{"id": "25825", "revid": "45179772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25825", "title": "Red", "text": "Primary color\nRed is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625\u2013750 nanometers. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.\nRed pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red became a symbolic color of communism and socialism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The Soviet red banner would subsequently be used throughout the entire history of the Soviet Union. China adopted its own red flag following the Chinese Communist Revolution. A red flag was also adopted by North Vietnam in 1954, and by all of Vietnam in 1975.\nSince red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy. In China, India, and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune.\nShades and variations.\nVarieties of the color red may differ in hue, chroma (also called saturation, intensity, or colorfulness), or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or in two or three of these qualities. Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint being a red or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black. Four examples are shown below.\nIn science and nature.\nSeeing red.\nThe human eye sees red when it looks at light with a wavelength between approximately 625 and 740 nanometers. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the light just past this range is called infrared, or below red, and cannot be seen by human eyes, although it can be sensed as heat. In the language of optics, red is the color evoked by light that stimulates neither the S or the M (short and medium wavelength) cone cells of the retina, combined with a fading stimulation of the L (long-wavelength) cone cells.\nPrimates can distinguish the full range of the colors of the spectrum visible to humans, but many kinds of mammals, such as dogs and cattle, have dichromacy, which means they can see blues and yellows, but cannot distinguish red and green (both are seen as gray). Bulls, for instance, cannot see the red color of the cape of a bullfighter, but they are agitated by its movement. (See color vision).\nOne theory for why primates developed sensitivity to red is that it allowed ripe fruit to be distinguished from unripe fruit and inedible vegetation. This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability, such as the emergence of red faces.\nRed light is used to help adapt night vision in low-light or night time, as the rod cells in the human eye are not sensitive to red.\nIn color theory and on a computer screen.\nIn the RYB color model, which is the basis of traditional color theory, red is one of the three primary colors, along with blue and yellow. Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet: Cennino Cennini, in his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, \"If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac (red lake), ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder\"; he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue indigo and red hematite.\nIn the CMY and CMYK color models, red is a secondary color subtractively mixed from magenta and yellow.\nIn the RGB color model, red, green and blue are additive primary colors. Red, green and blue light combined makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This principle is used to generate colors on such as computer monitors and televisions. For example, magenta on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.\nColor of sunset.\nAs a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles due to Rayleigh scattering, changing the final color of the beam that is seen. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye. At sunrise and sunset, when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon its red glow.\nLasers.\nLasers emitting in the red region of the spectrum have been available since the invention of the ruby laser in 1960. In 1962 the red helium\u2013neon laser was invented, and these two types of lasers were widely used in many scientific applications including holography, and in education. Red helium\u2013neon lasers were used commercially in LaserDisc players. The use of red laser diodes became widespread with the commercial success of modern DVD players, which use a 660\u00a0nm laser diode technology. Today, red and red-orange laser diodes are widely available to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive laser pointers. Portable, high-powered versions are also available for various applications. More recently, 671\u00a0nm diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) lasers have been introduced to the market for all-DPSS laser display systems, particle image velocimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and holography.\nRed's wavelength has been an important factor in laser technologies; red lasers, used in early compact disc technologies, are being replaced by blue lasers, as red's longer wavelength causes the laser's recordings to take up more space on the disc than would blue-laser recordings.\nFood coloring.\nThe most common synthetic food coloring today is Allura Red AC, a red azo dye that goes by several names including: Allura Red, Food Red 17, C.I. 16035, FD&amp;C Red 40, It was originally manufactured from coal tar, but now is mostly made from petroleum.\nIn Europe, Allura Red AC is not recommended for consumption by children. It is banned in Denmark, Belgium, France and Switzerland, and was also banned in Sweden until the country joined the European Union in 1994. The European Union approves Allura Red AC as a food colorant, but EU countries' local laws banning food colorants are preserved.\nIn the United States, Allura Red AC is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in cosmetics, drugs, and food. It is used in some tattoo inks and is used in many products, such as soft drinks, children's medications, and cotton candy. On June 30, 2010, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) called for the FDA to ban Red 40. Red 3 dye was banned in the United States in 2025.\nBecause of public concerns about possible health risks associated with synthetic dyes, many companies have switched to using natural pigments such as carmine, made from crushing the tiny female cochineal insect. This insect, originating in Mexico and Central America, was used to make the brilliant scarlet dyes of the European Renaissance.\nAutumn leaves.\nThe red of autumn leaves is produced by pigments called anthocyanins. They are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer. They develop in late summer in the sap of the cells of the leaf, and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influences\u2014both inside and outside the plant. Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of phosphate in the leaf is reduced.\nDuring the summer growing season, phosphate is at a high level. It has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll. But in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients, moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes, leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop.\nAnthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the buds in early spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as cranberries, red apples, blueberries, cherries, raspberries, and plums.\nAnthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas\u2014a famous example being New England\u2014up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment. In autumn forests they appear vivid in the maples, oaks, sourwood, sweetgums, dogwoods, tupelos, cherry trees and persimmons. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species. (See Autumn leaf color).\nBlood and other reds in nature.\nOxygenated blood is red due to the presence of oxygenated hemoglobin that contains iron molecules, with the iron components reflecting red light. Red meat gets its color from the iron found in the myoglobin and hemoglobin in the muscles and residual blood.\nPlants like apples, strawberries, cherries, tomatoes, peppers, and pomegranates are often colored by forms of carotenoids, red pigments that also assist photosynthesis.\nHair color.\nRed hair occurs naturally on approximately 1\u20132% of the human population. It occurs more frequently (2\u20136%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 which causes a mutation in the MC1R protein.\nRed hair varies from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright copper. It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin. The term \"redhead\" (originally \"redd hede\") has been in use since at least 1510.\nIn animal and human behavior.\nRed is associated with dominance in a number of animal species. For example, in mandrills, red coloration of the face is greatest in alpha males, increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates, and directly correlated with levels of testosterone. Red can also affect the perception of dominance by others, leading to significant differences in mortality, reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not. In humans, wearing red has been linked with increased performance in competitions, including professional sport and multiplayer video games. Controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise, so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance. Judges of tae kwon do have been shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue, and, when asked, a significant majority of people say that red abstract shapes are more \"dominant\", \"aggressive\", and \"likely to win a physical competition\" than blue shapes. In contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance behavior, exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks and elicits aversion in psychological tests where subjects are placed in an \"achievement\" context (e.g. taking an IQ test).\nHistory and art.\nIn prehistory and the ancient world.\nInside cave 13B at Pinnacle Point, an archeological site found on the coast of South Africa, paleoanthropologists in 2000 found evidence that, between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago, Late Stone Age people were scraping and grinding ochre, a clay colored red by iron oxide, probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies.\nRed hematite powder was also found scattered around the remains at a grave site in a Zhoukoudian cave complex near Beijing. The site has evidence of habitation as early as 700,000 years ago. The hematite might have been used to symbolize blood in an offering to the dead.\nRed, black and white were the first colors used by artists in the Upper Paleolithic age, probably because natural pigments such as red ochre and iron oxide were readily available where early people lived. Madder, a plant whose root could be made into a red dye, grew widely in Europe, Africa and Asia. The cave of Altamira in Spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15,000 and 16,500 BC.\nA red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus \"Kermes\", primarily \"Kermes vermilio\". The insects live on the sap of certain trees, especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region. Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans, who imported it from Spain. A different variety of dye was made from \"Porphyrophora hamelii\" (Armenian cochineal) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs. It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC, and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians.\nIn ancient Egypt, red was associated with life, health, and victory. Egyptians would color themselves with red ochre during celebrations. Egyptian women used red ochre as a cosmetic to redden cheeks and lips and also used henna to color their hair and paint their nails.\nThe ancient Romans wore togas with red stripes on holidays, and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl, called a \"flammeum\". Red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators. Red was also the color associated with army; Roman soldiers wore red tunics, and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which, depending upon the quality of the dye, could be crimson, scarlet or purple. In Roman mythology red is associated with the god of war, Mars. The vexilloid of the Roman Empire had a red background with the letters SPQR in gold. A Roman general receiving a triumph had his entire body painted red in honor of his achievement.\nThe Romans liked bright colors, and many Roman villas were decorated with vivid red murals. The pigment used for many of the murals was called vermilion, and it came from the mineral cinnabar, a common ore of mercury. It was one of the finest reds of ancient times \u2013 the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries. The source of cinnabar for the Romans was a group of mines near Almad\u00e9n, southwest of Madrid, in Spain. Working in the mines was extremely dangerous, since mercury is highly toxic; the miners were slaves or prisoners, and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence.\nThe Middle Ages.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, red was adopted as a color of majesty and authority by the Byzantine Empire, and the princes of Europe. It also played an important part in the rituals of the Roman Catholic Church, symbolizing the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs.\nIn Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red colored habitus. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.\nIn western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field, the St. George's Cross. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George's Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century, and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia.\nRenaissance.\nIn Renaissance painting, red was used to draw the attention of the viewer; it was often used as the color of the cloak or costume of Christ, the Virgin Mary, or another central figure.\nIn Venice, Titian was the master of fine reds, particularly vermilion; he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi-transparent glaze, which let the light pass through, to create a more luminous color. The figures of God, the Virgin Mary and two apostles are highlighted by their vermilion red costumes.\nQueen Elizabeth I of England liked to wear bright reds, before she adopted the more sober image of the \"Virgin Queen\". \nRed costumes were not limited to the upper classes. In Renaissance Flanders, people of all social classes wore red at celebrations. One such celebration was captured in \"The Wedding Dance\" (1566) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.\nThe painter Johannes Vermeer skilfully used different shades and tints of vermilion to paint the red skirt in \"The Girl with the Wine Glass\", then glazed it with madder lake to make a more luminous color.\nReds from the New World.\nIn Latin America, the Aztec people, the Paracas culture and other societies used cochineal, a vivid scarlet dye made from insects. From the 16th until the 19th century, cochineal became a highly profitable export from Spanish Mexico to Europe.\n18th to 20th century.\nIn the 18th century, red began to take on a new identity as the color of resistance and revolution. It was already associated with blood, and with danger; a red flag hoisted before a battle meant that no prisoners would be taken. In 1793\u201394, red became the color of the French Revolution. A red Phrygian cap, or \"liberty cap\", was part of the uniform of the sans-culottes, the most militant faction of the revolutionaries.\nIn the late 18th century, during a strike English dock workers carried red flags, and it thereafter became closely associated with the new labor movement, and later with the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, founded in 1900.\nIn Paris in 1832, a red flag was carried by working-class demonstrators in the failed June Rebellion (an event immortalized in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\"), and later in the 1848 French Revolution. The red flag was proposed as the new national French flag during the 1848 revolution, but was rejected by at the urging of the poet and statesman Alphonse Lamartine in favor of the tricolor flag. It appeared again as the flag of the short-lived Paris Commune in 1871. It was then adopted by Karl Marx and the new European movements of socialism and communism. Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The People's Republic of China adopted the red flag following the Chinese Communist Revolution. It was adopted by North Vietnam in 1954, and by all of Vietnam in 1975.\nSymbolism.\nCourage and sacrifice.\nSurveys show that red is the color most associated with courage. In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field, the St. George's Cross. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George's Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century, and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia.\nHatred, anger, aggression, passion, heat and war.\nWhile red is the color most associated with love, it also the color most frequently associated with hatred, anger, aggression and war. People who are angry are said to \".\" Red is the color most commonly associated with passion and heat. In ancient Rome, red was the color of Mars, the god of war\u2014the planet Mars was named for him because of its red color.\nWarning and danger.\nRed is the traditional color of warning and danger, and is therefore often used on flags. In the Middle Ages up through the French Revolution, a red flag shown in warfare indicated the intent to take no prisoners. Similarly, a red flag hoisted by a pirate ship meant no mercy would be shown to their target. In Britain, in the early days of motoring, motor cars had to follow a man with a red flag who would warn horse-drawn vehicles, before the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 abolished this law. In automobile races, the red flag is raised if there is danger to the drivers. In international football, a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red penalty card and ejected from the game.\nSeveral studies have indicated that red carries the strongest reaction of all the colors, with the level of reaction decreasing gradually with the colors orange, yellow, and white, respectively. For this reason, red is generally used as the highest level of warning, such as threat level of terrorist attack in the United States. In fact, teachers at a primary school in the UK have been told not to mark children's work in red ink because it encourages a \"negative approach\".\nRed is the international color of stop signs and stop lights on highways and intersections. It was standardized as the international color at the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968. It was chosen partly because red is the brightest color in daytime (next to orange), though it is less visible at twilight, when green is the most visible color. Red also stands out more clearly against a cool natural backdrop of blue sky, green trees or gray buildings. But it was mostly chosen as the color for stoplights and stop signs because of its universal association with danger and warning. The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968 uses red color also for the margin of danger warning sign, give way signs and prohibitory signs, following the previous German-type signage (established by Verordnung \u00fcber Warnungstafeln f\u00fcr den Kraftfahrzeugverkehr in 1927).\nThe color that attracts attention.\nRed is the color that most attracts attention. Surveys show it is the color most frequently associated with visibility, proximity, and extroverts. It is also the color most associated with dynamism and activity.\nRed is used in modern fashion much as it was used in Medieval painting; to attract the eyes of the viewer to the person who is supposed to be the center of attention. People wearing red seem to be closer than those dressed in other colors, even if they are actually the same distance away. Monarchs, wives of presidential candidates and other celebrities often wear red to be visible from a distance in a crowd. It is also commonly worn by lifeguards and others whose job requires them to be easily found.\nBecause red attracts attention, it is frequently used in advertising, though studies show that people are less likely to read something printed in red because they know it is advertising, and because it is more difficult visually to read than black and white text.\nSeduction, sexuality and sin.\nRed by a large margin is the color most commonly associated with seduction, sexuality, eroticism and immorality, possibly because of its close connection with passion and with danger.\nRed was long seen as having a dark side, particularly in Christian theology. It was associated with sexual passion, anger, sin, and the devil. In the Old Testament of the Bible, the Book of Isaiah said: \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow.\" In the New Testament, in the Book of Revelation, the Antichrist appears as a red monster, ridden by a woman dressed in scarlet, known as the Whore of Babylon.\nSatan is often depicted as colored red and/or wearing a red costume in both iconography and popular culture. By the 20th century, the devil in red had become a folk character in legends and stories. The devil in red appears more often in cartoons and movies than in religious art.\nIn 17th-century New England, red was associated with adultery. In the 1850 novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, \"The Scarlet Letter\", set in a Puritan New England community, a woman is punished for adultery with ostracism, her sin represented by a red letter 'A' sewn onto her clothes.\nRed is still commonly associated with prostitution. At various points in history, prostitutes were required to wear red to announce their profession. Houses of prostitution displayed a red light. Beginning in the early 20th century, houses of prostitution were allowed only in certain specified neighborhoods, which became known as red-light districts. Large red-light districts are found today in Bangkok and Amsterdam.\nIn the handkerchief code, the color red signifies interest in the sexual act of fisting.\nIn both Christian and Hebrew tradition, red is also sometimes associated with murder or guilt, with \"having blood on one's hands\", or \"being caught red-handed.\nMilitary uses.\nRed uniform.\nThe red military uniform was adopted by the English Parliament's New Model Army in 1645, and was still worn as a dress uniform by the British Army until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. Ordinary soldiers wore red coats dyed with madder, while officers wore scarlet coats dyed with the more expensive cochineal. This led to British soldiers being known as red coats.\nIn the modern British army, scarlet is still worn by the Foot Guards, the Life Guards, and by some regimental bands or drummers for ceremonial purposes. Officers and NCOs of those regiments which previously wore red retain scarlet as the color of their \"mess\" or formal evening jackets. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment has a scarlet tunic in its winter dress.\nScarlet is worn for some full dress, military band or mess uniforms in the modern armies of a number of the countries that made up the former British Empire. These include the Australian, Jamaican, New Zealand, Fijian, Canadian, Kenyan, Ghanaian, Indian, Singaporean, Sri Lankan and Pakistani armies.\nThe musicians of the United States Marine Corps Band wear red, following an 18th-century military tradition that the uniforms of band members are the reverse of the uniforms of the other soldiers in their unit. Since the US Marine uniform is blue with red facings, the band wears the reverse.\nRed Serge is the uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, created in 1873 as the North-West Mounted Police, and given its present name in 1920. The uniform was adapted from the tunic of the British Army. Cadets at the Royal Military College of Canada also wear red dress uniforms.\nThe Brazilian Marine Corps wears a red dress uniform.\nNATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems uses red to denote hostile forces, hence the terms \"red team\" and \"Red Cell\" to denote challengers during exercises.\nIn sports.\nThe first known team sport to feature red uniforms was chariot racing during the late Roman Empire. The earliest races were between two chariots, one driver wearing red, the other white. Later, the number of teams was increased to four, including drivers in light green and sky blue. Twenty-five races were run in a day, with a total of one hundred chariots participating.\nToday many sports teams throughout the world feature red on their uniforms. Along with blue, red is the most commonly used non-white color in sports. Numerous national sports teams wear red, often through association with their national flags. A few of these teams feature the color as part of their nickname such as Spain (with their association football (soccer) national team nicknamed \"La Furia Roja\" or \"The Red Fury\") and Belgium (whose football team bears the nickname \"Rode Duivels\" or \"Red Devils\").\nIn club association football (soccer), red is a commonly used color throughout the world. Among European notable club teams most often playing at home in red shirts include Bayern Munich, Benfica, Liverpool, Manchester United and Roma. Furthermore, many prominent teams play in partially red color schemes, involving different-colored sleeves or stripes. A number of teams' nicknames feature the color. A red penalty card is issued to a player who commits a serious infraction: the player is immediately disqualified from further play and his team must continue with one fewer player for the game's duration.\nRosso Corsa is the red international motor racing color of cars entered by teams from Italy. Since the 1920s Italian race cars of Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Lancia, and later Ferrari and Abarth have been painted with a color known as \"rosso corsa\" (\"racing red\"). National colors were mostly replaced in Formula One by commercial sponsor liveries in 1968, but unlike most other teams, Ferrari always kept the traditional red, although the shade of the color varies. Ducati traditionally run red factory bikes in motorcycle World Championship racing.\nThe color is commonly used for professional sports teams in Canada and the United States with eleven Major League Baseball teams, eleven National Hockey League teams, seven National Football League teams and eleven National Basketball Association teams prominently featuring some shade of the color. The color is also featured in the league logos of Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. In the National Football League, a red flag is thrown by the head coach to challenge a referee's decision during the game. During the 1950s when red was strongly associated with communism in the United States, the modern Cincinnati Reds team was known as the \"Redlegs\" and the term was used on baseball cards. After the red scare faded, the team was known as the \"Reds\" again.\nIn boxing, red is often the color used on a fighter's gloves. George Foreman wore the same red trunks he used during his loss to Muhammad Ali when he defeated Michael Moorer 20 years later to regain the title he lost. Boxers named or nicknamed \"red\" include Red Burman, Ernie \"Red\" Lopez, and his brother Danny \"Little Red\" Lopez.\nOn flags.\nRed is the most common color found in national flags, found on the flags of 77 percent of the 210 countries listed as independent in 2016; far ahead of white (58 percent); green (40 percent) and blue (37 percent). The British flag bears the colors red, white and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers.\nThe red on the flag of Nepal represents the floral emblem of the country, the rhododendron.\nRed, blue, and white are also the Pan-Slavic colors adopted by the Slavic solidarity movement of the late nineteenth century. Initially these were the colors of the Russian flag; as the Slavic movement grew, they were adopted by other Slavic peoples including Slovaks, Slovenes, and Serbs. The flags of the Czech Republic and Poland use red for historic heraldic reasons (see Coat of arms of Poland and Coat of arms of the Czech Republic) &amp; not due to Pan-Slavic connotations. In 2004 Georgia adopted a new white flag, which consists of four small and one big red cross in the middle touching all four sides.\nRed, white, and black were the colors of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918, and as such they came to be associated with German nationalism. In the 1920s they were adopted as the colors of the Nazi flag. In \"Mein Kampf\", Hitler explained that they were \"revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past.\" The red part of the flag was also chosen to attract attention \u2013 Hitler wrote: \"the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster\" because \"in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.\" The red also symbolized the social program of the Nazis, aimed at German workers. Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.\nRed, white, green and black are the colors of Pan-Arabism and are used by many Arab countries.\nRed, gold, green, and black are the colors of Pan-Africanism. Several African countries thus use the color on their flags, including South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the flag of Ethiopia, one of the oldest independent African countries. Rwanda, notably, removed red from its flag after the Rwandan genocide because of red's association with blood.\nThe flags of Japan and Bangladesh both have a red circle in the middle of different colored backgrounds. The flag of the Philippines has a red trapezoid on the bottom signifying blood, courage, and valor (also, if the flag is inverted so that the red trapezoid is on top and the blue at the bottom, it indicates a state of war). The flag of Singapore has a red rectangle on the top. The field of the flag of Portugal is green and red. The Ottoman Empire adopted several different red flags during the six centuries of its rule, with the successor Republic of Turkey continuing the 1844 Ottoman flag.\nIn politics.\n \nIn 18th-century Europe, red was usually associated with the monarchy and with those in power. The Pope wore red, as did the Swiss Guards of the Kings of France, the soldiers of the British Army and the Danish Army.\nIn the Roman Empire, freed slaves were given a red Phrygian cap as an emblem of their liberation. Because of this symbolism, the red \"Liberty cap\" became a symbol of the American patriots fighting for independence from England. During the French Revolution, the Jacobins also adapted the red Phrygian cap, and forced the deposed King Louis XVI to wear one after his arrest.\nSocialism and communism.\nIn the 19th century, with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of worker's movements, red became the color of socialism (especially the Marxist variant), and, with the Paris Commune of 1871, of revolution.\nIn the 20th century, red was the color first of the Russian Bolsheviks and then, after the success of the Russian Revolution of 1917, of communist parties around the world. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia went back to the pre-revolutionary blue, white and red flag.\nRed also became the color of many social democratic parties in Europe, including the Labour Party in Britain (founded 1900); the Social Democratic Party of Germany (whose roots went back to 1863) and the French Socialist Party, which dated back under different names, to 1879. The Socialist Party of America (1901\u20131972) and the Communist Party USA (1919) both also chose red as their color.\nMembers of the Christian-Social People's Party in Liechtenstein (founded 1918) advocated an expansion of democracy and progressive social policies, and were often referred to disparagingly as \"Reds\" for their social liberal leanings and party colors.\nThe Chinese Communist Party, founded in 1920, adopted the red flag and hammer and sickle emblem of the Soviet Union, which became the national symbols when the Party took power in China in 1949. Under Party leader Mao Zedong, the Party anthem became \"The East Is Red\", and Mao Zedong himself was sometimes referred to as a \"red sun\". During the Cultural Revolution in China, Party ideology was enforced by the Red Guards, and the sayings of Mao Zedong were published as a little red book in hundreds of millions of copies. Today the Chinese Communist Party claims to be the largest political party in the world, with eighty million members.\nBeginning in the 1960s and the 1970s, paramilitary extremist groups such as the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Japanese Red Army and the Shining Path Maoist movement in Peru used red as their color. But in the 1980s, some European socialist and social democratic parties, such as the Labour Party in Britain and the Socialist Party in France, moved away from the symbolism of the far left, keeping the red color but changing their symbol to a less-threatening red rose.\nRed is used around the world by political parties of the left or center-left. In the United States, it is the color of the Communist Party USA, and of the Social Democrats, USA.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, political commentators often refer to the \"red states\", which voted for Republican candidates in the last four presidential elections, and \"blue states\", which voted for Democrats. This convention is relatively recent: before the 2000 presidential election, media outlets assigned red and blue to both parties, sometimes alternating the allocation for each election. Fixed usage was established during the 39-day recount following the 2000 election, when the media began to discuss the contest in terms of \"red states\" versus \"blue states\". States which voted for different parties in two of the last four presidential elections are called \"Swing States\", and are usually colored purple, a mix of red and blue.\nSocial and special interest groups.\nSuch names as Red Club (a bar), Red Carpet (a discoth\u00e8que) or Red Cottbus and Club Red (event locations) suggest liveliness and excitement. The Red Hat Society is a social group founded in 1998 for women 50 and over. Use of the color red to call attention to an emergency situation is evident in the names of such organizations as the Red Cross (humanitarian aid), Red Hot Organization (AIDS support), and the Red List of Threatened Species (of IUCN). In reference to humans, term \"red\" is often used in the West to describe the indigenous peoples of the Americas.\nIdioms.\nMany idiomatic expressions exploit the various connotations of red:\nExpressing emotion\nGiving warning\nCalling attention\nOther idioms\nReferences.\nNotes and citations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After these events, the world will rise again, cleansed and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors, L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir. is an important event in Norse mythology and has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory in the history of Germanic studies.\nThe event is attested primarily in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In the \"Prose Edda\" and in a single poem in the \"Poetic Edda\", the event is referred to as , a usage popularised by 19th-century composer Richard Wagner with the title of the last of his \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" operas, (1876), which is \"Twilight of the Gods\" in German.\nEtymology.\nThe Old Norse compound word has a long history of interpretation. Its first element is clear: , the genitive plural of (n. pl.) 'the ruling powers, gods.' The second element is more problematic, as it occurs in two variants, and . Writing in the early 20th century, philologist Geir T. Zo\u00ebga treats the two forms as two separate compounds, glossing as 'the doom or destruction of the gods' and as 'the twilight of the gods.' The plural noun has several meanings, including 'development', 'origin', 'cause', 'relation', 'fate.' The word as a whole is then usually interpreted as the 'final destiny of the gods.'\nThe singular form is found in a stanza of the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Lokasenna\", and in the \"Prose Edda\". The noun means 'twilight' (from the verb 'to grow dark'), suggesting a translation 'twilight of the gods.' This reading was widely considered a result of folk etymology, or a learned reinterpretation of the original term due to the merger of (spelled \u01eb) and (spelled \u00f8) in Old Icelandic after c.\u20091200\n(nevertheless giving rise to the calque 'Twilight of the Gods' in the German reception of Norse mythology).\nOther terms used to refer to the events surrounding in the \"Poetic Edda\" include ( means age, 'end of an age') from a stanza of , from two stanzas of , ('when the gods die') from , ('when the gods will be destroyed') from , , and , ('destruction of the age') from , ('end of the gods') from , and, in the \"Prose Edda\", ('when the sons of Muspell move into battle') can be found in chapters 18 and 36 of .\nPresence in literature.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nThe \"Poetic Edda\" contains various references to :\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\" poem , references to begin from stanza 40 until 58, with the rest of the poem describing the aftermath. In the poem, a (a female seer) recites information to Odin. In stanza 41, the says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014Normalized Old Norse\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014Ursula Dronke translation\nThe then describes three roosters crowing: In stanza 42, the herdsman Eggth\u00e9r sits on a mound and cheerfully plays his harp while the crimson rooster Fjalar (Old Norse \"hider, deceiver\") crows in the forest G\u00e1lgvi\u00f0r. The golden rooster Gullinkambi crows to the \u00c6sir in Valhalla, and the third, unnamed soot-red rooster crows in the halls of the underworld location of Hel in stanza 43.\nAfter these stanzas, the further relates that the hound Garmr produces deep howls in front of the cave of Gnipahellir. Garmr's bindings break and he runs free. The describes the state of humanity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014Normalized Old Norse\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014Ursula Dronke translation\nThe \"sons of M\u00edm\" are described as being \"at play,\" though this reference is not further explained in surviving sources. Heimdall raises the Gjallarhorn into the air and blows deeply into it, and Odin converses with M\u00edm's head. The world tree Yggdrasil shudders and groans. The Hrym comes from the east, his shield before him. The Midgard serpent J\u00f6rmungandr furiously writhes, causing waves to crash. \"The eagle shrieks, pale-beaked he tears the corpse,\" and the ship Naglfar breaks free thanks to the waves made by J\u00f6rmungandr and sets sail from the east. The fire inhabitants of Muspelheim come forth.\nThe continues that J\u00f6tunheimr, the land of the , is aroar, and that the \u00c6sir are in council. The dwarfs groan by their stone doors. Surtr advances from the south, his sword brighter than the sun. Rocky cliffs open and the women sink.\nThe gods then do battle with the invaders: Odin is swallowed whole and alive fighting the wolf Fenrir, causing his wife Frigg her second great sorrow (the first being the death of her son, the god Baldr). Odin's son V\u00ed\u00f0arr avenges his father by rending Fenrir's jaws apart and stabbing it in the heart with his spear, thus killing the wolf. The serpent J\u00f6rmungandr opens its gaping maw, yawning widely in the air, and is met in combat by Thor. Thor, also a son of Odin and described here as protector of the earth, furiously fights the serpent, defeating it, but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterwards before collapsing dead from the Serpent's venom. The god Freyr fights Surtr and loses. After this, people flee their homes, and the sun becomes black while the earth sinks into the sea, the stars vanish, steam rises, and flames touch the heavens.\nThe sees the earth reappearing from the water and an eagle over a waterfall hunting fish on a mountain. The surviving \u00c6sir meet together at the field of I\u00f0av\u00f6llr. They discuss J\u00f6rmungandr, great events of the past, and the runic alphabet. In stanza 61, in the grass, they find the golden game pieces that the gods are described as having once happily enjoyed playing games with long ago (attested earlier in the same poem). The reemerged fields grow without needing to be sown. The gods H\u00f6\u00f0r and Baldr return from Hel and live happily together.\nThe says that the god H\u0153nir chooses wooden slips for divination and that the sons of two brothers will widely inhabit the windy world. She sees a hall thatched with gold in Giml\u00e9, where nobility will live and spend their lives pleasurably. Stanzas 65, found in the version of the poem, refers to a \"powerful, mighty one\" that \"rules over everything\" and who will arrive from above at the court of the gods (Old Norse ), which has been interpreted as a Christian addition to the poem. In stanza 66, the ends her account with a description of the dragon N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr, corpses in his jaws, flying through the air. The then \"sinks down.\" It is unclear if stanza 66 indicates that the is referring to the present time or if this is an element of the post- world.\nThe Vanir god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r is mentioned in relation to in stanza 39 of the poem \"Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l\". In the poem, Odin, disguised as Gagnr\u00e1\u00f0r, faces off with the wise Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir in a battle of wits. Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l references Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as a hostage during the earlier \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War, and that he will \"come back home among the wise Vanir\" at \"the doom of men.\"\nIn stanza 44, Odin poses the question to Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir as to who of mankind will survive the \"famous\" (\"Mighty Winter\"). Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir responds in stanza 45 that those survivors will be L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir and that they will hide in the forest of , that they will consume the morning dew, and will produce generations of offspring. In stanza 46, Odin asks what sun will come into the sky after Fenrir has consumed the sun that exists. Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir responds that S\u00f3l will bear a daughter before Fenrir assails her and that after this daughter will continue her mother's path.\nIn stanza 51, Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir states that, after Surtr's flames have been sated, Odin's sons V\u00ed\u00f0arr and V\u00e1li will live in the temples of the gods, and that Thor's sons M\u00f3\u00f0i and Magni will possess the hammer Mjolnir. In stanza 52, the disguised Odin asks the about his fate. Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir responds that \"the wolf\" will consume Odin, and that V\u00ed\u00f0arr will avenge him by sundering its cold jaws in battle. Odin ends the duel with one final question: what did Odin say to his son before preparing his funeral pyre? With this, Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir realizes that he is dealing with none other than Odin, whom he refers to as \"the wisest of beings,\" adding that Odin alone could know this. Odin's message has been interpreted as a promise of resurrection to Baldr after .\n is briefly referenced in stanza 40 of the poem . Here, the valkyrie Sigr\u00fan's unnamed maid is passing the deceased hero Helgi Hundingsbane's burial mound. Helgi is there with a retinue of men, surprising the maid. The maid asks if she is witnessing a delusion since she sees dead men riding, or if has occurred. In stanza 41, Helgi responds that it is neither.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nSnorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\" quotes heavily from and elaborates extensively in prose on the information there, though some of this information conflicts with that provided in .\n\"Gylfaginning\" chapters 26 and 34.\nIn the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", various references are made to . is first mentioned in chapter 26, where the throned figure of High, king of the hall, tells Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) some basic information about the goddess I\u00f0unn, including that her apples will keep the gods young until .\nIn chapter 34, High describes the binding of the wolf Fenrir by the gods, causing the god T\u00fdr to lose his right hand, and that Fenrir remains there until . Gangleri asks High why, since the gods could only expect destruction from Fenrir, they did not simply kill Fenrir once he was bound. High responds that \"the gods hold their sacred places and sanctuaries in such respect that they chose not to defile them with the wolf's blood, even though the prophecies foretold that he would be the death of Odin.\"\nAs a consequence of his role in the death of the god Baldr, Loki (described as father of Fenrir) is bound on top of three stones with the internal organs of his son Narfi (which are turned into iron) in three places. There, venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the Ska\u00f0i. Loki's wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, but whenever she leaves to empty it, the drops reach Loki's face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of .\nchapter 51.\nChapter 51 provides a detailed account of interspersed with various quotes from , while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of will be , during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will be useless. High details that, before these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, and fathers and sons will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of . Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, then his brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars will disappear. The earth and mountains will shake so violently that the trees will come loose from the soil, the mountains will topple, and all restraints will break, causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds.\nHigh relates that the great serpent J\u00f6rmungandr, also described as a child of Loki in the same source, will breach land as the sea violently swells onto it. The ship Naglfar, described in the \"Prose Edda\" as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with his mouth wide open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, and his lower jaw touching the earth. At Fenrir's side, J\u00f6rmungandr sprays venom throughout the air and the sea.\nDuring all of this, the sky splits into two. From the split, the \"sons of Muspell\" ride forth. Surtr rides first, surrounded by flames, his sword brighter than the sun. High says that \"Muspell's sons\" will ride across Bifr\u00f6st, described in as a rainbow bridge, and that the bridge will then break. The sons of Muspell (and their shining battle troop) advance to the field of V\u00edgr\u00ed\u00f0r, described as an expanse that reaches \"a hundred leagues in each direction,\" where Fenrir, J\u00f6rmungandr, Loki (followed by \"Hel's own\"), and Hrym (accompanied by all frost ) join them. While this occurs, Heimdallr stands and blows the Gjallarhorn with all his might. The gods awaken at the sound, and they meet. Odin rides to M\u00edmisbrunnr in search of counsel from M\u00edmir. Yggdrasil shakes, and everything, everywhere fears.\nHigh relates that the \u00c6sir and the Einherjar dress for war and head to the field. Odin, wearing a gold helmet and an intricate coat of mail, carries his spear Gungnir and rides before them. Odin advances against Fenrir, while Thor moves at his side, though Thor is unable to assist Odin because he has engaged J\u00f6rmungandr in combat. According to High, Freyr fights fiercely with Surtr, but falls because he lacks the sword he once gave to his messenger, Sk\u00edrnir. The hound Garmr (described here as the \"worst of monsters\") breaks free from his bonds in front of Gnipahellir, and fights the god T\u00fdr, resulting in both of their deaths.\nThor kills J\u00f6rmungandr but is poisoned by the serpent, and manages to walk only nine steps before falling to the earth dead. Fenrir swallows Odin, though immediately afterwards his son V\u00ed\u00f0arr kicks his foot into Fenrir's lower jaw, grips the upper jaw, and rips apart Fenrir's mouth, killing the great wolf. Loki fights Heimdallr and the two kill each other. Surtr covers the earth in fire, causing the entire world to burn. High quotes stanzas 46 to 47 of , and additionally stanza 18 of (the latter relating information about the battlefield V\u00edgr\u00ed\u00f0r).\n\"Gylfaginning\" chapters 52 and 53.\nAt the beginning of chapter 52, Gangleri asks \"what will be after heaven and earth and the whole world are burned? All the gods will be dead, together with the Einherjar and the whole of mankind. Didn't you say earlier that each person will live in some world throughout all ages?\"\nThe figure of Third, seated on the highest throne in the hall, responds that there will be many good places to live, but also many bad ones. Third states that the best place to be is Giml\u00e9 in the heavens, where a place exists called Okolnir that houses a hall called Brimir\u2014where one can find plenty to drink. Third describes a hall made of red gold located in Ni\u00f0afj\u00f6ll called Sindri, where \"good and virtuous men will live.\" Third further relates an unnamed hall in N\u00e1str\u00f6nd, the beaches of the dead, that he describes as a large repugnant hall facing north that is built from the spines of snakes, and resembles \"a house with walls woven from branches\"; the heads of the snakes face the inside of the house and spew so much venom that rivers of it flow throughout the hall, in which oath breakers and murderers must wade. Third here quotes stanzas 38 to 39, with the insertion of original prose stating that the worst place of all to be is in Hvergelmir, followed by a quote from to highlight that the dragon N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr harasses the corpses of the dead there.\nChapter 53 begins with Gangleri asking if any of the gods will survive and if there will be anything left of the earth or the sky. High responds that the earth will appear once more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field I\u00f0av\u00f6llr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, untouched by Surtr's flames, V\u00ed\u00f0arr and V\u00e1li reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mj\u00f6lnir, Thor's sons M\u00f3\u00f0i and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and H\u00f6\u00f0r also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the \u00c6sir once owned. stanza 51 is then quoted.\nHigh reveals that two humans, L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir, will have also survived the destruction by hiding in the wood Hoddm\u00edmis holt. These two survivors consume the morning dew for sustenance, and from their descendants, the world will be repopulated. stanza 45 is then quoted. The personified sun, S\u00f3l, will have a daughter at least as beautiful as she, and this daughter will follow the same path as her mother. stanza 47 is quoted, and so ends the foretelling of in .\nArchaeological record.\nVarious objects have been identified as depicting events from .\nThorwald's Cross.\n, a partially surviving runestone erected at Kirk Andreas on the Isle of Man, depicts a bearded human holding a spear downward at a wolf, his right foot in its mouth, while a large bird sits at his shoulder. Rundata dates it to 940, while Pluskowski dates it to the 11th century. This depiction has been interpreted as Odin, with a raven or eagle at his shoulder, being consumed by Fenrir at . On the other side of the stone is a depiction of a large cross and another image parallel to the Odin figure that has been described as Christ triumphing over Satan. These combined elements have led to the cross as being described as \"syncretic art,\" a mixture of pagan and Christian beliefs.\nGosforth Cross.\nThe Gosforth Cross (920\u2013950), in Cumbria, England, is a standing cross of a typical Anglo-Saxon form, carved on all sides of the long shaft, which is nearly square in section. Based on the mythological stories found in Old Norse texts written in Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it has been assumed that the figural carvings of the Gosforth Cross depict Norse mythological episodes connected to Ragnar\u00f6k. Apart from panels of ornament, the scenes include a Christian crucifixion, and possibly another scene in Hell, but the other scenes are generally interpreted as narrative incidents from the story, even by a scholar as cautious of such interpretations as David M. Wilson. The battle itself may be depicted on the north side. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, with one foot thrust into the beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, and the other is against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as V\u00ed\u00f0arr fighting Fenrir.\nLedberg stone.\nThe 11th-century Ledberg stone in Sweden, similarly to Thorwald's Cross, is regarded as alluding to the final battle of Ragnar\u00f6k through the stones images. The stone features a figure with his foot at the mouth of a four-legged beast, and this may also be a depiction of Odin being devoured by Fenrir at . Below the beast and the man is a depiction of a legless, helmeted man, with his arms in a prostrate position. The Younger Futhark inscription on the stone bears a commonly seen memorial dedication, but is followed by an encoded runic sequence that has been described as \"mysterious,\" and \"an interesting magic formula which is known from all over the ancient Norse world.\" \nSkarp\u00e5ker stone.\nOn the early 11th-century Skarp\u00e5ker Stone, from S\u00f6dermanland, Sweden, a father grieving his dead son used the same verse form, , as in the \"Poetic Edda\" in the following engraving:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nJansson (1987) notes that at the time of the inscription, everyone who read the lines would have thought of and the allusion that the father found fitting as an expression of his grief. The inscription on the stone depicts a time of religious transition in Viking Age Scandinavia by fusing Christian and Norse components. The presence of a Christian cross on the stone indicates an attempt to combine Norse prophetic themes with Christian concepts of resurrection and endless life. The ship on the stone, with its mast shaped like a cross, is believed to represent the trip to the afterlife, fusing Christian imagery with Viking Age culture.\nTheories and interpretations.\nCyclic time and \"Hoddm\u00edmis holt\".\nRudolf Simek theorizes that the survival of L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir at the end of is \"a case of reduplication of the anthropogeny, understandable from the cyclic nature of the Eddic eschatology.\" Simek says that Hoddm\u00edmis holt \"should not be understood literally as a wood or even a forest in which the two keep themselves hidden, but rather as an alternative name for the world-tree Yggdrasill. Thus, the creation of mankind from tree trunks (Askr, Embla) is repeated after the as well.\" Simek says that in Germanic regions, the concept of mankind originating from trees is ancient, and additionally points out legendary parallels in a Bavarian legend of a shepherd who lives inside a tree, whose descendants repopulate the land after life there has been wiped out by plague (citing a retelling by F. R. Schr\u00f6der). In addition, Simek points to an Old Norse parallel in the figure of \u00d6rvar-Oddr, \"who is rejuvenated after living as a tree-man (\"\u01earvar-Odds saga\" 24\u201327).\"\n, , and Christianity.\nTheories have been proposed about the relation between and the 9th-century Old High German epic poem \"Muspilli\" about the Christian Last Judgment, where the word appears, and the 9th-century Old Saxon epic poem about the life of Christ, where various other forms of the word appear. In both sources, the word is used to signify the end of the world through fire. The Christian thought of the Last Judgment as it is presented in the Book of Revelation is similar to the apocalyptic story of Ragnar\u00f6k, which features imagery of a final cosmic conflict, devastation, and eventual renewal. Key elements, such as the role of a savior figure and the contrast between divine forces and evil, may mirror Christian theological concepts brought during the conversion of Scandinavia. Old Norse forms of the term also appear throughout accounts of , where the world is also consumed in flames, and, though various theories exist about the meaning and origins of the term, its etymology has not been solved.\nProto-Indo-European basis.\nParallels have been pointed out between the of Norse religion and the beliefs of other related Indo-European peoples. Subsequently, theories have been put forth that represents a later evolution of a Proto-Indo-European belief along with other cultures descending from the Proto-Indo-Europeans. These parallels include comparisons of a cosmic winter motif between the Norse , the Iranian and . V\u00ed\u00f0arr's stride has been compared to the Vedic god Vishnu in that both have a \"cosmic stride\" with a special shoe used to tear apart a beastly wolf. Larger patterns have also been drawn between \"final battle\" events in Indo-European cultures, including the occurrence of a blind or semi-blind figure in \"final battle\" themes, and figures appearing suddenly with surprising skills.\nSimilar Indo-European mythological elements are highlighted by comparisons between Ragnar\u00f6k and Iranian prophetic traditions. The wolves' destruction of the sun and moon in V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 is consistent with Iranian customs about the Fravashi, divine guardians who intervene against demonic powers to guarantee the sun and moon's paths. Iranian traditions depict this conflict as a part of the world's continuous war between good and evil, whereas Scandinavian mythology depicts the cosmic catastrophe as taking place at the end of time. These parallels highlight a common cosmological concern for upholding order in the face of chaotic forces. Ragnar\u00f6k epitomizes the Old Norse warrior culture, in which bravery and resistance are used to face death's inevitable course. Gods such as Odin and Thor represent the ideal warrior archetypes, and the tale reflects a deeply ingrained cultural ideal of heroic tenacity. This philosophy supported a worldview in which destruction is not an end but a necessary prerequisite for rebirth. Iranian traditions share similarities with Ragnar\u00f6k's warrior ethos. Warriors are portrayed in both mythologies as seeking for a spot in paradise, which is known as Valhalla in Norse mythology. This shared ideal reinforces the relationship between apocalyptic myths and societal ideals in Indo-European traditions by reflecting a cultural emphasis on the afterlife as a compensation for bravery and devotion in combat.\nVolcanic eruptions.\nHilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that the events in occurring after the death of the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland. Records of eruptions in Iceland bear strong similarities to the sequence of events described in , especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783. Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions and that he was a volcano demon. Surtr's name occurs in some Icelandic place names, among them the lava tube Surtshellir, a number of dark caverns in the volcanic central region of Iceland. This viewpoint is expanded by recent research by Mathias Nordvig and Felix Riede, which connects the apocalyptic themes of to important geological and climatic occurrences in the sixth century AD. Massive volcanic eruptions created a \"dust veil\" at this time, which produced broad climatic changes throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including as longer periods of darkness and colder temperatures. Known as one of the most intense volcanic winters in history, the years 536\u2013550 AD brought about significant environmental changes in Scandinavia and shifts in settlement patterns during this time of climate disturbance, indicating a social reaction to these environmental issues.\nParallels have been pointed out between a poem spoken by a found in the 13th-century (\"the tale of the mountain dweller\"). In the tale, Th\u00f3rd and his servant get lost while travelling to church in winter, and so take shelter for the night within a cave. Inside the cave they hear noises, witness a pair of immense burning eyes, and then the being with burning eyes recites a poem of 12 stanzas. The poem the being recites contains references to Norse mythology (including a mention of Thor) and also prophecies (including that \"mountains will tumble, the earth will move, men will be scoured by hot water and burned by fire\"). Surtr's fire receives a mention in stanza 10. John Lindow says that the poem may describe \"a mix of the destruction of the race of giants and of humans, as in \" but that \"many of the predictions of disruption on earth could also fit the volcanic activity that is so common in Iceland.\"\nModern influences.\nThe events of \"Ragnarok\" are dramatized, albeit briefly, in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Marsh King's Daughter\".\nIn late 2013 and early 2014, English-language media outlets widely reported that was foretold to occur on 22 February 2014. Apparently patterned after the 2012 phenomenon, the claim was at times attributed to a \"Viking Calendar\". No such calendar is known to have existed, and the source was a \"prediction\" made to media outlets by the Jorvik Viking Centre in York, England, intended to draw attention to an event that the institution was to hold on that date. The Jorvik Viking Centre was criticized for misleading the public to promote the event. In a 2014 article on the claims, philologist Joseph S. Hopkins perceives the media response as an example of a broad revival of interest in the Viking Age and ancient Germanic topics.\nThe Norwegian fantasy adventure film \"G\u00e5ten Ragnarok\" was released in 2013 and centres on the discovery of the mythical serpent in contemporary Finnmark.\nThe myth is central to the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe film \"\", at whose climax the demon Surtur destroys Asgard as its people flee into space under the guidance of Thor, Valkyrie, Loki, Heimdall, Hulk, and Korg.\nA.

Byatt published a novel entitled \"Ragnarok: The End of the Gods\" in 2011.\n\"Ragnar\u00f6k\" is set up at the end of the 2018 video game \"God of War\", which is rooted in Norse mythology, after the protagonist Kratos kills Baldr. The 2022 sequel, \"God of War Ragnar\u00f6k\", deals with the aftermath of this event and covers the in-game version of \"Ragnar\u00f6k\".\nNorse mythology and climate change inspired the eponymous TV series \"Ragnarok\". The town of Edda in Western Norway is plagued by climate change and industrial pollution caused by the factories owned by the Jutul family, a group of . They are challenged by a teenage boy, Magne, the reincarnation of Thor. Thus begins the event Ragnarok (\"twilight of the gods\"), the fight against those who are destroying the planet.\nIn the 2020 video game \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla\", which is partially inspired by Norse mythology, the \u00c6sir are depicted as members of the Isu, who within the series' fictional lore, are an advanced civilization that predate humanity, and \"Ragnar\u00f6k\" refers to a series of events revolving around the Toba Catastrophe, or the \"Great Catastrophe\", which was a solar flare that hit the Earth, killing most of the Isu.

The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", the courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and the main setting is Denmark.\nThe action of Stoppard's play takes place mainly \"in the wings\" of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", with brief appearances of major characters from \"Hamlet\" who enact fragments of the original's scenes. Between these episodes, the two protagonists voice their confusion at the progress of events occurring onstage without them in \"Hamlet\", of which they have no direct knowledge.\nComparisons have been drawn with Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\",\nfor the presence of two central characters who almost appear to be two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time.\nTitle.\nThe title is taken directly from the final scene of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\". In an earlier scene, Prince Hamlet has been exiled to England by the treacherous King of Denmark (his uncle Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father to obtain the throne). En route to England, Hamlet discovers a letter from King Claudius which is being carried to England by Hamlet's old but now untrusted friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The letter commands that Hamlet be put to death upon his arrival in England. Hamlet rewrites the letter to command that instead, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern be put to death. He then escapes back to Denmark. \nBy the end of Shakespeare's play, Prince Hamlet, Laertes, Ophelia, Polonius, King Claudius, and Queen Gertrude all lie dead.\nAn ambassador from England arrives on the scene to bluntly report \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead\" (\"Hamlet\". Act V, Scene II, line 411). So they have joined all the other stabbed, poisoned and drowned characters. By the end of \"Hamlet\", Horatio is the only main figure left alive.\nSynopsis.\nWith William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\" as the backdrop\",\" \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" concerns the musings and mishaps of the titular characters. The play is structured as the inverse of \"Hamlet\", in which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two minor characters who were childhood friends of the Prince; instead, the duo remains the focus and Hamlet himself is a minor role whose actions occur largely offstage, with the exception of a few short scenes in which the dramatic plays converge.\nIn \"Hamlet\", Rosencrantz and Guildenstern operate under the King's command in an attempt to discover Hamlet's motives and plot against him. Hamlet, however, derisively mocks and outwits them, so that they, rather than he, are sentenced to death in the end. \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" explores these events from the perspective of the duo; their actions seem largely nonsensical because they are superseded and, therefore, determined by Hamlet's plot.\nAfter witnessing a performance of \"The Murder of Gonzago\" \u2013 the play within the play in \"Hamlet\" \u2013 they find themselves on a ship, transporting Prince Hamlet to the King in England, with the troupe that staged the performance also on board as stowaways. They are supposed to give the King a letter with an instruction to execute Hamlet, who discovers this and replaces the letter with another one. During the voyage, the ship is hijacked by pirates, after which it is discovered that Hamlet has disappeared and the letter now instructs the English monarch to execute them instead.\nThe troupe recreates the duel scene from \"Hamlet\" with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, at the end, accepting \"quo fata ferunt\" (\"whither the fates carry [us]\"). The play concludes with the final scene from \"Hamlet\" in which the English Ambassador arrives and announces that \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead\".\nSummary.\nAct One.\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern are betting on coin flips. Rosencrantz, who bets heads each time, wins 92 flips in a row. The extreme unlikeliness of this event according to the laws of probability leads Guildenstern to suggest that they may be \"within un-, sub- or supernatural forces\". It is revealed that the duo are journeying to court on the orders of the King. Guildenstern theorizes on the nature of reality, focusing on how an event becomes increasingly real as more people witness it.\nA troupe of Tragedians arrives and offers the two men a show. They seem capable only of performances involving bloodbaths. The next two scenes at court are from the plot of \"Hamlet\". The first, involving Hamlet and Ophelia, takes place offstage in \"Hamlet\"\u2014the stage directions repeat exactly the words with which Ophelia describes the event to Polonius in \"Hamlet\". The second is taken directly from \"Hamlet\": Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's first appearance in that play. The Danish king and queen, Claudius and Gertrude, ask the two to discover the nature of Hamlet's recent madness. The royal couple demonstrate an inability to distinguish the two courtiers from one another, as do the characters themselves (to their irritation).\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern attempt to practise for their meeting with the Prince by one pretending to be Hamlet and the other asking him questions, but they glean no new information from it. The act closes with another scene from \"Hamlet\" in which they finally meet the Prince face to face.\nAct Two.\nThe conversation ends between Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Hamlet. Guildenstern tries to be optimistic, while Rosencrantz admits that the pair made no progress and Hamlet entirely outwitted them.\nThe Player returns to the stage. He is angry that the pair did not stay to watch their play earlier because, without an audience, his Tragedians are nothing. He tells them to stop questioning their existence because life appears too chaotic to comprehend upon examination. The Player, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern lose themselves in another illogical conversation that demonstrates the limits of language. The Player leaves to prepare for his production of \"The Murder of Gonzago\", set to be put on in front of Hamlet and the King and Queen.\nClaudius and Gertrude enter and begin another short scene taken directly from \"Hamlet\": they ask about the duo's encounter with the Prince, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern inform them about his interest in the Tragedians' production. After Claudius and Gertrude leave, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern contemplate their job. They see Hamlet walk by but fail to seize the opportunity to interrogate him.\nThe Tragedians return and perform their dress rehearsal of \"The Murder of Gonzago\". Their play moves beyond the scope of what the reader sees in \"Hamlet\"; characters resembling Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are seen taking a sea voyage and meeting their deaths at the hands of English courtiers, foreshadowing the duo's true fate. Rosencrantz does not quite make the connection, but Guildenstern is frightened into a verbal attack on the Tragedians' inability to capture the real essence of death. The stage becomes dark.\nWhen the stage is once again visible, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern lie in the same position as had the actors portraying their deaths. The duo are upset that they have become the pawns of the royal couple. Claudius enters again and tells them to find where Hamlet has hidden Polonius's corpse. After many false starts, they eventually find Hamlet, who leaves with Claudius.\nRosencrantz is delighted to find that his mission is complete, but Guildenstern knows it has not ended. Hamlet enters, speaking with a Norwegian soldier. Rosencrantz decides that he is happy to accompany Hamlet to England because it means freedom from the orders of the Danish court. Guildenstern understands that wherever they go, they are still trapped in this world.\nAct Three.\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern find themselves on a ship that has already set sail. The pair seem to have no knowledge of how they got there. At first, they try to determine whether they are still alive, before they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat. They remember that Claudius has given them a letter to deliver to England. After some brief confusion over who actually has the letter, they find it and eventually open it. They realize that Claudius has asked for Hamlet to be killed. While Rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now, Guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and the plans of kings. The stage darkens and, presumably, the characters go to sleep. Hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself, an act which takes place offstage in \"Hamlet\".\nThe pair discovers that the Tragedians are hidden (\"impossibly\", according to the stage directions) in several barrels on deck. They are fleeing Denmark because their play offended Claudius. When Rosencrantz complains that there is not enough action, pirates attack. Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the Player all hide in separate barrels. The lights dim.\nWhen the lights come on again, Hamlet has vanished (in \"Hamlet\" it is reported that he was kidnapped by pirates from the ship). Rosencrantz and Guildenstern panic, then re-read the letter to find that it now calls for them to be put to death instead of the prince. Guildenstern cannot understand why he and Rosencrantz are so important as to necessitate their executions.\nThe Player tells Guildenstern that all paths end in death. Guildenstern snaps and draws the Player's dagger from his belt, shouting that his portrayals of death do not do justice to the real thing. He stabs the Player and the Player appears to die. Guildenstern fully believes that he has killed the Player. Seconds later, the Tragedians begin to clap and the Player stands up and bows, revealing the knife to be a theatrical one with a retractable blade. The Tragedians then act out the deaths from the final scene of \"Hamlet\".\nThe lighting shifts so that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern appear alone. Rosencrantz still does not understand why they must die, yet he resigns himself to his fate and he disappears. Guildenstern wonders when he passed the point where he could have stopped the series of events that has brought him to this point. He disappears as well. The final scene features the last few lines from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", as the Ambassador from England announces that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\nMotifs and ideas.\nAbsurdity.\nStoppard emphasizes the randomness of the world. In the beginning of Act One, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern bet on coin flips and Rosencrantz wins with heads ninety-two times in a row. Guildenstern creates a series of syllogisms in order to interpret this phenomenon, but nothing truly coincides with probability theory.\nArt vs. reality.\nThe players help demonstrate the conflict between art and reality. The world in which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern live lacks order, but art allows people to create artificial order. As the Player says, \"There's a design at work in all art.\" Art and the real world are in conflict. In order to reach out to the only reality he can be sure of, Guildenstern exclaims, \"No one gets up after death\u2014there is no applause\u2014there is only silence and some second-hand clothes, and that's death.\" Stoppard also uses his characters to comment on the believability of theatre. While Guildenstern criticises the Player for his portrayal of death, he believes the Player's performance when Guildenstern thinks he has stabbed him with a knife. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern believe exactly what the actors want them to believe.\nMetatheatre.\nMetatheatre is a central structural element of \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\". Scenes that are staged as plays, dumb shows, or commentaries on dramatic theory and practice are prominent in both Stoppard's play and Shakespeare's original tragedy \"Hamlet\". In \"Hamlet\", metatheatrical elements include the Player's speech (2.2), Hamlet's advice to the Players (3.2), and the meta-play \"The Mousetrap\" (3.3). Since Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are characters from \"Hamlet\" itself, Stoppard's entire play can be considered a piece of metatheatre. Bernardina da Silveira Pinheiro observes that Stoppard uses metatheatrical devices to produce a \"parody\" of the key elements of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" that includes foregrounding two minor characters considered \"nonentities\" in the original tragedy.\nNotable productions.\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland.\nThe play had its first incarnation as a 1964 one-act titled \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Meet King Lear\". The expanded version under the current title was first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe on 24 August 1966, by the Oxford Theatre Group. The play debuted in London with a production at The Old Vic directed by Derek Goldby, designed by Desmond Heeley, and scored by Marc Wilkinson. It premiered on 11 April 1967, with John Stride as Rosencrantz, Edward Petherbridge as Guildenstern, Graham Crowden as the Player, and John McEnery as Hamlet. The play returned to the National Theatre on 14 December 1995 and this production with Adrian Scarborough as Rosencrantz and Simon Russell Beale as Guildenstern subsequently toured to Belfast, Cork, Bath, Newcastle, Sheffield and Bradford.\nIn 2011 the play was revived in a production directed by Sir Trevor Nunn, opening at Chichester Festival Theatre before transferring to the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London's West End (June\u2013August 2011). It starred Samuel Barnett and Jamie Parker. Tim Curry was originally scheduled to appear as The Player, but dropped out during preview performances at Chichester Festival Theatre due to ill health and was replaced by Chris Andrew Mellon. In 2013, an excerpt of the play was performed by Benedict Cumberbatch (Rosencrantz) and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith (Guildenstern) on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the National Theatre.\nFrom 25 February to 6 May 2017 the play returned to The Old Vic in a production celebrating its 50th anniversary, directed by David Leveaux and starring Daniel Radcliffe as Rosencrantz, Joshua McGuire as Guildenstern and David Haig as The Player.\nBroadway and Off-Broadway.\nThe Royal National Theatre production of \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" had a year-long Broadway run from 9 October 1967, through 19 October 1968, initially at the Alvin Theatre, then transferring to the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on 8 January 1968.\nThe production, which was Stoppard's first on Broadway, totalled eight previews and 420 performances. It was directed by Derek Goldby and designed by Desmond Heeley and starred Paul Hecht as the Player, Brian Murray as Rosencrantz and John Wood as Guildenstern. The play was nominated for eight Tony Awards, and won four: Best Play, Scenic Design, Costume Design and Producer; the director and the three leading actors, all nominated for Tonys, did not win.\nThe play also won Best Play from the New York Drama Critics Circle in 1968, and Outstanding Production from the Outer Critics Circle in 1969. Clive Barnes of \"The New York Times\" described the play as \"very funny, very brilliant, very chilling.\"\nThe play was profiled in the William Goldman book \"\".\nThe play had a 1987 New York revival by Roundabout Theatre at the Union Square Theatre, directed by Robert Carsen and featuring John Wood as the Player, Stephen Lang as Rosencrantz and John Rubinstein as Guildenstern. It ran for 40 performances from 29 April to 28 June 1987.\nSeveral times since 1995, the American Shakespeare Center has mounted repertories that included both \"Hamlet\" and \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\", with the same actors performing the same roles in each; in their 2001 and 2009 seasons the two plays were \"directed, designed, and rehearsed together to make the most out of the shared scenes and situations\".\nHalifax's Neptune Theatre company began a production of the play in January 2024 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and collaborated with Mirvish Productions for a Toronto, Ontario run beginning in March 2024\u2014the latter of which was extended twice before the first production due to high sales. Both runs featured Billy Boyd as Guildenstern, Dominic Monaghan as Rosencrantz, and Michael Blake as the Player, with the Toronto Star describing them as \"a trio of brilliant performances\" and awarding the production 3.5/4 stars.\nOther worldwide productions.\nIn 2013, Sydney Theatre Company presented a production directed by Simon Phillips with a cast featuring Tim Minchin as Rosencrantz and Toby Schmitz as Guildenstern from 6 August to 7 September 2013.\nRadio adaptations.\nThe play has been adapted three times for BBC Radio:\nA 1983 radio adaptation was broadcast on the BBC World Service on 17 October directed by Gordon House, with Nigel Anthony as Rosencrantz, Nicky Henson as Guildenstern, Jack May as The Player, John Duttine as Hamlet, Peter Vaughan as Claudius, Marcia Warren as Gertrude, Eileen Tully as Ophelia, Cyril Shaps as Polonius and Alex Jennings as a Tragedian.\nIn June 2022, a production directed by Rosalind Ayres for the L.A. Theatre Works was broadcast from and recorded at the Invisible Studios, West Hollywood. The cast included Adhir Kalyan as Rosencrantz, Matthew Wolf as Guildenstern, Martin Jarvis as The Player, Anna Lyse Erikson as Alfred/Ophelia, Seamus Dever as Hamlet, JD Cullum as Claudius/Soldier, Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo as Polonius/Player-King/Horatio/Ambassador and Susan Sullivan as Gertrude.\nFilm adaptation.\nFilm rights to the play were originally bought by MGM in 1968 for a reported $350,000 plus 10% of the profits. John Boorman was announced as director with Bob Chartoff and Irwin Winkler to produce. The film was not made, however.\nThe play was eventually adapted for a film released in February 1990, with screenplay and direction by Stoppard. The motion picture is Stoppard's only film directing credit: \"[I]t began to become clear that it might be a good idea if I did it myself\u2014at least the director wouldn't have to keep wondering what the author meant. It just seemed that I'd be the only person who could treat the play with the necessary disrespect.\" The cast included Gary Oldman as Rosencrantz, Tim Roth as Guildenstern, Richard Dreyfuss as the Player, Joanna Roth as Ophelia, Ian Richardson as Polonius, Joanna Miles as Gertrude, Donald Sumpter as Claudius, and Iain Glen as Hamlet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While it is remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in RC4, rendering it insecure. It is especially vulnerable when the beginning of the output keystream is not discarded, or when nonrandom or related keys are used. Particularly problematic uses of RC4 have led to very insecure protocols such as WEP.\nAs of 2015[ [update]], there is speculation that some state cryptologic agencies may possess the capability to break RC4 when used in the TLS protocol. IETF has published RFC 7465 to prohibit the use of RC4 in TLS; Mozilla and Microsoft have issued similar recommendations.\nA number of attempts have been made to strengthen RC4, notably Spritz, RC4A, VMPC, and RC4+.\nHistory.\nRC4 is a stream cipher designed by Ronald Rivest of RSA Security in 1987. According to Rivest, the letters RC stand for \"Ron's Code\", though in general it is simply referred to as RC4. The same naming convention applies to RC2, RC5, and RC6.\nRC4 was initially a trade secret, but in September 1994, a description of it was anonymously posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list. It was soon posted on the sci.crypt newsgroup, where it was broken within days by Bob Jenkins. From there, it spread to many sites on the Internet. The leaked code was confirmed to be genuine, as its output was found to match that of proprietary software using licensed RC4. Because the algorithm is known, it is no longer a trade secret. The name \"RC4\" is trademarked, so RC4 is often referred to as \"ARCFOUR\" or \"ARC4\" (meaning \"alleged RC4\") to avoid trademark problems. RSA Security has never officially released the algorithm; Rivest has, however, linked to the English Wikipedia article on RC4 in his own course notes in 2008 and confirmed the history of RC4 and its code in a 2014 paper by him.\nRC4 became part of some commonly used encryption protocols and standards, such as WEP in 1997 and WPA in 2003/2004 for wireless cards; and SSL in 1995 and its successor TLS in 1999, until it was prohibited for all versions of TLS by RFC 7465 in 2015, due to the RC4 attacks weakening or breaking RC4 used in SSL/TLS. The main factors in RC4's success over such a wide range of applications have been its speed and simplicity: efficient implementations in both software and hardware were very easy to develop.\nDescription.\nRC4 generates a pseudorandom stream of bits (a keystream). As with any stream cipher, these can be used for encryption by combining it with the plaintext using bitwise exclusive or; decryption is performed the same way (since exclusive or with given data is an involution). This is similar to the one-time pad, except that generated \"pseudorandom bits\", rather than a prepared stream, are used.\nTo generate the keystream, the cipher makes use of a secret internal state which consists of two parts:\nThe permutation is initialized with a variable-length key, typically between 40 and 2048\u00a0bits, using the \"key-scheduling\" algorithm (KSA). Once this has been completed, the stream of bits is generated using the \"pseudo-random generation algorithm\" (PRGA).\nKey-scheduling algorithm (KSA).\nThe key-scheduling algorithm is used to initialize the permutation in the array \"S\". \"keylength\" is defined as the number of bytes in the key and can be in the range 1 \u2264 keylength \u2264 256, typically between 5 and 16, corresponding to a key length of 40\u2013128\u00a0bits. First, the array \"S\" is initialized to the identity permutation. S is then processed for 256 iterations in a similar way to the main PRGA, but also mixes in bytes of the key at the same time. Note that many different keys like 'Text' and 'TextText' lead to the same cipher.\n for i from 0 to 255\n S[i] := i\n endfor\n j := 0\n for i from 0 to 255\n j := (j + S[i] + key[i mod keylength]) mod 256\n swap values of S[i] and S[j]\n endfor\nPseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA).\nFor as many iterations as are needed, the PRGA modifies the state and outputs a byte of the keystream. In each iteration, the PRGA: \nEach element of S is swapped with another element at least once every 256 iterations.\n i := 0\n j := 0\n while GeneratingOutput:\n i := (i + 1) mod 256\n j := (j + S[i]) mod 256\n swap values of S[i] and S[j]\n t := (S[i] + S[j]) mod 256\n K := S[t]\n output K\n endwhile\nThus, this produces a stream of K[0], K[1], ... which are XORed with the \"plaintext\" to obtain the \"ciphertext\". So ciphertext[\"l\"] \n plaintext[\"l\"] \u2295 K[\"l\"].\nRC4-based random number generators.\nSeveral operating systems include , an API originating in OpenBSD providing access to a random number generator originally based on RC4. The API allows no seeding, as the function initializes itself using /dev/random. The use of RC4 has been phased out in most systems implementing this API. Man pages for the new arc4random include the backronym \"A Replacement Call for Random\" for ARC4 as a mnemonic, as it provides better random data than rand() does.\nProposed new random number generators are often compared to the RC4 random number generator.\nSeveral attacks on RC4 are able to distinguish its output from a random sequence.\nImplementation.\nMany stream ciphers are based on linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs), which, while efficient in hardware, are less so in software. The design of RC4 avoids the use of LFSRs and is ideal for software implementation, as it requires only byte manipulations. It uses 256 bytes of memory for the state array, S[0] through S[255], k bytes of memory for the key, key[0] through key[k\u22121], and integer variables, i, j, and K. Performing a modular reduction of some value modulo 256 can be done with a bitwise AND with 255 (which is equivalent to taking the low-order byte of the value in question).\nTest vectors.\nThese test vectors are not official, but convenient for anyone testing their own RC4 program. The keys and plaintext are ASCII, the keystream and ciphertext are in hexadecimal.\nSecurity.\nUnlike a modern stream cipher (such as those in eSTREAM), RC4 does not take a separate nonce alongside the key. This means that if a single long-term key is to be used to securely encrypt multiple streams, the protocol must specify how to combine the nonce and the long-term key to generate the stream key for RC4. One approach to addressing this is to generate a \"fresh\" RC4 key by hashing a long-term key with a nonce. However, many applications that use RC4 simply concatenate key and nonce; RC4's weak key schedule then gives rise to related-key attacks, like the Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack (which is famous for breaking the WEP standard).\nBecause RC4 is a stream cipher, it is more malleable than common block ciphers. If not used together with a strong message authentication code (MAC), then encryption is vulnerable to a bit-flipping attack. The cipher is also vulnerable to a stream cipher attack if not implemented correctly.\nIt is noteworthy, however, that RC4, being a stream cipher, was for a period of time the only common cipher that was immune to the 2011 BEAST attack on TLS\u00a01.0. The attack exploits a known weakness in the way cipher-block chaining mode is used with all of the other ciphers supported by TLS\u00a01.0, which are all block ciphers.\nIn March 2013, there were new attack scenarios proposed by Isobe, Ohigashi, Watanabe and Morii, as well as AlFardan, Bernstein, Paterson, Poettering and Schuldt that use new statistical biases in RC4 key table to recover plaintext with large number of TLS encryptions.\nThe use of RC4 in TLS is prohibited by RFC 7465 published in February 2015.\nRoos' biases and key reconstruction from permutation.\nIn 1995, Andrew Roos experimentally observed that the first byte of the keystream is correlated with the first three bytes of the key, and the first few bytes of the permutation after the KSA are correlated with some linear combination of the key bytes. These biases remained unexplained until 2007, when Goutam Paul, Siddheshwar Rathi and Subhamoy Maitra proved the keystream\u2013key correlation and, in another work, Goutam Paul and Subhamoy Maitra proved the permutation\u2013key correlations. The latter work also used the permutation\u2013key correlations to design the first algorithm for complete key reconstruction from the final permutation after the KSA, without any assumption on the key or initialization vector. This algorithm has a constant probability of success in a time, which is the square root of the exhaustive key search complexity. Subsequently, many other works have been performed on key reconstruction from RC4 internal states. Subhamoy Maitra and Goutam Paul also showed that the Roos-type biases still persist even when one considers nested permutation indices, like S[S[i]] or S[S[S[i]]]. These types of biases are used in some of the later key reconstruction methods for increasing the success probability.\nBiased outputs of the RC4.\nThe keystream generated by the RC4 is biased to varying degrees towards certain sequences, making it vulnerable to distinguishing attacks. The best such attack is due to Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir, who showed that the second output byte of the cipher was biased toward zero with probability 1/128 (instead of 1/256). This is due to the fact that if the third byte of the original state is zero, and the second byte is not equal to 2, then the second output byte is always zero. Such bias can be detected by observing only 256\u00a0bytes.\nSouradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel of COSIC showed that the first and the second bytes of the RC4 were also biased. The number of required samples to detect this bias is 225\u00a0bytes.\nScott Fluhrer and David McGrew also showed attacks that distinguished the keystream of the RC4 from a random stream given a gigabyte of output.\nThe complete characterization of a single step of RC4 PRGA was performed by Riddhipratim Basu, Shirshendu Ganguly, Subhamoy Maitra, and Goutam Paul. Considering all the permutations, they proved that the distribution of the output is not uniform given i and j, and as a consequence, information about j is always leaked into the output.\nFluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack.\nIn 2001, a new and surprising discovery was made by Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir: over all the possible RC4 keys, the statistics for the first few bytes of output keystream are strongly non-random, leaking information about the key. If the nonce and long-term key are simply concatenated to generate the RC4 key, this long-term key can be discovered by analysing a large number of messages encrypted with this key. This and related effects were then used to break the WEP (\"wired equivalent privacy\") encryption used with 802.11 wireless networks. This caused a scramble for a standards-based replacement for WEP in the 802.11 market and led to the IEEE\u00a0802.11i effort and WPA.\nProtocols can defend against this attack by discarding the initial portion of the keystream. Such a modified algorithm is traditionally called \"RC4-drop[n]\", where n is the number of initial keystream bytes that are dropped. The SCAN default is n = 768\u00a0bytes, but a conservative value would be n = 3072\u00a0bytes.\nThe Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack does not apply to RC4-based SSL, since SSL generates the encryption keys it uses for RC4 by hashing, meaning that different SSL sessions have unrelated keys.\nKlein's attack.\nIn 2005, Andreas Klein presented an analysis of the RC4 stream cipher, showing more correlations between the RC4 keystream and the key. Erik Tews, Ralf-Philipp Weinmann, and Andrei Pychkine used this analysis to create aircrack-ptw, a tool that cracks 104-bit RC4 used in 128-bit WEP in under a minute. Whereas the Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir attack used around 10\u00a0million messages, aircrack-ptw can break 104-bit keys in 40,000 frames with 50% probability, or in 85,000 frames with 95% probability.\nCombinatorial problem.\nA combinatorial problem related to the number of inputs and outputs of the RC4 cipher was first posed by Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir in 2001, whereby, of the total 256 elements in the typical state of RC4, if \"x\" number of elements (\"x\" \u2264 256) are \"only\" known (all other elements can be assumed empty), then the maximum number of elements that can be produced deterministically is also x in the next 256 rounds. This conjecture was put to rest in 2004 with a formal proof given by Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel.\nRoyal Holloway attack.\nIn 2013, a group of security researchers at the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London reported an attack that can become effective using only 234 encrypted messages. While yet not a practical attack for most purposes, this result is sufficiently close to one that it has led to speculation that it is plausible that some state cryptologic agencies may already have better attacks that render RC4 insecure. Given that, as of 2013[ [update]], a large amount of TLS traffic uses RC4 to avoid attacks on block ciphers that use cipher block chaining, if these hypothetical better attacks exist, then this would make the TLS-with-RC4 combination insecure against such attackers in a large number of practical scenarios.\nIn March 2015, researcher to Royal Holloway announced improvements to their attack, providing a 226 attack against passwords encrypted with RC4, as used in TLS.\nBar mitzvah attack.\nAt the Black Hat Asia 2015 Conference, Itsik Mantin presented another attack against SSL using RC4 cipher.\nNOMORE attack.\nIn 2015, security researchers from KU Leuven presented new attacks against RC4 in both TLS and WPA-TKIP. Dubbed the Numerous Occurrence MOnitoring &amp; Recovery Exploit (NOMORE) attack, it is the first attack of its kind that was demonstrated in practice. Their attack against TLS can decrypt a secure HTTP cookie within 75\u00a0hours. The attack against WPA-TKIP can be completed within an hour and allows an attacker to decrypt and inject arbitrary packets.\nRC4 variants.\nAs mentioned above, the most important weakness of RC4 comes from the insufficient key schedule; the first bytes of output reveal information about the key. This can be corrected by simply discarding some initial portion of the output stream. This is known as RC4-drop\"N\", where \"N\" is typically a multiple of 256, such as 768 or 1024.\nA number of attempts have been made to strengthen RC4, notably Spritz, RC4A, VMPC, and RC4+.\nRC4A.\nSouradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel have proposed an RC4 variant, which they call RC4A.\nRC4A uses two state arrays S1 and S2, and two indexes j1 and j2. Each time i is incremented, two bytes are generated:\nThus, the algorithm is:\n \"All arithmetic is performed modulo 256\"\n i := 0\n j1 := 0\n j2 := 0\n while GeneratingOutput:\n i := i + 1\n j1 := j1 + S1[i]\n swap values of S1[i] and S1[j1]\n output S2[S1[i] + S1[j1]]\n j2 := j2 + S2[i]\n swap values of S2[i] and S2[j2]\n output S1[S2[i] + S2[j2]]\n endwhile\nAlthough the algorithm required the same number of operations per output byte, there is greater parallelism than RC4, providing a possible speed improvement.\nAlthough stronger than RC4, this algorithm has also been attacked, with Alexander Maximov and a team from NEC developing ways to distinguish its output from a truly random sequence.\nVMPC.\nVariably Modified Permutation Composition (VMPC) is another RC4 variant. It uses similar key schedule as RC4, with\nj := S[(j + S[i] + key[i mod keylength]) mod 256] iterating 3 \u00d7 256 = 768 times rather than 256, and with an optional additional 768 iterations to incorporate an initial vector. The output generation function operates as follows:\n \"All arithmetic is performed modulo 256.\"\n i := 0\n while GeneratingOutput:\n j := S[j + S[i]]\n output S[S[S[j]] + 1]\n Swap S[i] and S[j] (\"b := S[j]; S[j] := S[i]; S[i] := b)\")\n i := i + 1\n endwhile\nThis was attacked in the same papers as RC4A, and can be distinguished within 238 output bytes.\nRC4+.\nRC4+ is a modified version of RC4 with a more complex three-phase key schedule (taking about three times as long as RC4, or the same as RC4-drop512), and a more complex output function which performs four additional lookups in the S array for each byte output, taking approximately 1.7 times as long as basic RC4.\n \"All arithmetic modulo 256. \"\u00ab\" and \"\u00bb\" are left and right shift, \"\u2295\" is exclusive OR\"\n while GeneratingOutput:\n i := i + 1\n a := S[i]\n j := j + a\n Swap S[i] and S[j] (\"b := S[j]; S[j] := S[i]; S[i] := b;\")\n c := S[i\u00ab5 \u2295 j\u00bb3] + S[j\u00ab5 \u2295 i\u00bb3]\n output (S[a+b] + S[c\u22950xAA]) \u2295 S[j+b]\n endwhile\nThis algorithm has not been analyzed significantly.\nSpritz.\nIn 2014, Ronald Rivest gave a talk and co-wrote a paper on an updated redesign called Spritz. A hardware accelerator of Spritz was published in Secrypt, 2016 and shows that due to multiple nested calls required to produce output bytes, Spritz performs rather slowly compared to other hash functions such as SHA-3 and the best known hardware implementation of RC4.\nLike other sponge functions, Spritz can be used to build a cryptographic hash function, a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), an encryption algorithm that supports authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), etc.\nIn 2016, Banik and Isobe proposed an attack that can distinguish Spritz from random noise. In 2017, Banik, Isobe, and Morii proposed a simple fix that removes the distinguisher in the first two keystream bytes, requiring only one additional memory access without diminishing software performance substantially.\nRC4-based protocols.\nWhere a protocol is marked with \"(optionally)\", RC4 is one of multiple ciphers the system can be configured to use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Starr occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles songs \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of four others. Out of the classic lineup of the Beatles, and as of 2025, Starr is the longest-living member of the band.\nStarr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, with periods of prolonged hospitalisation. As a teenager Starr became interested in the skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll around early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes when he was asked to join the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best.\nIn addition to the Beatles' films, Starr has acted in numerous others. After the Beatles disbanded, he released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit \"It Don't Come Easy\", and number ones \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". His most successful UK single was \"Back Off Boogaloo\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album \"Ringo\", which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. Starr has also featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two series of the children's television series \"Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends\" and portrayed \"Mr. Conductor\" during the first season of its American spin-off \"Shining Time Station\". Since 1989, he has toured with thirteen variations of Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band.\nStarr's playing style, which emphasised feel over technical virtuosity, influenced many drummers to reconsider their playing from a compositional perspective. He also influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings. In his opinion, his finest recorded performance was on the Beatles' \"Rain\". In 1999, he was inducted into the \"Modern Drummer\" Hall of Fame. In 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" readers named him the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. He was inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a Beatle in 1988 and as a solo artist in 2015, and appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.\nEarly life.\nRichard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940 at 9 Madryn Street in Dingle, an inner-city area of Liverpool. He is the only child of confectioners Richard Starkey and Elsie Gleave. Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of swing. Prior to the birth of their son, whom they called \"Ritchie\", the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit, but their regular outings ended soon after his birth. Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, \"Big Ritchie\", as Starkey's father became known, lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes for several consecutive days.\nIn an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved in 1944 to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, Admiral Grove; soon afterwards his parents separated, and they divorced within the year. Starkey later stated that he has \"no real memories\" of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as three times thereafter. Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband's support payments of thirty shillings a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a barmaid, an occupation that she held for twelve years.\nAt the age of six, Starkey developed appendicitis. Following an appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, causing him to fall into a coma that lasted days. His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street children's hospital. Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay at home, causing him to miss school. At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics. His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park. After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years. During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed. Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song \"Bedtime for Drums\" as a convalescence gift from Crawford. Starkey commented: \"I was in the hospital band ... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano \u2013 nothing. Only the drums.\"\nStarkey attended St Silas, a Church of England primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him \"Lazarus\", and later Dingle Vale Secondary modern school, where he showed an aptitude for art and drama, as well as practical subjects including mechanics. As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the 11-plus qualifying examination required for attendance at a grammar school. After the extended hospital stay following Starkey's recovery from tuberculosis, he did not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating biscuit tins with sticks. On 17 April 1954, Starkey's mother married Harry Graves at the register office on Mount Pleasant, Liverpool. He was an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage. Graves, an impassioned fan of big band music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey to recordings by Dinah Shore, Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels. Graves stated that he and \"Ritchie\" never had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: \"He was great ... I learned gentleness from Harry.\"\nBeatles biographer Bob Spitz described Starkey's upbringing as \"a Dickensian chronicle of misfortune\". Houses in the area were \"poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse.\" Crawford commented: \"Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive.\" The children who lived there spent much of their time at Prince's Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: \"You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way.\"\nAfter his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job with British Rail, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, he was laid off and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at Henry Hunt and Son, a Liverpool school equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.\nCareer.\nFirst bands.\nSoon after Trafford piqued Starkey's interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: \"I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs.\" The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as \"Rock Island Line\" and \"Walking Cane\", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.\nOn Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.\nIn November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes shortly before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His singing solos were billed as \"Starr Time\".\nBy early 1960, the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool's leading bands. In May, they were offered a three-month residency at a Butlins holiday camp in Wales. Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five-year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier, Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement. The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band, including an unpleasant tour of US Air Force bases in France about which Starr commented: \"The French don't like the British; at least I didn't like them.\" The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in Hamburg, they turned it down because of their prior commitment with Butlins. They eventually accepted, joining the Beatles at Bruno Koschmider's Kaiserkeller on 1 October 1960, where Starr first met the band. Storm's Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles, who also received less pay. Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand-in engagements while in Hamburg. On 15 October 1960, he drummed with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, recording with them for the first time while backing Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on the song \"Summertime\". During Starr's first stay in Hamburg he also met Tony Sheridan, who valued his drumming abilities to the point of asking Starr to leave the Hurricanes and join his band.\nThe Beatles.\nReplacing Best.\nStarr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins. On 14 August, Starr accepted Lennon's invitation to join the Beatles. On 16 August, Beatles manager Brian Epstein fired their drummer, Pete Best, who recalled: \"He said 'I've got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in.' He said [Beatles producer] George Martin wasn't too pleased with my playing [and] the boys thought I didn't fit in.\" Starr first performed as a member of the Beatles on 18 August 1962, at a horticultural society dance at Port Sunlight. After his appearance at the Cavern Club the following day, Best fans, upset by his firing, held vigils outside his house and at the club shouting \"Pete forever! Ringo never!\" Harrison received a black eye from one upset fan, and Epstein, whose car tyres they had flattened in anger, temporarily hired a bodyguard.\nStarr's first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962. He stated that Martin had thought that he \"was crazy and couldn't play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time, we were just a four-piece band\". For their second recording session with Starr, on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer Andy White while recording takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles' first single, \"Love Me Do\", backed with \"P.S. I Love You\". Starr played tambourine on \"Love Me Do\" and maracas on \"P.S. I Love You\". Concerned about his status in the Beatles, he thought: \"That's the end, they're doing a Pete Best on me.\" Martin later clarified: \"I simply didn't know what Ringo was like and I wasn't prepared to take any risks.\"\nBy November 1962, Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans, who were now calling for him to sing. He began receiving an amount of fan mail equal to that of the others, which helped to secure his position within the band. Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same \"wavelength\" as the other Beatles: \"I had to be, or I wouldn't have lasted. I had to join them as people as well as a drummer.\" He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney's publishing company, Northern Songs, but derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band's net concert earnings. He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: \"I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party.\" Like his father, Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received praise for his skills.\nWorldwide success.\nDuring 1963, the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in Britain. In January, their second single, \"Please Please Me\", followed \"Love Me Do\" into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" earned favourable reviews, leading to a boost in sales and radio play. By the end of the year, the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success when they performed in New York City on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" to a record 73\u00a0million viewers. Starr commented: \"In the States I know I went over well. It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me. I'd made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we're ordinary lads.\" He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including Penny Valentine's \"I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye\" and Rolf Harris's \"Ringo for President\". Cher released her first single, \"Ringo, I Love You\" in 1964 under the pseudonym Bonnie Joe Mason.\nIn 1964, \"I love Ringo\" lapel pins were the best-selling Beatles merchandise. The prominent placing of the Ludwig logo on the bass drum of his American import drum kit gave the company such a burst of publicity that it became the dominant drum manufacturer in North America for the next twenty years. During live performances, the Beatles continued the \"Starr Time\" routine that had been popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr's kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams. When the Beatles made their film debut in \"A Hard Day's Night\", Starr garnered praise from critics, who considered his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights. The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester because of Starr's lack of sleep the previous night; Starr commented: \"Because I'd been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line.\" Epstein attributed Starr's acclaim to \"the little man's quaintness\". After the release of the Beatles' second feature film, \"Help!\" (1965), Starr won a \"Melody Maker\" poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.\nDuring an interview with \"Playboy\" in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: \"[Best] took little pills to make him ill\". Soon after, Best filed a libel suit against him that lasted four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best's favour. In June, the Beatles were scheduled to begin their world tour of Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Before the start of the tour, Starr was stricken with a high-grade fever, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, and briefly stayed in a local hospital, followed by several days of recuperation at home. He was temporarily replaced for five concerts by 24-year-old session drummer Jimmie Nicol. Starr was discharged from the hospital and rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June. He later said that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness. In August, the Beatles were introduced to American songwriter Bob Dylan, who offered the group cannabis cigarettes. Starr was the first to try one but the others were hesitant.\nOn 11 February 1965, Starr married Maureen Cox, whom he had met in 1962. By this time the stress and pressure of Beatlemania had reached a peak for him. He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal, and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to defend against would-be assassins. The constant pressure affected the Beatles' performances; Starr commented: \"We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it.\" He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent hours playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and road manager Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him. In a letter published in \"Melody Maker\", a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: \"[I am] quite happy with my one little track on each album\".\nStudio years.\nIn August 1966, the Beatles released \"Revolver\", their seventh UK LP. It included the song \"Yellow Submarine\", their only British number-one single with Starr as the lead singer. Later that month, owing to the increasing pressures of touring, the Beatles gave their final concert, a 30-minute performance at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. Starr commented: \"We gave up touring at the right time. Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone.\" By December he had moved to a larger estate called Sunny Heights, in size, at St George's Hill in Weybridge, Surrey, near to Lennon. Although he had equipped the house with many luxury items, including numerous televisions, light machines, film projectors, stereo equipment, a billiard table, go-kart track and a bar named the Flying Cow, he did not include a drum kit; he explained: \"When we don't record, I don't play.\"\nFor the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon\u2013McCartney composition \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with \"Sgt. Pepper\", the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band; he commented: \"[It] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me it was a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play.\" His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his downtime, Starr worked on his guitar playing, and said: \"I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar\".\nEpstein's death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: \"[It was] a strange time for us, when it's someone who we've relied on in the business, where we never got involved.\" Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, \"Magical Mystery Tour\". Starr's growing interest in photography led to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by that of McCartney. In February 1968, Starr became the first Beatle to sing on another artist's show without the others. He sang the Buck Owens hit \"Act Naturally\", and performed a duet with Cilla Black, \"Do You Like Me Just a Little Bit?\" on her BBC One television programme, \"Cilla\".\nIn November 1968, Apple Records released \"The Beatles\", commonly known as the \"White Album\". The album was partly inspired by the band's recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. While attending the Maharishi's intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album there. It was here that Starr completed his first recorded Beatles song, \"Don't Pass Me By\", but he left after 10 days and later compared his time there to a stay at Butlin's. The long-lasting health problems that began in his childhood had an impact on his time in India, causing him to experience allergies and sensitivities to the local food; when the band travelled there, he resorted to taking his own food with him.\nRelations within the Beatles deteriorated during the recording of the White Album, and there were occasions where only one or two members were involved in the recording of a track. Starr had become tired of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach, Lennon's passive-aggressive behaviour, and the near-constant presence of Lennon's wife Yoko Ono. After one particularly difficult session which included McCartney harshly criticising his drumming, Starr briefly quit the Beatles and went on holiday to Sardinia, where he and his family stayed on a boat loaned to them by actor Peter Sellers. During a lunch there, the chef served octopus and Starr refused to eat it; an ensuing conversation with the ship's captain about the animal inspired Starr's song \"Octopus's Garden\" from the Beatles' album \"Abbey Road\", which he wrote using a guitar during the trip. Two weeks later, he returned to the studio to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.\nDespite a temporary return to friendly interactions during the completion of the White Album, production of the Beatles' fourth feature film \"Let It Be\" and its accompanying album further strained band relationships. On 20 August 1969, the Beatles gathered for the final time at Abbey Road Studios for a mixing session for \"I Want You\". At a business meeting exactly one month later, Lennon told the others that he was leaving the band, effective immediately. However, the band's break-up would not become public knowledge until McCartney's announcement on 10 April 1970 that he was also leaving.\nSolo career.\n1970s.\nShortly before McCartney announced his exit from the Beatles in April 1970, he and Starr had a falling out due to McCartney's refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album to allow for Starr's debut, \"Sentimental Journey\", and the Beatles' \"Let It Be\". Starr's album \u2013 composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney \u2013 peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. Starr followed \"Sentimental Journey\" with the country-inspired \"Beaucoups of Blues\", engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake. Despite favourable reviews, the album was a commercial failure. Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a film actor.\nStarr played drums on Lennon's \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), Ono's \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), and on Harrison's albums \"All Things Must Pass\" (1970), \"Living in the Material World\" (1973) and \"Dark Horse\" (1974). In 1971, Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single \"It Don't Come Easy\", which reached number four in both the US and the UK. The following year he released his most successful UK hit, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" (again produced and co-written by Harrison), which peaked at number two (US number nine). Having become friends with the English singer Marc Bolan, Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 T. Rex documentary \"Born to Boogie\".\nIn 1973 and 1974, Starr had two number one hits in the US: \"Photograph\", a UK number eight hit co-written with Harrison, and \"You're Sixteen\", written by the Sherman Brothers. Starr's third million-selling single in the US, \"You're Sixteen\" was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four. Both tracks appeared on Starr's debut rock album, \"Ringo\", produced by Richard Perry and featuring further contributions from Harrison as well as a song each from Lennon and McCartney. A commercial and critical success, the LP also included \"Oh My My\", a US number five. The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US. Author Peter Doggett describes \"Ringo\" as a template for Starr's solo career, saying that, as a musician first rather than a songwriter, \"he would rely on his friends and his charm, and if both were on tap, then the results were usually appealing\".\n\"Goodnight Vienna\" followed in 1974 and was also successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK. Featuring contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover (suggested by Lennon) of the Platters' 1954 hit \"Only You (And You Alone)\", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton's \"No No Song\", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit. The Elton John-written \"Snookeroo\" failed to chart in the UK, however. In mid-November 1974, a music video for the song and promotional film for the album was filmed on the rooftop of the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, designed to resemble a stack of discs. Lennon provided a voiceover as Starr's spacecraft landed on the building and Starr boarded it before taking off over the city. Starr, Nilsson, and Keith Moon were among the cast, along with a forty-foot robot named 'Gort' placed on the building. During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul. He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, \"Don't You Remember When\", and he inspired another De Paul song, \"If I Don't Get You the Next One Will\", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.\nStarr founded the record label Ring O' Records in 1975. The company signed eleven artists and released fifteen singles and five albums between 1975 and 1978, including works by David Hentschel, Graham Bonnet and Rab Noakes. The commercial impact of Starr's own career diminished over the same period, however, although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence. Speaking in 2001, he attributed this downward turn to his \"[not] taking enough interest\" in music, saying of himself and friends such as Nilsson and Keith Moon: \"We weren't musicians dabbling in drugs and alcohol; now we were junkies dabbling in music.\" Starr, Nilsson and Moon were members of a drinking club, the Hollywood Vampires.\nFrom the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, Starr and the designer Robin Cruikshank ran a furniture and interior design company, ROR. ROR's designs were placed on sale in the department stores of Harvey Nichols and Liberty of London. The company designed the interiors of palaces in Abu Dhabi and Oman, and the apartments of Paul Raymond and Starr's friend Nilsson.\nIn November 1976, Starr appeared as a guest at the Band's farewell concert, featured in the 1978 Martin Scorsese documentary \"The Last Waltz\". Also in 1976, Starr issued \"Ringo's Rotogravure\", the first release under his new contract with Atlantic Records for the North American market and Polydor for all other territories. The album was produced by Arif Mardin and featured compositions by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Starr promoted the release heavily, yet \"Rotogravure\" and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK. In America, the LP produced two minor hits, \"A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll\" (number 26) and a cover of \"Hey! Baby\" (number 74), and achieved moderate sales, reaching a chart position of 28. Its disappointing performance inspired Atlantic to revamp Starr's formula; the result was a blend of disco and 1970s pop, \"Ringo the 4th\" (1977). The album failed to chart in the UK and peaked at number 162 in the US. In 1978 Starr released \"Bad Boy\", which reached number 129 in the US and again failed to place on the UK albums chart.\nIn April 1979, Starr became seriously ill with intestinal problems relating to his childhood bout of peritonitis and was taken to the Princess Grace Hospital in Monte Carlo. He almost died and during an operation on 28 April, several feet of intestine had to be removed. Three weeks later he played with McCartney and Harrison at Eric Clapton's wedding. On 28 November, a fire destroyed his Hollywood home and much of his Beatles memorabilia.\n1980s.\nOn 19 May 1980, Starr and Barbara Bach survived a car crash in Surrey, England.\nFollowing Lennon's murder in December 1980, Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had originally written for Starr, \"All Those Years Ago\", as a tribute to their former bandmate. Released as a Harrison single in 1981, the track, which included Starr's drum part and overdubbed backing vocals by McCartney, peaked at number two in the US charts and number 13 in the UK. Later that year, Starr released \"Stop and Smell the Roses\", featuring songs produced by Nilsson, McCartney, Harrison, Ronnie Wood and Stephen Stills. The album's lead single, the Harrison-composed \"Wrack My Brain\", reached number 38 in the US charts, but failed to chart in the UK. Lennon had offered a pair of songs for inclusion on the album \u2013 \"Nobody Told Me\" and \"Life Begins at 40\" \u2013 but following his death, Starr did not feel comfortable recording them. Soon after the murder, Starr and his girlfriend Barbara Bach flew to New York City to be with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono.\nFollowing \"Stop and Smell the Roses\", Starr's recording projects were beset with problems. After completing \"Old Wave\" in 1982 with producer Joe Walsh, he was unable to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US. In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by Chips Moman, after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr narrated the 1984\u20131986 series of the children's animated television series \"Thomas &amp; Friends\", a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W. Awdry. For a single season in 1989, Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the American \"Thomas &amp; Friends\" spin-off, \"Shining Time Station\".\nIn 1985, Starr performed with his son Zak as part of Artists United Against Apartheid on the protest song \"Sun City\", and, with Harrison and Eric Clapton, was among the special guests on Carl Perkins' TV special \"\". In 1987, he played drums on Harrison's Beatles pastiche \"When We Was Fab\" and also appeared in Godley &amp; Creme's innovative video clip for the song. The same year, Starr joined Harrison, Clapton, Jeff Lynne and Elton John in a performance at London's Wembley Arena for the Prince's Trust charity. In January 1988, he attended the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in New York, with Harrison and Ono (the latter representing Lennon), to accept the Beatles' induction into the Hall of Fame.\nDuring October and November 1988, Starr and Bach attended a detox clinic in Tucson, Arizona; each received a six-week treatment for alcoholism. He later commented on his longstanding addiction: \"Years I've lost, absolute years ... I've no idea what happened. I lived in a blackout.\" Having embraced sobriety, Starr focused on re-establishing his career by making a return to touring. On 23 July 1989, Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band gave their first performance to an audience of ten thousand in Dallas, Texas. Setting a pattern that would continue over the following decades, the band consisted of Starr and an assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right at different times. The concerts interchanged Starr's singing, including selections of his Beatles and solo songs, with performances of each of the other artists' well-known material, the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer.\n1990s.\nThe first All-Starr excursion led to the release of \"Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band\" (1990), a compilation of live performances from the 1989 tour. Also in 1990, Starr recorded a version of the song \"I Call Your Name\" for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon's death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon's birth. The track, produced by Lynne, features a supergroup composed of Lynne, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jim Keltner.\nThe following year, Starr made a cameo appearance on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Brush with Greatness\" and contributed an original song, \"You Never Know\", to the soundtrack of the John Hughes film \"Curly Sue\". In 1992, he released his first studio album in nine years, \"Time Takes Time\", which was produced by Phil Ramone, Don Was, Lynne and Peter Asher and featured guest appearances by various stars including Brian Wilson and Harry Nilsson. The album failed to achieve commercial success, although the single \"Weight of the World\" peaked at number 74 in the UK, marking his first appearance on the singles chart there since \"Only You\" in 1974.\nIn 1994, Starr began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles for the \"Beatles Anthology\" project. They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, \"Free as a Bird\" was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, \"Real Love\". The temporary reunion ended when Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song. Starr then played drums on McCartney's 1997 album \"Flaming Pie\". Among the tracks to which he contributed, \"Little Willow\" was a song McCartney wrote about Starr's ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, while \"Really Love You\" was the first official release ever credited to McCartney\u2013Starkey.\nIn 1998, Starr released two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album \"Vertical Man\" marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on \"VH1 Storytellers\", which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them. Starr's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed \"I Wanna Be Santa Claus\". The album was a commercial failure, although the record company chose not to issue it in Britain.\n2000s.\nStarr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group of drummers and percussionists that include Buddy Rich, William F. Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \"Photograph\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \"Honey Don't\" at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, he released the album \"Ringo Rama\", which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \"Never Without You\". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled \"Fake Songs\".\nStarr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \"a Starr in the east\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition.\nHis 2005 release \"Choose Love\" eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9Madryn Street, stating that it had \"no historical significance\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.\nStarr released the album \"Liverpool 8\" in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart.&lt;ref name=\"Erlewine/Liverpool8\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign.\nIn April 2009, he reunited with McCartney at the David Lynch Foundation's \"Change Begins Within\" benefit concert, held at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Having played his own set beforehand, Starr joined McCartney for the finale and performed \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", among other songs. Starr also appeared on-stage during Microsoft's June 2009 E3 press conference with Yoko Ono, McCartney and Olivia Harrison to promote \"\" video game.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, Starr self-produced and released his fifteenth studio album, \"Y Not\", which included the track \"Walk with You\" and featured a vocal contribution from McCartney. Later that year, he appeared during \"\" as a celebrity phone operator. On 7 July 2010, he celebrated his 70th birthday at Radio City Music Hall with another All-Starr Band concert, topped with friends and family joining him on stage including Ono, his son Zak, and McCartney.\nStarr recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's \"Think It Over\" for the 2011 tribute album \"\". In January 2012, he released the album \"Ringo 2012\". Later that year, he announced that his All-Starr Band would tour the Pacific Rim during 2013 with select dates in New Zealand, Australia and Japan; it was his first performance in Japan since 1996, and his debut in both New Zealand and Australia.\nIn January 2014, Starr joined McCartney for a special performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, where they performed the song \"Queenie Eye\". That summer he toured Canada and the US with an updated version of the Twelfth All-Starr Band, featuring multi-instrumentalist Warren Ham instead of saxophonist Mark Rivera. In July, Starr became involved in \"#peacerocks\", an anti-violence campaign started by fashion designer John Varvatos, in conjunction with the David Lynch Foundation.&lt;ref name=\"instyle7/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, he won at the \"GQ\" Men of the Year Awards for his humanitarian work with the David Lynch Foundation.\nIn January 2015, Starr tweeted the title of his new studio album \"Postcards from Paradise\". The album came a few weeks in advance of Starr's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was released on 31 March 2015 to mixed to positive reviews. Later that month, Starr and his band announced a forthcoming Summer 2016 Tour of the US. Full production began in June 2016 in Syracuse.\nOn 7 July 2017 (his 77th birthday), Starr released \"Give More Love\" as a single, which was followed two months later by his nineteenth studio album, also titled \"Give More Love\" and issued by UMe. The album includes appearances by McCartney, as well as frequent collaborators such as Joe Walsh, David A. Stewart, Gary Nicholson and members of the All-Starr Band.\nIn June 2018, Starr embarked on a 44-date tour across Europe and North America with his All-Starr Band. As part of the tour, he performed two consecutive concerts at the Menora Mivtachim Arena in Tel Aviv, where he shared a message of \"peace and love\" with his fans. These shows marked his first performances in Israel, making him the second former Beatle to play in the country after Paul McCartney's 2008 concert in Tel Aviv.\nOn 13 September 2019, Starr announced the upcoming release of his 20th album, \"What's My Name\", to be released by UMe on 25 October 2019. He recorded the album in his home studio, Roccabella West in Los Angeles.\n2020s.\nIn celebration of his 80th birthday in July 2020, Starr organised a live-streamed concert featuring appearances by many of his friends and collaborators including McCartney, Walsh, Ben Harper, Dave Grohl, Sheryl Crow, Sheila E. and Willie Nelson. The show replaced his annual public birthday celebration at the Capitol Records Building, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 16 December 2020, Starr released the song \"Here's to the Nights\". An accompanying video was released on 18 December. The song of peace, love and friendship was written by Diane Warren and features a group of his friends, including McCartney, Joe Walsh, Corinne Bailey Rae, Eric Burdon, Sheryl Crow, Finneas, Dave Grohl, Ben Harper, Lenny Kravitz, Jenny Lewis, Steve Lukather, Chris Stapleton and Yola. The song was the lead single from his EP \"Zoom In\", which was released on 19 March 2021 via UMe.\nOn 16 March 2021, Starr stated in an interview with \"Esquire\" that it was unlikely that he would record another full-length album, preferring to release EPs instead. On 24 September that year, he released the EP \"Change the World\", a sequel to the previous EP \"Zoom In\".\nOn 7 February 2022, Starr announced his intention to return to touring with his band for the first time since 2019. The tour was announced to run from 27 May to 26 June, though several concerts held in June would end up being postponed till October due to two members of the band catching COVID-19. These postponed events were added to the band's previously announced tour to be held in September and October. On 1 October, he cancelled a concert at the Four Winds New Buffalo casino due to an unspecified illness affecting his voice. Another concert to be held at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel the following day was also postponed. On 3 October, it was confirmed that Starr had tested positive for COVID-19, after which several shows in Canada were cancelled.\nOn 16 September 2022, Starr released the EP \"EP3\". On 12 January 2023, Starr announced that he and the All-Starr Band would be touring in the US from 19 May to 17 June. In May 2023, a further series of tour dates was also announced, from 17 September to 13 October. Another EP by Starr, \"Rewind Forward\", released on 13 October. Another, \"Crooked Boy\", was initially released as a Record Store Day exclusive in 2024, with digital and physical releases on 26 April and 31 May, respectively. Despite previous statements that he would no longer release full albums, a country and roots album, \"Look Up\", produced by T Bone Burnett, was released on 10 January 2025.\nArtistry.\nInfluences.\nDuring his youth, Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958, he had developed a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: \"He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on.\" He stated that he \"was never really into drummers\", but identified Cozy Cole's 1958 cover of Benny Goodman's \"Topsy Part Two\" as \"the one drum record\" he bought.\nStarr's first musical hero was Gene Autry, about whom he commented: \"I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang, 'South of the Border'\". By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of Lee Dorsey. In November 1964, Starr told \"Melody Maker\": \"Our music is second-hand versions of negro music ... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured.\"\nDrums.\nStarr said of his drumming: \"I'm no good on the technical things ... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that.\" Beatles producer George Martin said: \"Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life\", but later said, \"He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support \u2013 that rock-solid back-beat \u2013 that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier.\" Starr said he did not believe the drummer's role was to \"interpret the song\". Instead, comparing his drumming to painting, he said: \"I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it.\"\nIn 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Journalist Robyn Flans wrote for the Percussive Arts Society: \"I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums\". Drummer Steve Smith said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm in how the public saw drummers. We started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect. One of Ringo's great qualities was that he composed unique, stylistic drum parts for the Beatles' songs. His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song.\nStarr said his favourite drummer is Jim Keltner, with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. The pair subsequently played drums together on some of Harrison's recordings during the 1970s, on \"Ringo\" and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours. For \"Ringo's Rotogravure\" in 1976, Starr credited himself as \"Thunder\" and Keltner as \"Lightnin'\".\nStarr is widely known for sitting behind the drum kit in a higher position than most drummers. This position gives him better access to the tom-tom and cymbals as well as doing the rimshot.\nStarr influenced the Genesis drummer Phil Collins, who said: \"I think he's vastly underrated, Ringo. The drum fills on 'A Day in the Life' are very, very complex things. You could take a great drummer from today and say, 'I want it like that', and they really wouldn't know what to do.\" Collins said his drumming on the 1983 Genesis song \"That's All\" was an affectionate attempt at a \"Ringo Starr drum part\".\nIn an often-repeated but apocryphal story, when asked if Starr was the best drummer in the world, Lennon quipped that he \"wasn't even the best drummer in the Beatles\". The line actually comes from a 1981 episode of the BBC Radio 4 comedy series \"Radio Active\", and gained more prominence when it was used by the television comedian Jasper Carrott in 1983, three years after Lennon's death. In September 1980, Lennon told \"Rolling Stone\" that Starr was a \"damn good drummer\" whose talent would have surfaced even without the Beatles.\nTjinder Singh of the indie rock band Cornershop said Starr was a pioneering drummer: \"There was a time when the common consensus was that Ringo couldn't play. What's that all about? He's totally unique, a one-off, and hip hop has a lot to thank him for.\" In his book \"The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions\", Mark Lewisohn says there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped due to mistakes by the other Beatles. Starr influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of \"Classic Rock Drummers\": \"Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers.\"\nIn 2021, Starr announced a ten-part MasterClass course called \"Drumming and Creative Collaboration\".\nVocals.\nStarr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for \"Yellow Submarine\" from \"Revolver\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". These melodies were tailored to Starr's limited baritone vocal range. Because of his distinctive voice, Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles, but they can be heard on songs such as \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and \"Carry That Weight\". He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\". In addition, he sang lead on \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"Boys\", \"Matchbox\", \"Honey Don't\", \"Act Naturally\", \"Good Night\" and \"What Goes On\".\nSongwriting.\nStarr's idiosyncratic turns of phrase or \"Ringoisms\", such as \"a hard day's night\" and \"tomorrow never knows\", were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: \"Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic.\" Starr also occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon\u2013McCartney songs, such as the line \"darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there\" in \"Eleanor Rigby\".\nStarr is credited as the sole composer of two Beatles songs: \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", the latter written with assistance from Harrison. While promoting the \"Abbey Road\" album in 1969, Harrison recognised Starr's lyrics to \"Octopus's Garden\" as an unwittingly profound message about finding inner peace, and therefore an example of how \"Ringo writes his cosmic songs without knowing it.\" Starr is also credited as a co-writer of \"What Goes On\", \"Flying\" and \"Dig It\". On material issued after the band's break-up, he received a writing credit for \"Taking a Trip to Carolina\" and joint songwriting credits with the other Beatles for \"12-Bar Original\", \"Los Paranoias\", \"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\", \"Suzy Parker\" (from the \"Let It Be\" film), \"Jessie's Dream\" (from the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film), \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Now and Then\".\nIn a 2003 interview, Starr discussed Harrison's input in his songwriting and said: \"I was great at writing two verses and a chorus \u2013 I'm still pretty good at that. Finishing songs is not my forte.\"&lt;ref name=\"Ruttenburg/TimeOutNY\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison helped Starr complete two of his biggest hit songs, \"It Don't Come Easy\" and \"Back Off Boogaloo\", although he only accepted a credit for \"Photograph\", which they wrote together in France. Starting with the \"Ringo\" album in 1973, Starr shared a songwriting partnership with Vini Poncia. One of the pair's first collaborations was \"Oh My My\". Over half of the songs on \"Ringo the 4th\" were Starkey\u2013Poncia compositions, but the partnership produced just two more songs, released on \"Bad Boy\" in 1978.\nPersonal life.\nIn the same week Starr joined the Beatles in 1962, he met 16 year old hairdresser Maureen Cox. They married at Caxton Hall on 11 February 1965. Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon were all witnesses, while Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man. Their marriage became the subject of the novelty song \"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\" by the Chicklettes. The couple had three children: Zak (b. 13 September 1965), Jason (b. 19 August 1967) and Lee (b. 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's home Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. The couple divorced in 1975 following Starr's repeated infidelities, alcoholism, and volatile behaviour. Cox died from leukaemia at the age of 48 in December 1994.\nIn 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak is also a drummer, and he spent time with the Who's Keith Moon during his father's regular absences; he has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. Starr has eight grandchildren: two from Zak, three from Jason, and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.\nStarr met actress Barbara Bach in 1980 on the set of the film \"Caveman\", and they were married at Marylebone Town Hall on 27 April 1981. Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh in Surrey, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo. He was listed at number 56 in the \"Sunday Times Rich List 2011\" with an estimated personal wealth of \u00a3150\u00a0million. In 2012, he was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014, Starr announced that his Surrey estate at Rydinghurst at Cranleigh was for sale, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.\nIn December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=\"Julien/Property\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit, instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon, and Marc Bolan, and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \"0000001\". The auction raised over $9\u00a0million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach.\nIn 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. \"I thought the European Union was a great idea,\" he said, \"but I didn't see it going anywhere lately.\" In 2017, he described his impatience for Britain to \"get on with\" Brexit, declaring that \"to be in control of your country is a good move\".\nIn October 2021, Starr was named in the Pandora Papers, which alleged secret financial deals among politicians and celebrities using tax havens in an effort to avoid the payment of owed taxes.\nStarr is a vegetarian. Mary McCartney confirmed he is allergic to garlic and onions.&lt;ref name=\"Maclean/Independent\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He meditates daily, and his catchphrase and motto for life is \"peace and love\".\nAwards and honours.\nStarr and the other members of the Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Birthday Honours; they received their insignia from Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. He and the other Beatles were collectively nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for their performances in the 1964 film \"A Hard Day's Night\". In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film \"Let It Be\". The minor planet 4150 Starr, discovered on 31 August 1984 by Brian A. Skiff at the Anderson Mesa Station of the Lowell Observatory, was named in Starr's honour. Starr was nominated for a 1989 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series for his role as Mr. Conductor in the television series \"Shining Time Station\".\nIn 2015, 27 years after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the Beatles, Starr became the last Beatle to be inducted for a solo career. Unlike the other three Beatles who were inducted within the \"Performers\" category, Starr was inducted within the \"Musical Excellence\" category. During the 50th Grammy Awards, Starr, George Martin and his son Giles accepted the Best Compilation Soundtrack award for \"Love\". On 9 November 2008, Starr accepted a Diamond Award on behalf of the Beatles during the 2008 World Music Awards ceremony in Monaco. On 8 February 2010, he was honoured with the 2,401st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It is located at 1750 North Vine Street, in front of the Capitol Records building, as are the stars for Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.\nStarr was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music. He was knighted in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge on 20 March 2018.\nIn 2022, Starr received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music for his \"immeasurable impact on music, film and television, and popular culture\".\nFilm career.\nStarr has received praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him \"a superb actor, an absolute natural\". By the mid-1960s, Starr had become a connoisseur of film. In addition to his roles in \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964), \"Help!\" (1965), \"Magical Mystery Tour\" (1967) and \"Let It Be\" (1970), Starr also acted in \"Candy\" (1968), \"The Magic Christian\" (1969), \"Blindman\" (1971), \"Son of Dracula\" (1974) and \"Caveman\" (1981). In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's \"200 Motels\" and was featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film \"The Point!\" He co-starred in \"That'll Be the Day\" (1973) as a Teddy Boy and appeared in \"The Last Waltz\", the Martin Scorsese documentary film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band.\nStarr played the Pope in Ken Russell's \"Lisztomania\" (1975), and a fictionalised version of himself in McCartney's \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" in 1984. Starr appeared as himself and a downtrodden alter-ego Ognir Rrats in \"Ringo\" (1978), an American-made television comedy film based loosely on \"The Prince and the Pauper\". For the 1979 documentary film on the Who, \"The Kids Are Alright\", Starr appeared in interview segments with fellow drummer Keith Moon.\nDiscography.\nSince the breakup of the Beatles, Starr has released 21 solo studio albums:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25835", "revid": "38516105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25835", "title": "Rn (newsreader)", "text": "Software, news client\nrn (short for \"Read News\") is a Usenet newsreader written by Larry Wall and originally released in 1984. It was one of the first newsreaders to take full advantage of a character-addressable CRT terminal (codice_1 by Kenneth Almquist was first). Previous newsreaders, such as \"readnews\", were mostly line-oriented and designed for use on the printing terminals which were common on the early Unix minicomputers where the Usenet software and network originated. Later variants of the original \"rn\" program included \"rrn\", \"trn\", and \"strn\".\nFeatures.\n\"rn\" was also notable for three other features it introduced: Kill file, \"do the right thing\", and automatic configuration. \nA Kill file is a file (called, obviously enough, KILL) containing regular expressions matched against the subjects of news articles in each group. If an article matches, it is marked as having already been read. This feature was essential as the growth of the Usenet made it impossible to read every article in even a limited selection of newsgroups.\n\"Do the right thing\" introduced a fundamental change in user-interface from previous news software. Rather than require a user to navigate menus or learn a command vocabulary for each mode of the program, certain single-keystroke commands were used throughout the user interface to perform the most appropriate function based on context. For example, the space character will \"go on to the next thing\", and the \"next thing\" could be the next page, the next article, or the next newsgroup, depending on where the user is in the process of reading news.\nFinally, automatic configuration is a feature for system administrators \u2013 not visible to users \u2013 that allows for building and installing the application with relative ease. Most Unix programs, and in particular Usenet software, were (and still often are) distributed in source code form which requires building and installing before users can use it. Because different versions of Unix were organized differently, a system administrator required sufficient programming skill to modify the source code to account for these differences. \"rn\" changed that paradigm by including a script, called \"Configure\", with enough intelligence to customize the build and install process for the system it was running on. Since its introduction in the \"rn\" codebase, the pattern of including a similar configure script in any software distribution became and still is popular.\nHistory.\nLike all of the original newsreaders and the Usenet software itself, \"rn\" was designed for the environment of a large time-shared minicomputer, which users connected to using terminals wired directly to the machine, and where the only networks available were accessed by slow and expensive dial-up modem connections. All of the articles in all of the newsgroups were stored in files on the local disk (known as the \"news spool\"), and \"rn\" could simply read those files directly when presenting them to the user. When local area networks became widespread, it was natural that administrators and users would desire remote access to the news spool, and NNTP, the Network News Transfer Protocol, was developed to serve that need. While working at Baylor College of Medicine, Stan O. Barber developed \"remote rn\" (rrn), a set of patches to \"rn\" which allowed it to communicate with an NNTP server over a local-area (or even wide-area) network. Barber later took over maintenance responsibility for \"rn\" itself from Larry Wall.\nAs news volumes continued to increase, it became apparent that even KILL files could not possibly keep up with the sheer number of users and articles. A new concept, the \"threaded\" newsreader, was needed as users gradually switched from a \"read most, kill few\" model to \"ignore most, read few\". By organizing the articles in a newsgroup according to threads of discussion, using headers that had long been present in Usenet articles but practically unused, a threaded newsreader would allow users to keep up with topics and discussions they were interested without having to explicitly deselect uninteresting threads. Kim F. Storm's \"nn\" newsreader was the first to implement this new model, and it looked for a while as if \"nn\" would do to \"rn\" what \"rn\" did to \"readnews\". This fate was averted when Wayne Davison developed trn, a set of patches to \"rn\" which gave it both threading at the article level and a new user interface that would allow users to select only the threads they desired, while remaining true to the original \"rn\" interface philosophy of \"do the right thing\".\nAn even more recent addition to the \"rn\" family has been the addition of \"scoring\", which allows a more complex method of evaluating articles to determine whether the user wishes to read them; originally this was implemented in a code fork of \"trn\" called \"strn\", but later this was integrated into the official \"trn\" distribution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ek\u00e9us had a long career in diplomacy and international security. He began as a district court clerk before joining the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1962, with postings in Bonn, Nairobi, and The Hague. He played a key role in Sweden\u2019s UN delegation, serving as deputy representative on the Security Council and later as ambassador to the Disarmament Delegation in Geneva. From 1991 to 1997, he led the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq, overseeing disarmament efforts after the Gulf War.\nEk\u00e9us later served as Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the United States (1997\u20132000) and held influential positions in arms control, including membership in the Canberra Commission and the UN Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters. From 2001 to 2007, he served as OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities. He has since remained active in international security, including roles with SIPRI, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and the International Commission on Missing Persons.\nEarly life.\nEk\u00e9us was born on 7 July 1935 in Kristinehamn, Sweden, the son of Axel Eriksson, a teaching assistant, and his wife Margit (n\u00e9e Johansson). He earned a Candidate of Law degree from Stockholm University College in 1959.\nCareer.\nEk\u00e9us served as a district court clerk from 1959 to 1962 before joining the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as an attach\u00e9 in 1962. He was posted in Bonn from 1963 to 1965 and then served as embassy secretary in Nairobi from 1965 to 1967. In 1967, he became an administrative officer (\"kanslisekreterare\") at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and was appointed desk officer (\"departementssekreterare\") in 1970. From 1970 to 1974, he worked as secretary to the minister for foreign affairs.\nEk\u00e9us then served as first secretary at Sweden's UN delegation in New York City from 1974 to 1978 and was deputy representative for Sweden on the United Nations Security Council from 1975 to 1976. In 1978, he was appointed counselor at the Swedish Embassy in The Hague. He later became Sweden's ambassador to the Disarmament Delegation in Geneva in 1983 and Permanent Representative of Sweden to Military Negotiations in Vienna from 1989 to 1994.\nBetween 1991 and 1997 he was director of the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq, the United Nations disarmament observers in Iraq after the Gulf War. In late July 2002 he reportedly said in the \"Svenska Dagbladet\" newspaper that during his time in this position he attempted to resist attempts by the United States to use the commission to perform espionage. His successor as director was Richard Butler. The journalist Andrew Cockburn reported in \"The First Post\" that Ek\u00e9us told him how the former US President Bill Clinton attempted to prevent Saddam Hussein's Iraq from being certified as free of weapons of mass destruction. Despite Ek\u00e9us' belief that Iraq was nearly certifiable as being free of such weapons, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced that United Nations sanctions would not be lifted until such time as Hussein was no longer in power.\nAccording to the journalist Christopher Hitchens, Ek\u00e9us \"told me that he'd been offered by Tariq Aziz in person, to his face, a bribe of a million and a half dollars to change his inspection report.

He served as Sweden's ambassador to the United States from 1997 to 2000. In 1999, he became a member of the UN Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters, and in 2000, he joined the board of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\nIn January 2000, Ek\u00e9us was nominated to head the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), charged with investigating allegations that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. But Ek\u00e9us' name failed to receive the approval of the United Nations Security Council, due to the opposition of France, Russia and China, and so Hans Blix was appointed instead.\nEk\u00e9us was High Commissioner on National Minorities at the OSCE from 2001 till 2007, as well as on the board of directors for the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI).

He held office as the leader of the United Australia Party (UAP) in his first term, and subsequently as the inaugural leader of the Liberal Party of Australia in his second. He was the member of parliament (MP) for the Victorian division of Kooyong from 1934 to 1966. He is the longest-serving prime minister in Australian history.\nMenzies studied law at the University of Melbourne and became one of Melbourne's leading lawyers. He was Deputy Premier of Victoria from 1932 to 1934, and then transferred to Federal Parliament, subsequently becoming Attorney-General of Australia and Minister for Industry in the government of Joseph Lyons. In April 1939, following Lyons's death, Menzies was elected leader of the United Australia Party (UAP) and sworn in as prime minister. He authorised Australia's entry into World War II in September 1939, and spent four months in England to participate in meetings of Churchill's war cabinet. On his return to Australia in August 1941, Menzies found that he had lost the support of his party and consequently resigned as prime minister. He subsequently helped to create the new Liberal Party, and was elected its inaugural leader in August 1945.\nAt the 1949 federal election, Menzies led the Liberal\u2013Country coalition to victory and returned as prime minister. His appeal to the home and family, promoted via reassuring radio talks, matched the national zeitgeist as the economy grew and middle-class values prevailed; the Australian Labor Party's support had also been eroded by Cold War scares. After 1955, his government also received support from the Democratic Labor Party, a breakaway group from the Labor Party. Menzies won seven consecutive elections during his second period, eventually retiring as prime minister in January 1966. Despite the failures of his first administration, his government is remembered for its development of Australia's capital city of Canberra, its expanded post-war immigration scheme, emphasis on higher education, and national security policies, which saw Australia contribute troops to the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency, the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation, and the Vietnam War.\nEarly life.\nBirth and family background.\nRobert Gordon Menzies was born on 20 December 1894 at his parents' home in Jeparit, Victoria. He was the fourth of five children born to Kate (\"n\u00e9e\" Sampson) and James Menzies; he had two elder brothers, an elder sister Isabel, and a younger brother. Menzies was the first Australian prime minister to have two Australian-born parents: his father was born in Ballarat and his mother in Creswick. His grandparents on both sides had been drawn to Australia by the Victorian gold rush. His maternal grandparents were born in Penzance, Cornwall. His paternal grandfather, also named Robert Menzies, was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland, and arrived in Melbourne in 1854. The following year he married Elizabeth Band, the daughter of a cobbler from Fife. Menzies was proud of his Scottish heritage, and preferred his surname to be pronounced in the traditional Scottish manner ( ) rather than as it is spelled ( ). This gave rise to his nickname \"Ming\", which was later expanded to \"Ming the Merciless\" after the comic strip character. His middle name was given in honour of Charles George Gordon.\nThe Menzies family had moved to Jeparit, a small Wimmera township, in the year before Robert's birth. At the 1891 census, the settlement had a population of just 55 people. His elder siblings had been born in Ballarat, where his father was a locomotive painter at the Phoenix Foundry. Seeking a new start, he moved the family to Jeparit to take over the general store, which \"survived rather than prospered\". During Menzies's childhood, three of his close relatives were elected to parliament. His uncle Hugh was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1902, followed by his father in 1911, while another uncle, Sydney Sampson, was elected to the federal Australian House of Representatives in 1906. Each of the three represented rural constituencies, and were defeated after a few terms. Menzies's maternal grandfather John Sampson was active in the trade union movement. He was the inaugural president of the Creswick Miners' Association, which he co-founded with future Australian Labor Party MP William Spence, and was later prominent in the Amalgamated Miners' Association.\nChildhood.\nGrowing up, Menzies and his siblings \"had the normal enjoyments and camaraderies of a small country town\". He began his formal education in 1899 at the Jeparit State School, a single-teacher one-room school. When he was about eleven, he and his sister were sent to Ballarat to live with his paternal grandmother; his two older brothers were already living there. In 1906, Menzies began attending the Humffray Street State School in Bakery Hill. The following year, aged 13, he ranked first in the state-wide scholarship examinations. This feat financed the entirety of his secondary education, which had to be undertaken at private schools, as Victoria did not yet have a system of public secondary schools. In 1908 and 1909, Menzies attended Grenville College, a small private school in Ballarat Central. He and his family moved to Melbourne in 1910, where he enrolled in Wesley College. Menzies was \"not very interested in and certainly incompetent at sport\", but excelled academically. In his third and final year at Wesley he won a \u00a340 exhibition for university study, one of 25 awarded by the state government.\nUniversity.\nIn 1913, Menzies entered the Melbourne Law School. He won a variety of prizes, exhibitions, and scholarships during his time as a student, graduating as a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) in 1916 and a Master of Laws (LL.M.) in 1918. He did, however, fail Latin in his first year. One of his prize-winning essays, \"The Rule of Law During the War\", was published as a brochure with an introduction by Harrison Moore, the law school dean. In 1916, Menzies was elected president of the Student Representatives' Council and editor of the \"Melbourne University Magazine\". He wrote both prose and poetry for the magazine, and also contributed a song about \"little Billy Hughes\" to an end-of-year revue. Menzies was also president of the Students' Christian Union, a founding member of the Historical Society, and a prominent member of the Law Students' Society. He had \"a reputation as an \"unusually bright and articulate member of the undergraduate community\", and was known as a skilful debater. However, he had also begun to develop the traits of pomposity and arrogance that would cause difficulties later in his career. His fellow law student and future parliamentary colleague Percy Joske noted Menzies as a student \"did not suffer fools gladly [...] the trouble was that his opponents frequently were not fools and that he tended to say things that were not only cutting and unkind but that were unjustified\".\nDuring World War I, Menzies served his compulsory militia service in the Melbourne University Rifles (a part-time militia unit) from 1915 to 1919. This unit was not efficient and Menzies noted in his diary that training in even basic skills such as rifle shooting was sub-standard. He was commissioned a second lieutenant on 6 January 1915. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he did not volunteer for overseas service, something that would later be used against him by political opponents; in 1939 he described it as \"a stream of mud through which I have waded at every campaign in which I have participated\". Menzies never publicly addressed the reasons for his decision not to enlist, stating only that they were \"compelling\" and related to his \"intimate personal and family affairs\". His two older brothers did serve overseas. In a 1972 interview, his brother Frank Menzies recalled that a \"family conference\" had determined that Robert should not enlist. They believed that having two of the family's three adult sons serving overseas was a sufficiently patriotic contribution to the war effort, and that the family's interests would be served best by Robert continuing his academic career. Another reason for keeping one of the elder sons home was the health of their father, James, who was physically unwell and emotionally unstable at the time. It has been noted that, as a student, Menzies supported the introduction of compulsory overseas conscription, which if implemented would have made him one of the first to be conscripted. Promoted to lieutenant, he resigned his commission with effect from 16 February 1921.\nLegal career.\nAfter graduating from the University of Melbourne in 1916 with first-class honours in Law, Menzies was admitted to the Victorian Bar and to the High Court of Australia in 1918. Establishing his own practice in Melbourne, Menzies specialised chiefly in constitutional law which he had read with the leading Victorian jurist and future High Court judge, Sir Owen Dixon. In 1920, Menzies was an advocate for the Amalgamated Society of Engineers which eventually took its appeal to the High Court of Australia. The case became a landmark authority for the positive reinterpretation of Commonwealth powers over those of the States. The High Court's verdict raised Menzies's profile as a skilled advocate, and eventually he was appointed a King's Counsel in 1929.\nEarly career in politics.\nState politics.\nIn 1928, Menzies entered state parliament as a member of the Victorian Legislative Council from East Yarra Province, representing the Nationalist Party of Australia. He stood for constitutional democracy, the rule of law, the sanctity of contracts and the jealous preservation of existing institutions. Suspicious of the Labor Party, Menzies stressed the superiority of free enterprise except for certain public utilities such as the railways. His candidacy was nearly defeated when a group of ex-servicemen attacked him in the press for not having enlisted. Within weeks of his entry to parliament, he was made a minister without portfolio in a new minority Nationalist State government led by Premier William McPherson. The new government had formed when the previous Labor government lost the support of the cross-bench Country Progressives. The following year he shifted to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for the Electoral district of Nunawading. In 1929, he founded the Young Nationalists as his party's youth wing and was its first president. Holding the portfolios of Attorney-General and Minister for the Railways, Menzies was Deputy Premier of Victoria from May 1932 until July 1934.\nFederal politics.\nIn August 1934, Menzies resigned from state parliament to contest the federal Division of Kooyong in the upcoming general election for the United Australia Party (UAP), which was the result of a merger during his tenure as a state parliamentarian of the Nationalists, Labor dissidents and the Australian Party.\nThe previous member, John Latham, had given up the seat in order to prepare for appointment as Chief Justice of Australia. Kooyong was a safely conservative seat based on Kew, and Menzies won easily. He was immediately appointed Attorney-General of Australia and Minister for Industry in the government of Joseph Lyons. In late 1934 and early 1935 Menzies, then attorney-general, unsuccessfully prosecuted the government's highly controversial case for the attempted exclusion from Australia of Egon Kisch, a Czech Jewish communist. The initial prohibition on Kisch's entry to Australia, however, had not been imposed by Menzies but by the Country Party minister for the interior, Thomas Paterson. In 1937 Menzies was appointed a Privy Counsellor.\nMenzies had extended discussions with British experts on Germany in 1935, but could not make up his mind whether Adolf Hitler was a \"real German patriot\" or a \"mad swash-buckler\". He condemned Nazi antisemitism, writing to the organisers of an anti-Nazi protest at the Melbourne Town Hall in 1933 that \"I hope that I may be associated with the protest of the meeting tonight against the barbaric and medieval persecution to which their fellow Jews in Europe are apparently being subjected\". In July 1939, Menzies, by then prime minister, declared in a speech that \"history will label Hitler as one of the great men of the century\".\nIn August 1938, while Attorney-General, Menzies spent several weeks on an official visit to Nazi Germany. He was strongly committed to democracy for the British peoples, but he initially thought that the Germans should take care of their own affairs. He strongly supported the appeasement policies of the Chamberlain government in London, and sincerely believed that war could and should be avoided at all costs. after the visit to Germany in 1938, Menzies wrote that the \"abandonment by the Germans of individual liberty ... has something rather magnificent about it\". Menzies also praised the \"really spiritual quality in the willingness of Germans to devote themselves to the service and well-being of the state\".\nMenzies supported British foreign policy, including appeasement, and was initially reticent about the prospect of going to war with Germany. However, by September 1939 the unfolding crisis in Europe changed his public stance that the diplomatic efforts by Chamberlain and other leaders to broker a peace agreement had failed, and that war was now an inevitability. In his Declaration of War broadcast on 3 September 1939, Menzies explained the dramatic turn of events over the past twelve months necessitating this change of course: \nIn those past 12 months, what has happened? in cold-blooded breach of the solemn obligations implied in both the statements I have quoted, Hitler has annexed the whole of the Czechoslovak state. Has, without flickering an eyelid, made a pact with Russia, a country the denouncing and reviling of which has been his chief stock-in-trade ever since he became chancellor. And has now, under circumstances which I will describe to you, invaded with armed force and in defiance of civilised opinion, the independent nation of Poland. Your own comments on this dreadful history will need no reinforcement by me. All I need say is, that whatever the inflamed ambitions of the German F\u00fchrer may be, he will undoubtedly learn, as other great enemies of freedom have learned before, that no empire, no dominion, can be soundly established upon a basis of broken promises or dishonoured agreements. \nMenzies went on to say that if Hitler's expansionist policy \"were allowed to go unchecked there could be no security in Europe and there could be no just peace for the world\". However, in a letter written by Menzies on 11 September 1939, he privately urged for peace negotiations and the continuation of appeasement with Hitler.\nMeanwhile, on the domestic front, animosity developed between Sir Earle Page and Menzies which was aggravated when Page became acting prime minister during Lyons's illness after October 1938. Menzies and Page attacked each other publicly. He later became deputy leader of the UAP. His supporters began promoting him as Lyons's natural successor; his critics accused Menzies of wanting to push Lyons out, a charge he denied.\nIn 1938, as part of the Dalfram dispute, he was ridiculed as \"Pig Iron Bob\", the result of an industrial conflict with the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia whose members had refused to load Australian pig iron being sold to an arms manufacturer in the Empire of Japan, for that country's war against China. In 1939, he resigned from the Cabinet in protest at postponement of the national insurance scheme and insufficient expenditure on defence.\nFirst prime ministership.\nWith Lyons's sudden death on 7 April 1939, Page became caretaker prime minister until the UAP could elect a new leader. On 18 April 1939, Menzies was elected party leader over three other candidates. He was sworn in as prime minister eight days later.\nA crisis arose almost immediately, however, when Page refused to serve under him. In an extraordinary personal attack in the House, Page accused Menzies of cowardice for not having enlisted in the Great War, and of treachery to Lyons. Menzies then formed a minority government. When Page was deposed as Country Party leader a few months later, Menzies took the Country Party back into his government in a full-fledged Coalition, with Page's successor, Archie Cameron, as the number-two man in the government. \nLead-up to World War II.\nDuring the Danzig crisis, Menzies, who had long felt that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh towards Germany, supported having the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda\u0144sk) rejoin Germany. Though Hitler had only asked for extraterritorial highways across the Polish Corridor to link East Prussia with the rest of the \"Reich\", Menzies also supported having the Polish Corridor returned to Germany. Despite his support for the Germans' claims to Danzig, Menzies was opposed to the prospect of German domination of Europe. Menzies in a speech on 28 March 1939 declared: \"I do not accept this doctrine of an unimpeded march by Germany to a territorial conquest of middle and southeastern Europe\". Ultimately, the fear of Japan proved decisive for Menzies, who believed that for Australia to not support Britain in the Danzig crisis would lead to Britain eventually abandoning Australia to face Japan alone. The prospect of war in Europe threatened to undermine the Singapore strategy that called for the main British battle fleet to be sent out to Singapore (the major British naval base in Asia) in the event of a threat from Japan. A war with Germany would require the majority of the Royal Navy's ships to stay within European waters, and an inability to execute the Singapore strategy as planned was widely feared in Canberra to be a strong encouragement for Japan to strike south against Australia. However, Menzies had a strong faith in the ability of Neville Chamberlain to handle the Danzig crisis. Menzies believed that the crisis should and would be resolved by a Munich-type deal under which the Free City of Danzig would be peacefully allowed to \"go home to the \"Reich\"\" while at the same time Germany should and would be deterred from going to war against Poland. Though Menzies felt that Poland was in the wrong in opposing the return of the Free City to Germany, he did not want to see the crisis end with Poland being subjected to Germany.\nSeveral times, Menzies declared that there were \"two sides\" both equally worthy of consideration to the Danzig dispute. He dismissed the \"jitters\", as he called it, on the stock market in the summer of 1939 while he spoke of \"an outpouring of the sentiments of peace in the minds of the people\". Throughout the summer of 1939, Menzies stressed in his speeches that war was \"not inevitable\" as he urged Australians to enjoy their summer vacations. In the cabinet, Menzies was opposed to expanding the tiny Australian Army beyond its current size of 1,571 soldiers on economic grounds. The news of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of 22 August 1939 was greeted with both relief and concern in Menzies's cabinet. It was understood that the German-Soviet non-aggression pact ended the prospect of a \"peace front\" of Britain, France and the Soviet Union to deter Germany from invading Poland, and that war was more likely than not in Europe. Conversely, the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact had (temporarily as it proved) alienated Japan from Germany, and within the Australian cabinet, it was felt that Japan would be less likely to enter a war against the British Empire because of the German-Soviet agreement, which had come as a most unwanted surprise in Tokyo. In Tokyo, the failure to achieve an alliance with Germany alongside the shock of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact caused the Japanese prime minister Baron Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d to submit his resignation to the Emperor, which was accepted. The possibility that at least for the moment that Japan would stay neutral if the Danzig crisis led to war in Europe encouraged the cabinet in Canberra to stand by Britain.\nAt war.\nOn 3 September 1939 Britain and France declared war on Germany due to its invasion of Poland on 1 September, leading to the start of World War II. Menzies responded immediately by also declaring Australia to be at war in support of Britain, and delivered a radio broadcast to the nation on that same day, which began \"Fellow Australians. It is my melancholy duty to inform you officially that in consequence of a persistence by Germany in her invasion of Poland, Great Britain has declared war upon her and that, as a result, Australia is also at war.\" A couple of days after the declaration, Menzies recalled parliament and asked for general support as the government faced the enormous responsibility of leading the nation in war time. Page and Curtin, as party leaders, pledged their support for all that needed to be done for the defence of the country.\nThus, Menzies at the age of 44 found himself a wartime leader of a small nation of 7\u00a0million people. He was especially worried about the military threat from Japan. Australia had very small forces, and depended on Britain for defence against the looming threat of the Japanese Empire, with its 100\u00a0million people, a very powerful Army and Navy and an aggressive foreign policy. He hoped that a policy of appeasement would head off a war with Japan, and repeatedly pressured London. Menzies did his best to rally the country, but the bitter memories of the disillusionment which followed World War I made his task difficult; this was compounded by his lack of a service record. Furthermore, as attorney-general and deputy prime minister, he had made an official visit to Germany in 1938, when the official policy of the Australian government, supported by the Opposition, was strong support for Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement. Menzies, then also holding the responsibility for the Department of Munitions created a couple of months earlier, led the Coalition into the 1940 election and suffered an eight-seat swing, losing the slender majority he had inherited from Lyons. The result was a hung parliament, with the Coalition two seats short of a majority. Menzies managed to form a minority government with the support of two independent MPs, Arthur Coles and Alex Wilson. Labor, led by John Curtin, refused Menzies's offer to form a war coalition, and opposed using the Australian army for a European war, preferring to keep it at home to defend Australia. Labor agreed to participate in the Advisory War Council.\nStrategic debates.\nMenzies sent the bulk of the army to help the British in the Middle East and Singapore, and told Winston Churchill the Royal Navy needed to strengthen its Far Eastern forces. On 11 August 1940, Churchill sent a long letter to Menzies promising that if Japan entered the war, Britain would activate the Singapore strategy by sending a strong Royal Navy force to Singapore. Menzies continued to be worried about the fact that the Singapore base-despite being billed as the \"Gibraltar of the East\" was a base, not the fortress that it was presented as; about the shoddy state of the fortifications at Singapore; and about the lack of details in Churchill's promises. \nJust before the September 1940 election, on 13 August 1940, three members of Menzies's cabinet had been killed in an air crash\u2014the Canberra air disaster\u2014along with General Brudenell White, Chief of the General Staff; two other passengers and four crew. This event weakened Menzies's government. On the night of 11 November 1940, aircraft from the carriers of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean fleet disabled a number of Italian capital ships at anchor at the Italian base at Taranto. In December 1940, Menzies sent Churchill a letter expressing concern that the Imperial Japanese Navy might likewise use air power to cripple the Singapore base. In the same letter, Menzies asked Churchill to activate the Singapore strategy by stationing at least three or four capital ships at Singapore. In response, Churchill wrote back to Menzies that to say he would not have capital ships \"sitting idle\" at Singapore and that to transfer capital ships to Singapore would mean \"ruining the Mediterranean situation. This I am sure you would not want to do unless or until the Japanese danger became far more menacing than at present\". In March 1941 and again in August 1941, Menzies appealed to Churchill in letters to activate the Singapore strategy as he wrote that he was highly concerned about Japanese ambitions in the Asia-Pacific region.\nFrom 24 January 1941, Menzies spent four months in Britain discussing war strategy with Churchill and other Empire leaders, while his position at home deteriorated. \"En route\" to the UK he took the opportunity to stop over to visit Australian troops serving in the North African Campaign. On 20 February 1941, Churchill asked Menzies to give his approval to send the Australian forces in North Africa to Greece. Like many other Australians of his generation, Menzies was haunted by the memory of the Battle of Gallipoli-which came about because of Churchill's plans to send an Allied fleet up the Dardanelles-and he was highly suspicious of another of Churchill's plans for victory in the Mediterranean. On 25 February 1941, Menzies reluctantly gave his approval to send the 6th Division to Greece. Professor David Day, an Australian historian, has posited that Menzies might have replaced Churchill as British prime minister, and that he had some support in the UK for this. Support came from Viscount Astor, Lord Beaverbrook and former First World War Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who were trenchant critics of Churchill's purportedly autocratic style, and favoured replacing him with Menzies, who had some public support for staying on in the War Cabinet for the duration, which was strongly backed by Sir Maurice Hankey, former First World War Colonel and member of both the world wars' War Cabinets. Writer Gerard Henderson has rejected this theory, but history professors Judith Brett and Joan Beaumont support Day, as does Menzies's daughter, Heather Henderson, who claimed Lady Astor \"even offered all her sapphires if he would stay on in England\".\nMenzies came home to a hero's welcome. However, his support in Parliament was less certain. Not only did some Coalition MPs doubt his popularity in the electorate, but they also believed that a national unity government was the only long-term solution. Menzies's reputation was badly damaged by the failure of the Allied expedition to Greece, in which Australian troops played a prominent role. \"The Australian Worker\" newspaper in an editorial on 11 June 1941 attacked Menzies for having \"too readily acquiesced in the ill-starred Greek campaign, of which the Cretan misadventure was the inevitable sequel\u00a0... As a military adventure, it was madness. As a political gesture, it was stupid because it was doomed to failure.\" Menzies sought to blame General Sir Thomas Blamey for the Greek expedition as he maintained that he had only given permission to send the Australians to Greece after Blamey did not oppose it. Menzies maintained that if Blamey had given his disapproval in his opinion as a professional soldier, he would never have sent the Australians to Greece. Matters came to a head in August, when the cabinet voted to have Menzies return to London to speak for Australia's interests in the War Cabinet. However, since Labor and the Coalition were level (both sides had 36 MPs), Menzies needed the support of the Labor Party in order to travel to Britain. Amid rumours that Menzies's real intention was to launch a political career in Britain, Labor insisted that the crisis was too dire for Menzies to leave the country.\nDownfall.\nWith Labor unwilling to support him travelling to London and his position within his own party room weakening, Menzies called an emergency cabinet meeting. He announced his intention to resign and advise the Governor-General, Lord Gowrie to commission Curtin as prime minister. The Cabinet instead urged Menzies to make another overture to Labor for a national unity government, but Labor turned the offer down. With his position now untenable, Menzies resigned the prime ministership on 27 August 1941.\nA joint UAP-Country Party conference chose Country Party leader Arthur Fadden as Coalition leader\u2014and hence Prime Minister\u2014even though the Country Party was the junior partner in the Coalition. Menzies was bitter about this treatment from his colleagues, and nearly left politics, but was persuaded to become Minister for Defence Co-ordination in Fadden's cabinet. The Fadden government lasted only 40 days before being defeated on a confidence motion. On 9 October 1941, Menzies resigned as leader of the UAP after failing to convince his colleagues that he should become Leader of the Opposition in preference to Fadden. He was replaced as UAP leader by former prime minister Billy Hughes, who was 79 years old at the time.\nInterregnum.\nMenzies's \"Forgotten People\".\nDuring his time in the political wilderness Menzies built up a large popular base of support by his frequent appeals, often by radio, to ordinary non-elite working citizens whom he called 'the Forgotten People'\u2014especially those who were not suburban and rich or members of organised labour. From November 1941, he began a series of weekly radio broadcasts reaching audiences across New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. A selection of these talks was edited into a book bearing the title of his most famous address, \"The Forgotten People\", delivered on 22 May 1942. In this landmark address, Menzies appealed to his support base:\nI do not believe that the real life of this nation is to be found either in great luxury hotels and the petty gossip of so-called fashionable suburbs, or in the officialdom of the organised masses. It is to be found in the homes of people who are nameless and unadvertised, and who, whatever their individual religious conviction or dogma, see in their children their greatest contribution to the immortality of their race. The home is the foundation of sanity and sobriety; it is the indispensable condition of continuity; its health determines the health of society as a whole.\nMenzies himself described \"The Forgotten People\" collection as 'a summarised political philosophy'. Representing the blueprint of his liberal philosophy, \"The Forgotten People\" encompassed a wide range of topics including Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, the control of the war, the role of women in war and peace, the future of capitalism, the nature of democracy and especially the role of the middle class, 'the forgotten people' of the title and their importance to Australia's future as a democracy. The addresses frequently emphasised the values which Menzies regarded as critical to shaping Australia's wartime and postwar policies. These were essentially the principles of liberalism: individual freedom, personal and community responsibility, the rule of law, parliamentary government, economic prosperity and progress based on private enterprise and reward for effort.\nAfter losing the UAP leadership, Menzies moved to the backbench. Besides his overall sense of duty, the war would have made it nearly impossible for him to return to his legal practice in any event. Labor won a crushing victory at the 1943 election, taking 49 of 74 seats and 58.2 percent of the two-party-preferred vote as well as a Senate majority. The Coalition, which had sunk into near-paralysis in opposition, was knocked down to only 19 seats. Hughes resigned as UAP leader, and Menzies was elected as his successor on the second ballot, defeating three other candidates. The UAP also voted to end the joint opposition arrangement with the Country Party, allowing Menzies to replace Fadden as opposition leader.\nFormation of the Liberal Party.\nSoon after his return, Menzies concluded that the UAP was at the end of its useful life. Menzies called a conference of anti-Labor parties with meetings in Canberra on 13 October 1944 and again in Albury (NSW) in December 1944. At the Canberra conference, the fourteen parties, with the UAP as the nucleus, decided to merge as one new non-Labor party\u2014the Liberal Party of Australia. The organisational structure and constitutional framework of the new party was formulated at the Albury Conference. Officially launched at the Sydney Town Hall on 31 August 1945, the Menzies-led Liberal Party of Australia inherited the UAP's role as senior partner in the Coalition. Curtin died in office in 1945 and was succeeded by Ben Chifley.\nThe reconfigured Coalition faced its first national test in the 1946 election. It won 26 of 74 seats on 45.9 percent of the two-party vote and remained in minority in the Senate. Despite winning a seven-seat swing, the Coalition failed to make a serious dent in Labor's large majority.\n1949 election campaign.\nOver the next few years, however, the anti-communist atmosphere of the early Cold War began to erode Labor's support. In 1947, Chifley announced that he intended to nationalise Australia's private banks, arousing intense middle-class opposition which Menzies successfully exploited. In addition to campaigning against Chifley's bank nationalization proposal, Menzies successfully led the 'No' case for a referendum by the Chifley government in 1948 to extend commonwealth wartime powers to control rents and prices. In the election campaign of 1949, Menzies and his party were resolved to stamp out the communist movement and to fight in the interests of free enterprise against what they termed as Labor's 'socialistic measures'. If Menzies won office, he pledged to counter inflation, extend child endowment and end petrol rationing. With the lower house enlarged from 74 to 121 seats, the Menzies Liberal/Country Coalition won the 1949 election with 74 House seats and 51.0 percent of the two-party vote but remained in minority in the Senate. Whatever else Menzies's victory represented, his anti-communism and advocacy for free enterprise had captured a new and formidable support base in postwar Australian society.\nSecond prime ministership.\nAfter his election victory, Menzies returned to the office of prime minister on 19 December 1949.\nCold War and national security.\nThe spectre of communism and the threat it was deemed to pose to national security became the dominant preoccupation of the new government in its first phase. Menzies introduced legislation in 1950 to ban the Australian Communist Party, hoping that the Senate would reject it and give him a trigger for a double dissolution election, but Labor let the bill pass. It was subsequently ruled unconstitutional by the High Court. But when the Senate rejected his banking bill, he called a double dissolution election. At that election, the Coalition suffered a five-seat swing, winning 69 of 121 seats and 50.7 percent of the two-party vote. However, it won six seats in the Senate, giving it control of both chambers. Later in 1951 Menzies decided to hold a referendum on the question of changing the Constitution to permit the parliament to make laws in respect of Communists and Communism where he said this was necessary for the security of the Commonwealth. If passed, this would have given a government the power to introduce a bill proposing to ban the Communist Party. Chifley died a few months after the 1951 election. The new Labor leader, H. V. Evatt, campaigned against the referendum on civil liberties grounds, and it was narrowly defeated. Menzies sent Australian troops to the Korean War. \nEconomic conditions deteriorated in the early 1950s and Labor was confident of winning the 1954 election. Menzies engaged in red-baiting of political opponents.93 Shortly before the election, Menzies announced that a Soviet diplomat in Australia Vladimir Petrov, had defected, and that there was evidence of a Soviet spy ring in Australia, including members of Evatt's staff. Evatt felt compelled to state on the floor of Parliament that he'd personally written to Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, who assured him there were no Soviet spy rings in Australia, bringing the House into silence momentarily before both sides of Parliament laughed at Evatt's naivety.\nThis Cold War scare was claimed by some to enable the Menzies government to win the election. The Menzies government won 64 of 121 seats and 49.3 percent of the two-party vote. Evatt accused Menzies of arranging Petrov's defection. The aftermath of the 1954 election caused a split in the Labor Party, with several anti-Communist members from Victoria defecting to form the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist). The new party directed its preferences to the Liberals, with the Menzies government re-elected with an increased majority at the 1955 election. Menzies was re-elected almost as easily at the 1958 election, again with the help of preferences from what had become the Democratic Labor Party.\nForeign policy.\nThe Menzies era saw immense regional changes, with post-war reconstruction and the withdrawal of the old European Powers and the British Empire from the Far East (including independence for India and Indonesia). In response to these geopolitical developments, the Menzies government maintained strong ties with Australia's traditional allies such as Britain and the United States while also reorienting Australia's foreign policy focus towards the Asia Pacific. With his first Minister for External Affairs, Percy Spender, the Menzies government signed the ANZUS treaty in San Francisco on 1 September 1951. Menzies later told parliament that this security pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States was 'based on the utmost good will, the utmost good faith and unqualified friendship' saying 'each of us will stand by it'. At the same time as strengthening the alliance with the United States, Menzies and Spender were committed to Australia being on 'good neighbour terms' with the countries of South and Southeast Asia. To help forge closer ties in the region, the Menzies government initiated the Colombo Plan that would see almost 40,000 students from the region come to study in Australia over the four subsequent decades. Recognising the economic potential of a burgeoning postwar Japan, Menzies, together with Trade Minister Jack McEwan and his new minister for External Affairs, Richard Casey, negotiated the Commerce Agreement with Japan in 1957. This trade agreement was followed by bilateral agreements with Malaya in 1958 and Indonesia in 1959.\nEconomic policy.\nThroughout his second period in office, Menzies practised classical liberal economics with an emphasis on private enterprise and self-sufficiency in contrast to Labor's 'socialist objective'. Accordingly, the economic policy emphasis of the Menzies government moved towards tax incentives to release productive capacity, boosting export markets, research and undertaking public works to provide power, water and communications.\nIn 1951, the top marginal tax rate for incomes above \u00a310,000 (equivalent to $487,272.73 in 2022) was 75 per cent under Menzies; from 1955 until the mid-1980s, the top marginal tax rate was 67 per cent.\nSocial reform.\nIn 1949, Parliament legislated to ensure that all Aboriginal ex-servicemen should have the right to vote. In 1961 a Parliamentary Committee was established to investigate and report to the Parliament on Aboriginal voting rights, and in 1962, Menzies's \"Commonwealth Electoral Act\" provided that all Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections.\nIn 1960, the Menzies government introduced a new pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which expanded the range of prescribed medicines subsidised by the government. Other social welfare measures of the government included the extension of the Commonwealth Child Endowment scheme, the pensioner medical and free medicines service, the Aged Persons' Homes Assistance scheme, free provision of life-saving drugs; the provision of supplementary pensions to dependent pensioners paying rent; increased rates of pension, unemployment and sickness benefits, and rehabilitation allowances; and a substantial system of tax incentives and rewards. In 1961, the \"Matrimonial Causes Act\" introduced a uniform divorce law across Australia, provided funding for marriage counselling services and made allowances for a specified period of separation as sufficient grounds for a divorce.\nIn response to the decision by the Catholic Diocese of Goulburn in July 1962 to close its schools in protest at the lack of government assistance, the Menzies government announced a new package of state aid for independent and Catholic schools. Menzies promised five million pounds annually for the provision of buildings and equipment facilities for science teaching in secondary schools. Also promised were 10 000 scholarships to help students stay at school for the last two years with a further 2 500 scholarships for technical schools. Despite the historically firm Catholic support base of the Labor Party, the Opposition under Arthur Calwell opposed state aid before eventually supporting it with the ascension of Gough Whitlam as Labor leader.\nIn 1965, the Menzies government took the decision to end open discrimination against married women in the public service, by allowing them to become permanent public servants, and allowing female officers who were already permanent public servants to retain that status after marriage.\nImmigration policy.\nThe Menzies government maintained and indeed expanded the Chifley Labor government's postwar immigration scheme established by Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell in 1947. Beginning in 1949, Immigration Minister Harold Holt decided to allow 800 non-European war refugees to remain in Australia, and Japanese war brides to be admitted to Australia. In 1950, External Affairs Minister Percy Spender instigated the Colombo Plan, under which students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities, then in 1957, non-Europeans with 15 years' residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens. In a watershed legal reform, a 1958 revision of the Migration Act introduced a simpler system for entry and abolished the \"dictation test\" which had permitted the exclusion of migrants on the basis of their ability to take down a dictation offered in any European language. Immigration Minister Alick Downer announced that \"distinguished and highly qualified Asians\" might immigrate. Restrictions continued to be relaxed through the 1960s in the lead-up to the Holt government's watershed \"Migration Act, 1966\".\nThis was despite a discussion with radio 2UE's Stewart Lamb in 1955, in which Menzies was a defender of the White Australia policy:\n(Menzies) \"I don't want to see reproduced in Australia the kind of problem they have in South Africa or in America or increasingly in Great Britain. I think it's been a very good policy and it's been of great value to us and most of the criticism of it that I've ever heard doesn't come from these oriental countries it comes from wandering Australians.\n(Lamb) \"For these years of course in the past Sir Robert you have been described as a racist.\"\n(Menzies) \"Have I?\"\n(Lamb) \"I have read this, yes.\"\n(Menzies) \"Well if I were not described as a racist I'd be the only public man who hasn't been.\"\nHigher education expansion.\nThe Menzies government extended Federal involvement in higher education and introduced the Commonwealth scholarship scheme in 1951, to cover fees and pay a generous means-tested allowance for promising students from lower socioeconomic groups. In 1956, a committee headed by Sir Keith Murray was established to inquire into the financial plight of Australia's universities, and Menzies's pumped funds into the sector under conditions which preserved the autonomy of universities. In its support for higher education, the Menzies government tripled Federal government funding and provided emergency grants, significant increases in academic salaries, extra funding for buildings, and the establishment of a permanent committee, from 1961, to oversee and make recommendations concerning higher education.\nDevelopment of Canberra.\nThe Menzies government developed the city of Canberra as the national capital. In 1957, the Menzies government established the National Capital Development Commission as independent statutory authority charged with overseeing the planning and development of Canberra. During Menzies' time in office, the great bulk of the federal public service moved from the state capitals to Canberra.\nLater life.\nMenzies turned 71 in December 1965 and began telling others of his intention to retire in the new year. He informed cabinet of his decision on 19 January 1966 and resigned as leader of the Liberal Party the following day; Harold Holt was elected unopposed as his successor. Holt's swearing-in was delayed by the death of Defence Minister Shane Paltridge on 21 January. Menzies and Holt were pallbearers at Paltridge's state funeral in Perth on 25 January, before returning to Canberra where Menzies formally concluded his term on 26 January.\nMenzies's farewell press conference was the first political press conference telecast live in Australia. He resigned from Parliament on 17 February, ending 32 years in Parliament (most of them spent as either a cabinet minister or opposition frontbencher), a combined 25 years as leader of the non-Labor Coalition, and 38 years as an elected official. To date, Menzies is the last Australian prime minister to leave office on his or her own terms. He was succeeded as Liberal Party leader and prime minister by his former treasurer, Harold Holt. He left office at the age of 71 years, 1 month and 6 days, making him the oldest person ever to be prime minister. Although the coalition remained in power for almost another seven years (until the 1972 Federal election), it did so under four different prime ministers, in part due to his successor's death, only 22 months after taking office.\nOn his retirement he became the thirteenth chancellor of the University of Melbourne and remained the head of the university from March 1967 until March 1972. Much earlier, in 1942, he had received the first honorary degree of Doctor of Laws of Melbourne University. His responsibility for the revival and growth of university life in Australia was widely acknowledged by the award of honorary degrees in the Universities of Queensland, Adelaide, Tasmania, New South Wales, and the Australian National University and by thirteen universities in Canada, the United States and Britain, including Oxford and Cambridge. Many learned institutions, including the Royal College of Surgeons (Hon. FRCS) and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (Hon. FRACP), elected him to Honorary Fellowships, and the Australian Academy of Science, for which he supported its establishment in 1954, made him a fellow (FAAS) in 1958. On 7 October 1965, Menzies was installed as the ceremonial office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Constable of Dover Castle as appointed by the Queen, which included an official residence at Walmer Castle during his annual visits to Britain. At the end of 1966 Menzies took up a scholar-in-residence position at the University of Virginia. He presented a series of lectures, published the following year as \"Central Power in the Australian Commonwealth\". He later published two volumes of memoirs. In March 1967 he was elected Chancellor of Melbourne University, serving a five-year term. In 1971, Menzies suffered a severe stroke and was permanently paralysed on one side of his body for the remainder of his life. He suffered a second stroke in 1972. His official biographer, Lady McNicoll wrote after his death in \"The Australian\" that Menzies was \"splendid and sharp right up until the end\" also that \"each morning he underwent physiotherapy and being helped to face the day.\" In March 1977, Menzies accepted his knighthood of the Order of Australia (AK) from Queen Elizabeth in a wheelchair in the Long Room of the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the Centenary Test.\nPersonal life.\nOn 27 September 1920, Menzies married Pattie Leckie at Kew Presbyterian Church in Melbourne. Pattie Leckie was the eldest daughter of John Leckie, a Deakinite Commonwealth Liberal who was elected the member for the Electoral district of Benambra in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1913. Soon after their marriage, the Menzies bought the house in Howard Street, Kew, which would become their family home for 25 years. They had three surviving children: Kenneth (1922\u20131993), Robert Jr (known by his middle name, Ian; 1923\u20131974) and a daughter, Margery (known by her middle name, Heather; born 1928). Another child died at birth.\nKenneth was born in Hawthorn on 14 January 1922. He married Marjorie Cook on 16 September 1949, and had six children: Alec, Lindsay, Robert III, Diana, Donald, and Geoffrey. He died in Kooyong on 8 September 1993. Ian and Heather were both born in Kew, on 12 October 1923 and 3 August 1928, respectively. Ian was afflicted with an undisclosed illness for most of his life. He never married, nor had children, and died in 1974 in East Melbourne at the age of 50. Heather married Peter Henderson, a diplomat and public servant (working at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia at the time of their marriage, and serving as the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs from 1979 to 1984), on 1 May 1955. A daughter, Roberta, named after Menzies, was born in 1956.\nAccording to Mungo MacCallum, Menzies as prime minister engaged in an affair with Betty Fairfax, the first wife of Sir Warwick Oswald Fairfax. That claim was subsequently disputed by Gerard Henderson and Menzies's own family.\nDeath and funeral.\nMenzies died from a heart attack while reading in his study at his Haverbrack Avenue home in Malvern, Melbourne on 15 May 1978. Tributes from across the world were sent to the Menzies family. Notably among those were from Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia: \"I was distressed to hear of the death of Sir Robert Menzies. He was a distinguished Australian whose contribution to his country and the Commonwealth will long be remembered\", and from Malcolm Fraser, Prime Minister of Australia: \"All Australians will mourn his passing. Sir Robert leaves an enduring mark on Australian history.\"\nMenzies was accorded a state funeral, held in Scots' Church, Melbourne on 19 May, at which Prince Charles represented the Queen. Other dignitaries to attend included current and former Prime Ministers of Australia Malcolm Fraser, John McEwen, John Gorton and William McMahon (the two surviving Labor Prime Ministers, Frank Forde and Gough Whitlam, did not attend the funeral), as well as the Governor General of Australia, Sir Zelman Cowan. Former Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Wilson also attended.\nThe service was and is to this day one of the largest state funerals ever held in Australia, with over 100,000 people lining the streets of Melbourne from Scots' Church to Springvale Crematorium, where a private service was held for the Menzies family and a 19-gun salute was fired at the end of the ceremony. In July 1978, a memorial service was held for Menzies in the United Kingdom at Westminster Abbey. Sir Robert and Dame Pattie Menzies's ashes are interred in the 'Prime Ministers Garden' within the grounds of Melbourne General Cemetery.\nSome of Menzies's detractors also commemorated his passing in 1978, with a screenprinted poster, \"Pig Iron Bob / Dead at last\", designed by Chips Mackinolty from the Earthworks Poster Collective.\nReligious views.\nMenzies was the son of a Presbyterian-turned-Methodist lay preacher and imbibed his father's Protestant faith and values. During his studies at the University of Melbourne, Menzies was president of the Students' Christian Union. Proud of his Scottish Presbyterian heritage with a living faith steeped in the Bible, Menzies nonetheless preached religious freedom and non-sectarianism as the norm for Australia. Indeed, his cooperation with Australian Catholics on the contentious state aid issue was recognised when he was invited as guest of honour to the annual Cardinal's Dinner in Sydney in 1964, presided over by Cardinal Norman Gilroy.\nLegacy and assessment.\nMenzies was by far the longest serving Prime Minister of Australia, in office for a combined total of 18 years, five months and 12 days. His second period of 16 years, one month and seven days is by far the longest unbroken tenure in that office. During his second period he dominated Australian politics as no one else has ever done. He managed to live down the failures of his first period in office and to rebuild the conservative side of politics from the nadir it hit at the 1943 election. However, it can also be noted that while retaining government on each occasion, Menzies lost the two-party-preferred vote at three separate elections \u2013 in 1940, 1954 and 1961.\nHe was the only Australian prime minister to recommend the appointment of four governors-general (Viscount Slim, and Lords Dunrossil, De L'Isle, and Casey). Only two other prime ministers have ever chosen more than one governor-general.\nThe Menzies era saw Australia become an increasingly affluent society, with average weekly earnings in 1965 50% higher in real terms than in 1945. The increased prosperity enjoyed by most Australians during this period was accompanied by a general increase in leisure time, with the five-day workweek becoming the norm by the mid-1960s, together with three weeks of paid annual leave.\nSeveral books have been filled with anecdotes about Menzies. While he was speaking in Williamstown, Victoria, in 1954, a heckler shouted, \"I wouldn't vote for you if you were the Archangel Gabriel\"\u00a0\u2013 to which Menzies coolly replied, \"If I were the Archangel Gabriel, I'm afraid you wouldn't be in my constituency.\"\nJo Gullett, who first knew him as a family friend of his father, Henry Gullett, wartime Minister for External Affairs, and who later served under Menzies as a Liberal Party member of parliament himself in Canberra in the 1950s, offered this assessment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is difficult to exaggerate the pre-eminence enjoyed by Menzies for over a quarter of a century in the federal Parliament. He had many natural gifts, of which the greatest lay in the quality of his mind. His capacity to absorb and retain information, facts, opinion, prejudices was most unusual. He had a particularly logical mind, so that even in his conversation, let alone his set speeches and arguments, his remarks were always in sequence. Whether he was drawing on his memory, or making up his mind as he went along, each point he made reinforced the others and added to a logical and rounded whole. He spoke like this because it was the way he thought. He would have succeeded in anything that demands a logical intellect\u2014science, generalship, high finance, the control of great organisations ... He had a beautiful speaking voice, clear, resonant and flexible. His appearance was impressive. Finally he had most of the virtues his countrymen and women liked and respected. He was not greedy. \"I have never believed in making every bob (shilling) a prisoner,\" he once remarked to me. So he was generous. He was a good family man, a regular churchgoer. Yet he enjoyed a party, good food and drink, loved to watch the test cricket and was an Australian Rules football fan. He shared the tastes of the people he led. At the same time none was more able than he to touch chords of loyalty and pride in the traditions and history of the British people, especially that section of them who had settled in Australia. He made us proud of ourselves. We associated him with this pride.\nPlanning for an official biography of Menzies began soon after his death, but it was long delayed by Dame Pattie Menzies's protection of her husband's reputation and her refusal to co-operate with the appointed biographer. In 1991, the Menzies family appointed A. W. Martin to write a biography, which appeared in two volumes, in 1993 and 1999. In 2019, Troy Bramston, a journalist for \"The Australian\" and a political historian, wrote the first biography of Menzies since Martin's two volumes, titled \"Robert Menzies: The Art of Politics\". Bramston had access to previously unavailable Menzies family papers, conducted new interviews with Menzies' contemporaries and it was endorsed by Menzies' daughter, Heather Henderson. It was described as having \"the most attractive combination of research and readability\" of all the Menzies biographies. The National Museum of Australia in Canberra holds a significant collection of memorabilia relating to Robert Menzies, including a range of medals and civil awards received by Sir Robert such as his Jubilee and Coronation medals, Order of Australia, Order of the Companions of Honour and US Legion of Merit. There are also a number of special presentation items including a walking stick, cigar boxes, silver gravy boats from the Kooyong electorate and a silver inkstand presented by Queen Elizabeth II. Robert Menzies's personal library of almost 4,000 books is held at the University of Melbourne Library.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rather than starting from the early 14th-century \"ars nova\", the Trecento music was treated by musicology as a coda to medieval music and the new era dated from the rise of triadic harmony and the spread of the \"contenance angloise\" style from the British Isles to the Burgundian School. A convenient watershed for its end is the adoption of basso continuo at the beginning of the Baroque period.\nThe period may be roughly subdivided, with an early period corresponding to the career of Guillaume Du Fay (c.\u20091397\u20131474) and the cultivation of cantilena style, a middle dominated by Franco-Flemish School and the four-part textures favored by Johannes Ockeghem (1410s or '20s\u20131497) and Josquin des Prez (late 1450s\u20131521), and culminating during the Counter-Reformation in the florid counterpoint of Palestrina (c.\u20091525\u20131594) and the Roman School.\nMusic was increasingly freed from medieval constraints, and more variety was permitted in range, rhythm, harmony, form, and notation. On the other hand, rules of counterpoint became more constrained, particularly with regard to treatment of dissonances. In the Renaissance, music became a vehicle for personal expression. Composers found ways to make vocal music more expressive of the texts they were setting. Secular music absorbed techniques from sacred music, and vice versa. Popular secular forms such as the chanson and madrigal spread throughout Europe. Courts employed virtuoso performers, both singers and instrumentalists. Music also became more self-sufficient with its availability in printed form, existing for its own sake.\nPrecursor versions of many familiar modern instruments (including the violin, guitar, lute and keyboard instruments) developed into new forms during the Renaissance. These instruments were modified to respond to the evolution of musical ideas, and they presented new possibilities for composers and musicians to explore. Early forms of modern woodwind and brass instruments like the bassoon and trombone also appeared, extending the range of sonic color and increasing the sound of instrumental ensembles. During the 15th century, the sound of full triads became common, and towards the end of the 16th century the system of church modes began to break down entirely, giving way to functional tonality (the system in which songs and pieces are based on musical \"keys\"), which would dominate Western art music for the next three centuries.\nFrom the Renaissance era, notated secular and sacred music survives in quantity, including vocal and instrumental works and mixed vocal/instrumental works. A wide range of musical styles and genres flourished during the Renaissance, including masses, motets, madrigals, chansons, accompanied songs, instrumental dances, and many others. Beginning in the late 20th century, numerous early music ensembles were formed. Ensembles specializing in music of the Renaissance era give concert tours and make recordings, using modern reproductions of historical instruments and using singing and performing styles which musicologists believe were used during the era.\nOverview.\nThe main characteristics of Renaissance music are:\nThe development of polyphony produced the notable changes in musical instruments that mark the Renaissance musically from the Middle Ages. Its use encouraged the development of larger ensembles and demanded sets of instruments that would blend together across the whole vocal range.\nOne of the most pronounced features of early Renaissance European art music was the increasing reliance on the interval of the third and its inversion, the sixth. (In the Middle Ages, thirds and sixths had been considered dissonances; and consonances were derived only of the perfect intervals: the perfect fourth, the perfect fifth, the octave, and the unison). Polyphony\u2014the use of multiple, independent melodic lines played simultaneously\u2014became increasingly elaborate throughout the 14th century, with highly independent voices in both vocal music and instrumental music. The beginning of the 15th century showed simplification, with the composers often striving for smoothness in the melodic parts. This was possible because of a greatly increased vocal range in music. Previously, in the Middle Ages, the narrow vocal range necessitated frequent crossing of parts, thus requiring a greater contrast between them to distinguish the different parts. \nThe modal character of Renaissance music\u2014later replaced by the tonal approach developing in the subsequent Baroque music era\u2014began to break down towards the end of the (Renaissance) period with the increased use of root motions of fifths or fourths; (see Circle of fifths for details). An example of a chord progression in which the chord roots move by the interval of a fourth is the chord progression in the key of C Major: \"D minor/G Major/C Major\"\u2014these are all triads; three-note chords. The movement from the D minor chord to the G Major chord is an interval of a perfect fourth. The movement from the G Major chord to the C Major chord is also an interval of a perfect fourth. This later developed into one of the defining characteristics of tonality during the Baroque era.\nBackground.\nAs in the other arts, the music of the period was significantly influenced by the developments which define the Early Modern period: the rise of humanistic thought; the recovery of the literary and artistic heritage of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome; increased innovation and discovery; the growth of commercial enterprises; the rise of a bourgeois class; and the Protestant Reformation. From this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular, the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school.\nThe invention of the printing press in 1439 made it cheaper and easier to distribute music and music theory texts on a wider geographic scale and to more people. Prior to the invention of printing, written music and music theory texts had to be hand-copied, a time-consuming and expensive process. Demand for music as entertainment and as a leisure activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style which culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Orlande de Lassus, Thomas Tallis, William Byrd and Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria. Relative political stability and prosperity in the Low Countries, along with a flourishing system of music education in the area's many churches and cathedrals allowed the training of large numbers of singers, instrumentalists, and composers. These musicians were highly sought throughout Europe, particularly in Italy, where churches and aristocratic courts hired them as composers, performers, and teachers. Since the printing press made it easier to disseminate printed music, by the end of the 16th century, Italy had absorbed the northern musical influences with Venice, Rome, and other cities becoming centers of musical activity. This reversed the situation from a hundred years earlier. Opera, a dramatic staged genre in which singers are accompanied by instruments, arose at this time in Florence. Opera was developed as a deliberate attempt to resurrect the music of ancient Greece.\nGenres.\nPrincipal liturgical (church-based) musical forms, which remained in use throughout the Renaissance period, were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end of the era, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular (non-religious) musical forms (such as the madrigal) for religious use. The 15th and 16th century masses had two kinds of sources that were used: monophonic (a single melody line) and polyphonic (multiple, independent melodic lines), with two main forms of elaboration, based on \"cantus firmus\" practice or, beginning some time around 1500, the new style of \"pervasive imitation\", in which composers would write music in which the different voices or parts would imitate the melodic and/or rhythmic motifs performed by other voices or parts. Several main types of masses were used:\nMasses were normally titled by the source from which they borrowed. \"Cantus firmus\" mass uses the same monophonic melody, usually drawn from chant and usually in the tenor and most often in longer note values than the other voices. Other sacred genres were the madrigale spirituale and the laude.\nDuring the period, secular (non-religious) music had an increasing distribution, with a wide variety of forms, but one must be cautious about assuming an explosion in variety: since printing made music more widely available, much more has survived from this era than from the preceding medieval era, and probably a rich store of popular music of the late Middle Ages is lost. Secular music was music that was independent of churches. The main types were the German Lied, Italian frottola, the French chanson, the Italian madrigal, and the Spanish villancico. Other secular vocal genres included the caccia, rondeau, virelai, bergerette, ballade, musique mesur\u00e9e, canzonetta, villanella, villotta, and the lute song. Mixed forms such as the motet-chanson and the secular motet also appeared.\nPurely instrumental music included consort music for recorders or viols and other instruments, and dances for various ensembles. Common instrumental genres were the toccata, prelude, ricercar, and canzona. Dances played by instrumental ensembles (or sometimes sung) included the basse danse (It. \"bassadanza\"), tourdion, saltarello, pavane, galliard, allemande, courante, bransle, canarie, piva, and lavolta. Music of many genres could be arranged for a solo instrument such as the lute, vihuela, harp, or keyboard. Such arrangements were called intabulations (It. \"intavolatura\", Ger. \"Intabulierung\").\nTowards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the madrigal comedy, and the intermedio are heard.\nTheory and notation.\nAccording to Margaret Bent: \"Renaissance notation is under-prescriptive by our [modern] standards; when translated into modern form it acquires a prescriptive weight that overspecifies and distorts its original openness\". Renaissance compositions were notated only in individual parts; scores were extremely rare, and barlines were not used. Note values were generally larger than are in use today; the primary unit of beat was the semibreve, or whole note. As had been the case since the Ars Nova (see Medieval music), there could be either two or three of these for each breve (a double-whole note), which may be looked on as equivalent to the modern \"measure,\" though it was itself a note value and a measure is not. The situation can be considered this way: it is the same as the rule by which in modern music a quarter-note may equal either two eighth-notes or three, which would be written as a \"triplet.\" By the same reckoning, there could be two or three of the next smallest note, the \"minim,\" (equivalent to the modern \"half note\") to each semibreve.\nThese different permutations were called \"perfect/imperfect tempus\" at the level of the breve\u2013semibreve relationship, \"perfect/imperfect prolation\" at the level of the semibreve\u2013minim, and existed in all possible combinations with each other. Three-to-one was called \"perfect,\" and two-to-one \"imperfect.\" Rules existed also whereby single notes could be halved or doubled in value (\"imperfected\" or \"altered,\" respectively) when preceded or followed by other certain notes. Notes with black noteheads (such as quarter notes) occurred less often. This development of white mensural notation may be a result of the increased use of paper (rather than vellum), as the weaker paper was less able to withstand the scratching required to fill in solid noteheads; notation of previous times, written on vellum, had been black. Other colors, and later, filled-in notes, were used routinely as well, mainly to enforce the aforementioned imperfections or alterations and to call for other temporary rhythmical changes.\nAccidentals (e.g. added sharps, flats and naturals that change the notes) were not always specified, somewhat as in certain fingering notations for guitar-family instruments (tablatures) today. However, Renaissance musicians would have been highly trained in dyadic counterpoint and thus possessed this and other information necessary to read a score correctly, even if the accidentals were not written in. As such, \"what modern notation requires [accidentals] would then have been perfectly apparent without notation to a singer versed in counterpoint.\" (See musica ficta.) A singer would interpret his or her part by figuring cadential formulas with other parts in mind, and when singing together, musicians would avoid parallel octaves and parallel fifths or alter their cadential parts in light of decisions by other musicians. It is through contemporary tablatures for various plucked instruments that we have gained much information about which accidentals were performed by the original practitioners.\nFor information on specific theorists, see Johannes Tinctoris, Franchinus Gaffurius, Heinrich Glarean, Pietro Aron, Nicola Vicentino, Tom\u00e1s de Santa Mar\u00eda, Gioseffo Zarlino, Vicente Lusitano, Vincenzo Galilei, Giovanni Artusi, Johannes Nucius, and Pietro Cerone.\nEarly period (1400\u20131470).\nThe key composers from the early Renaissance era also wrote in a late medieval style, and as such, they are transitional figures. Leonel Power (c. 1370s or 1380s\u20131445) was an English composer of the late medieval and early Renaissance music eras. Along with John Dunstaple, he was one of the major figures in English music in the early 15th century. Power is the composer best represented in the \"Old Hall Manuscript\", one of the only undamaged sources of English music from the early 15th century. He was one of the first composers to set separate movements of the ordinary of the mass which were thematically unified and intended for contiguous performance. The Old Hall Manuscript contains his mass based on the Marian antiphon, Alma Redemptoris Mater, in which the antiphon is stated literally in the tenor voice in each movement, without melodic ornaments. This is the only cyclic setting of the mass ordinary which can be attributed to him. He wrote mass cycles, fragments, and single movements and a variety of other sacred works.\nJohn Dunstaple (c. 1390\u20131453) was an English composer of polyphonic music of the late medieval era and early Renaissance periods. He was one of the most famous composers active in the early 15th century, a near-contemporary of Power, and was widely influential, not only in England but on the continent, especially in the developing style of the Burgundian School.\nDunstaple's influence on the continent's musical vocabulary was enormous, particularly considering the relative paucity of his (attributable) works. He was recognized for possessing something never heard before in music of the Burgundian School: \"la contenance angloise\" (\"the English countenance\"), a term used by the poet Martin le Franc in his \"Le Champion des Dames.\" Le Franc added that the style influenced Dufay and Binchois. Writing a few decades later in about 1476, the Flemish composer and music theorist Tinctoris reaffirmed the powerful influence Dunstaple had, stressing the \"new art\" that Dunstaple had inspired. Tinctoris hailed Dunstaple as the \"fons et origo\" of the style, its \"wellspring and origin.\"\nThe \"contenance angloise\", while not defined by Martin le Franc, was probably a reference to Dunstaple's stylistic trait of using full triadic harmony (three note chords), along with a liking for the interval of the third. Assuming that he had been on the continent with the Duke of Bedford, Dunstaple would have been introduced to French \"fauxbourdon\"; borrowing some of the sonorities, he created elegant harmonies in his own music using thirds and sixths (an example of a third interval is the notes C and E; an example of a sixth interval is the notes C and A). Taken together, these are seen as defining characteristics of early Renaissance music. Many of these traits may have originated in England, taking root in the Burgundian School around the middle of the century.\nBecause numerous copies of Dunstaple's works have been found in Italian and German manuscripts, his fame across Europe must have been widespread. Of the works attributed to him only about fifty survive, among which are two complete masses, three connected mass sections, fourteen individual mass sections, twelve complete isorhythmic motets and seven settings of Marian antiphons, such as \"Alma redemptoris Mater\" and \"Salve Regina, Mater misericordiae\". Dunstaple was one of the first to compose masses using a single melody as \"cantus firmus.\" A good example of this technique is his \"Missa Rex seculorum\". He is believed to have written secular (non-religious) music, but no songs in the vernacular can be attributed to him with any degree of certainty.\nOswald von Wolkenstein (c. 1376\u20131445) is one of the most important composers of the early German Renaissance. He is best known for his well-written melodies, and for his use of three themes: travel, God and sex.\nGilles Binchois (c.\u20091400\u20131460) was a Dutch composer, one of the earliest members of the Burgundian school and one of the three most famous composers of the early 15th century. While often ranked behind his contemporaries Guillaume Dufay and John Dunstaple by contemporary scholars, his works were still cited, borrowed and used as source material after his death. Binchois is considered to be a fine melodist, writing carefully shaped lines which are easy to sing and memorable. His tunes appeared in copies decades after his death and were often used as sources for mass composition by later composers. Most of his music, even his sacred music, is simple and clear in outline, sometimes even ascetic (monk-like). A greater contrast between Binchois and the extreme complexity of the \"ars subtilior\" of the prior (fourteenth) century would be hard to imagine. Most of his secular songs are rondeaux, which became the most common song form during the century. He rarely wrote in strophic form, and his melodies are generally independent of the rhyme scheme of the verses they are set to. Binchois wrote music for the court, secular songs of love and chivalry that met the expectations and satisfied the taste of the Dukes of Burgundy who employed him, and evidently loved his music accordingly. About half of his extant secular music is found in the Oxford Bodleian Library.\nGuillaume Du Fay (c.\u20091397\u20131474) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the early Renaissance. The central figure in the Burgundian School, he was regarded by his contemporaries as the leading composer in Europe in the mid-15th century. Du Fay composed in most of the common forms of the day, including masses, motets, Magnificats, hymns, simple chant settings in fauxbourdon, and antiphons within the area of sacred music, and rondeaux, ballades, virelais and a few other chanson types within the realm of secular music. None of his surviving music is specifically instrumental, although instruments were certainly used for some of his secular music, especially for the lower parts; all of his sacred music is vocal. Instruments may have been used to reinforce the voices in actual performance for almost any of his works. Seven complete masses, 28 individual mass movements, 15 settings of chant used in mass propers, three Magnificats, two Benedicamus Domino settings, 15 antiphon settings (six of them Marian antiphons), 27 hymns, 22 motets (13 of these isorhythmic in the more angular, austere 14th-century style which gave way to more melodic, sensuous treble-dominated part-writing with phrases ending in the \"under-third\" cadence in Du Fay's youth) and 87 chansons definitely by him have survived.\nMany of Du Fay's compositions were simple settings of chant, obviously designed for liturgical use, probably as substitutes for the unadorned chant, and can be seen as chant harmonizations. Often the harmonization used a technique of parallel writing known as fauxbourdon, as in the following example, a setting of the Marian antiphon \"Ave maris stella\". Du Fay may have been the first composer to use the term \"fauxbourdon\" for this simpler compositional style, prominent in 15th-century liturgical music in general and that of the Burgundian school in particular. Most of Du Fay's secular (non-religious) songs follow the formes fixes (rondeau, ballade, and virelai), which dominated secular European music of the 14th and 15th centuries. He also wrote a handful of Italian ballate, almost certainly while he was in Italy. As is the case with his motets, many of the songs were written for specific occasions, and many are datable, thus supplying useful biographical information. Most of his songs are for three voices, using a texture dominated by the highest voice; the other two voices, unsupplied with text, were probably played by instruments.\nDu Fay was one of the last composers to make use of late-medieval polyphonic structural techniques such as isorhythm, and one of the first to employ the more mellifluous harmonies, phrasing and melodies characteristic of the early Renaissance. His compositions within the larger genres (masses, motets and chansons) are mostly similar to each other; his renown is largely due to what was perceived as his perfect control of the forms in which he worked, as well as his gift for memorable and singable melody. During the 15th century, he was universally regarded as the greatest composer of his time, an opinion that has largely survived to the present day.\nMiddle period (1470\u20131530).\nDuring the 16th century, Josquin des Prez (c.\u20091450/1455\u00a0\u2013 27 August 1521) gradually acquired the reputation as the greatest composer of the age, with his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame.\nIn England, the intense Marian tradition led to the English Votive Style of polyphony, characterised by high treble lines and long solo verses with melisma. Antiphons were usually performed at the end of the liturgical day after compline. The largest collection of the style is the late-15th-century \"Eton Choirbook\". By 1500, canticles, antiphons and Lady Masses were composed with up to nine parts in the texture, and vocal ranges and melodic complexity increased; Erasmus noted the powerful basses of the English choirs of the time, but criticised the excessively-virtuosic treble verses and he did not believe English music to be spiritually edifying as a result. \"In churches everywhere, there is a great deal of organ music and much singing; but the style of this music seems designed more to delight the ears than to inspire piety. [...] Boys, exercising their little voices, break out into shouts, with tremulous tones and undulating inflections up and down, doing nothing but distort the words so that you cannot understand what is being sung.\" \"- letter to Ulrich von Hutten (1519)\"Characteristics of the votive style, such as elaborate voice lines and melisma, began to be supplanted by more succinct continental traditions by the 1530s. Apart from a brief but strong revival in the 1550s with the reign of Queen Mary, the votive style died out due to its complexity, scale and devotional subject coming to odds with the ideals of the Edwardian and Elizabethan reformations. Former late proponents such as John Sheppard, Robert White and Thomas Tallis began composing in a more modern, imitative style of polyphony closer to that of the late period, such as in the Roman School. Nevertheless, the Tudor votive style had enduring influence in the Anglican church: choristers and lay clerks often face each other antiphonally, placed in the quire's \"Decani\" and \"Cantoris\", just as they did in the late Plantagenet and early Tudor periods.\nLate period (1530 \u20131600).\nIn Venice, from about 1530 until around 1600, an impressive polychoral style developed, which gave Europe some of the grandest, most sonorous music composed up until that time, with multiple choirs of singers, brass and strings in different spatial locations in the Basilica San Marco di Venezia (see Venetian School). These multiple revolutions spread over Europe in the next several decades, beginning in Germany and then moving to Spain, France, and England somewhat later, demarcating the beginning of what we now know as the Baroque musical era.\nThe Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music in Rome, spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. While best known as a prolific composer of masses and motets, he was also an important madrigalist. His ability to bring together the functional needs of the Catholic Church with the prevailing musical styles during the Counter-Reformation period gave him his enduring fame.\nThe brief but intense flowering of the musical madrigal in England, mostly from 1588 to 1627, along with the composers who produced them, is known as the English Madrigal School. The English madrigals were a cappella, predominantly light in style, and generally began as either copies or direct translations of Italian models. Most were for three to six voices.\n\"Musica reservata\" is either a style or a performance practice in a cappella vocal music of the latter half of the 16th century, mainly in Italy and southern Germany, involving refinement, exclusivity, and intense emotional expression of sung text.\nThe cultivation of European music in the Americas began in the 16th century soon after the arrival of the Spanish, and the conquest of Mexico. Although fashioned in European style, uniquely Mexican hybrid works based on native Mexican language and European musical practice appeared very early. Musical practices in New Spain continually coincided with European tendencies throughout the subsequent Baroque and Classical music periods. Among these New World composers were Hernando Franco, Antonio de Salazar, and Manuel de Zumaya.\nIn addition, writers since 1932 have observed what they call a \"seconda prattica\" (an innovative practice involving monodic style and freedom in treatment of dissonance, both justified by the expressive setting of texts) during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\nMannerism.\nIn the late 16th century, as the Renaissance era closed, an extremely manneristic style developed. In secular music, especially in the madrigal, there was a trend towards complexity and even extreme chromaticism (as exemplified in madrigals of Luzzaschi, Marenzio, and Gesualdo). The term \"mannerism\" derives from art history.\nTransition to the Baroque.\nBeginning in Florence, there was an attempt to revive the dramatic and musical forms of Ancient Greece, through the means of monody, a form of declaimed music over a simple accompaniment; a more extreme contrast with the preceding polyphonic style would be hard to find; this was also, at least at the outset, a secular trend. These musicians were known as the Florentine Camerata.\nWe have already noted some of the musical developments that helped to usher in the Baroque, but for further explanation of this transition, see antiphon, \"stile concertato\", monody, madrigal, and opera, as well as the works given under \"Sources and further reading.\"\nInstruments.\nMany instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be recreated in order to perform music of the period on authentic instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind.\nMedieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self-accompanied with a drone, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into \"haut\" (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and \"bas\" (quieter, more intimate instruments). Only two groups of instruments could play freely in both types of ensembles: the cornett and sackbut, and the tabor and tambourine.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, instruments were considered to be less important than voices. They were used for dances and to accompany vocal music. Instrumental music remained subordinated to vocal music, and much of its repertory was in varying ways derived from or dependent on vocal models.\nOrgans.\nVarious kinds of organs were commonly used in the Renaissance, from large church organs to small portatives and reed organs called regals.\nBrass.\nBrass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played:\nStrings.\nAs a family, strings were used in many circumstances, both sacred and secular. A few members of this family include:\nPercussion.\nSome Renaissance percussion instruments include the triangle, the Jew's harp, the tambourine, the bells, cymbals, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums.\nWoodwinds (aerophones).\nWoodwind instruments (aerophones) produce sound by means of a vibrating column of air within the pipe. Holes along the pipe allow the player to control the length of the column of air, and hence the pitch. There are several ways of making the air column vibrate, which ways define the subcategories of woodwind instruments. \nA player may blow across a mouth hole, as in a transverse flute, or into a whistle mouthpiece, as in a recorder (a duct flute); into a single-reed mouthpiece, as in a modern-day clarinet or saxophone; or into a double-reed mouthpiece, as in an oboe or bassoon.

The river begins in the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden in the southeastern Swiss Alps. It forms part of the Swiss-Liechtenstein border, then part of the Swiss-Austrian border. From Lake Constance downstream, it forms part of the Swiss-German border. After that the Rhine defines much of the Franco-German border. It then flows in a mostly northerly direction through the German Rhineland. Finally, the Rhine turns to flow predominantly west to enter the Netherlands, eventually emptying into the North Sea. It drains an area of 185,000\u00a0km2.\nIts name derives from the Gaulish \"R\u0113nos\". There are two German states named after the river, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, in addition to several districts (e.g. Rhein-Sieg). The departments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin in Alsace (France) are also named after the river. Some adjacent towns are named after it, such as Rheinau, Stein am Rhein, Rheineck, Rheinfelden (Switzerland) and Rheinfelden (Germany).\nThe International Commission for the Hydrology of the Rhine Basin (CHR) and EUWID contend that the river could experience a massive decrease in volume, or even dry up completely in case of drought, within the next 30 to 80 years, as a result of the climate crisis.\nThe Rhine is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about . It also contains the most powerful waterfall in Europe, the Rhine Falls.\nThe Rhine and the Danube comprised much of the Roman Empire's northern inland boundary, and the Rhine has been a vital navigable waterway bringing trade and goods deep inland since those days. The various castles and defenses built along it attest to its prominence as a waterway in the Holy Roman Empire. Among the largest and most important cities on the Rhine are Cologne, Rotterdam, D\u00fcsseldorf, Duisburg, Strasbourg, Arnhem, and Basel.\nName.\nThe variants of the name of the Rhine (Latin Rhenus; French Rhin, Italian Reno, Romansh Rain or Rein, Dutch Rijn, Alemannic Ry, Ripuarian Rhing) in modern languages are all derived from the Gaulish name , which was adapted in Roman-era geography (1st century BC) as Latin , and as Greek ().\nThe spelling with \"Rh-\" in English \"Rhine\" as well as in German and French is due to the influence of Greek orthography, while the vocalization \"-i-\" is due to the Proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name as , via Old Frankish giving Old English , Old High German , early Middle Dutch (c.\u20091200) (then also spelled or ).\nThe modern German diphthong (also used in Romansh) is a Central German development of the early modern period, with the Alemannic name keeping the older vocalism. In Alemannic, the deletion of the ending \"-n\" in pausa is a recent development; the form is largely preserved in Lucernese dialects. has in Ripuarian is diphthongized, as is in Palatine. While Spanish has adopted the Germanic vocalism , Italian, Occitan, and Portuguese have retained the Latin .\nThe Gaulish name (Proto-Celtic or pre-Celtic ) belongs to a class of river names built from the Proto-Indo-European root \"to move, flow, run\", also found in other names such as the Reno in Italy.\nThe grammatical gender of the Celtic name (as well as of its Greek and Latin adaptation) is masculine, and the name remains masculine in German, Dutch, French, Spanish and Italian. The Old English river name was variously inflected as masculine or feminine; and its Old Icelandic adoption was inflected as feminine.\nGeography.\nThe length of the Rhine is conventionally measured in \"Rhine-kilometers\" (\"Rheinkilometer\"), a scale introduced in 1939 that runs from the 0\u00a0km datum at Old Rhine Bridge in the city of Konstanz, at the western end of Lake Constance, to the Hook of Holland at 1,036.20\u00a0km.\nThe river is significantly shortened from its natural course due to a number of canal projects completed in the 19th and 20th centuries. The \"total length of the Rhine\", to the inclusion of Lake Constance and the Alpine Rhine is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as by the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat in 2010.\nIts course is conventionally divided as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHeadwaters and sources.\nSources.\nThe Rhine carries its name without distinctive accessories only from the confluence of the Rein Anteriur/Vorderrhein and Rein Posteriur/Hinterrhein next to Reichenau in Tamins. Above this point is the extensive catchment area of the headwaters of the Rhine. This area belongs almost exclusively to the Swiss canton of Grisons (), ranging from Saint-Gotthard Massif in the west via one valley lying in the canton of Ticino and Sondrio (Lombardy, Italy) in the south to the Fl\u00fcela Pass in the east. The Rhine is one of four major rivers taking their source in the Gotthard region, along with the Ticino (drainage basin of the Po), Rh\u00f4ne and Reuss (Rhine basin). The Witenwasserenstock is the triple watershed between the Rhine, Rh\u00f4ne and Po.\nTraditionally, Lake Toma near the Oberalp Pass in the Gotthard region is seen as the source of the Anterior Rhine and the Rhine as a whole. The Posterior Rhine rises in the Rheinwald below the Rheinwaldhorn.\nAnterior Rhine and Posterior Rhine.\nThe source of the river is generally considered north of \"Lai da Tuma/Tomasee\" on \"Rein Anteriur/Vorderrhein\", although its southern tributary \"Rein da Medel\" is actually longer before its confluence with the Anterior Rhine near Disentis.\nThe Anterior Rhine (, ) springs from \"Lai da Tuma/Tomasee\", near the Oberalp Pass and passes the impressive \"Ruinaulta\" formed by the largest visible rock slide in the alps, the Flims Rockslide.\nThe Posterior Rhine (, ) starts from the Paradies Glacier, near the \"Rheinwaldhorn\". One of its tributaries, the \"Reno di Lei\", drains the \"Valle di Lei\" on politically Italian territory. After three main valleys separated by the two gorges, \"Roflaschlucht\" and \"Viamala\", it reaches Reichenau in Tamins.\nThe Anterior Rhine arises from numerous source streams in the upper Surselva and flows in an easterly direction. One source is \"Lai da Tuma\" () with the \"Rein da Tuma\", which is usually indicated as source of the Rhine, flowing through it.\nInto it flow tributaries from the south, some longer, some equal in length, such as the \"Rein da Medel\", the \"Rein da Maighels\", and the \"Rein da Curnera\". The Cadlimo Valley in the canton of Ticino is drained by the \"Reno di Medel\", which crosses the geomorphologic Alpine main ridge from the south. All streams in the source area are partially, sometimes completely, captured and sent to storage reservoirs for the local hydro-electric power plants.\nThe culminating point of the Anterior Rhine's drainage basin is the Piz Russein of the T\u00f6di massif of the Glarus Alps at above sea level. It starts with the creek \"Aua da Russein\" (lit.: \"Water of the Russein\").\nIn its lower course, the Anterior Rhine flows through a gorge named \"Ruinaulta\" (Flims Rockslide). The whole stretch of the Anterior Rhine to the Alpine Rhine confluence next to Reichenau in Tamins is accompanied by a long-distance hiking trail called \"Senda Sursilvana\".\nThe Posterior Rhine flows first east-northeast, then north. It flows through the three valleys named Rheinwald, Schams and Domleschg-Heinzenberg. The valleys are separated by the Rofla Gorge and Viamala Gorge. Its sources are located in the Adula Alps (Rheinwaldhorn, Rheinquellhorn, and G\u00fcferhorn).\nThe Avers Rhine joins from the south. One of its headwaters, the \"Reno di Lei\" (stowed in the Lago di Lei), is partially located in Italy.\nNear Sils the Posterior Rhine is joined by the Albula, from the east, from the Albula Pass region. The Albula draws its water mainly from the Landwasser with the Dischmabach as the largest source stream, but almost as much from the Gelgia, which comes down from the Julier Pass.\nNumerous larger and smaller tributary rivers bear the name of the \"Rhine\" or equivalent in various Romansh idioms, including \"Rein\" or \"Ragn\", including:\nAlpine Rhine.\nNext to Reichenau in Tamins the Anterior Rhine and the Posterior Rhine join and form the Alpine Rhine. The river makes a distinctive turn to the north near Chur. This section is nearly 86\u00a0km long, and descends from a height of 599 meters to 396 meters. It flows through a wide glacial Alpine valley known as the Rhine Valley (). Near Sargan a natural dam, only a few meters high, prevents it from flowing into the open Sztal valley and then through Lake Walen and Lake Zurich into the Aare. The Alpine Rhine begins in the westernmost part of the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden, and later forms the border between Switzerland to the west and Liechtenstein and later Austria to the east.\nAs an effect of human work, it empties into Lake Constance on Austrian territory and not on the border that follows its old natural river bed called \"Alter Rhein\" (lit.\u2009'Old Rhine').\nThe mouth of the Rhine into Lake Constance forms an inland delta. The delta is delimited in the west by the \"Alter Rhein\" and in the east by the modern canalized section of the Alpine Rhine (). Most of the delta is a nature reserve and bird sanctuary. It includes the Austrian towns of Gai\u00dfau, H\u00f6chst and Fu\u00dfach. The natural Rhine originally branched into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments. In the local Alemannic dialect, the singular is pronounced \"Isel\" and this is also the local pronunciation of \"Esel\" (\"Donkey\"). Many local fields have an official name containing this element.\nA regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fu\u00dfach, in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta. The Dornbirner Ach had to be diverted, too, and it now flows parallel to the canalized Rhine into the lake. Its water has a darker color than the Rhine; the latter's lighter suspended load comes from higher up the mountains. It is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake. This has already happened to the former Lake Tuggenersee.\nThe cut-off Old Rhine at first formed a swamp landscape. Later an artificial ditch of about two km was dug. It was made navigable to the Swiss town of Rheineck.\nLake Constance.\nLake Constance () consists of three bodies of water: the Obersee (lit.\u2009'upper lake'), the Untersee (lit.\u2009'lower lake'), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the Seerhein (lit.\u2009'Rhine of the lake(s)'). The lake is situated in Germany, Switzerland and Austria near the Alps. Specifically, its shorelines lie in the German states of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, and the Swiss cantons of Schaffhausen, St. Gallen and Thurgau. The Rhine flows into it from the south following the Swiss-Austrian border. It is located at approximately .\nObersee.\nThe flow of cold, grey mountain water continues for some distance into the lake. The cold water flows near the surface and at first does not mix with the warmer, green waters of Upper Lake. But then, at the so-called , the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water. The flow reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau. The water then follows the northern shore until Hagnau am Bodensee. A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake \u00dcberlingen. Most of the water flows via the \"Constance Hopper\" into the (lit.\u2009'Rhine Gutter') and Seerhein. Depending on the water level, this flow of the Rhine water is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake.\nThe Rhine carries very large amounts of debris into the lake\u00a0\u2013 over annually. In the mouth region, it is therefore necessary to permanently remove gravel by dredging. The large sediment loads are partly due to the extensive land improvements upstream.\nThree countries border the Obersee, namely Switzerland in the south, Austria in the southeast and the German states of Bavaria in the northeast and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in the north and northwest.\nSeerhein.\nThe Seerhein is only long. It connects the Obersee with the lower Untersee. Distance markers along the Rhine measure the distance from the bridge in the old city center of Konstanz.\nFor most of its length, the Seerhein forms the border between Germany and Switzerland. The exception is the old city center of Konstanz, on the Swiss side of the river.\nThe Seerhein emerged in the last thousands of years, when erosion caused the lake level to be lowered by about . Previously, the two lakes formed a single lake, as the name still suggests.\nUntersee.\nLike in the Obersee, the flow the Rhine can be traced in the Untersee. Here, too, the river water is hardly mixed with the lake water. The northern parts of the Untersee (Lake Zell and Gnadensee) remain virtually unaffected by the flow. The river traverses the southern, which, in isolation, is sometimes called (lit.\u2009'Lake Rhine'). The \"Schweizerische Schifffahrtsgesellschaft Untersee und Rhein\" (URh) offers regular boat trips on Untersee.\nBesides the \"Seerhein\", the Radolfzeller Aach is the main tributary of \"Untersee\". It adds large amounts of water from the Danube system to the \"Untersee\" via the Danube Sinkhole.\nReichenau Island was formed at the same time as the Seerhein, when the water level fell to its current level.\nLake Untersee is part of the border between Switzerland and Germany, with Germany on the north bank and Switzerland on the south, except both sides are Swiss in Stein am Rhein, where the High Rhine flows out of the lake.\nHigh Rhine.\nThe High Rhine () begins in Stein am Rhein at the western end of the Untersee. Now flowing generally westwards, it passes over the Rhine Falls () below Schaffhausen before being joined\u00a0\u2013 near Koblenz in the canton of Aargau\u00a0\u2013 by its major tributary, the Aare. The Aare more than doubles the Rhine's water discharge, to an average of slightly more than , and provides more than a fifth of the discharge at the Dutch border. The Aare also contains the waters from the summit of Finsteraarhorn, the highest point of the Rhine basin.\nBetween Eglisau and Basel, the vast majority of its length, the High Rhine forms the border between Germany and Switzerland. Only for brief distances at its extremities does the river run entirely within Switzerland; at the eastern end it separates the bulk of the canton of Schaffhausen and the German exclave of B\u00fcsingen am Hochrhein on the northern bank from cantons of Z\u00fcrich and Thurgau, while at the western end it bisects the canton of Basel-Stadt. Here, at the Rhine knee, the river turns north and leaves Switzerland altogether.\nThe High Rhine is characterized by numerous dams. On the few remaining natural sections, there are still several rapids. Over its entire course from Lake Constance to the Swiss border at Basel the river descends from .\nThere are passenger boat lines on the lower High Rhine and between Schaffhausen and Kreuzlingen.\nUpper Rhine.\nIn the center of Basel, the first major city in the course of the stream, is the Rhine knee, a major bend, where the overall direction of the Rhine changes from west to north. Here the High Rhine ends. Legally, the Central Bridge is the boundary between High and Upper Rhine. The river now flows north as Upper Rhine through the Upper Rhine Plain, which is about 300\u00a0km long and up to 40\u00a0km wide. The most important tributaries in this area are the Ill below of Strasbourg, the Neckar in Mannheim and the Main across from Mainz. In Mainz, the Rhine leaves the Upper Rhine Valley and flows through the Mainz Basin.\nThe southern half of the Upper Rhine forms the border between France (Alsace) and Germany (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg). The northern part forms the border between the German states of Rhineland-Palatinate in the west on the one hand, and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse on the other hand, in the east and north. A curiosity of this border line is that the parts of the city of Mainz on the right bank of the Rhine were given to Hesse by the occupying forces in 1945.\nThe Upper Rhine was a significant cultural landscape in Central Europe already in antiquity and during the Middle Ages. Today, the Upper Rhine area hosts many important manufacturing and service industries, particularly in the centers Basel, Strasbourg and Mannheim-Ludwigshafen. Strasbourg is the seat of the European Parliament, and so one of the three European capitals is located on the Upper Rhine.\nThe Upper Rhine region was changed significantly by a Rhine straightening program in the 19th century. The rate of flow was increased and the ground water level fell significantly. Dead branches were removed by construction workers and the area around the river was made more habitable for humans on flood plains as the rate of flooding decreased sharply. On the French side, the Grand Canal d'Alsace was dug, which carries a significant part of the river water, and all of the traffic. In some places, there are large compensation pools, for example, the huge \"Bassin de compensation de Plobsheim\" in Alsace.\nThe Upper Rhine has undergone significant human change since the 19th century. While it was slightly modified during the Roman occupation, it was not until the emergence of engineers such as Johann Gottfried Tulla that significant modernization efforts changed the shape of the river. Earlier work under Frederick the Great surrounded efforts to ease shipping and construct dams to serve coal transportation. Tulla is considered to have domesticated the Upper Rhine, a domestication that served goals such as reducing stagnant bogs that fostered waterborne diseases, making regions more habitable for human settlement, and reduce high frequency of floods. Not long before Tulla went to work on widening and straightening the river, heavy floods caused significant loss of life. Four diplomatic treaties were signed among German state governments and French regions dealing with the changes proposed along the Rhine, one was \"the Treaty for the Rectification of the Rhine flow from Neuberg to Dettenheim\"(1817), which surrounded states such as Bourbon France and the Bavarian Palatinate. Loops, oxbows, branches and islands were removed along the Upper Rhine so that there would be uniformity to the river. The engineering of the Rhine was not without protest, farmers and fishermen had grave concerns about valuable fishing areas and farmland being lost. While some areas lost ground, other areas saw swamps and bogs be drained and turned into arable land. Johann Tulla had the goal of shortening and straightening the Upper Rhine. Early engineering projects the Upper Rhine also had issues, with Tulla's project at one part of the river creating rapids, after the Rhine cut down from erosion to sheer rock. Engineering along the Rhine eased flooding and made transportation along the river less cumbersome. These state projects were part of the advanced and technical progress going on in the country alongside the industrial revolution. For the German state, making the river more predictable was to ensure development projects could easily commence.\nThe section of the Upper Rhine downstream from Mainz is also known as the \"Island Rhine\". Here a number of river islands occur, locally known as \"Rheinauen\".\nMiddle Rhine.\nThe Rhine is the longest river in Germany. It is here that the Rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries, such as the Neckar, the Main and, later, the Moselle, which contributes an average discharge of more than . Northeastern France drains to the Rhine via the Moselle; smaller rivers drain the Vosges and Jura Mountains uplands. Most of Luxembourg and a very small part of Belgium also drain to the Rhine via the Moselle. As it approaches the Dutch border, the Rhine has an annual mean discharge of and an average width of .\nBetween Bingen am Rhein and Bonn, the Middle Rhine flows through the Rhine Gorge, a formation which was created by erosion. The rate of erosion equaled the uplift in the region, such that the river was left at about its original level while the surrounding lands raised. The gorge is quite deep and is the stretch of the river which is known for its many castles and vineyards. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (2002) and known as \"the Romantic Rhine\", with more than 40\u00a0castles and fortresses from the Middle Ages and many quaint and lovely country villages.\nThe Mainz Basin ends in Bingen am Rhein; the Rhine continues as \"Middle Rhine\" into the Rhine Gorge in the Rhenish Slate Mountains. In this sections the river falls from 77.4\u00a0m above sea level to 50.4\u00a0m. On the left, is located the mountain ranges of Hunsr\u00fcck and Eifel, on the right Taunus and Westerwald. According to geologists, the characteristic narrow valley form was created by erosion by the river while the surrounding landscape was lifted (see water gap).\nMajor tributaries in this section are the Lahn and the Moselle. They join the Rhine near Koblenz, for the right and left respectively. Almost the entire length of the Middle Rhine runs in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.\nThe dominant economic sectors in the Middle Rhine area are viniculture and tourism. The Rhine Gorge between R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein and Koblenz is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Near Sankt Goarshausen, the Rhine flows around the famous rock Lorelei. With its outstanding architectural monuments, the slopes full of vines, settlements crowded on the narrow river banks and scores of castles lined up along the top of the steep slopes, the Middle Rhine Valley can be considered the epitome of the Rhine romanticism.\nLower Rhine.\nIn Bonn, where the Sieg flows into the Rhine, the Rhine enters the North German Plain and turns into the Lower Rhine. The Lower Rhine falls from 50\u00a0m to 12\u00a0m. The main tributaries on this stretch are the Ruhr and the Lippe. Like the Upper Rhine, the Lower Rhine used to meander until engineering created a solid river bed. Because the levees are some distance from the river, at high tide the Lower Rhine has more room for widening than the Upper Rhine.\nThe Lower Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia. Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized, in particular the agglomerations Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Ruhr area. Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation in Germany, the Rhine-Ruhr region. One of the most important cities in this region is Duisburg with the largest river port in Europe (Duisport). The region downstream of Duisburg is more agricultural. In Wesel, 30\u00a0km downstream of Duisburg, is located the western end of the second east\u2013west shipping route, the Wesel-Datteln Canal, which runs parallel to the Lippe. Between Emmerich and Cleves the Emmerich Rhine Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in Germany, crosses the river. Near Krefeld, the river crosses the Uerdingen line, the line which separates the areas where Low German and High German are spoken. The Rhine River is crossed by several ferries, including the one between Bad Honnef and Rolandseck, where the Lohfelderf\u00e4hre district is situated.\nUntil the early 1980s, industry was a major source of water pollution. Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Duisburg. Duisburg is the home of Europe's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam. The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields. The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water. It contributes to the Rhine. Other rivers in the Ruhr Area include the Emscher.\nDelta.\nThe Dutch name for Rhine is \"Rijn\". The Rhine turns west and enters the Netherlands, where, together with the rivers Meuse and Scheldt, it forms the extensive Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta, with the largest river delta in Europe. Crossing the border into the Netherlands at Spijk, close to Nijmegen and Arnhem, the Rhine is at its widest, although the river then splits into three main distributaries: the Waal, Nederrijn (\"Nether Rhine\") and IJssel.\nFrom here, the situation becomes more complicated, as the Dutch name \"Rijn\" no longer coincides with the main flow of water. Two-thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west, through the Waal and then, via the Merwede and Nieuwe Merwede (De Biesbosch), merging with the Meuse, through the Hollands Diep and Haringvliet estuaries, into the North Sea. The Beneden Merwede branches off, near Hardinxveld-Giessendam and continues as the Noord, to join the Lek, near the village of Kinderdijk, to form the Nieuwe Maas; then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Het Scheur and the Nieuwe Waterweg, to the North Sea. The Oude Maas branches off, near Dordrecht, farther down rejoining the Nieuwe Maas to form Het Scheur.\nThe other third of the water flows through the Pannerdens Kanaal and redistributes in the IJssel and Nederrijn. The IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow of the \"Rhine\" north into the IJsselmeer (a former bay), while the Nederrijn carries approximately two-ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the Waal. However, at Wijk bij Duurstede, the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek. It flows farther west, to rejoin the Noord into the Nieuwe Maas and to the North Sea.\nThe name \"Rijn\", from here on, is used only for smaller streams farther to the north, which together formed the main river Rhine in Roman times. Though they retained the name, these streams no longer carry water from the Rhine, but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders. From Wijk bij Duurstede, the old north branch of the Rhine is called Kromme Rijn (\"Bent Rhine\") past Utrecht, first Leidse Rijn (\"Rhine of Leiden\") and then, Oude Rijn (\"Old Rhine\"). The latter flows west into a sluice at Katwijk, where its waters can be discharged into the North Sea. This branch once formed the line along which the Limes Germanicus were built. During periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages, the Rhine took a left turn, creating the Channel River, the course of which now lies below the English Channel.\nThe Rhine-Meuse Delta, the most important natural region of the Netherlands begins near Millingen aan de Rijn, close to the Dutch-German border with the division of the Rhine into Waal and Nederrijn. The region between the Dutch-German border and Rotterdam, where the Waal, Lek, and Meuse run more or less parallel, is colloquially known as the \"Great Rivers\". Since the Rhine contributes most of the water, the shorter term \"Rhine Delta\" is commonly used. However, this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance, so it is clearer to call the larger one \"Rhine-Meuse delta\", or even \"Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta\", as the Scheldt ends in the same delta.\nThe shape of the Rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations: first, at Millingen aan de Rijn, the Rhine splits into Waal and Pannerdens Kanaal, which changes its name to Nederrijn at Angeren, and second near Arnhem, the IJssel branches off from the Nederrijn. This creates three main flows, two of which change names rather often. The largest and southern main branch begins as Waal and continues as Boven Merwede (\"Upper Merwede\"), Beneden Merwede (\"Lower Merwede\"), Noord (\"the North\"), Nieuwe Maas (\"New Meuse\"), Het Scheur (\"the Rip\") and Nieuwe Waterweg (\"New Waterway\"). The middle flow begins as Nederrijn, then changes into Lek, then joins the Noord, thereby forming Nieuwe Maas. The northern flow keeps the name IJssel until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer. Three more flows carry significant amounts of water: the Nieuwe Merwede (\"New Merwede\"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Boven to Beneden Merwede; the Oude Maas (\"Old Meuse\"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Beneden Merwede into Noord, and Dordtse Kil, which branches off from Oude Maas.\nBefore the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421), the Meuse flowed just south of today's line Merwede-Oude Maas to the North Sea and formed an archipelago-like estuary with Waal and Lek. This system of numerous bays, estuary-like extended rivers, many islands and constant changes of the coastline, is hard to imagine today. From 1421 to 1904, the Meuse and Waal merged further upstream at Gorinchem to form Merwede. For flood protection reasons, the Meuse was separated from the Waal through a lock and diverted into a new outlet called \"Bergse Maas\", then Amer and then flows into the former bay Hollands Diep.\nThe northwestern part of the estuary (around Hook of Holland), is still called \"Maasmond\" (\"Meuse Mouth\"), ignoring the fact that it now carries only water from the Rhine. This might explain the confusing naming of the various branches.\nThe hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta's main arms, disconnected arms (Hollandse IJssel, Linge, Vecht, etc.) and smaller rivers and streams. Many rivers have been closed (\"dammed\") and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders. The construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th century fundamentally. Currently Rhine water runs into the sea, or into former marine bays now separated from the sea, in five places, namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede, Nieuwe Waterway (Nieuwe Maas), Dordtse Kil, Spui and IJssel.\nThe Rhine-Meuse Delta is a tidal delta, shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers, but also by tidal currents. This meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea. Before the construction of the Delta Works, tidal influence was palpable up to Nijmegen, and even today, after the regulatory action of the Delta Works, the tide acts far inland. At the Waal, the most landward tidal influence can be detected between Brakel and Zaltbommel.\nGeologic history.\nAlpine orogeny.\nThe Rhine flows from the Alps to the North Sea Basin. The geography and geology of its present-day watershed has been developing since the Alpine orogeny began.\nIn southern Europe, the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, with the opening of the Tethys Ocean, between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, between about 240\u00a0MBP and 220\u00a0MBP (million years before present). The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180\u00a0MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.\nIn northern Europe, the North Sea Basin had formed during the Triassic and Jurassic periods and continued to be a sediment receiving basin since. In between the zone of Alpine orogeny and North Sea Basin subsidence, highlands resulting from an earlier orogeny (Variscan) remained, such as the Ardennes, Eifel and Vosges.\nFrom the Eocene onward, the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused a north\u2013south rift system to develop in this zone. The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben, in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment, in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands. By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben, that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river. At that time, it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps; instead, the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps.\nStream capture.\nThe watershed of the Rhine reaches into the Alps today, but it did not start out that way. In the Miocene period, the watershed of the Rhine reached south, only to the Eifel and Westerwald hills, about north of the Alps. The Rhine then had the Sieg as a tributary, but not yet the Moselle. The northern Alps were then drained by the Danube.\nThrough stream capture, the Rhine extended its watershed southward. By the Pliocene period, the Rhine had captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains, including the Main and the Neckar. The northern Alps were then drained by the Rhone. By the early Pleistocene period, the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed from the Rh\u00f4ne, including the Aare. Since that time, the Rhine has added the watershed above Lake Constance (Vorderrhein, Hinterrhein, Alpenrhein; captured from the Rh\u00f4ne), the upper reaches of the Main, beyond Schweinfurt and the Moselle in the Vosges Mountains, captured during the Saale Ice-age from the Meuse, to its watershed.\nAround 2.5\u00a0million years ago (ending 11,600 years ago) the Ice Ages began. Since approximately 600,000\u00a0years ago, six major glacial periods have occurred, in which sea level dropped as much as and much of the continental margins were exposed. In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000\u00a0yr\u00a0BP, marine oxygen isotope stage\u00a012), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the River Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine. During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas in what is now the Netherlands.\nThe most recent glacial period ran from ~74,000 (BP = Before Present), until the end of the Pleistocene (~11,600\u00a0BP). In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000\u00a0BP and around 29,000\u201324,000\u00a0BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately lower than today.\nMost of the Rhine's current course was not under the ice during the last Ice Age; although, its source must still have been a glacier. A tundra, with Ice Age flora and fauna, stretched across middle Europe, from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean. Such was the case during the Last Glacial Maximum, ca. 22,000\u201314,000\u00a0yr\u00a0BP, when ice-sheets covered Scandinavia, the Baltics, Scotland and the Alps, but left the space between as open tundra. Loess (wind-blown topsoil dust) arose from the south and North Sea plain settling on the slopes of the Alps, Urals and the Rhine Valley, rendering the valleys facing the prevailing winds especially fertile.\nEnd of the last glacial period.\nAs northwest Europe slowly began to warm from 22,000 years ago onward, frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring. Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension. Rapid warming and changes of vegetation, to open forest, began about 13,000\u00a0BP. By 9000\u00a0BP, Europe was fully forested. With globally shrinking ice-cover, ocean water levels rose and the English Channel and North Sea re-inundated. Meltwater, adding to the ocean and land subsidence, drowned the former coasts of Europe transgressionally.\nAbout 11000 years ago, the Rhine estuary was in the Strait of Dover. There remained some dry land in the southern North Sea, known as Doggerland, connecting mainland Europe to Britain. About 9000 years ago, that last divide was overtopped / dissected. Humans were already resident in the area when these events happened.\nSince 7500 years ago the situation of tides, currents and land-forms has resembled the present. Rates of sea level rise dropped such that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes widely compensate for transgression by the sea. In the southern North Sea, due to ongoing tectonic subsidence, the coastline and sea bed are sinking at the rate of about per century (1\u00a0meter or 39\u00a0inches in last 3000\u00a0years).\nAbout 7000\u20135000 BP, a general warming encouraged migration of all former ice-locked areas, including up the Danube and down the Rhine by peoples to the east. A sudden massive expansion of the Black Sea as the Mediterranean Sea burst into it through the Bosporus may have occurred about 7500\u00a0BP.\nHolocene delta.\nAt the beginning of the Holocene (~11,700 years ago), the Rhine occupied its Late-Glacial valley. As a meandering river, it reworked its ice-age floodplain. As sea-level rise continued in the Netherlands, the formation of the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta began (~8,000\u00a0years ago). Coeval absolute sea-level rise and tectonic subsidence have strongly influenced delta evolution. Other factors of importance to the shape of the delta are the local tectonic activities of the Peel Boundary Fault, the substrate and geomorphology, as inherited from the Last Glacial period and the coastal-marine dynamics, such as barrier and tidal inlet formations.\nSince ~3000 yr BP (= years Before Present), human impact is seen in the delta. As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This has caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. In the geologically recent past the main process distributing sediment across the delta has been the shifting of river channels to new locations on the floodplain (termed avulsion). Over the past 6000\u00a0years, approximately 80\u00a0avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta began with the mining of peat for salt and fuel from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11\u201313th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were straightened and groynes were built to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up.\nAt present, the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea through the former Meuse estuary, near Rotterdam. The river IJssel branch flows to the north and enters the IJsselmeer (formerly the Zuider Zee), initially a brackish lagoon but a freshwater lake since 1932. The discharge of the Rhine is divided into three branches: the Waal (6/9 of total discharge), the Nederrijn \u2013 Lek (2/9 of total discharge) and the IJssel (1/9 of total discharge). This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709 by river engineering works including the digging of the Pannerdens Kanaal and the installation, in the 20th century, of a series of weirs on the Nederrijn.\nMilitary and cultural history.\nAntiquity.\nThe Rhine was not known to Herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century BC in Roman-era geography. At that time, it formed the boundary between Gaul and Germania. \"It is estimated that Germanic tribes have been inhabiting the area since 2000 BCE.\"\nThe Upper Rhine had been part of the areal of the late Hallstatt culture since the 6th century BC, and by the 1st century BC, the areal of the La T\u00e8ne culture covered almost its entire length, forming a contact zone with the Jastorf culture, i.e. the locus of early Celtic-Germanic cultural contact.\nIn Roman geography, the Rhine formed the boundary between \"Gallia\" and \"Germania\" by definition; e.g. Maurus Servius Honoratus, \"Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil\" (8.727) \"(Rhenus) fluvius Galliae, qui Germanos a Gallia dividit\" \"(The Rhine is a) river of Gaul, which divides the Germanic people from Gaul.\"\nIn Roman geography, the Rhine and Hercynia Silva were considered the boundary of the civilized world; as it was a wilderness, the Romans were eager to explore it. This view is typified by \"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\", a long public inscription of Augustus, in which he boasts of his exploits; including, sending an expeditionary fleet north of the Rheinmouth, to Old Saxony and Jutland, which he claimed no Roman had ever done before.\nAugustus ordered his stepson Roman general Drusus to establish 50 military camps along the Rhine, starting the Germanic Wars in 12 BC. At this time, the plain of the Lower Rhine was the territory of the Ubii. The first urban settlement, on the grounds of what is today Downtown Cologne, along the Rhine, was \"Oppidum Ubiorum\", which was founded in 38\u00a0BC by the Ubii. Cologne became acknowledged, as a city by the Romans in AD\u00a050, by the name of \"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\".\nFrom the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70, Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg. The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards.\nThe Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine. The number was reduced to four as more units were moved to the Danube. The actual number of legions present at any base or in all, depended on whether a state or threat of war existed. Between about AD\u00a014 and 180, the assignment of legions was as follows:\nFor the army of Germania Inferior, two legions at Vetera (Xanten), \"I Germanica\" and \"XX Valeria\" (Pannonian troops); two legions at oppidum Ubiorum (\"town of the Ubii\"), which was renamed to Colonia Agrippina, descending to Cologne, \"V Alaudae\", a Celtic legion recruited from Gallia Narbonensis and \"XXI\", possibly a Galatian legion from the other side of the empire.\nFor the army of Germania Superior: one legion, \"II Augusta\", at Argentoratum (Strasbourg); and one, \"XIII Gemina\", at Vindonissa (Windisch). Vespasian had commanded II\u00a0Augusta, before he became emperor. In addition, were a double legion, XIV and XVI, at Moguntiacum (Mainz).\nThe two original military districts of Germania Inferior and Germania Superior, came to influence the surrounding tribes, who later respected the distinction in their alliances and confederations. For example, the upper Germanic peoples combined into the Alemanni. For a time, the Rhine ceased to be a border, when the Franks crossed the river and occupied Roman-dominated Celtic Gaul, as far as Paris.\nGermanic tribes crossed the Rhine in the Migration period, by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine, Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia on the High Rhine. This \"Germanic Heroic Age\" is reflected in medieval legend, such as the which tells of the hero Siegfried killing a dragon on the Drachenfels (Siebengebirge) (\"dragons rock\"), near Bonn at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court at Worms, at the Rhine and Kriemhild's golden treasure, which was thrown into the Rhine by Hagen.\nMedieval and modern history.\nBy the 6th century, the Rhine was within the borders of Francia. In the 9th, it formed part of the border between Middle and Eastern Francia, but in the 10th century, it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire, flowing through Swabia, Franconia and Lower Lorraine. The mouths of the Rhine, in the county of Holland, fell to the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th century; Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states. The Alsace on the left banks of the Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469 and eventually fell to France in the Thirty Years' War. The numerous historic castles in Rhineland-Palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route.\nSince the Peace of Westphalia, the Upper Rhine formed a contentious border between France and Germany. Establishing \"natural borders\" on the Rhine was a long-term goal of French foreign policy, since the Middle Ages, though the language border was \u2013 and is \u2013 far more to the west. French leaders, such as Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte, tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine. The Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon, as a French client state, in 1806 and lasted until 1814, during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the First French Empire. In 1840, the Rhine crisis, prompted by French prime minister Adolphe Thiers's desire to reinstate the Rhine as a natural border, led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in Germany. \nThe Rhine became an important symbol in German nationalism during the formation of the German state in the 19th century (see Rhine romanticism).\nAt the end of World War I, the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles. This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies, until 1935 and after that, it would be a demilitarized zone, with the German army forbidden to enter. The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision, in general, caused much resentment in Germany. The Allies' troops left the Rhineland in 1930 and, following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, the German army re-occupied it in 1936, which proved an enormously popular action in Germany. Although the Allies could probably have prevented the reoccupation, Britain and France were not inclined to do so, a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler.\nIn World War II, it was recognized that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the Western Allies. The Rhine bridge at Arnhem, immortalized in the book, \"A Bridge Too Far\" and the film, was a central focus of the battle of Arnhem, during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944. The bridges at Nijmegen, over the Waal distributary of the Rhine, were also an objective of Operation Market Garden. In a separate operation, the Ludendorff Bridge, crossing the Rhine at Remagen, became famous, when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact \u2013 much to their own surprise \u2013 after the Germans failed to demolish it. This also became the subject of a film, \"The Bridge at Remagen\".\n\"Seven Days to the River Rhine\" was a Warsaw Pact war plan for an invasion of Western Europe during the Cold War.\nUntil 1932, the generally accepted length of the Rhine was . In 1932 the German encyclopedia Knaurs Lexikon stated the length as , presumably a typographical error. \nAfter this number was placed into the authoritative Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die, it became generally accepted and found its way into numerous textbooks and official publications. The error was discovered in 2010, and the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat confirms the length at .\nLists of features.\nCities on the Rhine.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCountries and borders.\nDuring its course from the Alps to the North Sea, the Rhine passes through four countries and constitutes six different country borders.

The area today lies in Germany. Rungholt was flooded, with massive erosion, when a storm tide (known as \"Grote Mandrenke\" or \"Den Store Manddrukning\") hit the coast on 15 or 16 January 1362.\nLocation.\nRungholt was situated on the island of Strand, which was largely destroyed by the Burchardi Flood of 1634; remaining fragments include the Nordstrand peninsula and the islets of Hallig S\u00fcdfall, Pellworm and Nordstrandischmoor, while the rest now forms tidal flats in the surrounding Wadden Sea.\nIn 1921, ruins believed to represent Rungholt were discovered around Hallig S\u00fcdfall: wells, trenches and part of a tidal lock. In June 2023, the German Research Foundation announced that researchers had confirmed this identification, and had already mapped 10 square kilometers of the area including key features such as a church. Detailed archeological investigations of the remains of buildings, dykes and a harbour have been published.\nHistory.\nDocuments about Rungholt mostly date from much later times (16th century). Archaeologists think Rungholt was an important town and port. It might have contained up to 500 houses, with about 3,000 people. Findings indicate trade in agricultural products and possibly amber.\nThe great storm known as the \"Grote Mandrenke\" (\"Store Manddrukning\"), sometimes also named after the saint Marcellus, occurred on 15 or 16 January 1362. Estimates put the number of deaths at around 25,000. Possibly 30 settlements were destroyed, and the coastline shifted east, leaving formerly inhabited land in the tidal Wadden Sea.\nThe vulnerability of the settlement to the storm tide has been attributed to agricultural development: \"It was like a natural landscape of peat bogs and fenland. It was very uninhabitable, and they completely colonized it. They completely changed the landscape,\" ... \"Once you remove all this peat and get the water out, you have very, very rich soils that are perfect for agriculture [but] \"with rising sea levels and increasing storminess, one day these dikes they built were not sufficient enough, and these settlements just drowned.\"\nLegends and later reception.\nSometimes referred to as the \"Atlantis of the North Sea\", the Rungholt of legend was a large, rich town, with the catastrophe supposedly a divine punishment for the sins of its inhabitants.\nImpressed by the fate of the town, the relics, and not least the legends' excessive descriptions, the German poet Detlev von Liliencron wrote the 1882 poem \"Trutz, Blanke Hans\" about the lost town, which begins: \"Heut bin ich \u00fcber Rungholt gefahren, die Stadt ging unter vor sechshundert Jahren.\" (\"Today I traveled over Rungholt; the town sank 600 years ago.\").\nThe Sinbadventurers (German: Die Hamburger Sindbadauken) is an opera for children composed by Benjamin Gordon with a libretto by Francis H\u00fcsers. It was commissioned by the Hamburg State Opera and was first performed on February 8, 2015. In the opera, three children set out to discover the lost gold of Rungholt. In the Interlude before the final act, the main character, Lotte, tries desperately to warn the citizens of Rungholt of their impending destruction by reciting verses from Liliencron's ballad. \nGerman singer Achim Reichel put Liliencron's poem to music on his 1977 album \"Regenballade\".\nGerman band Santiano released a song called \"Rungholt\" in their 2015 CD \"Von Liebe, Tod und Freiheit\". It also includes verses from von Liliencron's poem.\nTheodor Storm mentions Rungholt in his novella \"Eine Halligfahrt\".\nChristian Kracht mentions Rungholt in his novella \"Faserland\".\nThe Danish writer Dorothea Petersen mentions Rungholt in her historical novel \"Havets rytter\".\nUrsula Hegi mentions Rungholt in her 2020 novel \"The Patron Saint of Pregnant Girls\".\nLocal myth has it that one can still hear the church bells of Rungholt ringing underwater when sailing through the area on a calm night.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "25852", "revid": "50609751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25852", "title": "Rice's theorem", "text": "Theorem in computability theory\nIn computability theory, Rice's theorem states that all non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable. A \"semantic\" property is one about the program's behavior (for instance, \"does the program terminate for all inputs?\"), unlike a syntactic property (for instance, \"does the program contain an if-then-else statement?\"). A \"non-trivial\" property is one that is neither true for every program, nor false for every program.\nThe theorem generalizes the undecidability of the halting problem. It has far-reaching implications on the feasibility of static analysis of programs. It implies that it is impossible, for example, to implement a tool that checks whether any given program is correct, or even executes without error (it is possible to implement a tool that always overestimates or always underestimates, so in practice one has to decide what is less of a problem).\nThe theorem is named after Henry Gordon Rice, who proved it in his doctoral dissertation of 1951 at Syracuse University.\nIntroduction.\nRice's theorem puts a theoretical bound on which types of static analysis can be performed automatically. One can distinguish between the syntax of a program, and its semantics. The syntax is the detail of how the program is written, or its \"intension\", and the semantics is how the program behaves when run, or its \"extension\". Rice's theorem asserts that it is impossible to decide a property of programs that depends only on the semantics and not on the syntax, unless the property is trivial (true of all programs, or false of all programs).\nBy Rice's theorem, it is impossible to write a program that automatically verifies for the absence of bugs in other programs, taking a program and a specification as input, and checking whether the program satisfies the specification.\nThis does not imply an impossibility to prevent \"certain types\" of bugs. For example, Rice's theorem implies that in dynamically typed programming languages that are Turing-complete, it is impossible to verify the absence of type errors. On the other hand, statically typed programming languages feature a type system that statically prevents type errors. In essence, this should be understood as a feature of the \"syntax\" (taken in a broad sense) of those languages. In order to type check a program, its source code must be inspected; the operation does not depend merely on the hypothetical semantics of the program.\nIn terms of general software verification, this means that although one cannot algorithmically check whether any given program satisfies a given specification, one can require programs to be annotated with extra information that proves the program is correct, or to be written in a particular restricted form that makes the verification possible, and only accept programs that are verified in this way. In the case of type safety, the former corresponds to type annotations, and the latter corresponds to type inference. Taken beyond type safety, this idea leads to correctness proofs of programs through proof annotations such as in Hoare logic.\nAnother way of working around Rice's theorem is to search for methods that catch \"many\" bugs, without being complete. This is the theory of abstract interpretation.\nYet another direction for verification is model checking, which can only apply to finite-state programs, not to Turing-complete languages.\nFormal statement.\nLet formula_1 be an admissible numbering of the partial computable functions, and let formula_2 be a subset of formula_3. Suppose that:\nThen formula_2 is undecidable.\nA more concise statement can be made in terms of index sets: The only decidable index sets are formula_13 and formula_3.\nExamples.\nGiven a program \"P\" that takes a natural number \"n\" and returns a natural number \"P\"(\"n\"), the following questions are undecidable:\nProof by Kleene's recursion theorem.\nAssume for contradiction that formula_2 is a non-trivial, extensional and computable set of natural numbers. Since formula_2 is non-trivial, there is a natural number formula_17 and a natural number formula_18. Define the total computable function formula_19 of formula_20 and formula_21 by formula_22 when formula_23 and formula_24 when formula_25. By Kleene's recursion theorem, there exists formula_20 such that formula_27. Then, if formula_23, we have formula_29, contradicting the extensionality of formula_2 since formula_18, and conversely, if formula_25, we have formula_33, which again contradicts extensionality since formula_17.\nProof by reduction from the halting problem.\nProof sketch.\nSuppose, for concreteness, that we have an algorithm for examining a program \"p\" and determining infallibly whether \"p\" is an implementation of the squaring function, which takes an integer \"d\" and returns \"d\"2. The proof works just as well if we have an algorithm for deciding any other non-trivial property of program behavior (i.e. a semantic and non-trivial property), and is given in general below.\nThe claim is that we can convert our algorithm for identifying squaring programs into one that identifies functions that halt. We will describe an algorithm that takes inputs \"a\" and \"i\" and determines whether program \"a\" halts when given input \"i\".\nThe algorithm for deciding this is conceptually simple: it constructs (the description of) a new program \"t\" taking an argument \"n\", which (1) first executes program \"a\" on input \"i\" (both \"a\" and \"i\" being hard-coded into the definition of \"t\"), and (2) then returns the square of \"n\". If \"a\"(\"i\") runs forever, then \"t\" never gets to step (2), regardless of \"n\". Then clearly, \"t\" is a function for computing squares if and only if step (1) terminates. Since we have assumed that we can infallibly identify programs for computing squares, we can determine whether \"t\", which depends on \"a\" and \"i\", is such a program; thus we have obtained a program that decides whether program \"a\" halts on input \"i\". Note that our halting-decision algorithm never executes \"t\", but only passes its description to the squaring-identification program, which by assumption always terminates; since the construction of the description of \"t\" can also be done in a way that always terminates, the halting-decision cannot fail to halt either.\n halts (a,i) {\n define t(n) {\n a(i)\n return n\u00d7n\n return is_a_squaring_function(t)\nThis method does not depend specifically on being able to recognize functions that compute squares; as long as \"some\" program can do what we are trying to recognize, we can add a call to \"a\" to obtain our \"t\". We could have had a method for recognizing programs for computing square roots, or programs for computing the monthly payroll, or programs that halt when given the input codice_1; in each case, we would be able to solve the halting problem similarly.\nFormal proof.\nFor the formal proof, algorithms are presumed to define partial functions over strings and are themselves represented by strings. The partial function computed by the algorithm represented by a string \"a\" is denoted F\"a\". This proof proceeds by reductio ad absurdum: we assume that there is a non-trivial property that is decided by an algorithm, and then show that it follows that we can decide the halting problem, which is not possible, and therefore a contradiction.\nLet us now assume that \"P\"(\"a\") is an algorithm that decides some non-trivial property of F\"a\". Without loss of generality we may assume that \"P\"(\"no-halt\") = \"no\", with \"no-halt\" being the representation of an algorithm that never halts. If this is not true, then this holds for the algorithm \"P\" that computes the negation of the property \"P\". Now, since \"P\" decides a non-trivial property, it follows that there is a string \"b\" that represents an algorithm F\"b\" and \"P\"(\"b\") = \"yes\". We can then define an algorithm \"H\"(\"a\", \"i\") as follows:\n1. construct a string \"t\" that represents an algorithm \"T\"(\"j\") such that\n* \"T\" first simulates the computation of F\"a\"(\"i\"),\n* then \"T\" simulates the computation of F\"b\"(\"j\") and returns its result.\n2. return \"P\"(\"t\").\nWe can now show that \"H\" decides the halting problem:\nSince the halting problem is known to be undecidable, this is a contradiction and the assumption that there is an algorithm \"P\"(\"a\") that decides a non-trivial property for the function represented by \"a\" must be false."}

They imposed punishments such as fines, property confiscation and imprisonment on recusants. The suspension under Oliver Cromwell was mainly intended to give relief to Nonconformist Protestants rather than to Catholics, to whom some restrictions applied into the 1920s, through the Act of Settlement 1701, despite the 1828\u20131829 Catholic emancipation.\nIn some cases those adhering to Catholicism faced capital punishment, and some English and Welsh Catholics who were executed in the 16th and 17th centuries have been canonised by the Catholic Church as martyrs of the English Reformation.\nToday, \"recusant\" applies to the descendants of Catholic families of the British gentry and aristocracy.\nHistory.\nAfter the English Reformation, from the 16th to the 19th centuries \"recusants\" were subject to civil penalties and sometimes, especially in the earlier part of that period, to criminal penalties. Catholics formed a large proportion, if not a plurality, of recusants, and it was to Catholics that the term initially was applied. Non-Catholic groups composed of Reformed Christians or Protestant dissenters from the Church of England were later labelled \"recusants\" as well. Recusancy laws were in force from the reign of Elizabeth I to that of George III, but were not always enforced with equal intensity.\nThe first statute to address sectarian dissent from England's official religion was enacted in 1593 under Elizabeth I and specifically targeted Catholics, under the title \"An Act for restraining Popish recusants\". It defined \"Popish recusants\" as those &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;convicted for not repairing to some Church, Chapel, or usual place of Common Prayer to hear Divine Service there, but forbearing the same contrary to the tenor of the laws and statutes heretofore made and provided in that behalf.\nOther Acts targeted Catholic recusants, including statutes passed under JamesI and Charles I, as well as laws defining other offences deemed to be acts of recusancy. Recusants were subject to various civil disabilities and penalties under English penal laws, most of which were repealed during the Regency and the reign of George IV (1811\u201330). \"The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia\" notes that Dissenters were largely forgiven by the Act of Toleration under WilliamIII, while Catholics \"were not entirely emancipated till 1829\".\nEarly recusants included Protestant dissenters, whose confessions derived from the Calvinistic Reformers or Radical Reformers. With the growth of these latter groups after the Restoration of CharlesII, they were distinguished from Catholic recusants by the terms \"nonconformist\" or \"dissenter\". The recusant period reaped an extensive harvest of saints and martyrs.\nAmong the recusants were some high-profile Catholic aristocrats such as the Howards and, for a time, the Plantagenet-descended Beauforts. This patronage ensured that an organic and rooted English base continued to inform the country's Catholicism.\nIn the English-speaking world, the Douay-Rheims Bible was translated from the Latin Vulgate by expatriate recusants in Rheims, France, in 1582 (New Testament) and in Douai, France in 1609 (Old Testament). It was revised by Bishop Richard Challoner in the years 1749\u201352. After \"Divino afflante Spiritu\", translations multiplied in the Catholic world (just as they multiplied in the Protestant world around the same time beginning with the Revised Standard Version). Various other translations were used by Catholics around the world for English-language liturgies, ranging from the New American Bible and the Jerusalem Bible to the Revised Standard Version Second Catholic Edition.\nProminent historical Catholics in the United Kingdom.\nRecusant families.\nThere were dozens of recusant families, some no longer extant. For example, the Howard family, some of whose members are known as Fitzalan-Howard, the Dukes of Norfolk, the highest-ranking non-royal family in England and hereditary holders of the title of Earl Marshal, is considered the most prominent Catholic family in England. Other members of the Howard family, the Earls of Carlisle, Effingham and Suffolk are Anglican, including a cadet branch of the Carlisles who own Castle Howard in Yorkshire. Recusancy was historically focused in Northern England, especially in Cumberland, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Westmoreland. A geographical exception was a branch of the Welds from Shropshire who migrated via London to Oxfordshire and Dorset. The three sons of Sir John Weld (1585\u20131622), founder of the Weld Chapel in Southgate, all married into recusant families and were technically \"converts\" in the 1640s. The eldest, Humphrey, began a lineage, referred to as the \"Lulworth Welds\". They became connected by marriage to Catholic families across the kingdom, including the Arundells, Blundells, Cliffords, Erringtons, Gillows, Haydocks, Petres, Ropers, Shireburns, Smythes, Stourtons, Throckmortons, Fitzherberts, Vaughans and Vavasours. The Acton (also known as Dalberg-Acton and Lyon-Dalberg-Acton) family is another well-known recusant family.\nIndividuals.\nAlthough William Shakespeare (1564\u20131616) and his immediate family were conforming members of the established Church of England, Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, was a member of a particularly conspicuous and determinedly Catholic family in Warwickshire.\nSome scholars also believe there is evidence that several members of Shakespeare's family were secretly recusant Catholics. The strongest evidence is a tract professing secret Catholicism signed by John Shakespeare, father of the poet. The tract was found in the 18th century in the rafters of a house which had once been John Shakespeare's and was seen and described by the reputable scholar Edmond Malone. Malone later changed his mind and declared that he thought the tract was a forgery. Although the document has since been lost, Anthony Holden writes that Malone's reported wording of the tract is linked to a testament written by Charles Borromeo and circulated in England by Edmund Campion, copies of which still exist in Italian and English. Other research, however, suggests that the Borromeo testament is a 17th-century artefact (at the earliest dating from 1638), was not printed for missionary work, and could never have been in the possession of John Shakespeare. John Shakespeare was listed as one who did not attend church services, but this was \"for feare of processe for Debtte\", according to the commissioners, not because he was a recusant.\nAnother notable English Catholic, possibly a convert, was composer William Byrd. Some of Byrd's most popular \"motets\" were actually written as a type of correspondence to a friend and fellow composer, Philippe de Monte. De Monte wrote his own motets in response, such as the \"Super Flumina Babylonis\". These correspondence motets often featured themes of oppression or the hope of deliverance.\nDorothy Lawson was a Catholic noblewoman who used her autonomy, financial independence and social status as a widow to harbour priests in her household. She was a patroness of the Society of Jesus, who met yearly at her home to discuss the mission in England, employed Catholic servants, held religious services for the local community, and visited recusants who were imprisoned in gaol for their beliefs. Her children were raised in the Catholic faith. Three daughters entered convents on the continent and a son attended a seminary in Douai.\nThe Jacobean poet John Donne was another notable Englishman born into a recusant Catholic family. He later, however, authored two Protestant-leaning writings and, at the behest of King James I, was ordained into the Church of England.\nGuy Fawkes, an Englishman and a Spanish soldier, along with other recusants or converts, including, among others, Sir Robert Catesby, Christopher Wright, John Wright and Thomas Percy, was arrested and charged with attempting to blow up the King and Parliament on 5 November 1605. The plot was uncovered and most of the plotters, who were recusants or converts, were tried and executed.\nOther countries.\nThe term \"recusancy\" is primarily applied to English, Scottish, and Welsh Catholics, but there were other instances in Europe. The vast majority of native Irish, while subjects of the British Crown, rejected both the reformed Church of Ireland and the dissenting churches, remaining loyal to the Catholic Church, suffering the same penalties as recusants in Great Britain. The situation was exacerbated by land claims, paramilitary violence, and ethnic antagonisms on all sides.\nRecusancy in Scandinavia is not considered to have survived much past the period of the Liturgical Struggle until anti-Catholicism lessened towards the end of the 18th century and freedom of religion was re-established in the mid-19th century (although there were individual cases of Catholic sympathies occurring even in the 17th and 18th centuries). Notable converts were Christina, Queen of Sweden, daughter of Gustavus Adolphus; and Sigrid Undset, Nobel Prize-winning author of \"Kristin Lavransdatter\". The number of ethnic Swedes who are Catholic is fewer than 40,000, and includes Anders Arborelius, a convert and the first Swedish Bishop since the Reformation. In 2017, he was made a cardinal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25856", "revid": "50717717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25856", "title": "Radiation", "text": "Waves or particles moving through space\nIn physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or a material medium. This includes:\nRadiation is often categorized as either \"ionizing\" or \"non-ionizing\" depending on the energy of the radiated particles. Ionizing radiation carries more than 10 electron volts (eV), which is enough to ionize atoms and molecules and break chemical bonds. This is an important distinction due to the large difference in harmfulness to living organisms. A common source of ionizing radiation is radioactive materials that emit \u03b1, \u03b2, or \u03b3 radiation, consisting of helium nuclei, electrons or positrons, and photons, respectively. Other sources include X-rays from medical radiography examinations and muons, mesons, positrons, neutrons and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere.\nGamma rays, X-rays, and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word \"ionize\" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds that form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared, and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies.\nThe word \"radiation\" arises from the phenomenon of waves \"radiating\" (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that apply to all types of radiation. Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point.\nIonizing radiation.\nRadiation with sufficiently high energy can ionize atoms; that is to say it can knock electrons off atoms, creating ions. Ionization occurs when an electron is stripped (or \"knocked out\") from an electron shell of the atom, which leaves the atom with a net positive charge. Because living cells and, more importantly, the DNA in those cells can be damaged by this ionization, exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer. Thus \"ionizing radiation\" is somewhat artificially separated from particle radiation and electromagnetic radiation, simply due to its great potential for biological damage. While an individual cell is made of trillions of atoms, only a small fraction of those will be ionized at low to moderate radiation powers. The probability of ionizing radiation causing cancer is dependent upon the absorbed dose of the radiation and is a function of the damaging tendency of the type of radiation (equivalent dose) and the sensitivity of the irradiated organism or tissue (effective dose).\nIf the source of the ionizing radiation is a radioactive material or a nuclear process such as fission or fusion, there is particle radiation to consider. Particle radiation is subatomic particles accelerated to relativistic speeds by nuclear reactions. Because of their momenta, they are quite capable of knocking out electrons and ionizing materials, but since most have an electrical charge, they do not have the penetrating power of ionizing radiation. The exception is neutron particles; see below. There are several different kinds of these particles, but the majority are alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons, and protons. Roughly speaking, photons and particles with energies above about 10 electron volts (eV) are ionizing (some authorities use 33 eV, the ionization energy for water). Particle radiation from radioactive material or cosmic rays almost invariably carries enough energy to be ionizing.\nMost ionizing radiation originates from radioactive materials and space (cosmic rays), and as such is naturally present in the environment, since most rocks and soil have small concentrations of radioactive materials. Since this radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses, instruments such as Geiger counters are usually required to detect its presence. In some cases, it may lead to secondary emission of visible light upon its interaction with matter, as in the case of Cherenkov radiation and radio-luminescence.\nIonizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research, and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood, and currently estimates are loosely determined by population-based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\", \"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\" and \"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided\".\nUltraviolet radiation.\nUltraviolet, of wavelengths from 10\u00a0nm to 200\u00a0nm, ionizes air molecules, causing it to be strongly absorbed by air and by ozone (O3) in particular. Ionizing UV therefore does not penetrate Earth's atmosphere to a significant degree, and is sometimes referred to as vacuum ultraviolet. Although present in space, this part of the UV spectrum is not of biological importance, because it does not reach living organisms on Earth.\nThere is a zone of the atmosphere in which ozone absorbs some 98% of non-ionizing but dangerous UV-C and UV-B. This ozone layer starts at about and extends upward. Some of the ultraviolet spectrum that does reach the ground is non-ionizing, but is still biologically hazardous due to the ability of single photons of this energy to cause electronic excitation in biological molecules, and thus damage them by means of unwanted reactions. An example is the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which begins at wavelengths below 365\u00a0nm (3.4\u00a0eV), which is well below ionization energy. This property gives the ultraviolet spectrum some of the dangers of ionizing radiation in biological systems without actual ionization occurring. In contrast, visible light and longer-wavelength electromagnetic radiation, such as infrared, microwaves, and radio waves, consists of photons with too little energy to cause damaging molecular excitation, and thus this radiation is far less hazardous per unit of energy.\nX-rays.\nX-rays are electromagnetic waves with a wavelength less than about 10\u22129\u00a0m (greater than and ). A smaller wavelength corresponds to a higher energy according to the equation \"E\" = \"h\"\"c\"/\"\u03bb\". (\"E\" is Energy; \"h\" is the Planck constant; \"c\" is the speed of light; \"\u03bb\" is wavelength.) When an X-ray photon collides with an atom, the atom may absorb the energy of the photon and boost an electron to a higher orbital level, or if the photon is extremely energetic, it may knock an electron from the atom altogether, causing the atom to ionize. Generally, larger atoms are more likely to absorb an X-ray photon since they have greater energy differences between orbital electrons. The soft tissue in the human body is composed of smaller atoms than the calcium atoms that make up bone, so there is a contrast in the absorption of X-rays. X-ray machines are specifically designed to take advantage of the absorption difference between bone and soft tissue, allowing physicians to examine structure in the human body.\nX-rays are also totally absorbed by the thickness of the earth's atmosphere, resulting in the prevention of the X-ray output of the sun, smaller in quantity than that of UV but nonetheless powerful, from reaching the surface.\nGamma radiation.\nGamma (\u03b3) radiation consists of photons with a wavelength less than (greater than 1019\u00a0Hz and 41.4\u00a0keV). Gamma radiation emission is a nuclear process that occurs to rid an unstable nucleus of excess energy after most nuclear reactions. Both alpha and beta particles have an electric charge and mass, and thus are quite likely to interact with other atoms in their path. Gamma radiation, however, is composed of photons, which have neither mass nor electric charge and, as a result, penetrates much further through matter than either alpha or beta radiation.\nGamma rays can be stopped by a sufficiently thick or dense layer of material, where the stopping power of the material per given area depends mostly (but not entirely) on the total mass along the path of the radiation, regardless of whether the material is of high or low density. However, as is the case with X-rays, materials with a high atomic number such as lead or depleted uranium add a modest (typically 20% to 30%) amount of stopping power over an equal mass of less dense and lower atomic weight materials (such as water or concrete). The atmosphere absorbs all gamma rays approaching Earth from space. Even air is capable of absorbing gamma rays, halving the energy of such waves by passing through, on the average, .\nAlpha radiation.\nAlpha particles are helium-4 nuclei (two protons and two neutrons). They interact with matter strongly due to their charges and combined mass, and at their usual velocities only penetrate a few centimetres of air, or a few millimetres of low density material (such as the thin mica material which is specially placed in some Geiger counter tubes to allow alpha particles in). This means that alpha particles from ordinary alpha decay do not penetrate the outer layers of dead skin cells and cause no damage to the live tissues below. Some very high energy alpha particles compose about 10% of cosmic rays, and these are capable of penetrating the body and even thin metal plates. However, they are of danger only to astronauts, since they are deflected by the Earth's magnetic field and then stopped by its atmosphere.\nAlpha radiation is dangerous when alpha-emitting radioisotopes are inhaled or ingested (breathed or swallowed). This brings the radioisotope close enough to sensitive live tissue for the alpha radiation to damage cells. Per unit of energy, alpha particles are at least 20 times more effective at cell-damage than gamma rays and X-rays. See relative biological effectiveness for a discussion of this. Examples of highly poisonous alpha-emitters are all isotopes of radium, radon, and polonium, due to the amount of decay that occur in these short half-life materials.\nBeta radiation.\nBeta-minus (\u03b2\u2212) radiation consists of an energetic electron. It is more penetrating than alpha radiation but less than gamma. Beta radiation from radioactive decay can be stopped with a few centimetres of plastic or a few millimetres of metal. It occurs when a neutron decays into a proton in a nucleus, releasing the beta particle and an antineutrino. Beta radiation from linac accelerators is far more energetic and penetrating than natural beta radiation. It is sometimes used therapeutically in radiotherapy to treat superficial tumors.\nBeta-plus (\u03b2+) radiation is the emission of positrons, which are the antimatter form of electrons. When a positron slows to speeds similar to those of electrons in the material, the positron will annihilate an electron, releasing two gamma photons of 511\u00a0keV in the process. Those two gamma photons will be traveling in (approximately) opposite directions. The gamma radiation from positron annihilation consists of high energy photons, and is also ionizing.\nNeutron radiation.\nNeutrons are categorized according to their speed/energy. Neutron radiation consists of free neutrons. These neutrons may be emitted during either spontaneous or induced nuclear fission. Neutrons are rare radiation particles; they are produced in large numbers only where chain reaction fission or fusion reactions are active; this happens for about 10 microseconds in a thermonuclear explosion, or continuously inside an operating nuclear reactor; production of the neutrons stops almost immediately in the reactor when it goes non-critical.\nNeutrons can make other objects, or material, radioactive. This process, called neutron activation, is the primary method used to produce radioactive sources for use in medical, academic, and industrial applications. Even comparatively low speed thermal neutrons cause neutron activation (in fact, they cause it more efficiently). Neutrons do not ionize atoms in the same way that charged particles such as protons and electrons do (by the excitation of an electron), because neutrons have no charge. It is through their absorption by nuclei which then become unstable that they cause ionization. Hence, neutrons are said to be \"indirectly ionizing\". Even neutrons without significant kinetic energy are indirectly ionizing, and are thus a significant radiation hazard. Not all materials are capable of neutron activation; in water, for example, the most common isotopes of both types atoms present (hydrogen and oxygen) capture neutrons and become heavier but remain stable forms of those atoms. Only the absorption of more than one neutron, a statistically rare occurrence, can activate a hydrogen atom, while oxygen requires two additional absorptions. Thus water is only very weakly capable of activation. The sodium in salt (as in sea water), on the other hand, need only absorb a single neutron to become Na-24, a very intense source of beta decay, with a half-life of 15 hours.\nIn addition, high-energy (high-speed) neutrons have the ability to directly ionize atoms. One mechanism by which high energy neutrons ionize atoms is to strike the nucleus of an atom and knock the atom out of a molecule, leaving one or more electrons behind as the chemical bond is broken. This leads to production of chemical free radicals. In addition, very high energy neutrons can cause ionizing radiation by \"neutron spallation\" or knockout, wherein neutrons cause emission of high-energy protons from atomic nuclei (especially hydrogen nuclei) on impact. The last process imparts most of the neutron's energy to the proton, much like one billiard ball striking another. The charged protons and other products from such reactions are directly ionizing.\nHigh-energy neutrons are very penetrating and can travel great distances in air (hundreds or even thousands of metres) and moderate distances (several metres) in common solids. They typically require hydrogen rich shielding, such as concrete or water, to block them within distances of less than 1\u00a0m. A common source of neutron radiation occurs inside a nuclear reactor, where a metres-thick water layer is used as effective shielding.\nCosmic radiation.\nThere are two sources of high energy particles entering the Earth's atmosphere from outer space: the sun and deep space. The sun continuously emits particles, primarily free protons, in the solar wind, and occasionally augments the flow hugely with coronal mass ejections (CME).\nThe particles from deep space (inter- and extra-galactic) are much less frequent, but of much higher energies. These particles are also mostly protons, with much of the remainder consisting of helions (alpha particles). A few completely ionized nuclei of heavier elements are present. The origin of these galactic cosmic rays is not yet well understood, but they seem to be remnants of supernovae and especially gamma-ray bursts (GRB), which feature magnetic fields capable of the huge accelerations measured from these particles. They may also be generated by quasars, which are galaxy-wide jet phenomena similar to GRBs but known for their much larger size, and which seem to be a violent part of the universe's early history.\nNon-ionizing radiation.\nThe kinetic energy of particles of non-ionizing radiation is too small to produce charged ions when passing through matter. For non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (see types below), the associated particles (photons) have only sufficient energy to change the rotational, vibrational or electronic valence configurations of molecules and atoms. The effect of non-ionizing forms of radiation on living tissue has only recently been studied. Nevertheless, different biological effects are observed for different types of non-ionizing radiation.\nEven \"non-ionizing\" radiation is capable of causing thermal-ionization if it deposits enough heat to raise temperatures to ionization energies. These reactions occur at far higher total energies than with ionization radiation, which requires only single particles to cause ionization. A familiar example of thermal ionization is the flame-ionization of a common fire, and the browning reactions in common food items induced by infrared radiation, during broiling-type cooking.\nThe electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible electromagnetic radiation frequencies. The electromagnetic spectrum (usually just spectrum) of an object is the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by, or absorbed by, that particular object.\nThe non-ionizing portion of electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves that (as individual quanta or particles, see photon) are not energetic enough to detach electrons from atoms or molecules and hence cause their ionization. These include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and (sometimes) visible light. The lower frequencies of ultraviolet light may cause chemical changes and molecular damage similar to ionization, but is technically not ionizing. The highest frequencies of ultraviolet light, as well as all X-rays and gamma-rays are ionizing.\nThe occurrence of ionization depends on the energy of the individual particles or waves, and not on their number. An intense flood of particles or waves will not cause ionization if these particles or waves do not carry enough energy to be ionizing, unless they raise the temperature of a body to a point high enough to ionize small fractions of atoms or molecules by the process of thermal-ionization (this, however, requires relatively extreme radiation intensities).\nUltraviolet light.\nAs noted above, the lower part of the spectrum of ultraviolet, called soft UV, from 3\u00a0eV to about 10\u00a0eV, is non-ionizing. However, the effects of non-ionizing ultraviolet on chemistry and the damage to biological systems exposed to it (including oxidation, mutation, and cancer) are such that even this part of ultraviolet is often compared with ionizing radiation.\nVisible light.\nLight, or visible light, is a very narrow range of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye, or 380\u2013750\u00a0nm which equates to a frequency range of 790 to 400\u00a0THz respectively. More broadly, physicists use the term \"light\" to mean electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths, whether visible or not.\nInfrared.\nInfrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300\u00a0\u03bcm, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1\u00a0THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \"feel\". Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \"pits\". Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1\u00a0kW/m2 at sea level. Of this energy, 53% is infrared radiation, 44% is visible light, and 3% is ultraviolet radiation.\nMicrowave.\nMicrowaves are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths ranging from as short as 1\u00a0mm to as long as 1\u00a0m, which equates to a frequency range of 300\u00a0MHz to 300\u00a0GHz. This broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimetre waves), but various sources use different other limits. In all cases, microwaves include the entire super high frequency band (3 to 30\u00a0GHz, or 10 to 1\u00a0cm) at minimum, with RF engineering often putting the lower boundary at 1\u00a0GHz (30\u00a0cm), and the upper around 100\u00a0GHz (3\u00a0mm).\nRadio waves.\nRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are made by lightning, or by certain astronomical objects. Artificially generated radio waves are used for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and other navigation systems, satellite communication, computer networks and innumerable other applications. In addition, almost any wire carrying alternating current will radiate some of the energy away as radio waves; these are mostly termed interference. Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves may bend at the rate of the curvature of the Earth and may cover a part of the Earth very consistently, shorter waves travel around the world by multiple reflections off the ionosphere and the Earth. Much shorter wavelengths bend or reflect very little and travel along the line of sight.\nVery low frequency.\nVery low frequency (VLF) refers to a frequency range of 30\u00a0Hz to 3\u00a0kHz which corresponds to wavelengths of respectively. Since there is not much bandwidth in this range of the radio spectrum, only the very simplest signals can be transmitted, such as for radio navigation. Also known as the myriametre band or myriametre wave as the wavelengths range from 100\u00a0km to 10\u00a0km (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10\u00a0km).\nExtremely low frequency.\nExtremely low frequency (ELF) is radiation frequencies from 3 to 30\u00a0Hz (108 to 107\u00a0m respectively). In atmosphere science, an alternative definition is usually given, from 3\u00a0Hz to 3\u00a0kHz. In the related magnetosphere science, the lower frequency electromagnetic oscillations (pulsations occurring below ~3\u00a0Hz) are considered to lie in the ULF range, which is thus also defined differently from the ITU Radio Bands. A massive military ELF antenna in Michigan radiates very slow messages to otherwise unreachable receivers, such as submerged submarines.\nThermal radiation (heat).\nThermal radiation is a common synonym for infrared radiation emitted by objects at temperatures often encountered on Earth. Thermal radiation refers not only to the radiation itself, but also the process by which the surface of an object radiates its thermal energy in the form of black-body radiation. Infrared or red radiation from a common household radiator or electric heater is an example of thermal radiation, as is the heat emitted by an operating incandescent light bulb. Thermal radiation is generated when energy from the movement of charged particles within atoms is converted to electromagnetic radiation.\nAs noted above, even low-frequency thermal radiation may cause temperature-ionization whenever it deposits sufficient thermal energy to raise temperatures to a high enough level. Common examples of this are the ionization (plasma) seen in common flames, and the molecular changes caused by the \"browning\" during food-cooking, which is a chemical process that begins with a large component of ionization.\nBlack-body radiation.\n\"Black-body radiation\" is an idealized spectrum of radiation emitted by a body that is at a uniform temperature. The shape of the spectrum and the total amount of energy emitted by the body is a function of the absolute temperature of that body. The radiation emitted covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum and the intensity of the radiation (power/unit-area) at a given frequency is described by Planck's law of radiation. For a given temperature of a black-body there is a particular frequency at which the radiation emitted is at its maximum intensity. That maximum radiation frequency moves toward higher frequencies as the temperature of the body increases. The frequency at which the black-body radiation is at maximum is given by Wien's displacement law and is a function of the body's absolute temperature. A black-body is one that emits at any temperature the maximum possible amount of radiation at any given wavelength. A black-body will also absorb the maximum possible incident radiation at any given wavelength. A black-body with a temperature at or below room temperature would thus appear absolutely black, as it would not reflect any incident light nor would it emit enough radiation at visible wavelengths for our eyes to detect. Theoretically, a black-body emits electromagnetic radiation over the entire spectrum from very low frequency radio waves to x-rays, creating a continuum of radiation.\nThe color of a radiating black-body tells the temperature of its radiating surface. It is responsible for the color of stars, which vary from infrared through red (), to yellow (), to white and to blue-white () as the peak radiance passes through those points in the visible spectrum. When the peak is below the visible spectrum the body is black, while when it is above the body is blue-white, since all the visible colors are represented from blue decreasing to red.\nDiscovery.\nElectromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than visible light were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel, the astronomer. Herschel published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London. Herschel, like Ritter, used a prism to refract light from the Sun and detected the infrared (beyond the red part of the spectrum), through an increase in the temperature recorded by a thermometer.\nIn 1801, the German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter made the discovery of ultraviolet by noting that the rays from a prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than violet light. Ritter's experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the UV rays were capable of causing chemical reactions.\nThe first radio waves detected were not from a natural source, but were produced deliberately and artificially by the German scientist Heinrich Hertz in 1887, using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations in the radio frequency range, following formulas suggested by the equations of James Clerk Maxwell.\nWilhelm R\u00f6ntgen discovered and named X-rays. While experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 November 1895, he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass. Within a month, he discovered the main properties of X-rays that we understand to this day.\nIn 1896, Henri Becquerel found that rays emanating from certain minerals penetrated black paper and caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate. His doctoral student Marie Curie discovered that only certain chemical elements gave off these rays of energy. She named this behavior radioactivity.\nAlpha rays (alpha particles) and beta rays (beta particles) were differentiated by Ernest Rutherford through simple experimentation in 1899. Rutherford used a generic pitchblende radioactive source and determined that the rays produced by the source had differing penetrations in materials. One type had short penetration (it was stopped by paper) and a positive charge, which Rutherford named \"alpha rays\". The other was more penetrating (able to expose film through paper but not metal) and had a negative charge, and this type Rutherford named \"beta\". This was the radiation that had been first detected by Becquerel from uranium salts. In 1900, the French scientist Paul Villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium, and after he described it, Rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation, which in 1903 Rutherford named gamma rays.\nHenri Becquerel himself proved that beta rays are fast electrons, while Rutherford and Thomas Royds proved in 1909 that alpha particles are ionized helium. Rutherford and Edward Andrade proved in 1914 that gamma rays are like X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths.\nCosmic ray radiations striking the Earth from outer space were finally definitively recognized and proven to exist in 1912, as the scientist Victor Hess carried an electrometer to various altitudes in a free balloon flight. The nature of these radiations was only gradually understood in later years.\nThe neutron and neutron radiation were discovered by James Chadwick in 1932. A number of other high energy particulate radiations such as positrons, muons, and pions were discovered by cloud chamber examination of cosmic ray reactions shortly thereafter, and others types of particle radiation were produced artificially in particle accelerators, through the last half of the twentieth century.\nApplications.\nMedicine.\nRadiation and radioactive substances are used for diagnosis, treatment, and research. X-rays, for example, pass through muscles and other soft tissue but are stopped by dense materials. This property of X-rays enables doctors to find broken bones and to locate cancers that might be growing in the body. Doctors also find certain diseases by injecting a radioactive substance and monitoring the radiation given off as the substance moves through the body. Radiation used for cancer treatment is called ionizing radiation because it forms ions in the cells of the tissues it passes through as it dislodges electrons from atoms. This can kill cells or change genes so the cells cannot grow. Other forms of radiation such as radio waves, microwaves, and light waves are called non-ionizing. They do not have as much energy so they are not able to ionize cells.\nCommunication.\nAll modern communication systems use forms of electromagnetic radiation. Variations in the intensity of the radiation represent changes in the sound, pictures, or other information being transmitted. For example, a human voice can be sent as a radio wave or microwave by making the wave vary to corresponding variations in the voice. Musicians have also experimented with gamma rays sonification, or using nuclear radiation, to produce sound and music.\nScience.\nResearchers use radioactive atoms to determine the age of materials that were once part of a living organism. The age of such materials can be estimated by measuring the amount of radioactive carbon they contain in a process called radiocarbon dating. Similarly, using other radioactive elements, the age of rocks and other geological features (even some man-made objects) can be determined; this is called Radiometric dating. Environmental scientists use radioactive atoms, known as tracer atoms, to identify the pathways taken by pollutants through the environment.\nRadiation is used to determine the composition of materials in a process called neutron activation analysis. In this process, scientists bombard a sample of a substance with particles called neutrons. Some of the atoms in the sample absorb neutrons and become radioactive. The scientists can identify the elements in the sample by studying the emitted radiation.\nPossible damage to health and environment from certain types of radiation.\nRadiation is not always dangerous, and not all types of radiation are equally dangerous, contrary to several common medical myths. For example, although bananas contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, particularly potassium-40 (40K), which emit ionizing radiation when undergoing radioactive decay, the levels of such radiation are far too low to induce radiation poisoning, and bananas are not a radiation hazard. It would not be physically possible to eat enough bananas to cause radiation poisoning, as the radiation dose from bananas is non-cumulative. Radiation is ubiquitous on Earth, and humans are adapted to survive at the normal low-to-moderate levels of radiation found on Earth's surface. The relationship between dose and toxicity is often non-linear, and many substances that are toxic at very high doses actually have neutral or positive health effects, or are biologically essential, at moderate or low doses. There is some evidence to suggest that this is true for ionizing radiation: normal levels of ionizing radiation may serve to stimulate and regulate the activity of DNA repair mechanisms. High enough levels of any kind of radiation will eventually become lethal, however.\nIonizing radiation in certain conditions can damage living organisms, causing cancer or genetic damage.\nNon-ionizing radiation in certain conditions also can cause damage to living organisms, such as burns. In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) released a statement adding radio frequency electromagnetic fields (including microwave and millimetre waves) to their list of things which are possibly carcinogenic to humans.\nRWTH Aachen University's EMF-Portal web site presents one of the biggest database about the effects of electromagnetic radiation. As of 12 July 2019 it has 28,547 publications and 6,369 summaries of individual scientific studies on the effects of electromagnetic fields.\nEnvironmental radioactivity.\nOn Earth there are different sources of radiation, natural as well as artificial. Natural radiation can come from the Sun, Earth itself, or from cosmic radiation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25857", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25857", "title": "Rodolphus Agricola", "text": "15th century Dutch humanist\nRodolphus Agricola (; August 28, 1443, or February 17, 1444 \u2013 October 27, 1485) was a Dutch humanist of the Northern Low Countries, famous for his knowledge of Latin and Greek. He was an educator, musician, builder of church organs, a poet in Latin and the vernacular, a diplomat, a boxer and a Hebrew scholar towards the end of his life. Today, he is best known as the author of \"De inventione dialectica\", the father of Northern European humanism and a zealous anti-scholastic in the late fifteenth century.\nBiography.\nAgricola was born in Baflo in the Dutch province of Groningen as the illegitimate son of the cleric and future abbot Hendrik Vries and Zycka Huesman, a rich farmer's daughter. He was originally named \"Roelof Huesman\", or \"Huisman\", his mother's surname. The Latin adjective \"Phrisius\" identifies him as a Frisian.\nEducated first by the school of St. Maarten in Groningen, Agricola matriculated at the University of Erfurt with his father's assistance and received a BA in 1458. He then studied at University of Louvain, receiving an MA in 1465; he was renowned for the purity of his Latin and skill in disputation. He concentrated his studies on Cicero and Quintilian, but also added French and Greek to his ever-growing list of languages during his university years. At the end of his life, he would learn Hebrew to be able to read the Old Testament, especially the Psalms, unadulterated by translation.\nIn the 1460s Agricola travelled to Italy, where he became associated with humanist masters and statesmen. From circa 1468 until 1475, he studied civil law at the University of Pavia and later went to Ferrara (1475\u20131479). There, he became the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Prince d'Este of Ferrara, and was a pupil of Theodor Gaza and attended lectures by Battista Guarino. He devoted himself to the study of classical texts and gained fame for the elegance of his Latin style and his knowledge of philosophy. While in Ferrara, Agricola gained formal employment as the organist to the opulent ducal chapel. He held that post until 1479, after which he returned to the North, becoming secretary to the city of Groningen. Here, at the Cistercian Abbey of St Bernard at Aduard, near Groningen, and at 's-Heerenbergh near Emmerich in the south-east, he was at the center of a group of scholars and humanists, with whom he kept up a lively exchange of letters. His correspondents included the musician and choirmaster of Antwerp Jacobus Barbirianus (Barbireau), rector of the Latin School at Deventer Alexander Hegius von Heek and Johannes Reuchlin, the humanist scholar and later student of Hebrew.\nIn 1470, he taught a deaf child how to communicate orally and in writing; his work, \"De inventione dialectica,\" documents this pioneering educational effort.\nOnce in Germany again, he spent time in Dillingen, where he continued to correspond with humanist friends and colleagues throughout Europe. In correspondence, he primarily advocated for his project to promote the study of classical learning and the \"Studia humanitatis\". Agricola remained an independent scholar, unattached to a university or religious establishment. This independence became a hallmark of humanist scholars. In 1479, Agricola completed his \"De inventione dialectica\" (\"On Dialectical Invention\") in Dillingen, which argued for the precise application of \"loci\" in scholarly argumentation.\nFrom 1480 to 1484 he held the post of secretary of the city of Groningen.\nIn 1481, Agricola spent six months in Brussels at the court of Archduke Maximilian (later Maximilian I, the Holy Roman Emperor). Friends attempted to dissuade him from accepting the archduke's patronage as they feared that the archduke's influence would undermine his philosophical ideals. He also declined the offer to become the head of a Latin school at Antwerp.\nIn 1484, Agricola moved to Heidelberg by invitation of Johann von Dalberg, the Bishop of Worms. The two men had met in Pavia, and they became close friends in Heidelberg. The bishop was a generous benefactor of learning. At this time Agricola began studying Hebrew, and he is said to have published an original translation of the Psalms.\nIn 1485, Dalberg was sent as an ambassador to Pope Innocent VIII in Rome, with Agricola accompanying him; the latter was struck gravely ill on their journey. He died shortly after their return to Heidelberg and Ermolao Barbaro composed an epitaph for him.\nLegacy.\n\"De inventione dialectica\" was influential in creating a place for logic in rhetorical studies and was of significance in the education of early humanists. It was a critical and systematic treatment of ideas and concepts related to dialectics.\nThe significance of \"De inventione dialectica\" for the history of argumentation is that it assimilated the art of dialectic to that of rhetoric. Argumentation focused not on truth but on what might be said with reason. Accordingly, Agricola focused on the \"Topics\" rather than the \"Analytics\" of Aristotle and on Cicero, but also on the writings of historians, poets, and orators. Thus, for Agricola, dialectic was an open field; the art of finding \"whatever can be said with any degree of probability on any subject.\" (Hamilton, David. \"From Dialectic to Didactic\").\nAgricola was also important to the deaf community, since he believed that people who are born deaf can express themselves by putting their thoughts into writing. His statement that deaf people can be taught a language is one of the earliest positive statements about deafness on record (Gannon, 1981).\nAgricola's \"De formando studio\"\u2014his long letter on a private educational program\u2014was printed as a small booklet and influenced pedagogy of the early sixteenth century.\nAgricola was also important for his personal influence over others. Erasmus admired Agricola, eulogizing him in \"Adagia\" and calling him \"the first to bring a breath of better literature from Italy.\" Erasmus claimed him as a father/teacher figure and may have met him through his own schoolmaster Alexander Hegius (most probably one of Agricola's students) at Hegius's School in Deventer. In addition to Hegius, Agricola's students include Conrad Celtis (in Heidelberg).\nErasmus made it his personal mission to ensure that several of Agricola's major works were printed posthumously. Agricola's literary executor was Adolphus Occo, a physician of Augsburg. By about 1530 disciples and followers had gathered the manuscripts left by Agricola, and these were edited by Alardus of Amsterdam.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She began her career performing on Broadway at age 19. Known for her nasal voice and distinctive personality, Gordon gained international recognition and critical acclaim for film roles that continued into her 70s and 80s. Her later work included performances in \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968), \"What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?\" (1969), \"Where's Poppa?\" (1970), \"Harold and Maude\" (1971), \"Every Which Way but Loose\" (1978), \"Any Which Way You Can\" (1980), and \"My Bodyguard\" (1980).\nIn addition to her acting career, Gordon wrote numerous plays, film scripts, and books, most notably co-writing the screenplay for the 1949 film \"Adam's Rib\". Gordon won an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy, and two Golden Globe Awards for her acting, as well as three Academy Award nominations for her writing.\nEarly life and education.\nRuth Gordon Jones was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, at 41 Winthrop Avenue, in the Wollaston section of town.\nShe was the child of Annie Tapley (n\u00e9e Ziegler) and Clinton Jones. Her only sibling was an older half-sister Claire, from her father's first marriage. She was baptized an Episcopalian. Her first appearance in the public eye came as an infant when her photograph was used in advertising for her father's employer, Mellin's Food for Infants and Invalids. Before graduating from Quincy High School, she wrote to several of her favorite actresses requesting autographed pictures. A personal reply from Hazel Dawn (whom she had seen in a stage production of \"The Pink Lady\") inspired her to go into acting. Although her father was skeptical of her chances of success in a difficult profession, he took his daughter to New York in 1914, where he enrolled her in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.\nCareer.\nSilent films.\nIn 1915, Gordon appeared as an extra in silent films that were shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey, including as a dancer in \"The Whirl of Life\", a film based on the lives of Vernon and Irene Castle. The same year, she made her Broadway debut in a revival of \"Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\" in the role of Nibs (one of the Lost Boys), appearing onstage with Maude Adams and earning a favorable mention from powerful critic Alexander Woollcott. He described her favorably as \"ever so gay\", and he became her friend and mentor.\nIn 1918, Gordon played opposite actor Gregory Kelly in the Broadway adaptation of Booth Tarkington's \"Seventeen\". The pair continued to perform together in North American tours of Frank Craven's \"The First Year\" and Tarkington's \"Clarence\" and \"Tweedles\". Then in 1921, Gordon and Kelly were wed.\nIn December 1920, Gordon checked into a Chicago hospital to have her legs broken and straightened to treat her lifelong bow-leggedness. After a three-month recovery, she moved to Indianapolis, where they started a repertory company.\nKelly died of heart disease in 1927 at the age of 35. Gordon at the time had been enjoying a comeback, appearing on Broadway as Bobby in Maxwell Anderson's \"Saturday's Children\", performing in a serious role after being typecast for years as a \"beautiful, but dumb\" character.\nIn 1929, Gordon was starring in the hit play \"Serena Blandish\" when she became pregnant by the show's producer, Jed Harris. Their son, Jones Harris, was born in Paris that year and Gordon brought him back to New York. Although they never married, Gordon and Harris provided their son with a normal upbringing, and his parentage became public knowledge as social conventions changed. In 1932, the family was living discreetly in a small, elegant New York City brownstone.\n Their son later married the actress and heiress Heidi Vanderbilt.\n1930s.\nGordon continued to act on the stage throughout the 1930s, including notable runs as Mattie in \"Ethan Frome\", Margery Pinchwife in William Wycherley's Restoration comedy \"The Country Wife\" at London's Old Vic and on Broadway, and Nora Helmer in Henrik Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" at Central City, Colorado, and on Broadway.\n1940s.\nGordon was signed to a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film contract for a brief period in the early 1930s, but did not make a movie for the company until her supporting role in Greta Garbo's final film \"Two-Faced Woman\" (1941). Gordon had better luck at other studios in Hollywood, appearing in supporting roles in a string of films, including \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\" (as Mary Todd Lincoln), \"Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet\" (as Mrs. Ehrlich) and \"Action in the North Atlantic\", in the early 1940s. Gordon's Broadway acting appearances in the 1940s included Iris in Paul Vincent Carroll's \"The Strings, My Lord, Are False\", Natasha in Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic's revival of Anton Chekhov's \"Three Sisters\", and leading roles in her plays \"Over Twenty-One\" and \"The Leading Lady\".\nGordon married her second husband, writer Garson Kanin, in 1942. Gordon and Kanin collaborated on the screenplays for the Katharine Hepburn\u00a0\u2013 Spencer Tracy films \"Adam's Rib\" (1949) and \"Pat and Mike\" (1952). Both films were directed by George Cukor. They were close friends of Hepburn and Tracy, and they incorporated elements of the actors' personalities in the films. Gordon and Kanin received Academy Award nominations for both of those screenplays as well as for \"A Double Life\" (1947), also directed by Cukor.\n1950s.\n\"The Actress\" (1953) was Gordon's film adaptation of her autobiographical play \"Years Ago\", filmed by MGM with Jean Simmons portraying the girl from Quincy, Massachusetts, who convinced her sea captain father to let her go to New York to become an actress. Gordon wrote three volumes of memoirs in the 1970s: \"My Side\", \"Myself Among Others\", and \"An Open Book\".\nGordon continued her stage-acting career in the 1950s, and she was nominated for a 1956 Tony for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for her portrayal of Dolly Levi in Thornton Wilder's \"The Matchmaker\", a role she played in London, Edinburgh, and Berlin.\n1960s.\nIn 1966, Gordon was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for \"Inside Daisy Clover\" opposite Natalie Wood. It was her first nomination for acting. In 1969, she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for \"Rosemary's Baby\", a film adaptation of Ira Levin's bestselling horror novel about a satanic cult residing in an Upper West Side apartment building in Manhattan. In accepting the award onstage at the 41st Academy Awards, Gordon thanked the academy by saying \"I can't tell you how encouraging a thing like this is ...\" (rousing laughter from the audience). At the time she had been in the business for 50 years and was 72 years old. \"And thank all of you who voted for me, and to everyone who didn't: please, excuse me\", she added, prompting more laughter and applause.\nGordon won another Golden Globe for \"Rosemary's Baby\", and she was nominated again in 1971 for her role as Maude in \"Harold and Maude\" (with Bud Cort as her love interest).\nLater career.\nShe appeared in 22 more films and many television appearances through her 70s and 80s, including successful sitcoms such as \"Rhoda\" (as the mother of the unseen doorman Carlton, which earned her an Emmy nomination) and \"Newhart\". She portrayed a murderous author on the 1977 episode \"Columbo: Try and Catch Me\". She made countless talk-show appearances, in addition to hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1977.\nGordon won an Emmy Award for an appearance on the sitcom \"Taxi\", for a 1979 episode titled \"Sugar Mama\", in which her character tries to solicit the services of a taxi driver, played by series star Judd Hirsch, as a male escort.\nHer last Broadway appearance was as Mrs. Warren in George Bernard Shaw's \"Mrs. Warren's Profession\", produced by Joseph Papp at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in 1976. In the summer of 1976, Gordon starred in the leading role of her own play, \"Ho! Ho! Ho!\" at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts. She had a minor role as Ma Boggs, the mother of Orville Boggs (Geoffrey Lewis), in the Clint Eastwood films \"Every Which Way but Loose\" and \"Any Which Way You Can\".\nIn 1983, Gordon was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.\n\"Harold and Maude\", \"Adam's Rib\", and \"Rosemary's Baby\" have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the United States Library of Congress.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn August 28, 1985, Gordon died at her summer home in Edgartown, Massachusetts, following a stroke at age 88. Her husband of 43 years, Garson Kanin, was at her side and said that even her last day of life was typically full, with walks, talks, errands, and a morning of work on a new play. She had made her last public appearance two weeks before at a benefit showing of the film \"Harold and Maude\" and had recently finished acting in four films.\nIn August 1979, a small movie theater in Westboro, Massachusetts, was named the Ruth Gordon Flick. She attended the opening ceremony, standing on a bench in the lobby so she could be seen. The theater no longer exists. In November 1984, the outdoor amphitheater in Merrymount Park in Quincy, Massachusetts, was named Ruth Gordon Amphitheater in her honor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its \"non-functional\" attributes), while preserving its functionality. Potential advantages of refactoring may include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve the source code's maintainability and create a simpler, cleaner, or more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility. Another potential goal for refactoring is improved performance; software engineers face an ongoing challenge to write programs that perform faster or use less memory.\nTypically, refactoring applies a series of standardized basic \"micro-refactorings\", each of which is (usually) a tiny change in a computer program's source code that either preserves the behavior of the software, or at least does not modify its conformance to functional requirements. Many development environments provide automated support for performing the mechanical aspects of these basic refactorings. If done well, code refactoring may help software developers discover and fix hidden or dormant bugs or vulnerabilities in the system by simplifying the underlying logic and eliminating unnecessary levels of complexity. If done poorly, it may fail the requirement that external functionality not be changed, and may thus introduce new bugs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By continuously improving the design of code, we make it easier and easier to work with. This is in sharp contrast to what typically happens: little refactoring and a great deal of attention paid to expediently add new features. If you get into the hygienic habit of refactoring continuously, you'll find that it is easier to extend and maintain code.\u2014\u200a\nMotivation.\nRefactoring is usually motivated by noticing a code smell. For example, the method at hand may be very long, or it may be a near duplicate of another nearby method. Once recognized, such problems can be addressed by \"refactoring\" the source code, or transforming it into a new form that behaves the same as before but that no longer \"smells\".\nFor a long routine, one or more smaller subroutines can be extracted; or for duplicate routines, the duplication can be removed and replaced with one shared function. Failure to perform refactoring can result in accumulating technical debt; on the other hand, refactoring is one of the primary means of repaying technical debt.\nBenefits.\nThere are two general categories of benefits to the activity of refactoring.\nPerformance engineering can remove inefficiencies in programs, known as software bloat, arising from traditional software-development strategies that aim to minimize an application's development time rather than the time it takes to run. Performance engineering can also tailor software to the hardware on which it runs, for example, to take advantage of parallel processors and vector units.\nTiming and responsibility.\nThere are two possible times for refactoring.\nA method that balances preventive and corrective refactoring is \"shared responsibility for refactoring\".\nThis approach splits the refactoring action into two stages and two\nroles. The original developer of the code just prepares the code for refactoring, and when the code smells form, a subsequent developer carries out the actual refactoring action.\nChallenges.\nRefactoring requires extracting software system structure, data models, and intra-application dependencies to get back knowledge of an existing software system.\nThe turnover of teams implies missing or inaccurate knowledge of the current state of a system and about design decisions made by departing developers. Further code refactoring activities may require additional effort to regain this knowledge.\nRefactoring activities generate architectural modifications that deteriorate the structural architecture of a software system. Such deterioration affects architectural properties such as maintainability and comprehensibility which can lead to a complete re-development of software systems.\nCode refactoring activities are secured with software intelligence when using tools and techniques providing data about algorithms and sequences of code execution. Providing a comprehensible format for the inner-state of software system structure, data models, and intra-components dependencies is a critical element to form a high-level understanding and then refined views of what needs to be modified, and how.\nTesting.\nAutomatic unit tests should be set up before refactoring to ensure routines still behave as expected. Unit tests can bring stability to even large refactors when performed with a single atomic commit. A common strategy to allow safe and atomic refactors spanning multiple projects is to store all projects in a single repository, known as monorepo.\nWith unit testing in place, refactoring is then an iterative cycle of making a small program transformation, testing it to ensure correctness, and making another small transformation. If at any point a test fails, the last small change is undone and repeated in a different way. Through many small steps the program moves from where it was to where you want it to be. For this very iterative process to be practical, the tests must run very quickly, or the programmer would have to spend a large fraction of their time waiting for the tests to finish. Proponents of extreme programming and other agile software development describe this activity as an integral part of the software development cycle.\nTechniques.\nHere are some examples of micro-refactorings; some of these may only apply to certain languages or language types. A longer list can be found in Martin Fowler's refactoring book and website. Many development environments provide automated support for these micro-refactorings. For instance, a programmer could click on the name of a variable and then select the \"Encapsulate field\" refactoring from a context menu. The IDE would then prompt for additional details, typically with sensible defaults and a preview of the code changes. After confirmation by the programmer it would carry out the required changes throughout the code.\nStatic analysis.\nStatic program analysis (called \"linting\" when performed on less strict interpreted languages) detects problems in a valid but substandard program.\nTransformations.\nTransformations modify the syntactic representation of a program. Some modifications alter the semantics or structure of the program in a way which improves its flexibility or robustness. Such modifications require knowledge of the problem domain and intended logic, and thus are infeasible to automate. Modifications exist which make the program easier to read and modify but which to not alter the underlying logic of the program; these transformations can be automated.\nHardware refactoring.\nWhile the term \"refactoring\" originally referred exclusively to refactoring of software code, in recent years code written in hardware description languages has also been refactored. The term \"hardware refactoring\" is used as a shorthand term for refactoring of code in hardware description languages. Since hardware description languages are not considered to be programming languages by most hardware engineers, hardware refactoring is to be considered a separate field from traditional code refactoring.\nAutomated refactoring of analog hardware descriptions (in VHDL-AMS) has been proposed by Zeng and Huss. In their approach, refactoring preserves the simulated behavior of a hardware design. The non-functional measurement that improves is that refactored code can be processed by standard synthesis tools, while the original code cannot. Refactoring of digital hardware description languages, albeit manual refactoring, has also been investigated by Synopsys fellow Mike Keating. His target is to make complex systems easier to understand, which increases the designers' productivity.\nHistory.\nThe first known use of the term \"refactoring\" in the published literature was in a September, 1990 article by William Opdyke and Ralph Johnson.\nAlthough refactoring code has been done informally for decades, William Griswold's 1991 Ph.D. dissertation\nis one of the first major academic works on refactoring functional and procedural programs, followed by William Opdyke's 1992 dissertation\non the refactoring of object-oriented programs, although all the theory and machinery have long been available as program transformation systems. All of these resources provide a catalog of common methods for refactoring; a refactoring method has a description of how to apply the method and indicators for when you should (or should not) apply the method.\nMartin Fowler's book \"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code\" is the canonical reference. \nThe terms \"factoring\" and \"factoring out\" have been used in this way in the Forth community since at least the early 1980s. Chapter Six of Leo Brodie's book \"Thinking Forth\" (1984) is dedicated to the subject.\nIn extreme programming, the Extract Method refactoring technique has essentially the same meaning as factoring in Forth; to break down a \"word\" (or function) into smaller, more easily maintained functions.\nRefactorings can also be reconstructed posthoc to produce concise descriptions of complex software changes recorded in software repositories like Git.\nAutomated code refactoring.\nMany software editors and IDEs have automated refactoring support. Here is a list of a few of these editors, or so-called refactoring browsers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

F. Codd in 1970.\nA Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system that stores data in a structured format using rows and columns.\nMany relational database systems are equipped with the option of using SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and updating the database.\nHistory.\nThe concept of relational database was defined by E. F. Codd at IBM in 1970. Codd introduced the term \"relational\" in his research paper \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\". In this paper and later papers, he defined what he meant by \"relation\". One well-known definition of what constitutes a relational database system is composed of Codd's 12 rules.\nHowever, no commercial implementations of the relational model conform to all of Codd's rules, so the term has gradually come to describe a broader class of database systems, which at a minimum:\nIn 1974, IBM began developing System R, a research project to develop a prototype RDBMS.\nThe first system sold as an RDBMS was Multics Relational Data Store (June 1976). Oracle was released in 1979 by Relational Software, now Oracle Corporation. Ingres and IBM BS12 followed. Other examples of an RDBMS include IBM Db2, SAP Sybase ASE, and Informix. In 1984, the first RDBMS for Macintosh began being developed, code-named Silver Surfer, and was released in 1987 as 4th Dimension and known today as 4D.\nThe first systems that were relatively faithful implementations of the relational model were from:\nThe most common definition of an RDBMS is a product that presents a view of data as a collection of rows and columns, even if it is not based strictly upon relational theory. By this definition, RDBMS products typically implement some but not all of Codd's 12 rules.\nA second school of thought argues that if a database does not implement all of Codd's rules (or the current understanding on the relational model, as expressed by Christopher J. Date, Hugh Darwen and others), it is not relational. This view, shared by many theorists and other strict adherents to Codd's principles, would disqualify most DBMSs as not relational. For clarification, they often refer to some RDBMSs as \"truly-relational database management systems\" (TRDBMS), naming others \"pseudo-relational database management systems\" (PRDBMS). \nAs of 2009, most commercial relational DBMSs employ SQL as their query language.\nAlternative query languages have been proposed and implemented, notably the pre-1996 implementation of Ingres QUEL.\nRelational model.\nA relational model organizes data into one or more tables (or \"relations\") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Rows are also called records or tuples. Columns are also called attributes. Generally, each table/relation represents one \"entity type\" (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as \"Lee\" or \"chair\") and the columns represent values attributed to that instance (such as address or price).\nFor example, each row of a class table corresponds to a class, and a class corresponds to multiple students, so the relationship between the class table and the student table is \"one to many\"\nKeys.\nEach row in a table has its own unique key. Rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables by adding a column for the unique key of the linked row (such columns are known as foreign keys). Codd showed that data relationships of arbitrary complexity can be represented by a simple set of concepts.\nPart of this processing involves consistently being able to select or modify one and only one row in a table. Therefore, most physical implementations have a unique primary key (PK) for each row in a table. When a new row is written to the table, a new unique value for the primary key is generated; this is the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the table. System performance is optimized for PKs. Other, more natural keys may also be identified and defined as alternate keys (AK). Often several columns are needed to form an AK (this is one reason why a single integer column is usually made the PK). Both PKs and AKs have the ability to uniquely identify a row within a table. Additional technology may be applied to ensure a unique ID across the world, a globally unique identifier, when there are broader system requirements.\nThe primary keys within a database are used to define the relationships among the tables. When a PK migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key (FK) in the other table. When each cell can contain only one value and the PK migrates into a regular entity table, this design pattern can represent either a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship. Most relational database designs resolve many-to-many relationships by creating an additional table that contains the PKs from both of the other entity tables\u00a0\u2013 the relationship becomes an entity; the resolution table is then named appropriately and the two FKs are combined to form a PK. The migration of PKs to other tables is the second major reason why system-assigned integers are used normally as PKs; there is usually neither efficiency nor clarity in migrating a bunch of other types of columns.\nRelationships.\nRelationships are a logical connection between different tables (entities), established on the basis of interaction among these tables. These relationships can be modelled as an entity-relationship model.\nTransactions.\nIn order for a database management system (DBMS) to operate efficiently and accurately, it must use ACID transactions.\nStored procedures.\nPart of the programming within a RDBMS is accomplished using stored procedures (SPs). Often procedures can be used to greatly reduce the amount of information transferred within and outside of a system. For increased security, the system design may grant access to only the stored procedures and not directly to the tables. Fundamental stored procedures contain the logic needed to insert new and update existing data. More complex procedures may be written to implement additional rules and logic related to processing or selecting the data.\nTerminology.\nThe relational database was first defined in June 1970 by Edgar Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Codd's view of what qualifies as an RDBMS is summarized in Codd's 12 rules. A relational database has become the predominant type of database. Other models besides the \"relational model\" include the hierarchical database model and the network model.\nThe table below summarizes some of the most important relational database terms and the corresponding SQL term:\nRelations or tables.\nIn a relational database, a \"relation\" is a set of tuples that have the same attributes. A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a table, which is organized into rows and columns. All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints.\nThe relational model specifies that the tuples of a relation have no specific order and that the tuples, in turn, impose no order on the attributes. Applications access data by specifying queries, which use operations such as \"select\" to identify tuples, \"project\" to identify attributes, and \"join\" to combine relations. Relations can be modified using the \"insert\", \"delete\", and \"update\" operators. New tuples can supply explicit values or be derived from a query. Similarly, queries identify tuples for updating or deleting.\nTuples by definition are unique. If the tuple contains a candidate or primary key then obviously it is unique; however, a primary key need not be defined for a row or record to be a tuple. The definition of a tuple requires that it be unique, but does not require a primary key to be defined. Because a tuple is unique, its attributes by definition constitute a superkey.\nBase and derived relations.\nAll data are stored and accessed via relations. Relations that store data are called \"base relations\", and in implementations are called \"tables\". Other relations do not store data, but are computed by applying relational operations to other relations. These relations are sometimes called \"derived relations\". In implementations these are called \"views\" or \"queries\". Derived relations are convenient in that they act as a single relation, even though they may grab information from several relations. Also, derived relations can be used as an abstraction layer.\nDomain.\nA domain describes the set of possible values for a given attribute, and can be considered a constraint on the value of the attribute. Mathematically, attaching a domain to an attribute means that any value for the attribute must be an element of the specified set. The character string \"ABC\", for instance, is not in the integer domain, but the integer value \"123\" is. Another example of domain describes the possible values for the field \"CoinFace\" as (\"Heads\",\"Tails\"). So, the field \"CoinFace\" will not accept input values like (0,1) or (H,T).\nConstraints.\nConstraints are often used to make it possible to further restrict the domain of an attribute. For instance, a constraint can restrict a given integer attribute to values between 1 and 10. Constraints provide one method of implementing business rules in the database and support subsequent data use within the application layer. SQL implements constraint functionality in the form of check constraints.\nConstraints restrict the data that can be stored in relations. These are usually defined using expressions that result in a Boolean value, indicating whether or not the data satisfies the constraint. Constraints can apply to single attributes, to a tuple (restricting combinations of attributes) or to an entire relation.\nSince every attribute has an associated domain, there are constraints (domain constraints). The two principal rules for the relational model are known as entity integrity and referential integrity.\nPrimary key.\nEvery relation/table has a primary key, this being a consequence of a relation being a set. A primary key uniquely specifies a tuple within a table. While natural attributes (attributes used to describe the data being entered) are sometimes good primary keys, surrogate keys are often used instead. A surrogate key is an artificial attribute assigned to an object which uniquely identifies it (for instance, in a table of information about students at a school they might all be assigned a student ID in order to differentiate them). The surrogate key has no intrinsic (inherent) meaning, but rather is useful through its ability to uniquely identify a tuple.\nAnother common occurrence, especially in regard to N:M cardinality is the composite key. A composite key is a key made up of two or more attributes within a table that (together) uniquely identify a record.\nForeign key.\nForeign key refers to a field in a relational table that matches the primary key column of another table. It relates the two keys. Foreign keys need not have unique values in the referencing relation. A foreign key can be used to cross-reference tables, and it effectively uses the values of attributes in the referenced relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the referencing relation. The concept is described formally as: \"For all tuples in the referencing relation projected over the referencing attributes, there must exist a tuple in the referenced relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of the referencing attributes match the corresponding values in the referenced attributes.\"\nStored procedures.\nA stored procedure is executable code that is associated with, and generally stored in, the database. Stored procedures usually collect and customize common operations, like inserting a tuple into a relation, gathering statistical information about usage patterns, or encapsulating complex business logic and calculations. Frequently they are used as an application programming interface (API) for security or simplicity. Implementations of stored procedures on SQL RDBMS's often allow developers to take advantage of procedural extensions (often vendor-specific) to the standard declarative SQL syntax.\nStored procedures are not part of the relational database model, but all commercial implementations include them.\nIndex.\nAn index is one way of providing quicker access to data. Indices can be created on any combination of attributes on a relation. Queries that filter using those attributes can find matching tuples directly using the index (similar to Hash table lookup), without having to check each tuple in turn. This is analogous to using the index of a book to go directly to the page on which the information you are looking for is found, so that you do not have to read the entire book to find what you are looking for. Relational databases typically supply multiple indexing techniques, each of which is optimal for some combination of data distribution, relation size, and typical access pattern. Indices are usually implemented via B+ trees, R-trees, and bitmaps.\nIndices are usually not considered part of the database, as they are considered an implementation detail, though indices are usually maintained by the same group that maintains the other parts of the database. The use of efficient indexes on both primary and foreign keys can dramatically improve query performance. This is because B-tree indexes result in query times proportional to log(n) where n is the number of rows in a table and hash indexes result in constant time queries (no size dependency as long as the relevant part of the index fits into memory).\nRelational operations.\nQueries made against the relational database, and the derived relvars in the database are expressed in a relational calculus or a relational algebra. In his original relational algebra, Codd introduced eight relational operators in two groups of four operators each. The first four operators were based on the traditional mathematical set operations:\nThe remaining operators proposed by Codd involve special operations specific to relational databases:\nOther operators have been introduced or proposed since Codd's introduction of the original eight including relational comparison operators and extensions that offer support for nesting and hierarchical data, among others.\nNormalization.\nNormalization was first proposed by Codd as an integral part of the relational model. It encompasses a set of procedures designed to eliminate non-simple domains (non-atomic values) and the redundancy (duplication) of data, which in turn prevents data manipulation anomalies and loss of data integrity. The most common forms of normalization applied to databases are called the normal forms.\nRDBMS.\nConnolly and Begg define database management system (DBMS) as a \"software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database\". RDBMS is an extension of that initialism that is sometimes used when the underlying database is relational.\nAn alternative definition for a relational database management system is a database management system (DBMS) based on the relational model. Most databases in widespread use today are based on this model.\nRDBMSs have been a common option for the storage of information in databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s. Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases, because RDBMS were easier to implement and administer. Nonetheless, relational stored data received continued, unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the 1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the so-called object\u2013relational impedance mismatch between relational databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML database management systems in the 1990s. However, due to the expanse of technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS databases.\nDistributed relational databases.\nDistributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) was designed by a workgroup within IBM in the period 1988 to 1994. DRDA enables network connected relational databases to cooperate to fulfill SQL requests.\nThe messages, protocols, and structural components of DRDA are defined by the Distributed Data Management Architecture.\nList of database engines.\nAccording to DB-Engines, in December 2024 the most popular systems on the db-engines.com web site were:\nAccording to research company Gartner, in 2011, the five leading proprietary software relational database vendors by revenue were Oracle (48.8%), IBM (20.2%), Microsoft (17.0%), SAP including Sybase (4.6%), and Teradata (3.7%).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25874", "revid": "7770027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25874", "title": "Rule of Saint Benedict", "text": "Book of monastic precepts written in 516\nThe Rule of Saint Benedict () is a book of precepts written in Latin c.\u2009530 by St. Benedict of Nursia (c. AD 480\u2013550) for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot.\nThe spirit of Saint Benedict's Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: \"pax\" (\"peace\") and the traditional \"ora et labora\" (\"pray and work\"). Compared to other precepts, the Rule provides a moderate path between individual zeal and formulaic institutionalism; because of this middle ground, it has been widely popular. Benedict's concerns were his views of the needs of monks in a community environment: namely, to establish due order, to foster an understanding of the relational nature of human beings, and to provide a spiritual father to support and strengthen the individual's ascetic effort and the spiritual growth that is required for the fulfillment of the human vocation, theosis.\nThe \"Rule of Saint Benedict\" has been used by Benedictines for 15 centuries, and thus St. Benedict is sometimes regarded as the founder of Western monasticism due to the reforming influence that his rules had on the contemporary Catholic hierarchy. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Benedict intended to found a religious order in the modern sense, and it was not until the Late Middle Ages that mention was made of an \"Order of Saint Benedict\". His \"Rule\" was written as a guide for individual, autonomous communities: all Benedictine Houses (and the Congregations in which they have grouped themselves) still remain self-governing. Advantages seen in retaining this unique Benedictine emphasis on autonomy include cultivating models of tightly bonded communities and contemplative lifestyles. Perceived disadvantages comprise geographical isolation from important activities in adjacent communities. Other perceived losses include inefficiency and lack of mobility in the service of others, and insufficient appeal to potential members. These different emphases emerged within the framework of the Rule in the course of history and are to some extent present within the Benedictine Confederation and the Cistercian Orders of the Common and the Strict Observance.\nOrigins.\nChristian monasticism first appeared in the Egyptian desert, before Benedict of Nursia. Under the inspiration of Saint Anthony the Great (251\u2013356), ascetic monks led by Saint Pachomius (286\u2013346) formed the first Christian monastic communities under what became known as an \"Abbot\", from the Aramaic \"abba\" (father).Within a generation, both solitary as well as communal monasticism became very popular and spread outside of Egypt, first to Palestine and the Judean Desert and thence to Syria and North Africa. Saint Basil of Caesarea codified the precepts for these eastern monasteries in his Ascetic Rule, or \"Ascetica\", which is still used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nIn the West in about the year 500, Benedict became so upset by the immorality of society in Rome that he gave up his studies there, at age fourteen, and chose the life of an ascetic monk in the pursuit of personal holiness, living as a hermit in a cave near the rugged region of Subiaco. In time, setting an example with his zeal, he began to attract disciples. After considerable initial struggles with his first community at Subiaco, he eventually founded the monastery of Monte Cassino in 529, where he wrote his Rule near the end of his life.\nIn chapter 73, Saint Benedict commends the Rule of Saint Basil and alludes to further authorities. He was probably aware of the Rule written by Pachomius (or attributed to him), and his Rule also shows influence by the Rule of St Augustine of Hippo and the writings of Saint John Cassian. Benedict's greatest debt, however, may be to the anonymous document known as the Rule of the Master, which Benedict seems to have radically excised, expanded, revised and corrected in the light of his own considerable experience and insight. Saint Benedict's work expounded upon preconceived ideas that were present in the religious community only making minor changes more in line with the time period relevant to his system.\nThe \"Rule\" was translated into Armenian by Nerses of Lampron in the 10th century and is used by the Armenian Catholic Mekhitarists today. It was also translated into Old English by \u00c6thelwold.\nOverview.\nThe \"Rule\" opens with a hortatory preface, drawing on the \"Admonitio ad filium spiritualem\", in which Saint Benedict sets forth the main principles of the religious life, \"viz.\": the renunciation of one's own will and arming oneself \"with the strong and noble weapons of obedience\" under the banner of \"the true King, Christ the Lord\" (Prol. 3). He proposes to establish a \"school for the Lord's service\" (Prol. 45) in which the \"way to salvation\" (Prol. 48) shall be taught, so that by persevering in the monastery till death his disciples may \"through patience share in the passion of Christ that [they] may deserve also to share in his Kingdom\" (Prol. 50, \"passionibus Christi per patientiam participemur, ut et regno eius mereamur esse consortes\"; note: Latin and have the same root, \"cf.\" Fry, RB 1980, p.167).\nOutline of the Benedictine life.\nSaint Benedict's model for the monastic life was the family, with the abbot as father and all the monks as brothers. Priesthood was not initially an important part of Benedictine monasticism \u2013 monks used the services of their local priest. Because of this, almost all the Rule is applicable to communities of women under the authority of an abbess. This appeal to multiple groups would later make the Rule of Saint Benedict an integral set of guidelines for the development of the Christian faith.\nSaint Benedict's Rule organises the monastic day into regular periods of communal and private prayer, sleep, spiritual reading, and manual labour \u2013 \"ut in omnibus glorificetur Deus\", \"that in all [things] God may be glorified\" (\"cf.\" Rule ch. 57.9). In later centuries, intellectual work and teaching took the place of farming, crafts, or other forms of manual labour for many \u2013 if not most \u2013 Benedictines.\nTraditionally, the daily life of the Benedictine revolved around the eight canonical hours. The monastic timetable, or Horarium, would begin at midnight with the service, or \"office\", of \"Matins\" (today also called the Office of Readings), followed by the morning office of \"Lauds\" at 3\u00a0am. Before the advent of wax candles in the 14th century, this office was said in the dark or with minimal lighting; and monks were expected to memorise everything. These services could be very long, sometimes lasting till dawn, but usually consisted of a chant, three antiphons, three psalms, and three lessons, along with celebrations of any local saints' days. Afterwards the monks would retire for a few hours of sleep and then rise at 6am to wash and attend the office of \"Prime\". They then gathered in \"Chapter\" to receive instructions for the day and to attend to any judicial business. Then came private Mass or spiritual reading or work until 9am when the office of \"Terce\" was said, and then High Mass. At noon came the office of \"Sext\" and the midday meal. After a brief period of communal recreation, the monk could retire to rest until the office of \"None\" at 3pm. This was followed by farming and housekeeping work until after twilight, the evening prayer of \"Vespers\" at 6pm, then the night prayer of \"Compline\" at 9pm, and retiring to bed, before beginning the cycle again. In modern times, this timetable is often changed to accommodate any apostolate outside the monastic enclosure (e.g. the running of a school or parish).\nMany Benedictine Houses have a number of \"Oblates (secular)\" who are affiliated with them in prayer, having made a formal private promise (usually renewed annually) to follow the Rule of St Benedict in their private life as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit.\nIn recent years discussions have occasionally been held concerning the applicability of the principles and spirit of the Rule of Saint Benedict to the secular working environment.\nReforms.\nDuring the more than 1500 years of their existence, Benedictines have seen cycles of flourish and decline. Several reform movements sought more intense devotion to both the letter and spirit of the Rule of St Benedict, at least as they understood it. Examples include the Camaldolese, the Cistercians, the Trappists (a reform of the Cistercians), and the Sylvestrines.\nSecular significance.\nCharlemagne had Benedict's Rule copied and distributed to encourage monks throughout western Europe to follow it as a standard. Beyond its religious influences, the Rule of St Benedict was one of the most important written works to shape medieval Europe, embodying the ideas of a written constitution and the rule of law. It also incorporated a degree of democracy in a non-democratic society, and dignified manual labor.\nPopular motto \"Ora et labora\".\nAlthough not stated explicitly in the rule, the motto \"Ora et labora\" is widely considered to be a shortform capturing the spirit of the rule.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.\nWhile the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is mostly based on a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others.\nThe goals of treatment are to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when the disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations.\nRA affects about 24.5 million people as of 2015. This is 0.5\u20131% of adults in the developed world with between 5 and 50 per 100,000 people newly developing the condition each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. It resulted in 38,000 deaths in 2013, up from 28,000 deaths in 1990. The first recognized description of RA was made in 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landr\u00e9-Beauvais (1772\u20131840) of Paris. The term \"rheumatoid arthritis\" is based on the Greek for watery and inflamed joints.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nRA primarily affects joints, but it also affects other organs in more than 15\u201325% of cases. Associated problems include cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, interstitial lung disease, infection, cancer, feeling tired, depression, mental difficulties, and trouble working.\nJoints.\nArthritis of joints involves inflammation of the synovial membrane. Joints become swollen, tender, and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected (polyarthritis). Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands, feet and cervical spine, but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved. Synovitis can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface, causing deformity and loss of function. The fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), highly specialized mesenchymal cells found in the synovial membrane, have an active and prominent role in these pathogenic processes of the rheumatic joints.\nRA typically manifests with signs of inflammation, with the affected joints being swollen, warm, painful, and stiff, particularly early in the morning on waking or following prolonged inactivity. Increased stiffness early in the morning is often a prominent feature of the disease and typically lasts for more than an hour. Gentle movements may relieve symptoms in the early stages of the disease. These signs help distinguish rheumatoid from non-inflammatory problems of the joints, such as osteoarthritis. In arthritis of non-inflammatory causes, signs of inflammation and early morning stiffness are less prominent.\nThe pain associated with RA is induced at the site of inflammation and classified as nociceptive as opposed to neuropathic. The joints are often affected in a fairly symmetrical fashion, although this is not specific, and the initial presentation may be asymmetrical.\nAs the pathology progresses, the inflammatory activity leads to tendon tethering and erosion and destruction of the joint surface, which impairs range of movement and leads to deformity. The fingers may develop almost any deformity depending on which joints are most involved. Specific deformities, which also occur in osteoarthritis, include ulnar deviation, boutonniere deformity (also \"buttonhole deformity\", flexion of proximal interphalangeal joint and extension of distal interphalangeal joint of the hand), swan neck deformity (hyperextension at proximal interphalangeal joint and flexion at distal interphalangeal joint) and \"Z-thumb.\" \"Z-thumb\" or \"Z-deformity\" consists of hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint, fixed flexion, and subluxation of the metacarpophalangeal joint and gives a \"Z\" appearance to the thumb. The hammer toe deformity may be seen. In the worst case, joints are known as arthritis mutilans due to the mutilating nature of the deformities.\nSkin.\nThe rheumatoid nodule, which is sometimes in the skin, is the most common non-joint feature and occurs in 30% of people who have RA. It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a \"necrotizing granuloma\". The initial pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the synovitis, since similar structural features occur in both. The nodule has a central area of fibrinoid necrosis that may be fissured and which corresponds to the fibrin-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space. Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading macrophages and fibroblasts, corresponding to the intimal layer in synovium and a cuff of connective tissue containing clusters of lymphocytes and plasma cells, corresponding to the subintimal zone in synovitis. The typical rheumatoid nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences, such as the elbow, the heel, the knuckles, or other areas that sustain repeated mechanical stress. Nodules are associated with a positive RF (rheumatoid factor) titer, ACPA, and severe erosive arthritis. Rarely, these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body.\nSeveral forms of vasculitis occur in RA, but are mostly seen with long-standing and untreated disease. The most common presentation is due to involvement of small- and medium-sized vessels. Rheumatoid vasculitis can thus commonly present with skin ulceration and vasculitic nerve infarction known as mononeuritis multiplex.\nOther, rather rare, skin associated symptoms include pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome, drug reactions, erythema nodosum, lobe panniculitis, atrophy of finger skin, palmar erythema, and skin fragility (often worsened by corticosteroid use).\nDiffuse alopecia areata (Diffuse AA) occurs more commonly in people with rheumatoid arthritis. RA is also seen more often in those with relatives who have AA.\nLungs.\nLung fibrosis is a recognized complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It is also a rare but well-recognized consequence of therapy (for example with methotrexate and leflunomide). Caplan's syndrome describes lung nodules in individuals with RA and additional exposure to coal dust. Exudative pleural effusions are also associated with RA.\nHeart and blood vessels.\nPeople with RA are more prone to atherosclerosis, and risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke is markedly increased.\nOther possible complications that may arise include: pericarditis, endocarditis, left ventricular failure, valvulitis and fibrosis. Many people with RA do not experience the same chest pain that others feel when they have angina or myocardial infarction. To reduce cardiovascular risk, it is crucial to maintain optimal control of the inflammation caused by RA (which may be involved in causing the cardiovascular risk), and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to cardiovascular risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications, and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable.\nBlood.\nVarious mechanisms can cause anemia in rheumatoid arthritis, which is by far the most common abnormality of the blood cells. The chronic inflammation caused by RA leads to raised hepcidin levels, leading to anemia of chronic disease where iron is poorly absorbed and also sequestered into macrophages. The red cells are of normal size and color (normocytic and Normochromic).\nA low white blood cell count usually only occurs in people with Felty's syndrome with an enlarged liver and spleen. The mechanism of neutropenia is complex. An increased platelet count occurs when inflammation is uncontrolled.\nOther.\nThe role of the circadian clock in rheumatoid arthritis suggests a correlation between an early morning rise in circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and painful morning joint stiffness.\nKidneys.\nRenal amyloidosis can occur as a consequence of untreated chronic inflammation. Treatment with penicillamine or gold salts such as sodium aurothiomalate are recognized causes of membranous nephropathy.\nEyes.\nThe eye can be directly affected in the form of episcleritis or scleritis, which, when severe, can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision, as well as being painful. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.\nLiver.\nLiver problems in people with rheumatoid arthritis may be from the underlying disease process or the medications used to treat the disease. A coexisting autoimmune liver disease, such as primary biliary cirrhosis or autoimmune hepatitis may also cause problems.\nNeurological.\nPeripheral neuropathy and mononeuritis multiplex may occur. The most common problem is carpal tunnel syndrome caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist.\nRheumatoid disease of the spine can lead to myelopathy. \nAtlanto-axial subluxation can occur, owing to erosion of the odontoid process or transverse ligaments in the cervical spine connection to the skull. Such an erosion (&gt;3mm) can give rise to vertebrae slipping over one another and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to quadriplegia or even death.\nVertigo may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis via the following associations that can cause vertigo:\nConstitutional symptoms.\nConstitutional symptoms including fatigue, low grade fever, malaise, morning stiffness, loss of appetite and loss of weight are common systemic manifestations seen in people with active RA.\nBones.\nLocal osteoporosis occurs in RA around the inflamed joints. It is postulated to be partially caused by inflammatory cytokines. More general osteoporosis is probably contributed to by immobility, systemic cytokine effects, local cytokine release in bone marrow, and corticosteroid therapy.\nCancer.\nThe incidence of lymphoma is increased, although it is uncommon and associated with the chronic inflammation, not the treatment of RA. The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer is increased in people with RA compared to the general population, an association possibly due to the use of immunosuppression agents for treating RA.\nTeeth.\nPeriodontitis and tooth loss are common in people with rheumatoid arthritis.\nRisk factors.\nRA is a systemic (whole body) autoimmune disease. Certain genetic and environmental factors affect the risk of RA.\nGenetic.\nWorldwide, RA affects approximately 1% of the adult population and occurs in one in 1,000 children. Studies show that RA primarily affects individuals between the ages of 40\u201360 years and is seen more commonly in females. A family history of RA increases the risk around three to five times; as of 2016, it was estimated that genetics may account for 40\u201365% of cases of seropositive RA, but only around 20% for seronegative RA. RA is strongly associated with genes of the inherited tissue type major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen. HLA-DR4 is the major genetic factor implicated \u2013 the relative importance varies across ethnic groups.\nGenome-wide association studies examining single-nucleotide polymorphisms have found around one hundred alleles associated with RA risk. Risk alleles within the HLA (particularly HLA-DRB1) genes harbor more risk than other loci. The HLA encodes proteins that control recognition of self- versus non-self molecules. Other risk loci include genes affecting co-stimulatory immune pathways\u2014for example CD28 and CD40, cytokine signaling, lymphocyte receptor activation threshold (e.g., PTPN22), and innate immune activation\u2014appear to have less influence than HLA mutations.\nDespite the strong genetic components of the disease, identical twin studies have shown only 12\u201315% concordance for twins raised in separate households. This suggests that rheumatoid arthritis most likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors in the majority of cases.\nEnvironmental.\nThere are established epigenetic and environmental risk factors for RA. Smoking is an established risk factor for RA in Caucasian populations, increasing the risk three times compared to non-smokers, particularly in men, heavy smokers, and those who are rheumatoid factor positive. Modest alcohol consumption may be protective.\nSilica exposure has been linked to RA.\nPreliminary research is investigating whether the incidence of inflammatory arthritis, including RA, may be increased following COVID-19.\nNegative findings.\nNo infectious agent has been consistently linked with RA and there is no evidence of disease clustering to indicate its infectious cause, but periodontal disease has been consistently associated with RA.\nThe many negative findings suggest that either the trigger varies or that it might be a chance event inherent in the immune response. \nPathophysiology.\nRA primarily starts as a state of persistent cellular activation leading to autoimmunity and immune complexes in joints and other organs where it manifests.\nThe clinical manifestations of disease are primarily inflammation of the synovial membrane and joint damage, and the fibroblast-like synoviocytes play a key role in these pathogenic processes. Three phases of progression of RA are an initiation phase (due to non-specific inflammation), an amplification phase (due to T cell activation), and chronic inflammatory phase, with tissue injury resulting from the cytokines, IL\u20131, TNF-alpha, and IL\u20136.\nNon-specific inflammation.\nFactors allowing an abnormal immune response, once initiated, become permanent and chronic. These factors are genetic disorders which change regulation of the adaptive immune response. Genetic factors interact with environmental risk factors for RA, with cigarette smoking as the most clearly defined risk factor.\nOther environmental and hormonal factors may explain higher risks for women, including onset after childbirth and hormonal medications. A possibility for increased susceptibility is that negative feedback mechanisms \u2013 which normally maintain tolerance \u2013 are overtaken by positive feedback mechanisms for certain antigens, such as IgG Fc bound by rheumatoid factor and citrullinated fibrinogen bound by antibodies to citrullinated peptides (ACPA \u2013 Anti\u2013citrullinated protein antibody). A debate on the relative roles of B-cell produced immune complexes and T cell products in inflammation in RA has continued for 30 years, but neither cell is necessary at the site of inflammation, only autoantibodies to IgGFc, known as rheumatoid factors and ACPA, with ACPA having an 80% specificity for diagnosing RA. As with other autoimmune diseases, people with RA have abnormally glycosylated antibodies, which are believed to promote joint inflammation.\nAmplification in the synovium.\nOnce the generalized abnormal immune response has become established, which may take several years before any symptoms occur, plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes produce rheumatoid factors and ACPA of the IgG and IgM classes in large quantities. These activate macrophages through Fc receptor and complement binding, which is part of the intense inflammation in RA. Binding of an autoreactive antibody to the Fc receptors is mediated through the antibody's N-glycans, which are altered to promote inflammation in people with RA.\nThis contributes to local inflammation in a joint, specifically the synovium, with edema, vasodilation and entry of activated T-cells, mainly CD4 in microscopically nodular aggregates and CD8 in microscopically diffuse infiltrates.\nSynovial macrophages and dendritic cells function as antigen-presenting cells by expressing MHC class II molecules, which establishes the immune reaction in the tissue.\nChronic inflammation.\nThe disease progresses by forming granulation tissue at the edges of the synovial lining, pannus with extensive angiogenesis and enzymes causing tissue damage. The fibroblast-like synoviocytes have a prominent role in these pathogenic processes. The synovium thickens, cartilage and underlying bone disintegrate, and the joint deteriorates, with raised calprotectin levels serving as a biomarker of these events.\nCytokines and chemokines attract and accumulate immune cells, i.e., activated T- and B cells, monocytes, and macrophages from activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes, in the joint space. By signalling through RANKL and RANK, they eventually trigger osteoclast production, which degrades bone tissue. The fibroblast-like synoviocytes that are present in the synovium during rheumatoid arthritis display altered phenotype compared to the cells present in normal tissues. The aggressive phenotype of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis and the effect these cells have on the microenvironment of the joint can be summarized into hallmarks that distinguish them from healthy fibroblast-like synoviocytes. These hallmark features of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis are divided into seven cell-intrinsic hallmarks and four cell-extrinsic hallmarks. The cell-intrinsic hallmarks are: reduced apoptosis, impaired contact inhibition, increased migratory invasive potential, changed epigenetic landscape, temporal and spatial heterogeneity, genomic instability and mutations, and reprogrammed cellular metabolism. The cell-extrinsic hallmarks of FLS in RA are: promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion, contributes to cartilage degradation, induces synovial angiogenesis, and recruits and stimulates immune cells.\nDiagnosis.\nImaging.\nX-rays of the hands and feet are generally performed when many joints are affected. In RA, there may be no changes in the early stages of the disease, or the X-ray may show osteopenia near the joint, soft tissue swelling, and a smaller than normal joint space. As the disease advances, there may be bony erosions and subluxation. Other medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are also used in RA.\nTechnical advances in ultrasonography, like high-frequency transducers (10\u00a0MHz or higher), have improved the spatial resolution of ultrasound images, depicting 20% more erosions than conventional radiography. Color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound are useful in assessing the degree of synovial inflammation as they can show vascular signals of active synovitis. This is important since in the early stages of RA, the synovium is primarily affected, and synovitis seems to be the best predictive marker of future joint damage.\nBlood tests.\nWhen RA is clinically suspected, a physician may test for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs measured as anti-CCP antibodies).\nThe test is positive approximately two-thirds of the time, but a negative RF or CCP antibody does not rule out RA; rather, the arthritis is called \"seronegative\", which occurs in approximately a third of people with RA. During the first year of illness, rheumatoid factor is more likely to be negative with some individuals becoming seropositive over time. RF is a non-specific antibody and seen in about 10% of healthy people, in many other chronic infections like hepatitis C, and chronic autoimmune diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Therefore, the test is not specific for RA.\nHence, new serological tests check for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies ACPAs. These tests are again positive in 61\u201375% of all RA cases, but with a specificity of around 95%. As with RF, ACPAs are many times present before symptoms have started.\nThe by far most common clinical test for ACPAs is the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti CCP) ELISA. In 2008, a serological point-of-care test for the early detection of RA combined the detection of RF and anti-MCV with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 99.7%.\nTo improve the diagnostic capture rate in the early detection of patients with RA and to risk-stratify these individuals, the rheumatology field continues to seek complementary markers to both RF and anti-CCP. 14-3-3\u03b7 (YWHAH) is one such marker that complements RF and anti-CCP, along with other serological measures like C-reactive protein. In a systematic review, 14-3-3\u03b7 has been described as a welcome addition to the rheumatology field. The authors indicate that the serum-based 14-3-\u03b7 marker is additive to the armamentarium of existing tools available to clinicians, and that there is adequate clinical evidence to support its clinical benefits.\nOther blood tests are usually done to differentiate from other causes of arthritis, like the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, full blood count, kidney function, liver enzymes and other immunological tests (e.g., antinuclear antibody/ANA) are all performed at this stage. Elevated ferritin levels can reveal hemochromatosis, a mimic of RA, or be a sign of Still's disease, a seronegative, usually juvenile, variant of rheumatoid Arthritis.\nClassification criteria.\nIn 2010, the \"2010 ACR / EULAR Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria\" were introduced.\nThe new criteria are not diagnostic criteria, but are classification criteria to identify disease with a high likelihood of developing a chronic form. However a score of 6 or greater unequivocally classifies a person with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.\nThese new classification criteria overruled the \"old\" ACR criteria of 1987 and are adapted for early RA diagnosis. The \"new\" classification criteria, jointly published by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), establish a point value between 0 and 10. Four areas are covered in the diagnosis:\nThe new criteria incorporate the growing understanding of and the advances in diagnosing and treating RA. In the \"new\" criteria, serology and autoimmune diagnostics carry major weight, as ACPA detection is appropriate to diagnose the disease in an early state, before joints destructions occur. Destruction of the joints seen in radiological images was a significant point in the ACR criteria from 1987. This criterion is no longer regarded to be relevant, as this is just the type of damage that treatment is meant to avoid.\nDifferential diagnoses.\nSeveral other medical conditions can resemble RA, and need to be distinguished from it at the time of diagnosis:\nRarer causes which usually behave differently but may cause joint pains:\nSometimes arthritis is in an undifferentiated stage (i.e., none of the above criteria is positive), even if synovitis is witnessed and assessed with ultrasound imaging.\nDifficult-to-treat.\nRheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA) is a specific classification RA by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR).\nSigns of illness:\nFactors contributing to difficult-to-treat disease:\nGenetic factors.\nGenetic factors such as HLA-DR1B1, TRAF1, PSORS1C1 and microRNA 146a are associated with difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis, other gene polymorphisms seem to be correlated with response to biologic modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). The next one is the FOXO3A gene region been reported as associated with the worst disorder. The minor allele at FOXO3A summons a differential response of monocytes in RA patients. FOXO3A can provide an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF\u03b1. Possible gene polymorphism: STAT4, PTPN2, PSORS1C1 and TRAF3IP2 genes had been correlated with response to TNF inhibitors.\nHLA-DR1 and HLA-DRB1 gene.\nThe \"HLA\"-\"DRB1\" gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Currently, at least 2479 different versions of the \"HLA\"-\"DRB1\" gene have been identified. The presence of HLA-DRB1 alleles seems to predict radiographic damage, which may be partially mediated by ACPA development, and also elevated sera inflammatory levels and high swollen joint count. HLA-DR1 is encoded by the most risk allele HLA-DRB1, which shares a conserved 5-aminoacid sequence that is correlated with the development of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies. HLA-DRB1 gene have more strong correlation with disease development. Susceptibility to and outcome for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be associated with particular HLA-DR alleles, but these alleles vary among ethnic groups and geographic areas.\nMicroRNAs.\nMicroRNAs are a factor in the development of that type of disease. MicroRNAs usually operate as a negative regulator of the expression of target proteins, and their increased concentration after biologic treatment (bDMARDs) or after anti-rheumatic drugs. The levels of miRNA before and after anti-TNFa/DMRADs combination therapy are potential novel biomarkers for predicting and monitoring the outcome. For instance, some of them were found significantly upregulated by anti-TNFa/DMRADs combination therapy. For example, miRNA-16-5p, miRNA-23-3p, miRNA125b-5p, miRNA-126-3p, miRNA-146a-5p, miRNA-223-3p. Curious fact is that only responder patients showed an increase in those miRNAs after therapy, and paralleled the reduction of TNF\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, rheumatoid factor (RF), and C-reactive protein (CRP).\nMonitoring progression.\nMany tools can be used to monitor remission in rheumatoid arthritis.\nformula_1\nFrom this, the disease activity of the affected person can be classified as follows:\nIt is not always a reliable indicator of treatment effect. One major limitation is that low-grade synovitis may be missed.\nManagement.\nThere is no cure for RA, but treatments can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Disease-modifying treatment has the best results when it is started early and aggressively. The results of a recent systematic review found that combination therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and non-TNF biologics plus methotrexate (MTX) resulted in improved disease control, Disease Activity Score (DAS)-defined remission, and functional capacity compared with a single treatment of either methotrexate or a biologic alone.\nThe goals of treatment are to minimize symptoms such as pain and swelling, to prevent bone deformity (for example, bone erosions visible in X-rays), and to maintain day-to-day functioning. This is primarily addressed with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); dosed physical activity; analgesics and physical therapy may be used to help manage pain. RA should generally be treated with at least one specific anti-rheumatic medication while combination therapies and corticosteroids are common in treatment. The use of benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) to treat the pain is not recommended as it does not appear to help and is associated with risks.\nLifestyle.\nRegular exercise is recommended as both safe and effective to maintain muscle strength and overall physical function. Physical activity is beneficial for people with rheumatoid arthritis who experience fatigue, although there was little to no evidence to suggest that exercise may have an impact on physical function in the long term, a study found that carefully dosed exercise has shown significant improvements in patients with RA. Physical activity increases the production of synovial fluid, which lubricates the joints and reduces friction. Moderate effects have been found for aerobic exercises and resistance training on cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength in RA. Furthermore, physical activity had no detrimental side effects like increased disease activity in any exercise dimension. It is uncertain if eating or avoiding specific foods or other specific dietary measures help improve symptoms, but several studies have shown that high-vegetable diets improve RA symptoms, whereas high-meat diets make symptoms worse. Occupational therapy has a positive role to play in improving functional ability in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Weak evidence supports the use of wax baths (thermotherapy) to treat arthritis in the hands.\nEducational approaches that inform people about tools and strategies available to help them cope with rheumatoid arthritis may improve a person's psychological status and level of depression in the short term. Educating patients who have rheumatoid arthritis has shown a positive effect on how patients engage in their plan of care; the patient will be aware of fatigue, activity limitations, and pain and know possible side effects of how to manage this pain. Lack of knowledge can often lead to fear and limit adherence. Intervention by physical therapists plays a key role in offering proper tools for self-management, motivation in activities of daily living, and any assistive device use if needed. Patients will be assisted in managing neurologic impairments and musculoskeletal stiffness to maximize strength and function. Encouraging patients to balance physical activity with their everyday living can prevent further joint damage and provide a sense of control.\nThe use of extra-depth shoes and molded insoles may reduce pain during weight-bearing activities such as walking. Insoles may also prevent the progression of bunions.\nDisease-modifying agents.\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the primary treatment for RA. They are a diverse collection of drugs, grouped by use and convention. They have been found to improve symptoms, decrease joint damage, and improve overall functional abilities. DMARDs should be started early in the disease as they result in disease remission in approximately half of people and improved outcomes overall.\nThe following drugs are considered DMARDs: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, TNF inhibitors (certolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, anakinra, and auranofin. Additionally, rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies and are also DMARDs. Use of tocilizumab is associated with a risk of increased cholesterol levels.\nThe most commonly used agent is methotrexate, with other frequently used agents including sulfasalazine and leflunomide. Leflunomide is effective when used for 6\u201312 months, with similar effectiveness to methotrexate when used for 2 years. Sulfasalazine also appears to be most effective in the short-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\nHydroxychloroquine, in addition to its low toxicity profile, is considered effective for the treatment of moderate RA symptoms. Pharmacokinetic characteristics of Hydroxychloroquine are complex due to the large volume of distribution, significant tissue binding, and long terminal elimination half-life.\nHistorically, terminal elimination half-lives were considered very long, 40\u201350 days for Hydroxychloroquine as compared to up to 60 days\nfor Chloroquine. More recent studies suggest a shorter half-life of about 5 days. A long Hydroxychloroquine half-life is attributed to extensive tissue uptake rather than to an intrinsic inability to clear the drug. The expected delay in the attainment of steady-state concentrations (3\u20134 months) may be in part responsible for the slow therapeutic response observed with Hydroxychloroquine.\nAgents may be used in combination, however, people may experience greater side effects. Methotrexate is the most important and useful DMARD and is usually the first treatment. A combined approach with methotrexate and biologics improves ACR50, HAQ scores and RA remission rates. This benefit from the combination of methotrexate with biologics occurs both when this combination is the initial treatment and when drugs are prescribed in a sequential or step-up manner. Triple therapy consisting of methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine may also effectively control disease activity. Adverse effects should be monitored regularly with toxicity including gastrointestinal, hematologic, pulmonary, and hepatic. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain can be reduced by taking folic acid.\nRituximab combined with methotrexate appears to be more effective in improving symptoms compared to methotrexate alone. Rituximab works by decreasing levels of B-cells (an immune cell that is involved in inflammation). People taking rituximab had improved pain, function, reduced disease activity, and reduced joint damage based on X-ray images. After 6 months, 21% more people had improvement in their symptoms using rituximab and methotrexate.\nBiological agents should generally be used only if methotrexate and other conventional agents are not effective after a trial of three months. They are associated with a higher rate of serious infections as compared to other DMARDs. Biological DMARD agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF inhibitors) such as infliximab; interleukin 1 blockers such as anakinra, monoclonal antibodies against B cells such as rituximab, interleukin 6 blockers such as tocilizumab, and T cell co-stimulation blockers such as abatacept. They are often used in combination with either methotrexate or leflunomide. Biologic monotherapy or tofacitinib with methotrexate may improve ACR50, RA remission rates and function. Abatacept should not be used at the same time as other biologics. In those who are well controlled (low disease activity) on TNF inhibitors, decreasing the dose does not appear to affect overall function. Discontinuation of TNF inhibitors (as opposed to gradually lowering the dose) by people with low disease activity may lead to increased disease activity and may affect remission, damage that is visible on an x-ray, and a person's function. People should be screened for latent tuberculosis before starting any TNF inhibitor therapy to avoid reactivation of tuberculosis.\nTNF inhibitors and methotrexate appear to have similar effectiveness when used alone, and better results are obtained when used together. Golimumab is effective when used with methotraxate. TNF inhibitors may have equivalent effectiveness, with etanercept appearing to be the safest. Injecting etanercept, in addition to methotrexate twice a week, may improve ACR50 and decrease radiographic progression for up to 3 years. Abatacept appears effective for RA with 20% more people improving with treatment than without but long term safety studies are yet unavailable. Adalimumab slows the time for the radiographic progression when used for 52 weeks. However, there is a lack of evidence to distinguish between the biologics available for RA. Issues with the biologics include their high cost and association with infections, including tuberculosis. Use of biological agents may reduce fatigue. The mechanism of how biologics reduce fatigue is unclear.\nGold and cyclosporin.\nSodium aurothiomalate, auranofin, and cyclosporin are less commonly used due to more common adverse effects. However, cyclosporin was found to be effective in progressive RA when used up to one year.\nHydrogen Therapy.\nPatients with RA given H2-water hydrogen therapy for four weeks showed significant improvement of symptoms.\nAnti-inflammatory and analgesic agents.\nGlucocorticoids can be used in the short term and at the lowest dose possible for flare-ups and while waiting for slow-onset drugs to take effect. Combination of glucocorticoids and conventional therapy has shown a decrease in rate of erosion of bones. Steroids may be injected into affected joints during the initial period of RA, before the use of DMARDs or oral steroids.\nNon-NSAID drugs to relieve pain, like paracetamol may be used to help alleviate the pain symptoms; they do not change the underlying disease. The use of paracetamol may be associated with the risk of developing ulcers.\nNSAIDs reduce both pain and stiffness in those with RA but do not affect the underlying disease and appear to have no effect on people's long term disease course and thus are no longer first line agents. NSAIDs should be used with caution in those with gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or kidney problems. Rofecoxib was withdrawn from the global market as its long-term use was associated to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. Use of methotrexate together with NSAIDs is safe, if adequate monitoring is done. COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, and NSAIDs are equally effective. A 2004 Cochrane review found that people preferred NSAIDs over paracetamol. However, it is yet to be clinically determined whether NSAIDs are more effective than paracetamol.\nThe neuromodulator agents, topical capsaicin, may be reasonable to use in an attempt to reduce pain. Nefopam by mouth and cannabis are not recommended as of 2012, as the risks of use appear to be greater than the benefits.\nLimited evidence suggests the use of weak oral opioids, but the adverse effects may outweigh the benefits.\nAlternatively, physical therapy has been tested and shown as an effective aid in reducing pain in patients with RA. As most RA is detected early and treated aggressively, physical therapy plays more of a preventative and compensatory role, aiding in pain management alongside regular rheumatic therapy.\nSurgery.\nEspecially for affected fingers, hands, and wrists, synovectomy may be needed to prevent pain or tendon rupture when drug treatment has failed. Severely affected joints may require joint replacement surgery, such as knee replacement. Postoperatively, physiotherapy is always necessary. There is insufficient evidence to support surgical treatment on arthritic shoulders.\nPhysiotherapy.\nFor people with RA, physiotherapy may be used together with medical management. This may include cold and heat application, electronic stimulation, and hydrotherapy. Although medications improve symptoms of RA, muscle function is not regained when disease activity is controlled.\nPhysiotherapy promotes physical activity. In RA, physical activity like exercise in the appropriate dosage (frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, progression) and physical activity promotion is effective in improving cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and maintaining a long-term active lifestyle. Additionally, exercise can be useful for pain management in this population, specifically, conditioning exercise programs that include aerobic, isometric, and isotonic exercises. Due to the debilitating effects of the disease, people with RA can gain skills back through exercise because it increases the energy capacity of the muscles. In the short term, resistance exercises, with or without range of motion exercises, improve self-reported hand functions. Physical activity promotion according to the public health recommendations should be an integral part of standard care for people with RA and other arthritic diseases. Additionally, the combination of physical activities and cryotherapy show its efficacy on the disease activity and pain relief. The combination of aerobic activity and cryotherapy may be an innovative therapeutic strategy to improve the aerobic capacity in arthritis patients and consequently reduce their cardiovascular risk while minimizing pain and disease activity.\nCompression gloves.\nCompression gloves are handwear designed to help prevent the occurrence of various medical disorders relating to blood circulation in the wrists and hands. They can be used to treat the symptoms of arthritis, though the medical benefits may be limited.\nAlternative medicine.\nIn general, there is not enough evidence to support any complementary health approaches for RA, with safety concerns for some of them. Some mind and body practices and dietary supplements may help people with symptoms and therefore may be beneficial additions to conventional treatments, but there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions. A systematic review of CAM modalities (excluding fish oil) found that \" The available evidence does not support their current use in the management of RA.\" Studies showing beneficial effects in RA on a wide variety of CAM modalities are often affected by publication bias and are generally not high quality evidence such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\nA 2005 Cochrane review states that low level laser therapy can be tried to improve pain and morning stiffness due to rheumatoid arthritis as there are few side-effects.\nThere is limited evidence that tai chi might improve the range of motion of a joint in persons with rheumatoid arthritis. The evidence for acupuncture is inconclusive with it appearing to be equivalent to sham acupuncture.\nA Cochrane review in 2002 showed some benefits of electrical stimulation as a rehabilitation intervention to improve the power of the hand grip and help to resist fatigue. D\u2010penicillamine may provide similar benefits as DMARDs, but it is also highly toxic. Low-quality evidence suggests the use of therapeutic ultrasound on arthritic hands. Potential benefits include increased grip strength, reduced morning stiffness and number of swollen joints. There is tentative evidence of benefit of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in RA. Acupuncture\u2010like TENS (AL-TENS) may decrease pain intensity and improve muscle power scores.\nLow-quality evidence suggests people with active RA may benefit from assistive technology. This may include less discomfort and difficulty such as when using an eye drop device. Balance training is of unclear benefits.\nDietary supplements.\nFatty acids.\nThere has been a growing interest in the role of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to reduce inflammation and alleviate the symptoms of RA. Metabolism of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids produces docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which inhibit pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6), decreasing both lymphocyte proliferation and reactive oxygen species. These studies showed evidence for significant clinical improvements on RA in inflammatory status and articular index. Gamma-linolenic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, may reduce pain, tender joint count, and stiffness, and is generally safe. For omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (found in fish oil, flax oil and hemp oil), a meta-analysis reported a favorable effect on pain, although confidence in the effect was considered moderate. The same review reported less inflammation but no difference in joint function. A review examined the effect of marine oil omega-3 fatty acids on pro-inflammatory eicosanoid concentrations; leukotriene4 (LTB4) was lowered in people with rheumatoid arthritis but not in those with non-autoimmune chronic diseases. Fish consumption has no association with RA. A fourth review limited inclusion to trials in which people eat \u22652.7\u00a0g/day for more than three months. The use of pain relief medication was decreased, but improvements in tender or swollen joints, morning stiffness, and physical function were unchanged. Collectively, the current evidence is not strong enough to determine that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids or regular consumption of fish are effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.\nHerbal.\nThe American College of Rheumatology states that no herbal medicines have health claims supported by high-quality evidence and thus they do not recommend their use. There is no scientific basis to suggest that herbal supplements advertised as \"natural\" are safer for use than conventional medications as both are chemicals. Herbal medications, although labelled \"natural\", may be toxic or fatal if consumed. Due to the false belief that herbal supplements are always safe, there is sometimes a hesitancy to report their use which may increase the risk of adverse reactions.\nPregnancy.\nMore than 75% of women with rheumatoid arthritis have symptoms that improve during pregnancy, but their symptoms worsen after delivery. Methotrexate and leflunomide are teratogenic (harmful to the fetus) and not used in pregnancy. It is recommended that women of childbearing age use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and discontinue their use if pregnancy is planned. Low doses of prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine are considered safe in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis. Prednisolone should be used with caution as the side effects include infections and fractures.\nVaccinations.\nPeople with RA have an increased risk of infections and mortality, and recommended vaccinations can reduce these risks. The inactivated influenza vaccine should be received annually. The pneumococcal vaccine should be administered twice for people under the age 65 and once for those over 65. Lastly, the live-attenuated zoster vaccine should be administered once after the age 60, but is not recommended in people on a tumor necrosis factor alpha blocker.\nPrognosis.\nThe course of the disease varies greatly. Some people have mild short-term symptoms, but in most the disease is progressive for life. Around 25% will have subcutaneous nodules (known as rheumatoid nodules); this is associated with a poor prognosis.\nPrognostic factors.\nPoor prognostic factors include,\nMortality.\nRA reduces lifespan on average from three to twelve years. Young age at onset, long disease duration, the presence of other health problems, and characteristics of severe RA\u00a0\u2013 such as poor functional ability or overall health status, a lot of joint damage on x-rays, the need for hospitalisation or involvement of organs other than the joints\u00a0\u2013 have been shown to associate with higher mortality. Positive responses to treatment may indicate a better prognosis. A 2005 study by the Mayo Clinic noted that individuals with RA have a doubled risk of heart disease, independent of other risk factors such as diabetes, excessive alcohol use, and elevated cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index. The mechanism by which RA causes this increased risk remains unknown; the presence of chronic inflammation has been proposed as a contributing factor. It is possible that the use of new biologic drug therapies extend the lifespan of people with RA and reduce the risk and progression of atherosclerosis. This is based on cohort and registry studies, and remains hypothetical. It is uncertain whether biologics improve vascular function in RA. There was an increase in total cholesterol and HDLc levels, and no improvement in the atherogenic index.&lt;ref name=\"biologics cv effects/ cancer\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nEpidemiology.\nRA affects 0.5\u20131% of adults in the developed world, with between 5 and 50 per 100,000 people newly developing the condition each year. In 2010, it resulted in about 49,000 deaths globally.\nOnset is uncommon under the age of 15, and from then on, the incidence rises with age until the age of 80. Women are affected three to five times as often as men.\nThe age at which the disease most commonly starts is in women between 40 and 50 years of age, and for men, somewhat later. RA is a chronic disease, and although rarely, a spontaneous remission may occur, the common course of progression consists of persistent symptoms that wax and wane in intensity, along with continued deterioration of joint structures, leading to deformation and disability.\nThere is an association between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypothesised to lead to enhanced generation of RA-related autoantibodies. Oral bacteria that invade the blood may also contribute to chronic inflammatory responses and the generation of autoantibodies.\nHistory.\nThe first recognized description of RA in modern medicine was in 1800 by the French physician Augustin Jacob Landr\u00e9-Beauvais (1772\u20131840) who was based in the famed Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital in Paris. The name \"rheumatoid arthritis\" itself was coined in 1859 by British rheumatologist Alfred Baring Garrod.\nThe art of Peter Paul Rubens may depict the effects of RA. In his later paintings, his rendered hands show, in the opinion of some physicians, increasing deformity consistent with the symptoms of the disease. RA appears to some to have been depicted in 16th-century paintings. However, it is generally recognized in art historical circles that the painting of hands in the 16th and 17th century followed certain stylized conventions, most clearly seen in the Mannerist movement. It was conventional, for instance, to show the upheld right hand of Christ in what now appears a deformed posture. These conventions are easily misinterpreted as portrayals of disease.\nHistoric (though not necessarily effective) treatments for RA have also included: rest, ice, compression and elevation, apple diet, nutmeg, some light exercise every now and then, nettles, bee venom, copper bracelets, rhubarb diet, extractions of teeth, fasting, honey, vitamins, insulin, magnets, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\nEtymology.\nRheumatoid arthritis is derived from the Greek word \"\u1fe5\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1-rheuma (nom.), \u1fe5\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2-rheumatos (gen.)\" (\"flow, current\"). The suffix -\"oid\" (\"resembling\") gives the translation as \"joint inflammation that resembles rheumatic fever\". Rhuma, which means watery discharge, might refer to the fact that the joints are swollen or that the disease may be made worse by wet weather.\nResearch.\nMeta-analysis found an association between periodontal disease and RA, but the mechanism of this association remains unclear. Two bacterial species associated with periodontitis are implicated as mediators of protein citrullination in the gums of people with RA.\nVitamin D deficiency is more common in people with rheumatoid arthritis than in the general population. However, whether vitamin D deficiency is a cause or a consequence of the disease remains unclear. One meta-analysis found that vitamin D levels are low in people with rheumatoid arthritis and that vitamin D status correlates inversely with prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe fibroblast-like synoviocytes have a prominent role in the pathogenic processes of the rheumatic joints, and therapies that target these cells are emerging as promising therapeutic tools, raising hope for future applications in rheumatoid arthritis.\nPossible links with intestinal barrier dysfunction are investigated.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25876", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25876", "title": "Anastasius I Dicorus", "text": "Roman emperor from 491 to 518\nAnastasius I Dicorus (; c.\u2009431 \u2013 9 July 518) was Roman emperor from 491 to 518. A career civil servant, he came to the throne at the age of 61 after being chosen by Ariadne, the wife of his predecessor, Zeno. His reign was characterized by reforms and improvements in the empire's government, finances, economy and bureaucracy. The resulting stable government, reinvigorated monetary economy and sizeable budget surplus allowed the empire to pursue more ambitious policies under his successors, most notably Justinian I. Since many of Anastasius' reforms proved long-lasting, his influence over the empire endured for centuries.\nAnastasius was a Monophysite Christian and his personal religious tendencies caused tensions throughout his reign in the empire that was becoming increasingly divided along religious lines.\nEarly life and family.\nAnastasius was born at Dyrrachium; the date is unknown, but is thought to have been no later than 431. He was born into an Illyro-Roman family. Anastasius had one black eye and one blue eye (heterochromia), and for that reason he was nicknamed \"Dicorus\" (, \"two-pupiled\"). Before becoming emperor, Anastasius was a silentiary.\nAnastasius is known to have had a brother named Paulus, who served as consul in 496. With a woman known as Magna, Paulus was father to Irene, who married Olybrius. This Olybrius was the son of Anicia Juliana and Areobindus Dagalaifus Areobindus. The daughter of Olybrius and Irene was named Proba. She married Probus and was mother to a younger Juliana. This younger Juliana married her possible relative another Anastasius, son of Anastasius and maternal grandson of Theodora, and was mother of Areobindus, Placidia, and a younger Proba, who married (Flavius) Anastasius, born in 530, and mothered Areobindus, born in 550, and Placidia, born in 552 and wife of John Mystacon. Another nephew of Anastasius was Probus, consul in 502. Anastasius' sister, Caesaria, married Secundinus, and gave birth to Hypatius and Pompeius. Anastasius Paulus Probus Moschianus Probus Magnus, consul in 518, was a great-nephew of Anastasius. His daughter Juliana later married Marcellus, a brother of Justin II. The extensive family may well have included several viable candidates for the throne.\nAccession.\nIn the weeks following the death of Zeno (491), crowds gathered in the Hippodrome of Constantinople and demanded a Chalcedonian and properly Roman successor, chanting \"Give the Empire an Orthodox emperor! Give the Empire a Roman Emperor!\" Under such pressure, Ariadne, Zeno's widow, turned to Anastasius. Anastasius was in his sixties at the time of his ascension to the throne. Ariadne chose Anastasius over Zeno's brother Longinus, which upset the Isaurians. Once he took office, Anastasius exiled Longinus and purged a number of Isaurians officials from government. Religiously, Anastasius' sympathies were with the Monophysites. Consequently, as a condition of his accession, the patriarch of Constantinople required that he pledge not to repudiate the Council of Chalcedon.\nAriadne married Anastasius on 20 May 491, shortly after his accession on 11 April. He gained popular favour by a judicious remission of taxation, in particular by abolishing the hated tax on receipts, which was mostly paid by the poor. He displayed great vigour and energy in administering the affairs of the empire. His reforms improved the empire's tax base and pulled it from financial depression and bleak morale. By the end of his reign, it is claimed that the treasury had 320,000 lb gold reserve.\nNot long after his accession, the circus factions caused riots and set fires around the Hippodrome. Though its exact cause is unclear, the riot was pacified when Anastasius replaced the city prefect Julian with his brother-in-law Secundinus.\nForeign policy and wars.\nUnder Anastasius, the empire engaged in the Isaurian War against Longinus and the Anastasian War against Sassanid Persia.\nThe Isaurian War (492\u2013497) was instigated by the Isaurian supporters of Longinus, the brother of Zeno, who was passed over for the throne in favour of Anastasius, and local discontents. The banished Isaurian officials, led by the ex-bishop Conon and former governor Lilingis, gathered in Isauria and mounted a revolt. Their defeat by John the Scythian and John the Hunchback in the Battle of Cotyaeum in 492 broke the back of the revolt, but guerrilla warfare continued in the Isaurian Mountains for several years. The resistance hinged upon the Isaurians' retention of the mountain strongholds. Anastasius passed economic legislations in the mid-490s, which suggests that the war did not absorb all of the energy and resources of the government. After five years, the Isaurian resistance was broken. Large numbers of Isaurians were forcibly relocated to Thrace to ensure that they would not revolt again.\nDuring the Anastasian War of 502\u2013505 against the Sassanid Persians, the Sassanids captured the cities of Theodosiopolis and Amida, although the Romans later received Amida in exchange for gold. The Persian provinces also suffered severely, and a peace was concluded in 506. Anastasius afterward built the strong fortress of Daras, which was named Anastasiopolis, to hold the Persians at Nisibis in check. The Balkan provinces were denuded of troops, however, and were devastated by invasions of Bulgars. To protect Constantinople and its vicinity against them, Anastasius built the Anastasian Wall, extending from the Propontis to the Black Sea. He converted his birthplace, Dyrrachium, into one of the most fortified cities on the Adriatic with the construction of Durr\u00ebs Castle.\nOnce the relationship between the Romans the Ostrogoths was restored, Italy was independently governed by the Ostrogothic ruler Theodoric, but under the conditions agreed with Anastasius, Theodoric could not make laws, mint his own coins nor appoint Goths to the consulship and civil offices. However, he had the right to promulgate edicts, and appoint Romans to the consulship and civil offices and Goths to the military offices. Theodoric forged a relationship with the Visigothic king Alaric II in Gaul. Anastasius became wary of Theodoric's imperial ambition in the West. In the Frankish \"rex\" Clovis, the emperor found an ally. Partly thanks to the former \"magister militum\" Gundobad, he teamed up with Clovis to overthrow the Gothic hegemony in the West. In the Franco\u2013Gothic War (507\u2013511), Clovis defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Vouill\u00e9. The threat of an invasion by the Roman army had prevented Theodoric from intervening in the battle on time to support the Visigoths in 507. In early 508, a Roman attack actually took place in the Italian boot. Anastasius had sent an expedition force of 8,000 soldiers for this attack, but the Roman intervention was not aimed at conquest, since it did not seek a confrontation with Theodoric's army and limited itself only to the looting of some cities in the south. The Franks were thus more successful in the war.\nDomestic and ecclesiastical policies.\nAnastasius was a convinced Monophysite, but his ecclesiastical policy was moderate. He endeavoured to maintain the principle of the Henotikon of Zeno and the peace of the church. Yet, in 512, perhaps emboldened after his military success against the Persians, Anastasius deposed the Metropolitan of Chalcedon and replaced him with a Monophysite. That violated his agreement with the Patriarch of Constantinople and precipitated riots in Chalcedon. The following year, the general Vitalian started a rebellion, quickly defeated an imperial army and marched on Constantinople. With the army closing in, Anastasius gave Vitalian the title of Commander of the Army of Thrace and began communicating with the Pope on a potential end to the Acacian schism. Two years later, General Marinus attacked Vitalian and forced him and his troops to the northern part of Thrace. After the conclusion of the conflict, Anastasius had undisputed control of the empire until his death in 518.\nDeath and succession.\nThe \"Anonymous Valesianus\" gives a (most likely fictional) account of Anastasius attempting to predict his successor. Anastasius did not know which of his three nephews would succeed him and so he put a message under one of three couches and had his nephews take seats in the room. He believed that the nephew who sat on the couch with the message would be his heir. However, two of his nephews sat on the same couch, and the one with the concealed message remained empty. After putting the matter to God in prayer, he determined that the first person to enter his room the next morning would be the next emperor, and that person turned out to be Justin, the commander of the Excubitors (\"comes excubitorum\").\nAnastasius died childless in Constantinople on 9 July 518. He was 90 and a half years old according to the later chronicles of John Malalas (c. 491\u2013578) and the \"Chronicon Paschale\" (c. 630). The early 6th-century historian Victor of Tunnuna states that he died at the age of 88, a figure accepted by most modern historians.\nHe became the last emperor known to be consecrated as divus on his death. Anastasius left the Imperial treasury with 23,000,000 \"solidi\", which is 320,000 pounds of gold or . Justin then became the next emperor.\nAdministrative reform and introduction of new coinage.\nAnastasius showed an interest in administrative efficiency and issues concerning the economy. Whenever it was possible in governmental transactions, he altered the method of payment from goods to hard currency. This practice decreased the potential for embezzlement and the need for transportation and storage of supplies. It also allowed for easier accounting. He also applied this practice to taxes, mandating that taxes be paid with cash rather than with goods. He eliminated the practice of providing soldiers with their arms and uniforms; instead he allotted each soldier a generous sum of money with which to purchase their own. These changes to imperial policy seemed beneficial; taxpayers often paid smaller tax bills than they had before, while government revenue increased. The increase in revenue allowed the emperor to pay soldiers a higher wage, which attracted native Roman soldiers to the military, as opposed to the barbarian and Isaurian mercenaries which some previous emperors had been forced to rely on. Anastasius is often cited for his \"prudent management\" of the empire's finances.\nAmidst these reforms, though, Anastasius continued the practice of selling official positions. He sold so many that he has been accused of having facilitated the creation of a civilian aristocracy. This claim is strengthened by the growth in influence of families that often held high level positions in the government, such as the Apiones from Egypt. This has puzzled historians, given that the emperor seems to have minimised government corruption/inefficiency in other areas. Anastasius I also gave official positions to his close friend General Celer, his brother-in-law, his brother, his nephews, and his grand-nephews.\nThe complex monetary system of the early Byzantine Empire, which suffered a partial collapse in the mid-5th century, was revived by Anastasius in 498. The new system involved three denominations of gold, the \"solidus\" and its half (\"semissis\") and third (\"tremissis\"); and five denominations of copper, the \"follis\" (worth 40 \"nummi\") and its fractions down to a \"nummus\". It would seem that the new currency quickly became an important part of trade with other regions. A follis coin has been found in the Charjou desert, north of the River Oxus. Four solidi from his reign have been recovered as far from the Roman Empire as China. China might seem an unlikely trading partner, but the Romans and the Chinese were probably able to do business via Central Asian merchants travelling along the Silk Roads. Some Roman trading partners attempted to replicate the coins of Anastasius. The currency created by Anastasius stayed in use and circulated widely for long after his reign.\nA 40-\"nummi\" coin of Anastasius is depicted on the obverse of North Macedonia's 50 denar banknote, issued in 1996.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His reign was marked by significant religious and political decisions aimed at stabilizing the Empire. One of his notable actions was reversing the previous appointment of a Monothelete patriarch of Constantinople, instead reinstating Orthodoxy by appointing Germanus I to the position. This move was made in an effort to gain the favor of Pope Constantine.\nAnastasius II dedicated his efforts to fortifying the Empire and fostering a period of stability. However, his reign was cut short when he was deposed by Theodosius III during the Byzantine campaign against the Umayyad Caliphate in 715. Undeterred, four years later, in 719, Anastasius launched a rebellion against Leo III the Isaurian in a bid to reclaim the imperial throne.\nInitially, Anastasius received support from Tervel of Bulgaria, who provided soldiers and funds for his cause. However, the situation took a turn when Anastasius failed to enter Constantinople, and the Bulgarian forces he had brought with him complied with a request from Leo III to hand over Anastasius and his allies. Consequently, Anastasius was executed alongside other members of the rebellion in 719.\nBiography.\nAnastasius, originally named Artemios (; male form of Artemis) held prominent positions as a bureaucrat and Imperial secretary (\"asekretis\") under preceding emperors. His tenure coincided with a period of turmoil and instability in the Byzantine Empire known as The Twenty Years' Anarchy. Following the initial removal of the last hereditary ruler, Justinian II, the empire experienced a rapid succession of four rulers from 695 to 713. The fourth ruler, Philippicus, successfully deposed Justinian II for the second time.\nPhilippicus adopted policies that proved unfavorable to the majority of the empire's population, who adhered to Orthodoxy. Notably, he deposed the Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople in favor of a Monothelete patriarch. This decision garnered significant opposition both within the empire, particularly among the Orthodox populace, and from the church in Rome. Additionally, Philippicus diverted military resources from Anatolia to the Balkans in an attempt to defend Constantinople against the Bulgars. However, this shift left the empire's eastern front vulnerable to the Umayyad Caliphate's advancements. Consequently, Philippicus faced widespread discontent during his reign. All these things caused Philippicus\u2019 reign to be plagued with discontent among the populace.\nIn 713, the troops belonging to the Opsikion \"Theme\" stationed in Thrace rose up against Emperor Philippicus. To prevent him from leading a counter-rebellion and due to the traditional requirement of physical flawlessness for an emperor, Philippicus was blinded. This act aimed to disqualify him both culturally and practically from ever reclaiming the throne. The day after the blinding, the conspirators selected Artemios as the new emperor, who subsequently adopted the regnal name Anastasius. Like his predecessor, Anastasius ascended the throne under similar circumstances, which also posed the possibility of a comparable downfall.\nTo consolidate this position and maintain stability within the military, crucial for thwarting future coups and retaining Imperial control, Anastasius took decisive measures. He had the officers directly responsible for plotting against Philippicus blinded and exiled. This action served as a deterrent against future rebellions, ensuring that Anastasius could maintain his rule and prevent further unrest.\nRule.\nDuring Anastasius' reign, his primary focus was on stabilizing the Byzantine Empire. One of his key objectives was to reverse the religious reforms implemented by his predecessor. In line with this goal, Anastasius supported the decisions of the Sixth Ecumenical Council and removed the Monothelete Patriarch John VI of Constantinople from his position. He replaced him with the orthodox Patriarch Germanus in 715. This strategic move had several purposes. Firstly, it helped to pacify the unrest among the Orthodox population in Constantinople. Furthermore, it enhanced Anastasius' legitimacy as the emperor, which was particularly important considering his rise to power through a rebellion. To maintain imperial authority and stability, he sought various forms of proof of legitimacy. Elevating Orthodoxy effectively resolved the short-lived schism between the monarchy and the catholic Church, which was consistent with the Byzantine emperors' attempts to reconcile with Rome. Gaining the approval of Pope Constantine would have provided Anastasius with a symbol of legitimacy that his predecessor lacked, thereby reinforcing his own legitimacy by comparison.\nIn addition to his religion reforms, Anastasius recognized the need to address the precarious state of the Byzantine Empire's defenses and the issue of territorial loss. The Umayyad Caliphate posed a significant threat, surrounding the Empire both by land and sea. Their incursions had reached as far as Galatia in 714. In response, Anastasius pursued diplomatic avenues to restore peace but found his emissaries unsuccessful in Damascus. Consequently, he initiated a comprehensive defensive strategy. This involved the restoration of Constantinople's walls, the construction of siege equipment, the stockpiling of food, and the rebuilding of the Byzantine fleet. The death of Caliph al-Walid I in 715 presented an opportunity for Anastasius to reverse the situation in his favor. He dispatched an army under Leo the Isaurian, who would later become emperor, to invade Syria. Simultaneously, he ordered his fleet to concentrate on Rhodes, with instructions not only to resist the enemy's approach but also to destroy their naval resources. Retaking the territories lost to the Caliphate served both practical advantages, such as expanding the empire's borders, and symbolic purposes, showcasing the strength of the new regime.\nDeposition.\nIn Rhodes, a revolt occurred among the Opsician troops due to their discontent with the actions of Anastasius following his rise to power. During this mutiny, Admiral John was killed. Subsequently, the mutineers decided to overthrow Anastasius and install a new Emperor, Theodosius III (also known as Theodosios). Theodosius III, who was a relatively unknown tax-collector, was proclaimed as the new emperor. Following a siege that lasted six months, Constantinople was captured by Theodosius. Meanwhile, Anastasius had fled to Nicaea but was eventually compelled to yield to the authority of the new emperor. He retired to a monastery in Thessalonica. Theophanes the Confessor reports that Anastasius' reign lasted for 1 year and 3 months, suggesting his removal from power in September 715. However, an alternative date of November 715 is also possible.\nRebellion.\nTheodosius, the reigning emperor, was later deposed by Leo III, who had previously served under Anastasius. Leo would face two successive crises during his rule. The first crisis occurred when the Umayyad Caliphate besieged Constantinople, causing confusion about whether the city had been conquered. Troops stationed in Sicily declared their support for a new emperor, mistakenly believing that the capital had fallen. Although their rebellion was suppressed, the siege and the subsequent rebellion created an appearance of weakness in Leo's new government. Observing this, Anastasius decided to rebel and reclaim the Byzantine throne.\nIn 719, Anastasius left Thessalonica to lead a revolt against Leo III. The instigator of the rebellion is a matter of debate, with conflicting accounts from Patriarch Nikephoros and Theophanes the Confessor. Nikephoros claims that Anastasius orchestrated the plot himself, while Theophanes suggests that Niketas Xylinites initiated the rebellion by corresponding with Anastasius. Regardless, Anastasius sought support from Tervel of Bulgaria and received a significant number of troops, as well as financial aid amounting to 50,000 litres of gold. However, Theophanes the Confessor, who provides this information elsewhere, mistakenly confuses Tervel with his eventual successor Kormesiy, leaving the possibility that Anastasius formed an alliance with the younger ruler. Another explanation posits that Kormesiy acted as a representative of Tervel during negotiations with Anastasius.\nAlthough the coups during the Twenty Years Anarchy had seen some success, rebellions carried a high risk of failure. Therefore, Anastasius must have had a compelling reason to believe that the risk was worth taking. One explanation is that he interpreted the siege of Constantinople and the minor rebellion as indications of the state's weakness, making him believe that a rebellion could succeed. Another possibility is that Anastasius genuinely believed that the Empire was in a state of crisis and that he was one of the few individuals capable of saving it. Lastly, it is plausible that Theophanes was accurate in asserting that Niketas Xylinites advised Anastasius to rebel.\nWith the Bulgarian forces by his side, Anastasius marched toward Constantinople. He had sent a message to Niketas Anthrakas, the commander of the city walls, requesting that the gates be opened upon his arrival. Unfortunately for Anastasius, the message was intercepted, leading to Niketas being beheaded and foiling Anastasius' plan to enter Constantinople easily. Unable to breach the city, Anastasius and his conspirators were handed over, by the Bulgarians, to Leo III as requested. In 719, Anastasius was executed, along with other conspirators including Niketas Xylinitas and the archbishop of Thessalonica. Anastasius' wife Irene arranged for his burial in the Church of the Holy Apostles.\nHistoriography.\nAnastasius II received historical attention several decades after his death through the works of Theophanes the Confessor and Patriarch Nikephoros. These scholars, known for their extensive coverage of Byzantine history, incorporated Anastasius II into their writings, although their focus extended beyond his specific reign. Notably, their accounts primarily revolved around the rebellion initiated by Anastasius against Leo III. Due to the proximity of their writings to the actual event, Theophanes and Nikephoros are frequently consulted as primary sources for subsequent works about Anastasius.\nAs historical records progressed into the 1900s, Anastasius II's coverage tended to be contextualized within broader time periods. A common approach involved discussing his reign immediately following an account of his predecessor, Philippicus. In these records, Anastasius was often portrayed in a relatively favorable light compared to Philippicus. Additionally, some works addressing Bulgarian actions during Anastasius' lifetime also touched upon his reign.\nMore recent sources on Anastasius II exhibit sparser coverage, often limited to encyclopedic entries or discussions focusing on his relationship with Leo III. It is not uncommon to encounter brief mentions of Anastasius without delving into his character or achievements. One possible explanation for the limited amount of literature dedicated to Anastasius II is that Leo III is generally regarded as the emperor who succeeded where Anastasius fell short. Consequently, more works have emerged discussing Leo III and his accomplishments, leaving less scholarly attention devoted to Anastasius II. Furthermore, the brevity of Anastasius' reign, coupled with a scarcity of primary sources, could contribute to the relative lack of historical coverage he has received.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Along with other liturgical books of the Roman Rite, the Roman Missal contains the texts and rubrics for the celebration of the most common liturgy and Mass of the Catholic Church.\nHistory.\nBefore the Council of Trent (1570).\nBefore the high Middle Ages, several books were used at Mass: a Sacramentary with the prayers, one or more books for the Scriptural readings, and one or more books for the antiphons and other chants. Gradually, manuscripts came into being that incorporated parts of more than one of these books, leading finally to versions that were complete in themselves. Such a book was referred to as a \"Missale Plenum\" ().\nIn 1223 Saint Francis of Assisi instructed his friars to adopt the form that was in use at the Papal Court (\"Rule\", chapter 3). They adapted this missal further to the needs of their largely itinerant apostolate. Pope Gregory IX considered, but did not put into effect, the idea of extending this missal, as revised by the Franciscans, to the whole Western Church; and in 1277 Pope Nicholas III ordered it to be accepted in all churches in the city of Rome. Its use spread throughout Europe, especially after the invention of the printing press; but the editors introduced variations of their own choosing, some of them substantial. Printing also favoured the spread of other liturgical texts of less certain orthodoxy. The Council of Trent determined that an end must be put to the resulting disparities.\nThe chapel missal used during Innocent III's papacy was largely reproduced in the Franciscan Missal, which in turn was adopted by Pope Nicholas for the Roman Missal. The later Roman Missal of 1474, which replicates the papal chapel missal of the 1200s, \"hardly differs at all\" from the Tridentine Missal promulgated in 1570.\nThe first printed \"Missale Romanum\" (Roman Missal), containing the \"Ordo Missalis secundum consuetudinem Curiae Romanae\" (Order of the Missal in accordance with the custom of the Roman Curia), was produced in Milan in 1474. Almost a whole century passed before the appearance of an edition officially published by order of the Holy See. During that interval, the 1474 Milanese edition was followed by at least 14 other editions: 10 printed in Venice, 3 in Paris, 1 in Lyon. For lack of a controlling authority, these editions differ, sometimes considerably.\nAnnotations in the hand of Cardinal Gugliemo Sirleto in a copy of the 1494 Venetian edition show that it was used for drawing up the 1570 official edition of Pope Pius V. In substance, this 1494 text is identical with that of the 1474 Milanese edition.\nIn the 1500s, the Pre-Tridentine Roman Rite became the basis for Evangelical-Lutheran Rite of the Mass.\nFrom 1570 to the 1960s.\nImplementing the decision of the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V promulgated, in the Apostolic Constitution \"Quo primum\" of 14 July 1570, an edition of the Roman Missal that was mandated for obligatory use throughout the Latin Church except where there was another liturgical rite that could be proven to have been in use for at least two centuries.\nSome corrections to Pope Pius V's text proved necessary, and Pope Clement VIII replaced it with a new typical edition of the Roman Missal on 7 July 1604. (In this context, the word \"typical\" means that the text is the one to which all other printings must conform.) A further revised typical edition was promulgated by Pope Urban VIII on 2 September 1634.\nBeginning in the late seventeenth century, France and neighbouring areas saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops. Some of these were editions of manuscript missals already existing prior to 1370, but had undergone modifications that in some cases touched on the arbitrary. Later accusations of influence by Jansenism and Gallicanism were largely unfounded, as is shown by the fact that the Holy See did never condemned these books. This historical phenomenon of diocesan missals ended, however, when Abbot Gu\u00e9ranger and bishops such as Bishop Pierre-Louis Parisis of Langres initiated in the nineteenth century a vigorous polemical campaign in favour of a return to the Roman Missal. By 1875 all the French dioceses were using the Roman Missal. In 1884, Pope Leo XIII promulgated a new typical edition that took account of all the changes introduced since the time of Pope Urban VIII. Pope Pius X also undertook a revision of the Roman Missal, which was promulgated and declared typical by his successor Pope Benedict XV on 25 July 1920.\nThough Pope Pius X's revision made few corrections, omissions, and additions to the text of the prayers in the Roman Missal, there were major changes in the rubrics, changes which were not incorporated in the section entitled \"\"Rubricae generales\", but were instead printed as an additional section under the heading \"Additiones et variationes in rubricis Missalis.\"\nPope Pius XII issued no new typical edition of the Roman Missal, but authorized experimentally in 1951 the replacement of revised texts for Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil. After positive reports from the world's bishops, these changes were made universally obligatory in 1955. The Pope also removed from the Vigil of Pentecost the series of six Old Testament readings, with their accompanying Tracts and Collects, but these continued to be printed until 1962.\nAcceding to the wishes of many of the bishops, Pope Pius XII judged it expedient also to reduce the rubrics of the missal to a simpler form, a simplification enacted by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 23 March 1955. The changes this made in the General Roman Calendar are indicated in General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII.\nIn the following year, 1956, while preparatory studies were being conducted for a general liturgical reform, Pope Pius XII surveyed the opinions of the bishops on the liturgical improvement of the Roman breviary. After duly weighing the answers of the bishops, he judged that it was time to address the need for a general and systematic revision of the rubrics of the breviary and missal. This question he referred to the special committee of experts appointed to study the general liturgical reform.\nHis successor, Pope John XXIII, issued a new typical edition of the Roman Missal in 1962. This incorporated the revised Code of Rubrics which Pope Pius XII's commission had prepared, and which Pope John XXIII had made obligatory with effect from 1 January 1961. In the Missal, this Code of Rubrics replaced two of the documents in the 1920 edition; and the Pope's motu proprio \"Rubricarum instructum\" took the place of the superseded Apostolic constitution \"Divino afflatu\" of Pope Pius X.\nOther notable changes incorporated were the omission of the adjective \"perfidis\"\" in the Good Friday Prayer for the Jews and the insertion of the name of Saint Joseph into the Canon (or Eucharistic Prayer) of the Mass.\nRevision following the Second Vatican Council.\nIn 1965 and 1967 some changes were officially introduced into the Mass of the Roman Rite in the wake of \"Sacrosanctum Concilium\", but no new edition of the Roman Missal had been produced to incorporate them. They were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced in various countries when the language of the people began to be used in addition to Latin. References sometimes met in an English-language context to \"the 1965 Missal\" concern these temporary vernacular productions, not the Roman Missal itself. Some countries that had the same language used different translations and varied in the amount of vernacular admitted.\nA new edition of the Roman Missal was promulgated by Pope Paul VI with the apostolic constitution \"Missale Romanum\" of 3 April 1969. The full text of the revised Missal was not published until the following year, and full vernacular translations appeared some years later, but parts of the Missal in Latin were already available since 1964 in non-definitive form, and provisional translations appeared without delay.\nIn his apostolic constitution, Pope Paul VI made particular mention of the following significant changes that he had made in the Roman Missal:\nIn addition to these changes, the Pope noted that his revision considerably modified other sections of the Missal, such as the Proper of Seasons, the Proper of Saints, the Common of Saints, the Ritual Masses, and the Votive Masses, adding: \"In all of these changes, particular care has been taken with the prayers: not only has their number been increased, so that the new texts might better correspond to new needs, but also their text has been restored on the testimony of the most ancient evidences.\"\nEditions after the Second Vatican Council.\nIn 1970, the first typical edition of the Roman Missal (in Latin) bearing the title \"Missale Romanum ex decreto Sacrosancti Oecumenici Concilii Vaticani II instauratum\" was published, after being formally promulgated by Pope Paul VI in the previous year. A reprint that corrected misprints appeared in 1971. A second typical edition, with minor changes, followed in 1975. In 2000, Pope John Paul II approved a third typical edition, which appeared in 2002. This third edition added feasts, especially of some recently canonized saints, new prefaces of the Eucharistic Prayers, and additional Masses and prayers for various needs, and it revised and amplified the General Instruction of the Roman Missal.\nIn 2008, under Pope Benedict XVI, an emended reprint of the third edition was issued, correcting misprints and some other mistakes (such as the insertion at the beginning of the Apostles' Creed of \"unum\", as in the Nicene Creed). A supplement gives celebrations, such as that of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina, added to the General Roman Calendar after the initial printing of the 2002 typical edition.\nThree alterations required personal approval by Pope Benedict XVI:\nPope John XXIII's 1962 edition of the Roman Missal began a period of aesthetic preference for a reduced number of illustrations in black and white instead of the many brightly coloured pictures previously included. The first post-Vatican II editions, both in the original Latin and in translation, continued that tendency. The first Latin edition (1970) had in all 12 black-and-white woodcut illustrations by Gian Luigi Uboldi. The 1974 English translation adopted by the United States episcopal conference appear in several printings. \"Our Sunday Visitor\" printed it with further illustrations by Uboldi, while the printing by \"Catholic Book Publishing\" had woodcuts in colour. The German editions of 1975 and 1984 had no illustrations, thus emphasizing the clarity and beauty of the typography. The French editions of 1974 and 1978 were also without illustrations, while the Italian editions of 1973 and 1983 contained both reproductions of miniatures in an 11th-century manuscript and stylized figures whose appropriateness is doubted by the author of a study on the subject, who also makes a similar observation about the illustrations in the Spanish editions of 1978 and 1988. The minimalist presentation in these editions contrasts strongly with the opulence of United States editions of the period between 2005 and 2011 with their many full-colour reproductions of paintings and other works of art.\nThe first vernacular version of the third edition (2002) of the Vatican II Roman Missal to be published was that in Greek. It appeared in 2006. The English translation. taking into account the 2008 changes, came into use in 2011. Translations into some other languages took longer: that into Italian was decided on by the Episcopal Conference of Italy at its November 2018 meeting and was confirmed by the Holy See in the following year, as announced by the conference's president at its 22 May 2019 meeting. It replaces the 1983 Italian translation of the 1975 second Latin edition. The new text includes changes to the Italian Lord's Prayer and Gloria. In the Lord's Prayer, \"e non c'indurre in tentazione\" (\"and lead us not into temptation\") becomes \"non abbandonarci alla tentazione\" (\"do not abandon us to temptation\") and \"come noi li rimettiamo ai nostri debitori\" (\"as we forgive our debtors\") becomes \"come anche noi li rimettiamo ai nostri debitori\" (\"as we too forgive our debtors\"). In the Gloria \"pace in terra agli uomini di buona volont\u00e0\" (\"peace on earth to people of good will\") becomes \"pace in terra agli uomini, amati dal Signore\" (\"peace on earth to people, who are loved by the Lord\").\nContinued use of earlier editions.\nIn his motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\" of 7 July 2007, Pope Benedict XVI stated that the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal was never juridically abrogated and that it may be freely used by any priest of the Latin Church when celebrating Mass \"without a congregation\". Use of the 1962 edition at Mass with a congregation is allowed, with the permission of the priest in charge of a church, for stable groups attached to this earlier form of the Roman Rite, provided that the priest using it is \"qualified to do so and not juridically impeded\" (as for instance by suspension). Accordingly, many dioceses schedule regular Masses celebrated using the 1962 edition. Since the main difference between the 1962 Missal and prior editions is the liturgy for Holy Week, the church has permitted Tridentine Mass parishes to adopt earlier editions of the Roman Missal published just prior to the 1962 edition.\nIn 2021, Pope Francis, motivated by a desire to stave off what he perceived to be growing rejection of the Second Vatican Council developing from groups using the preconciliar rites, issued \"Traditionis custodes\" to restore the previous status quo of bishops having authority over the celebrations of Mass in the preconciliar Roman Rite. Francis stated in the letter that the current version of the Roman Rite ought to be regarded as the \"unique expression of [its] \"lex orandi\".\"\nSeveral traditionalist fraternities in full communion with the Holy See are authorised to celebrate the Mass exclusively according to the 1962 version of the Missal: such groups include the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP), the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP), the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney and the Institute of the Good Shepherd.\nThe Society of Saint Pius X (FSSPX), which rejects the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and is not in full communion with the Holy See, exclusively celebrates the Mass according to the 1962 version of the Roman Missal. Sedevacantist and sedeprivationist groups, which reject the Council and do not recognise the current Pope as valid, also reject the 1962 version of the Missal, seeing it as contaminated by modernism as well and thus only celebrate Mass using the 1920 edition of the Missal. There is a dispute among sedevacantists on the acceptance of the 1955 rubrics of the Paschal Triduum introduced by Pius XII: some groups (such as the Society of Saint Pius V, the Roman Catholic Institute and the Istituto Mater Boni Consilii) reject them, believing them to be the first step towards the post-Conciliar liturgical renovations; others (such as the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen) accept them, seeing them as a liturgical change by a valid Pope and, thus, binding to all Catholics.\nFor information on the calendars included in pre-69/70 editions (a small part of the full Missal), see General Roman Calendar of 1960, General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII, General Roman Calendar of 1954, and Tridentine calendar.\nOfficial English translations.\nThe International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL) prepared an English translation of the 1970 Roman Missal, which was approved by the individual English-speaking episcopal conferences and, after being reviewed by the Holy See, was put into effect, beginning with the United States in 1973.\nThe authority for the episcopal conferences, with the consent of the Holy See, to decide on such translations was granted by the Second Vatican Council.\nICEL prepared a greatly altered English translation, and presented it for the consent of the Holy See in 1998. The Holy See withheld its consent and informed ICEL that the Latin text of the Missal, which must be the basis of translations into other languages, was being revised, making irrelevant a translation based on what would no longer be the official text of the Roman Missal.\nOn 28 March 2001, the Holy See issued the Instruction \"Liturgiam Authenticam\", which included the requirement that in translations of the liturgical texts from the official Latin originals, \"the original text, insofar as possible, must be translated integrally and in the most exact manner, without omissions or additions in terms of their content, and without paraphrases or glosses. Any adaptation to the characteristics or the nature of the various vernacular languages is to be sober and discreet.\" This was a departure from the principle of functional equivalence promoted in ICEL translations after the Second Vatican Council.\nIn the following year, the third typical edition of the revised Roman Missal in Latin, which had already been promulgated in 2000, was released. These two texts made clear the need for a new official English translation of the Roman Missal, particularly because the previous one was at some points an adaptation rather than strictly a translation. An example is the rendering of the response \"Et cum spiritu tuo\" (literally, \"And with your spirit\") as \"And also with you.\" Accordingly, the International Commission on English in the Liturgy prepared, with some hesitancy on the part of the bishops, a new English translation of the Roman Missal, the completed form of which received the approval of the Holy See in April 2010.\nOn 19 July 2001, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments established an international committee of English-speaking bishops, called the Vox Clara Committee, \"to advise that Dicastery in its responsibilities related to the translation of liturgical texts in the English language and to strengthen effective cooperation with the Conferences of Bishops\". On the occasion of the meeting of the committee in Rome in April 2002, Pope John Paul II sent them a message emphasizing that \"fidelity to the rites and texts of the Liturgy is of paramount importance for the Church and Christian life\" and charging the committee to ensure that \"the texts of the Roman Rite are accurately translated in accordance with the norms of the Instruction \"Liturgiam authenticam\"\". \"Liturgiam authenticam\" also took from the Bishops' conferences the power to make its own translations and instituted a papal commission, Vox Clara, to revise the Bishops' work. In 2008 it made an estimated 10,000 changes to the ICEL's proposed text. By 2017 Pope Francis had formed a commission to review and evaluate \"Liturgiam authenticam\".\nThe work of making a new translation of the Roman Missal was completed in time to enable the national episcopal conference in most English-speaking countries to put it into use from the first Sunday of Advent (27 November) 2011.\nAs well as translating \"Et cum spiritu tuo\" as \"And with your spirit\", which some scholars suggest refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit the priest received at ordination, in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed \"consubstantial with the Father\" was used as a translation of \"consubstantialem Patri\" (in Greek \"\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\"), instead of \"of one Being with the Father\" (or, in the United States only, \"one in Being with the Father\"), and the Latin phrase \"qui pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum\", formerly translated as \"It will be shed for you and \"for all\" so that sins may be forgiven\", was translated literally as \"which will be poured out for you and \"for many\" for the forgiveness of sins\" (see Pro multis).\nThis new official translation of the entire Order of Mass is available on the website of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which also provides a comparison between the new text of the people's parts and that hitherto in use in the United States (where the version of the Nicene Creed was slightly different from that in other English-speaking countries).\nPope Benedict XVI remarked: \"Many will find it hard to adjust to unfamiliar texts after nearly forty years of continuous use of the previous translation. The change will need to be introduced with due sensitivity, and the opportunity for catechesis that it presents will need to be firmly grasped. I pray that in this way any risk of confusion or bewilderment will be averted, and the change will serve instead as a springboard for a renewal and a deepening of Eucharistic devotion all over the English-speaking world.\"\nThe plan to introduce the new English translation of the missal was not without critics. Over 22,000 electronic signatures, some of them anonymous, were collected on a web petition to ask the Bishops, Cardinals and the Pope to reconsider the new translation. At the time there was open dissent from one parish in Seattle.\nThe Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference (Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland) put into effect the changes in the people's parts of the revised English translation of the Order of Mass from 28 November 2008, when the Missal as a whole was not yet available. Protests were voiced on grounds of content and because it meant that Southern Africa was thus out of line with other English-speaking countries. One bishop claimed that the English-speaking conferences should have withstood the Holy See's insistence on a more literal translation. However, when in February 2009 the Holy See declared that the change should have awaited completion of work on the Missal, the bishops conference appealed, with the result that those parishes that had adopted the new translation were directed to continue using it, while those that had not were told to await further instructions before doing so.\nIn view of the foreseen opposition to making changes, the various English-speaking episcopal conferences arranged catechesis on the Mass and the Missal, and made information available also on the Internet. Other initiatives included the Catholic News Agency publishing a series of ten articles on the revised translation.\nIn 2012, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines revised the 41-year-old liturgy with an English version of the Roman Missal, and later translated it in the vernacular to several native languages in the Philippines. For instance, in 2024, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos uses the Tagalog language Roman Missal entitled \"Ang Aklat ng Mabuting Balita.\"\nPope Francis' approach.\nOn 9 September 2017 Pope Francis issued the motu proprio \"Magnum Principium\" (\"The Great Principle\") which allowed local bishops' conferences more authority over translation of liturgical documents. The motu proprio \"grants the episcopal conferences the faculty to judge the worth and coherence of one or another phrase in the translations from the original.\" The role of the Vatican is also modified in accord with the decree of Vatican II, to confirming texts already prepared by bishops' conferences, rather than \"recognition\" in the strict sense of Canon Law no. 838.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Intertwining his Catholic faith with scientific thinking, Roger Bacon is considered one of the greatest polymaths of the medieval period.\nIn the early modern era, he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his mechanical or necromantic brazen head. He is credited as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method, along with his teacher Robert Grosseteste. Bacon applied the empirical method of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) to observations in texts attributed to Aristotle. Bacon discovered the importance of empirical testing when the results he obtained were different from those that would have been predicted by Aristotle.\nHis linguistic work has been heralded for its early exposition of a universal grammar, and 21st-century re-evaluations emphasise that Bacon was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his \"experimental\" knowledge obtained from books in the scholastic tradition. He was, however, partially responsible for a revision of the medieval university curriculum, which saw the addition of optics to the traditional \"\".\nBacon's major work, the , was sent to Pope Clement IV in Rome in 1267 upon the pope's request. Although gunpowder was first invented and described in China, Bacon was the first in Europe to record its formula.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife.\nRoger Bacon was born in Ilchester in Somerset, England, in the early 13th century. His birth is sometimes narrowed down to 1210, 1213 or 1214, 1215 or 1220. The only source for his birth date is a statement from his 1267 ' that \"forty years have passed since I first learned the '\". The latest dates assume this referred to the alphabet itself, but elsewhere in the \" it is clear that Bacon uses the term to refer to rudimentary studies, the trivium or quadrivium that formed the medieval curriculum. His family appears to have been well off.\nBacon studied at Oxford. While Robert Grosseteste had probably left shortly before Bacon's arrival, his work and legacy almost certainly influenced the young scholar and it is possible Bacon subsequently visited him and William of Sherwood in Lincoln. Bacon became a Master at Oxford, lecturing on Aristotle. There is no evidence he was ever awarded a doctorate. (The title \" was a posthumous scholastic accolade.) A caustic cleric named Roger Bacon is recorded speaking before the king at Oxford in 1233.\nIn 1237 or at some point in the following decade, he accepted an invitation to teach at the University of Paris. While there, he lectured on Latin grammar, Aristotelian logic, arithmetic, geometry, and the mathematical aspects of astronomy and music. His faculty colleagues included Robert Kilwardby, Albertus Magnus, and Peter of Spain, who may later become Pope as Pope John XXI. The Cornishman Richard Rufus was a scholarly opponent. In 1247 or soon after, he left his position in Paris.\nAs a private scholar, his whereabouts for the next decade are uncertain but he was likely in Oxford c.\u20091248\u20131251, where he met Adam Marsh, and in Paris in 1251. He seems to have studied most of the known Greek and Arabic works on optics (then known as \"perspective\", '). A passage in the ' states that at some point he took a two-year break from his studies.\nBy the late 1250s, resentment against the king's preferential treatment of his \u00e9migr\u00e9 Poitevin relatives led to a coup and the imposition of the Provisions of Oxford and Westminster, instituting a baronial council and more frequent parliaments. Pope Urban IV absolved the king of his oath in 1261 and, after initial abortive resistance, Simon de Montfort led a force, enlarged due to recent crop failures, that prosecuted the Second Barons' War. Bacon's own family were considered royal partisans: De Montfort's men seized their property and drove several members into exile.\nIn 1256 or 1257, he became a friar in the Franciscan Order in either Paris or Oxford, following the example of scholarly English Franciscans such as Grosseteste and Marsh. After 1260, Bacon's activities were restricted by a statute prohibiting the friars of his order from publishing books or pamphlets without prior approval. He was likely kept at constant menial tasks to limit his time for contemplation and came to view his treatment as an enforced absence from scholarly life.\nBy the mid-1260s, he was undertaking a search for patrons who could secure permission and funding for his return to Oxford. For a time, Bacon was finally able to get around his superiors' interference through his acquaintance with Guy de Foulques, bishop of Narbonne, cardinal of Sabina, and the papal legate who negotiated between England's royal and baronial factions.\nIn 1263 or 1264, a message garbled by Bacon's messenger, Raymond of Laon, led Guy to believe that Bacon had already completed a summary of the sciences. In fact, he had no money to research, let alone copy, such a work and attempts to secure financing from his family were thwarted by the Second Barons' War. However, in 1265, Guy was summoned to a conclave at Perugia that elected him Pope Clement IV. William Benecor, who had previously been the courier between Henry III and the pope, now carried the correspondence between Bacon and Clement. Clement's reply of 22\u00a0June 1266 commissioned \"writings and remedies for current conditions\", instructing Bacon not to violate any standing \"prohibitions\" of his order but to carry out his task in utmost secrecy.\nWhile faculties of the time were largely limited to addressing disputes on the known texts of Aristotle, Clement's patronage permitted Bacon to engage in a wide-ranging consideration of the state of knowledge in his era. In 1267 or '68, Bacon sent the Pope his \"\", which presented his views on how to incorporate Aristotelian logic and science into a new theology, supporting Grosseteste's text-based approach against the \"sentence method\" then fashionable.\nBacon also sent his ', ', \"\", an optical lens, and possibly other works on alchemy and astrology. The entire process has been called \"one of the most remarkable single efforts of literary productivity\", with Bacon composing referenced works of around a million words in about a year.\nPope Clement died in 1268 and Bacon lost his protector. The Condemnations of 1277 banned the teaching of certain philosophical doctrines, including deterministic astrology. Some time within the next two years, Bacon was apparently imprisoned or placed under house arrest. This was traditionally ascribed to Franciscan Minister General Jerome of Ascoli, probably acting on behalf of the many clergy, monks, and educators attacked by Bacon's 1271 \"\".\nModern scholarship, however, notes that the first reference to Bacon's \"imprisonment\" dates from eighty years after his death on the charge of unspecified \"suspected novelties\" and finds it less than credible. Contemporary scholars who do accept Bacon's imprisonment typically associate it with Bacon's \"attraction to contemporary prophesies\", his sympathies for \"the radical 'poverty' wing of the Franciscans\", interest in certain astrological doctrines, or generally combative personality rather than from \"any scientific novelties which he may have proposed\".\nSometime after 1278, Bacon returned to the Franciscan House at Oxford, where he continued his studies and is presumed to have spent most of the remainder of his life. His last dateable writing\u2014the \"\"\u2014was completed in 1292. He seems to have died shortly afterwards and been buried at Oxford.\nWorks.\nMedieval European philosophy often relied on appeals to the authority of Church Fathers such as St\u00a0Augustine, and on works by Plato and Aristotle only known at second hand or through Latin translations. By the 13th century, new works and better versions \u2013 in Arabic or in new Latin translations from the Arabic \u2013 began to trickle north from Muslim Spain. In Roger Bacon's writings, he upholds Aristotle's calls for the collection of facts before deducing scientific truths, against the practices of his contemporaries, arguing that \"thence cometh quiet to the mind\".\nBacon also called for reform with regard to theology. He argued that, rather than training to debate minor philosophical distinctions, theologians should focus their attention primarily on the Bible itself, learning the languages of its original sources thoroughly. He was fluent in several of these languages and was able to note and bemoan several corruptions of scripture, and of the works of the Greek philosophers that had been mistranslated or misinterpreted by scholars working in Latin. He also argued for the education of theologians in science (\"natural philosophy\") and its addition to the medieval curriculum.\n\"Opus Majus\".\nBacon's 1267 \"Greater Work\", the ', contains treatments of mathematics, optics, alchemy, and astronomy, including theories on the positions and sizes of the celestial bodies. It is divided into seven sections: \"The Four General Causes of Human Ignorance\" ('), \"The Affinity of Philosophy with Theology\" ('), \"On the Usefulness of Grammar\" ('), \"The Usefulness of Mathematics in Physics\" ('), \"On the Science of Perspective\" ('), \"On Experimental Knowledge\" ('), and \"A Philosophy of Morality\" (').\nIt was not intended as a complete work but as a \"persuasive preamble\" ('), an enormous proposal for a reform of the medieval university curriculum and the establishment of a kind of library or encyclopedia, bringing in experts to compose a collection of definitive texts on these subjects. The new subjects were to be \"perspective\" (i.e., optics), \"astronomy\" (inclusive of astronomy proper, astrology, and the geography necessary to use them), \"weights\" (likely some treatment of mechanics but this section of the ' has been lost), alchemy, agriculture (inclusive of botany and zoology), medicine, and \"experimental science\", a philosophy of science that would guide the others. The section on geography was allegedly originally ornamented with a map based on ancient and Arabic computations of longitude and latitude, but has since been lost. His (mistaken) arguments supporting the idea that dry land formed the larger proportion of the globe were apparently similar to those which later guided Columbus.\nIn this work Bacon criticises his contemporaries Alexander of Hales and Albertus Magnus, who were held in high repute despite having only acquired their knowledge of Aristotle at second hand during their preaching careers. Albert was received at Paris as an authority equal to Aristotle, Avicenna and Averroes, a situation Bacon decried: \"never in the world [had] such monstrosity occurred before.\"\nIn Part I of the \"Opus Majus\" Bacon recognises some philosophers as the \"Sapientes\", or gifted few, and saw their knowledge in philosophy and theology as superior to the \"vulgus philosophantium\", or common herd of philosophers. He held Islamic thinkers between 1210 and 1265 in especially high regard calling them \"both philosophers and sacred writers\" and defended the integration of philosophy from apostate philosopher of the Islamic world into Christian learning.\nCalendrical reform.\nIn Part IV of the \"\", Bacon proposed a calendrical reform similar to the later system introduced in 1582 under Pope Gregory XIII. Drawing on ancient Greek and medieval Islamic astronomy recently introduced to western Europe via Spain, Bacon continued the work of Robert Grosseteste and criticised the then-current Julian calendar as \"intolerable, horrible, and laughable\".\nIt had become apparent that Eudoxus and Sosigenes's assumption of a year of 365\u00bc days was, over the course of centuries, too inexact. Bacon charged that this meant the computation of Easter had shifted forward by 9 days since the First Council of Nicaea in 325. His proposal to drop one day every 125 years and to cease the observance of fixed equinoxes and solstices was not acted upon following the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268. The eventual Gregorian calendar drops one day from the first three centuries in each set of 400 years.\nOptics.\nIn Part V of the \"\", Bacon discusses physiology of eyesight and the anatomy of the eye and the brain, considering light, distance, position, and size, direct and reflected vision, refraction, mirrors, and lenses. His treatment was primarily oriented by the Latin translation of Alhazen's \"Book of Optics\". He also draws heavily on Eugene of Palermo's Latin translation of the Arabic translation of Ptolemy's \"Optics\"; on Robert Grosseteste's work based on Al-Kindi's \"Optics\"; and, through Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), on Ibn Sahl's work on dioptrics.\nGunpowder.\nA passage in the ' and another in the ' are usually taken as the first European descriptions of a mixture containing the essential ingredients of gunpowder. Partington and others have come to the conclusion that Bacon most likely witnessed at least one demonstration of Chinese firecrackers, possibly obtained by Franciscans\u2014including Bacon's friend William of Rubruck\u2014who visited the Mongol Empire during this period. The most telling passage reads:\nWe have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children's toy which is made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e. a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpetre [together with sulphur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning. \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Henry William Lovett Hime of the Royal Artillery published the theory that Bacon's \"\" contained a cryptogram giving a recipe for the gunpowder he witnessed. The theory was criticised by Thorndike in a 1915 letter to \"Science\" and several books, a position joined by Muir, John Maxson Stillman, Steele, and Sarton. Needham et al. concurred with these earlier critics that the additional passage did not originate with Bacon and further showed that the proportions supposedly deciphered (a 7:5:5 ratio of saltpetre to charcoal to sulphur) as not even useful for firecrackers, burning slowly with a great deal of smoke and failing to ignite inside a gun barrel. The ~41% nitrate content is too low to have explosive properties.\n\"Secret of Secrets\".\nBacon attributed the \"Secret of Secrets\" (\"\"), the Islamic \"Mirror of Princes\" (), to Aristotle, thinking that he had composed it for Alexander the Great. Bacon produced an edition of Philip of Tripoli's Latin translation, complete with his own introduction and notes; and his writings of the 1260s and 1270s cite it far more than his contemporaries did. This led Easton and others, including Robert Steele, to argue that the text spurred Bacon's own transformation into an experimentalist. (Bacon never described such a decisive impact himself.) The dating of Bacon's edition of the \"Secret of Secrets\" is a key piece of evidence in the debate, with those arguing for a greater impact giving it an earlier date; but it certainly influenced the elder Bacon's conception of the political aspects of his work in the sciences.\nAlchemy.\nBacon has been credited with a number of alchemical texts.\nThe \"Letter on the Secret Workings of Art and Nature and on the Vanity of Magic\" ('), also known as \"On the Wonderful Powers of Art and Nature\" ('), a likely-forged letter to an unknown \"William of Paris,\" dismisses practices such as necromancy but contains most of the alchemical formulae attributed to Bacon, including one for a philosopher's stone and another possibly for gunpowder. It also includes several passages about hypothetical flying machines and submarines, attributing their first use to Alexander the Great. \"On the Vanity of Magic\" or \"The Nullity of Magic\" is a debunking of esoteric claims in Bacon's time, showing that they could be explained by natural phenomena.\nHe wrote on the medicine of Galen, referring to the translations of Avicenna. He believed that the medicine of Galen belonged to an ancient tradition passed through Chaldeans, Greeks and Arabs. Although he provided a negative image of Hermes Trismegistus, his work was influenced by Hermetic thought. Bacon's endorsement of Hermetic philosophy is evident, as his citations of the alchemical literature known as the Secretum Secretorum made several appearances in the Opus Majus. The Secretum Secretorum contains knowledge about the Hermetic Emerald Tablet, which was an integral component of alchemy, thus proving that Bacon's version of alchemy was much less secular, and much more spiritual than once interpreted. The importance of Hermetic philosophy in Bacon's work is also evident through his citations of classic Hermetic literature such as the Corpus Hermeticum. Bacon's citation of the Corpus Hermeticum, which consists of a dialogue between Hermes and the pagan deity Asclepius, proves that Bacon's ideas were much more in line with the spiritual aspects of alchemy rather than the scientific aspects. However, this is somewhat paradoxical as what Bacon was specifically trying to prove in the Opus Majus and subsequent works, was that spirituality and science were the same entity. Bacon believed that by using science, certain aspects of spirituality such as the attainment of \"Sapientia\" or \"Divine Wisdom\" could be logically explained using tangible evidence. Bacon's Opus Majus was first and foremost, a compendium of sciences which he believed would facilitate the first step towards \"Sapientia\". Bacon placed considerable emphasis on alchemy and even went so far as to state that alchemy was the most important science. The reason why Bacon kept the topic of alchemy vague for the most part, is due to the need for secrecy about esoteric topics in England at the time as well as his dedication to remaining in line with the alchemical tradition of speaking in symbols and metaphors.\nLinguistics.\nBacon's early linguistic and logical works are the \"Overview of Grammar\" (\"Summa Grammatica\"), ', and the ' or \"\". These are mature but essentially conventional presentations of Oxford and Paris's terminist and pre-modist logic and grammar. His later work in linguistics is much more idiosyncratic, using terminology and addressing questions unique in his era.\nIn his \"Greek\" and \"Hebrew Grammars\" (' and '), in his work \"On the Usefulness of Grammar\" (Book III of the \"\"), and in his \"Compendium of the Study of Philosophy\", Bacon stresses the need for scholars to know several languages. Europe's vernacular languages are not ignored\u2014he considers them useful for practical purposes such as trade, proselytism, and administration\u2014but Bacon is mostly interested in his era's languages of science and religion: Arabic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin.\nBacon is less interested in a full practical mastery of the other languages than on a theoretical understanding of their grammatical rules, ensuring that a Latin reader will not misunderstand passages' original meaning. For this reason, his treatments of Greek and Hebrew grammar are not isolated works on their topic but contrastive grammars treating the aspects which influenced Latin or which were required for properly understanding Latin texts. He pointedly states, \"I want to describe Greek grammar for the benefit of Latin speakers\". It is likely only this limited sense which was intended by Bacon's boast that he could teach an interested pupil a new language within three days.\nPassages in the \"Overview\" and the Greek grammar have been taken as an early exposition of a universal grammar underlying all human languages. The Greek grammar contains the tersest and most famous exposition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Grammar is one and the same in all languages, substantially, though it may vary, accidentally, in each of them.\nHowever, Bacon's lack of interest in studying a literal grammar underlying the languages known to him and his numerous works on linguistics and comparative linguistics has prompted Hovdhaugen to question the usual literal translation of Bacon's \"\" in such passages. She notes the ambiguity in the Latin term, which could refer variously to the structure of language, to its description, and to the science underlying such descriptions: i.e., linguistics.\nOther works.\nBacon states that his \"Lesser Work\" (') and \"Third Work\" (') were originally intended as summaries of the ' in case it was lost in transit. Easton's review of the texts suggests that they became separate works over the course of the laborious process of creating a fair copy of the ', whose half-million words were copied by hand and apparently greatly revised at least once.\nOther works by Bacon include his \"Tract on the Multiplication of Species\" ('), \"On Burning Lenses\" ('), the ' and ', the \"Compendium of the Study of Philosophy\" and \"of Theology\" (' and '), and his \"Computus\". The \"Compendium of the Study of Theology\", presumably written in the last years of his life, was an anticlimax: adding nothing new, it is principally devoted to the concerns of the 1260s.\nApocrypha.\n\"The Mirror of Alchimy\" (\"\"), a short treatise on the origin and composition of metals, is traditionally credited to Bacon. It espouses the Arabian theory of mercury and sulphur forming the other metals, with vague allusions to transmutation. Stillman opined that \"there is nothing in it that is characteristic of Roger Bacon's style or ideas, nor that distinguishes it from many unimportant alchemical lucubrations of anonymous writers of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries\", and Muir and Lippmann also considered it a pseudepigraph.\nThe cryptic Voynich manuscript has been attributed to Bacon by various sources, including by its first recorded owner, but historians of science Lynn Thorndike and George Sarton dismissed these claims as unsupported, and the vellum of the manuscript has since been dated to the 15th century.\nLegacy.\nBacon was largely ignored by his contemporaries in favour of other scholars such as Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure, and Thomas Aquinas, although his works were studied by Bonaventure, John Pecham, and Peter of Limoges, through whom he may have influenced Raymond Lull. He was also partially responsible for the addition of optics (\"\") to the medieval university curriculum.\nBy the early modern period, the English considered him the epitome of a wise and subtle possessor of forbidden knowledge, a Faust-like magician who had tricked the devil and so was able to go to heaven. Of these legends, one of the most prominent was that he created a talking brazen head which could answer any question. The story appears in the anonymous 16th-century account of \"The Famous Historie of Fryer Bacon\", in which Bacon speaks with a demon but causes the head to speak by \"the continuall fume of the six hottest Simples\", testing his theory that speech is caused by \"an effusion of vapors\".\nAround 1589, Robert Greene adapted the story for the stage as \"The Honorable Historie of Frier Bacon and Frier Bongay\", one of the most successful Elizabethan comedies. As late as the 1640s, Thomas Browne was still complaining that \"Every ear is filled with the story of Frier Bacon, that made a brazen head to speak these words, \"Time is\"\". Greene's Bacon spent seven years creating a brass head that would speak \"strange and uncouth aphorisms\" to enable him to encircle Britain with a wall of brass that would make it impossible to conquer.\nUnlike his source material, Greene does not cause his head to operate by natural forces but by \"nigromantic charms\" and \"the enchanting forces of the devil\": i.e., by entrapping a dead spirit or hobgoblin. Bacon collapses, exhausted, just before his device comes to life and announces \"Time is\", \"Time was\", and \"Time is Past\" before being destroyed in spectacular fashion: the stage direction instructs that \"a lightening flasheth forth, and a hand appears that breaketh down the Head with a hammer\".\nA necromantic head was ascribed to Pope Sylvester\u00a0II as early as the 1120s, but Browne considered the legend to be a misunderstanding of a passage in Peter the Good's c.\u20091335 \"Precious Pearl\" where the negligent alchemist misses the birth of his creation and loses it forever. The story may also preserve the work by Bacon and his contemporaries to construct clockwork armillary spheres. Bacon had praised a \"self-activated working model of the heavens\" as \"the greatest of all things which have been devised\".\nAs early as the 16th century, natural philosophers such as Bruno, Dee and Francis Bacon were attempting to rehabilitate Bacon's reputation and to portray him as a scientific pioneer who had avoided the petty bickering of his contemporaries to attempt a rational understanding of nature. By the 19th century, commenters following Whewell considered that \"Bacon ... was not appreciated in his age because he was so completely in advance of it; he is a 16th- or 17th-century philosopher, whose lot has been by some accident cast in the 13th century\". His assertions in the \"\" that \"theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data, aided by instruments, and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses\" were (and still are) considered \"one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record\".\nThis idea that Bacon was a modern experimental scientist reflected two views of the period: that the principal form of scientific activity is experimentation and that 13th-century Europe still represented the \"Dark Ages\". This view, which is still reflected in some 21st-century popular science books, portrays Bacon as an advocate of modern experimental science who emerged as a solitary genius in an age hostile to his ideas. Based on Bacon's apocrypha, he is also portrayed as a visionary who predicted the invention of the submarine, aircraft, and automobile. Consistent with this view of Bacon as a man ahead of his time, H. G. Wells's \"Outline of History\" attributes this prescient passage to him:Machines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great ships suited to river or ocean, guided by one man, may be borne with greater speed than if they were full of men. Likewise, cars may be made so that without a draught animal they may be moved \"cum impetu inaestimabili\", as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from which antiquity fought. And flying machines are possible, so that a man may sit in the middle turning some device by which artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird.\nHowever, in the course of the 20th century, Husserl, Heidegger and others emphasised the importance to the modern science of Cartesian and Galilean projections of mathematics over sensory perceptions of nature; Heidegger, in particular, noted the lack of such an understanding in Bacon's works. Although Crombie, Kuhn and Schramm continued to argue for Bacon's importance to the development of \"qualitative\" areas of modern science, Duhem, Thorndike, Carton and Koyr\u00e9 emphasised the essentially medieval nature of Bacon's \"\".\nResearch also established that Bacon was probably not as isolated\u2014and not as persecuted\u2014as was once thought. Many medieval sources of and influences on Bacon's scientific activity have been identified. In particular, Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of Robert Grosseteste: his work on optics and the calendar followed Grosseteste's lead, as did his idea that inductively-derived conclusions should be submitted for verification through experimental testing.\nBacon noted of William of Sherwood that \"nobody was greater in philosophy than he\"; praised Peter of Maricourt (the author of \"A Letter on Magnetism\") and John of London as \"perfect\" mathematicians; Campanus of Novara (the author of works on astronomy, astrology, and the calendar) and a Master Nicholas as \"good\"; and acknowledged the influence of Adam Marsh and lesser figures. Some scholars have pushed back on his reputation as an isolated genius. \nAs a result, the picture of Bacon has changed. Bacon is now seen as part of his age: a leading figure in the beginnings of the medieval universities at Paris and Oxford but one joined in the development of the philosophy of science by Robert Grosseteste, William of Auvergne, Henry of Ghent, Albert Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham. Lindberg summarised:\nBacon was not a modern, out of step with his age, or a harbinger of things to come, but a brilliant, combative, and somewhat eccentric schoolman of the thirteenth century, endeavoring to take advantage of the new learning just becoming available while remaining true to traditional notions... of the importance to be attached to philosophical knowledge\".\nA recent review of the many visions of Bacon across the ages says contemporary scholarship still neglects one of the most important aspects of his life and thought: his commitment to the Franciscan order. \nHis was a plea for reform addressed to the supreme spiritual head of the Christian faith, written against a background of apocalyptic expectation and informed by the driving concerns of the friars. It was designed to improve training for missionaries and to provide new skills to be employed in the defence of the Christian world against the enmity of non-Christians and of the Antichrist. It cannot usefully be read solely in the context of the history of science and philosophy.\nWith regard to religion's influence on Bacon's philosophy, Charles Sanders Peirce noted, \"To Roger Bacon... the schoolmen's conception of reasoning appeared only an obstacle to truth... [but] Of all kinds of experience, the best, he thought, was interior illumination, which teaches many things about Nature which the external senses could never discover, such as the transubstantiation of bread.\" Later scholars have therefore viewed him as a proto-protestant.\nIn Oxford lore, Bacon is credited as the namesake of Folly Bridge for having been placed under house arrest nearby. Although this is probably untrue, it had formerly been known as \"Friar Bacon's Bridge\". Bacon is also honoured at Oxford by a plaque affixed to the wall of the Westgate shopping centre.\nIn popular culture.\nTo commemorate the 700th anniversary of Bacon's approximate year of birth, Prof. J. Erskine wrote the biographical play \"A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century\", which was performed and published by Columbia University in 1914. A fictionalised account of Bacon's life and times also appears in the second book of James Blish's \"After Such Knowledge\" trilogy, the 1964 \"Doctor Mirabilis\". Bacon serves as a mentor to the protagonists of Thomas Costain's 1945 \"The Black Rose\", and Umberto Eco's 1980 \"The Name of the Rose\".\nGreene's play prompted a less successful sequel \"John of Bordeaux\" and was recast as a children's story for James Baldwin's 1905 \"Thirty More Famous Stories Retold\". \"The Brazen Head of Friar Bacon\" also appears in Daniel Defoe's 1722 \"Journal of the Plague Year\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1843 \"The Birth-Mark\" and 1844 \"The Artist of the Beautiful\", William Douglas O'Connor's 1891 \"The Brazen Android\" (where Bacon devises it to terrify King Henry into accepting Simon de Montfort's demands for greater democracy), John Cowper Powys's 1956 \"The Brazen Head\", and Robertson Davies's 1970 \"Fifth Business\". Bacon appears in Rudyard Kipling's 1926 story 'The Eye of Allah'.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReference works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25880", "revid": "5067238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25880", "title": "Refractive index", "text": "Property in optics\nIn optics, the refractive index (also called refraction index or index of refraction), often denoted \"n\", is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (\"c\") to the speed of light in a given optical medium (\"v\"), \"n\"=\"c\"/\"v\". The refractive index determines how much the path of light is bent, or refracted, when entering a material, as described by Snell's law of refraction, \"n\"1 sin \"\u03b8\"1 = \"n\"2 sin \"\u03b8\"2, where \"\u03b8\"1 and \"\u03b8\"2 are the angle of incidence and angle of refraction, respectively, of a ray crossing the interface between two media with refractive indices \"n\"1 and \"n\"2. The refractive indices also determine the amount of light that is reflected when reaching the interface, as well as the critical angle for total internal reflection, their intensity (Fresnel equations) and Brewster's angle.\nThe refractive index, formula_1, can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values: the speed of light in a medium is \"v\" = c/\"n\", and similarly the wavelength in that medium is \"\u03bb\" = \"\u03bb\"0/\"n\", where \"\u03bb\"0 is the wavelength of that light in vacuum. This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and assumes that the frequency (\"f\" = \"v\"/\"\u03bb\") of the wave is not affected by the refractive index.\nThe refractive index may vary with wavelength. This causes white light to split into constituent colors when refracted. This is called dispersion. This effect can be observed in prisms and rainbows, and as chromatic aberration in lenses. Light propagation in absorbing materials can be described using a complex-valued refractive index. The imaginary part then handles the attenuation, while the real part accounts for refraction. For most materials the refractive index changes with wavelength by several percent across the visible spectrum. Consequently, refractive indices for materials reported using a single value for n must specify the wavelength used in the measurement.\nThe concept of refractive index applies across the full electromagnetic spectrum, from X-rays to radio waves. It can also be applied to wave phenomena such as sound. In this case, the speed of sound is used instead of that of light, and a reference medium other than vacuum must be chosen. Refraction also occurs in oceans when light passes into the halocline where salinity has impacted the density of the water column.\nFor lenses (such as eye glasses), a lens made from a high refractive index glass will be thinner, and hence lighter, than a \u2013 usually cheaper \u2013 conventional lens with a lower refractive index.\nPlastics materials tend to have lower refractive indices than glasses, but have significantly less density than glasses. Therefore since many years the lightest eyeglasses are fabricated from plastics.\nDefinition.\nThe relative refractive index of an optical medium 2 with respect to another reference medium 1 (\"n\"21) is given by the ratio of speed of light in medium 1 to that in medium 2. This can be expressed as follows:\nformula_2\nIf the reference medium 1 is vacuum, then the refractive index of medium 2 is considered with respect to vacuum. It is simply represented as \"n\"2 and is called the absolute refractive index of medium 2.\nThe absolute refractive index \"n\" of an optical medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum, c =, and the phase velocity v of light in the medium,\nformula_3\nSince c is constant, n is inversely proportional to v:\nformula_4\nThe phase velocity is the speed at which the crests or the phase of the wave moves, which may be different from the group velocity, the speed at which the pulse of light or the envelope of the wave moves. Historically air at a standardized pressure and temperature has been common as a reference medium.\nHistory.\nThomas Young was presumably the person who first used, and invented, the name \"index of refraction\", in 1807.\nAt the same time he changed this value of refractive power into a single number, instead of the traditional ratio of two numbers. The ratio had the disadvantage of different appearances. Newton, who called it the \"proportion of the sines of incidence and refraction\", wrote it as a ratio of two numbers, like \"529 to 396\" (or \"nearly 4 to 3\"; for water). Hauksbee, who called it the \"ratio of refraction\", wrote it as a ratio with a fixed numerator, like \"10000 to 7451.9\" (for urine). Hutton wrote it as a ratio with a fixed denominator, like 1.3358 to 1 (water).\nYoung did not use a symbol for the index of refraction, in 1807. In the later years, others started using different symbols: n, m, and \u00b5. The symbol n gradually prevailed.\nTypical values.\nRefractive index also varies with wavelength of the light as given by Cauchy's equation. The most general form of this equation is\nformula_5\nwhere n is the refractive index, \u03bb is the wavelength, and A, B, C, etc., are coefficients that can be determined for a material by fitting the equation to measured refractive indices at known wavelengths. The coefficients are usually quoted for \u03bb as the vacuum wavelength in micrometres.\nUsually, it is sufficient to use a two-term form of the equation:\nformula_6\nwhere the coefficients A and B are determined specifically for this form of the equation.\nFor visible light most transparent media have refractive indices between 1 and 2. A few examples are given in the adjacent table. These values are measured at the yellow doublet D-line of sodium, with a wavelength of 589 nanometers, as is conventionally done. Gases at atmospheric pressure have refractive indices close to 1 because of their low density. Almost all solids and liquids have refractive indices above 1.3, with aerogel as the clear exception. Aerogel is a very low density solid that can be produced with refractive index in the range from 1.002 to 1.265. Moissanite lies at the other end of the range with a refractive index as high as 2.65. Most plastics have refractive indices in the range from 1.3 to 1.7, but some high-refractive-index polymers can have values as high as 1.76.\nFor infrared light refractive indices can be considerably higher. Germanium is transparent in the wavelength region from and has a refractive index of about 4. A type of new materials termed \"topological insulators\", was recently found which have high refractive index of up to 6 in the near to mid infrared frequency range. Moreover, topological insulators are transparent when they have nanoscale thickness. These properties are potentially important for applications in infrared optics.\nRefractive index below unity.\nAccording to the theory of relativity, no information can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum, but this does not mean that the refractive index cannot be less than 1. The refractive index measures the phase velocity of light, which does not carry information. The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index below 1. This can occur close to resonance frequencies, for absorbing media, in plasmas, and for X-rays. In the X-ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to 1 (exceptions close to some resonance frequencies).\nAs an example, water has a refractive index of \n 1 \u2212 for X-ray radiation at a photon energy of ( wavelength).\nAn example of a plasma with an index of refraction less than unity is Earth's ionosphere. Since the refractive index of the ionosphere (a plasma), is less than unity, electromagnetic waves propagating through the plasma are bent \"away from the normal\" (see Geometric optics) allowing the radio wave to be refracted back toward earth, thus enabling long-distance radio communications. See also Radio Propagation and Skywave.\nNegative refractive index.\nRecent research has also demonstrated the \"existence\" of materials with a negative refractive index, which can occur if permittivity and permeability have simultaneous negative values. This can be achieved with periodically constructed metamaterials. The resulting negative refraction (i.e., a reversal of Snell's law) offers the possibility of the superlens and other new phenomena to be actively developed by means of metamaterials.\nMicroscopic explanation.\nAt the atomic scale, an electromagnetic wave's phase velocity is slowed in a material because the electric field creates a disturbance in the charges of each atom (primarily the electrons) proportional to the electric susceptibility of the medium. (Similarly, the magnetic field creates a disturbance proportional to the magnetic susceptibility.) As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave, the charges in the material will be \"shaken\" back and forth at the same frequency. The charges thus radiate their own electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency, but usually with a phase delay, as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them (see sinusoidally driven harmonic oscillator). The light wave traveling in the medium is the macroscopic superposition (sum) of all such contributions in the material: the original wave plus the waves radiated by all the moving charges. This wave is typically a wave with the same frequency but shorter wavelength than the original, leading to a slowing of the wave's phase velocity. Most of the radiation from oscillating material charges will modify the incoming wave, changing its velocity. However, some net energy will be radiated in other directions or even at other frequencies (see scattering).\nDepending on the relative phase of the original driving wave and the waves radiated by the charge motion, there are several possibilities:\nFor most materials at visible-light frequencies, the phase is somewhere between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, corresponding to a combination of both refraction and absorption.\nDispersion.\nThe refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength (and frequency) of light. This is called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide white light into its constituent spectral colors. As the refractive index varies with wavelength, so will the refraction angle as light goes from one material to another. Dispersion also causes the focal length of lenses to be wavelength dependent. This is a type of chromatic aberration, which often needs to be corrected for in imaging systems. In regions of the spectrum where the material does not absorb light, the refractive index tends to decrease with increasing wavelength, and thus increase with frequency. This is called \"normal dispersion\", in contrast to \"anomalous dispersion\", where the refractive index increases with wavelength. For visible light normal dispersion means that the refractive index is higher for blue light than for red.\nFor optics in the visual range, the amount of dispersion of a lens material is often quantified by the Abbe number:\nformula_7\nFor a more accurate description of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index, the Sellmeier equation can be used. It is an empirical formula that works well in describing dispersion. \"Sellmeier coefficients\" are often quoted instead of the refractive index in tables.\nPrincipal refractive index wavelength ambiguity.\nBecause of dispersion, it is usually important to specify the vacuum wavelength of light for which a refractive index is measured. Typically, measurements are done at various well-defined spectral emission lines.\nManufacturers of optical glass in general define principal index of refraction at yellow spectral line of helium () and alternatively at a green spectral line of mercury (), called d and e lines respectively. Abbe number is defined for both and denoted Vd and Ve. The spectral data provided by glass manufacturers is also often more precise for these two wavelengths.\nBoth, d and e spectral lines are singlets and thus are suitable to perform a very precise measurements, such as spectral goniometric method.\nIn practical applications, measurements of refractive index are performed on various refractometers, such as Abbe refractometer. Measurement accuracy of such typical commercial devices is in the order of 0.0002. Refractometers usually measure refractive index nD, defined for sodium doublet D (), which is actually a midpoint between two adjacent yellow spectral lines of sodium. Yellow spectral lines of helium (d) and sodium (D) are apart, which can be considered negligible for typical refractometers, but can cause confusion and lead to errors if accuracy is critical.\nAll three typical principle refractive indices definitions can be found depending on application and region, so a proper subscript should be used to avoid ambiguity.\nComplex refractive index.\nWhen light passes through a medium, some part of it will always be absorbed. This can be conveniently taken into account by defining a complex refractive index,\nformula_8\nThe real and imaginary parts of this refractive index are not independent, and are connected through the Kramers\u2013Kronig relations, i.e. the complex refractive index is a linear response function, ensuring causality. Here, the real part n is the refractive index and indicates the phase velocity, while the imaginary part \u03ba is called the extinction coefficient indicates the amount of attenuation when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the material.128 It is related to the absorption coefficient, formula_9, through:\nformula_10\nThese values depend upon the frequency of the light used in the measurement.\nThat \u03ba corresponds to absorption can be seen by inserting this refractive index into the expression for electric field of a plane electromagnetic wave traveling in the x-direction. This can be done by relating the complex wave number to the complex refractive index through , with \"\u03bb\"0 being the vacuum wavelength; this can be inserted into the plane wave expression for a wave travelling in the x-direction as:\nformula_11\nHere we see that \u03ba gives an exponential decay, as expected from the Beer\u2013Lambert law. Since intensity is proportional to the square of the electric field, intensity will depend on the depth into the material as\nformula_12\nand thus the absorption coefficient is \"\u03b1\" \n 4\u03c0\"\u03ba\"/\"\u03bb\"0,128 and the penetration depth (the distance after which the intensity is reduced by a factor of 1/\"e\") is \"\u03b4\"p \n 1/\"\u03b1\" \n \"\u03bb\"0/4\u03c0\"\u03ba\".\nBoth n and \u03ba are dependent on the frequency. In most circumstances \"\u03ba\" &gt; 0 (light is absorbed) or \"\u03ba\" \n 0 (light travels forever without loss). In special situations, especially in the gain medium of lasers, it is also possible that \"\u03ba\" &lt; 0, corresponding to an amplification of the light.\nAn alternative convention uses instead of , but where \"\u03ba\" &gt; 0 still corresponds to loss. Therefore, these two conventions are inconsistent and should not be confused. The difference is related to defining sinusoidal time dependence as Re[exp(\u2212\"i\u03c9t\")] versus Re[exp(+\"i\u03c9t\")]. See Mathematical descriptions of opacity.\nDielectric loss and non-zero DC conductivity in materials cause absorption. Good dielectric materials such as glass have extremely low DC conductivity, and at low frequencies the dielectric loss is also negligible, resulting in almost no absorption. However, at higher frequencies (such as visible light), dielectric loss may increase absorption significantly, reducing the material's transparency to these frequencies.\nThe real n, and imaginary \u03ba, parts of the complex refractive index are related through the Kramers\u2013Kronig relations. In 1986, A.R. Forouhi and I. Bloomer deduced an equation describing \u03ba as a function of photon energy, E, applicable to amorphous materials. Forouhi and Bloomer then applied the Kramers\u2013Kronig relation to derive the corresponding equation for n as a function of E. The same formalism was applied to crystalline materials by Forouhi and Bloomer in 1988.\nThe refractive index and extinction coefficient, n and \u03ba, are typically measured from quantities that depend on them, such as reflectance, R, or transmittance, T, or ellipsometric parameters, \u03c8 and \u03b4. The determination of n and \u03ba from such measured quantities will involve developing a theoretical expression for R or T, or \u03c8 and \u03b4 in terms of a valid physical model for n and \u03ba. By fitting the theoretical model to the measured R or T, or \u03c8 and \u03b4 using regression analysis, n and \u03ba can be deduced.\nX-ray and extreme UV.\nFor X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation the complex refractive index deviates only slightly from unity and usually has a real part smaller than 1. It is therefore normally written as (or with the alternative convention mentioned above). Far above the atomic resonance frequency delta can be given by\nformula_13\nwhere \"r\"0 is the classical electron radius, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength, and \"n\"e is the electron density. One may assume the electron density is simply the number of electrons per atom Z multiplied by the atomic density, but more accurate calculation of the refractive index requires replacing Z with the complex atomic form factor It follows that\nformula_14\nwith \u03b4 and \u03b2 typically of the order of and .\nRelations to other quantities.\nOptical path length.\nOptical path length (OPL) is the product of the geometric length d of the path light follows through a system, and the index of refraction of the medium through which it propagates,\nformula_15\nThis is an important concept in optics because it determines the phase of the light and governs interference and diffraction of light as it propagates. According to Fermat's principle, light rays can be characterized as those curves that optimize the optical path length.\nRefraction.\nWhen light moves from one medium to another, it changes direction, i.e. it is refracted. If it moves from a medium with refractive index \"n\"1 to one with refractive index \"n\"2, with an incidence angle to the surface normal of \"\u03b8\"1, the refraction angle \"\u03b8\"2 can be calculated from Snell's law:\nformula_16\nWhen light enters a material with higher refractive index, the angle of refraction will be smaller than the angle of incidence and the light will be refracted towards the normal of the surface. The higher the refractive index, the closer to the normal direction the light will travel. When passing into a medium with lower refractive index, the light will instead be refracted away from the normal, towards the surface.\nTotal internal reflection.\nIf there is no angle \"\u03b8\"2 fulfilling Snell's law, i.e.,\nformula_17\nthe light cannot be transmitted and will instead undergo total internal reflection. This occurs only when going to a less optically dense material, i.e., one with lower refractive index. To get total internal reflection the angles of incidence \"\u03b8\"1 must be larger than the critical angle\nformula_18\nReflectivity.\nApart from the transmitted light there is also a reflected part. The reflection angle is equal to the incidence angle, and the amount of light that is reflected is determined by the reflectivity of the surface. The reflectivity can be calculated from the refractive index and the incidence angle with the Fresnel equations, which for normal incidence reduces to\nformula_19\nFor common glass in air, \"n\"1 \n 1 and \"n\"2 \n 1.5, and thus about 4% of the incident power is reflected. At other incidence angles the reflectivity will also depend on the polarization of the incoming light. At a certain angle called Brewster's angle, \"p\"-polarized light (light with the electric field in the plane of incidence) will be totally transmitted. Brewster's angle can be calculated from the two refractive indices of the interface as \nformula_20\nLenses.\nThe focal length of a lens is determined by its refractive index n and the radii of curvature \"R\"1 and \"R\"2 of its surfaces. The power of a thin lens in air is given by the simplified version of the Lensmaker's formula:\nformula_21\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens.\nMicroscope resolution.\nThe resolution of a good optical microscope is mainly determined by the numerical aperture (\"A\"Num) of its objective lens. The numerical aperture in turn is determined by the refractive index n of the medium filling the space between the sample and the lens and the half collection angle of light \u03b8 according to Carlsson (2007):\nformula_22\nFor this reason oil immersion is commonly used to obtain high resolution in microscopy. In this technique the objective is dipped into a drop of high refractive index immersion oil on the sample under study.\nRelative permittivity and permeability.\nThe refractive index of electromagnetic radiation equals\nformula_23\nwhere \"\u03b5\"r is the material's relative permittivity, and \"\u03bc\"r is its relative permeability. The refractive index is used for optics in Fresnel equations and Snell's law; while the relative permittivity and permeability are used in Maxwell's equations and electronics. Most naturally occurring materials are non-magnetic at optical frequencies, that is \"\u03bc\"r is very close to 1, therefore n is approximately . In this particular case, the complex relative permittivity , with real and imaginary parts \"\u03b5\"r and \"\u025b\u0303\"r, and the complex refractive index , with real and imaginary parts n and \u03ba (the latter called the \"extinction coefficient\"), follow the relation\nformula_24\nand their components are related by:\nformula_25\nand:\nformula_26\nwhere formula_27 is the complex modulus.\nWave impedance.\nThe wave impedance of a plane electromagnetic wave in a non-conductive medium is given by\nformula_28\nwhere \"Z\"0 is the vacuum wave impedance, \u03bc and \u03b5 are the absolute permeability and permittivity of the medium, \"\u03b5\"r is the material's relative permittivity, and \"\u03bc\"r is its relative permeability.\nIn non-magnetic media (that is, in materials with \"\u03bc\"r \n 1), formula_29 and formula_30\nThus refractive index in a non-magnetic media is the ratio of the vacuum wave impedance to the wave impedance of the medium.\nThe reflectivity \"R\"0 between two media can thus be expressed both by the wave impedances and the refractive indices as\nformula_31\nDensity.\nIn general, it is assumed that the refractive index of a glass increases with its density. However, there does not exist an overall linear relationship between the refractive index and the density for all silicate and borosilicate glasses. A relatively high refractive index and low density can be obtained with glasses containing light metal oxides such as and , while the opposite trend is observed with glasses containing and as seen in the diagram at the right.\nMany oils (such as olive oil) and ethanol are examples of liquids that are more refractive, but less dense, than water, contrary to the general correlation between density and refractive index.\nFor air, \"n\" - 1 is proportional to the density of the gas as long as the chemical composition does not change. This means that it is also proportional to the pressure and inversely proportional to the temperature for ideal gases. For liquids the same observation can be made as for gases, for instance, the refractive index in alkanes increases nearly perfectly linear with the density. On the other hand, for carboxylic acids, the density decreases with increasing number of C-atoms within the homologeous series. The simple explanation of this finding is that it is not density, but the molar concentration of the chromophore that counts. In homologeous series, this is the excitation of the C-H-bonding. August Beer must have intuitively known that when he gave Hans H. Landolt in 1862 the tip to investigate the refractive index of compounds of homologeous series. While Landolt did not find this relationship, since, at this time dispersion theory was in its infancy, he had the idea of molar refractivity which can even be assigned to single atoms. Based on this concept, the refractive indices of organic materials can be calculated.\nBandgap.\nThe optical refractive index of a semiconductor tends to increase as the bandgap energy decreases. Many attempts have been made to model this relationship beginning with T. S. Moses in 1949. Empirical models can match experimental data over a wide range of materials and yet fail for important cases like InSb, PbS, and Ge. \nThis negative correlation between refractive index and bandgap energy, along with a negative correlation between bandgap and temperature, means that many semiconductors exhibit a positive correlation between refractive index and temperature. This is the opposite of most materials, where the refractive index decreases with temperature as a result of a decreasing material density.\nGroup index.\nSometimes, a \"group velocity refractive index\", usually called the \"group index\" is defined:\nformula_32\nwhere \"v\"g is the group velocity. This value should not be confused with n, which is always defined with respect to the phase velocity. When the dispersion is small, the group velocity can be linked to the phase velocity by the relation\nformula_33\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength in the medium. In this case the group index can thus be written in terms of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index as\nformula_34\nWhen the refractive index of a medium is known as a function of the vacuum wavelength (instead of the wavelength in the medium), the corresponding expressions for the group velocity and index are (for all values of dispersion)\nformula_35\nwhere \"\u03bb\"0 is the wavelength in vacuum.\nVelocity, momentum, and polarizability.\nAs shown in the Fizeau experiment, when light is transmitted through a moving medium, its speed relative to an observer traveling with speed v in the same direction as the light is:\nformula_36\nThe momentum of photons in a medium of refractive index n is a complex and controversial issue with two different values having different physical interpretations.\nThe refractive index of a substance can be related to its polarizability with the Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation or to the molar refractivities of its constituents by the Gladstone\u2013Dale relation.\nRefractivity.\nIn atmospheric applications, refractivity is defined as \"N\" \n \"n\" \u2013 1, often rescaled as either \"N\" \n 106 (\"n\" \u2013 1) or \"N\" \n 108 (\"n\" \u2013 1); the multiplication factors are used because the refractive index for air, n deviates from unity by at most a few parts per ten thousand.\n\"Molar refractivity\", on the other hand, is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance and can be calculated from the refractive index as\nformula_37\nwhere \u03c1 is the density, and M is the molar mass.\nNonscalar, nonlinear, or nonhomogeneous refraction.\nSo far, we have assumed that refraction is given by linear equations involving a spatially constant, scalar refractive index. These assumptions can break down in different ways, to be described in the following subsections.\nBirefringence.\nIn some materials, the refractive index depends on the polarization and propagation direction of the light. This is called birefringence or optical anisotropy.\nIn the simplest form, uniaxial birefringence, there is only one special direction in the material. This axis is known as the optical axis of the material. Light with linear polarization perpendicular to this axis will experience an \"ordinary\" refractive index \"n\"o while light polarized in parallel will experience an \"extraordinary\" refractive index \"n\"e. The birefringence of the material is the difference between these indices of refraction, \u0394\"n\" \n \"n\"e \u2212 \"n\"o. Light propagating in the direction of the optical axis will not be affected by the birefringence since the refractive index will be \"n\"o independent of polarization. For other propagation directions the light will split into two linearly polarized beams. For light traveling perpendicularly to the optical axis the beams will have the same direction. This can be used to change the polarization direction of linearly polarized light or to convert between linear, circular, and elliptical polarizations with waveplates.\nMany crystals are naturally birefringent, but isotropic materials such as plastics and glass can also often be made birefringent by introducing a preferred direction through, e.g., an external force or electric field. This effect is called photoelasticity, and can be used to reveal stresses in structures. The birefringent material is placed between crossed polarizers. A change in birefringence alters the polarization and thereby the fraction of light that is transmitted through the second polarizer.\nIn the more general case of trirefringent materials described by the field of crystal optics, the \"dielectric constant\" is a rank-2 tensor (a 3 by 3 matrix). In this case the propagation of light cannot simply be described by refractive indices except for polarizations along principal axes.\nNonlinearity.\nThe strong electric field of high intensity light (such as the output of a laser) may cause a medium's refractive index to vary as the light passes through it, giving rise to nonlinear optics. If the index varies quadratically with the field (linearly with the intensity), it is called the optical Kerr effect and causes phenomena such as self-focusing and self-phase modulation. If the index varies linearly with the field (a nontrivial linear coefficient is only possible in materials that do not possess inversion symmetry), it is known as the Pockels effect.\nInhomogeneity.\nIf the refractive index of a medium is not constant but varies gradually with the position, the material is known as a gradient-index (GRIN) medium and is described by gradient index optics. Light traveling through such a medium can be bent or focused, and this effect can be exploited to produce lenses, some optical fibers, and other devices. Introducing GRIN elements in the design of an optical system can greatly simplify the system, reducing the number of elements by as much as a third while maintaining overall performance. The crystalline lens of the human eye is an example of a GRIN lens with a refractive index varying from about 1.406 in the inner core to approximately 1.386 at the less dense cortex. Some common mirages are caused by a spatially varying refractive index of air.\nDetermination.\nHomogeneous media.\nThe refractive index of liquids or solids can be determined with refractometers. They typically measure some angle of refraction or the critical angle for total internal reflection. The first laboratory refractometers sold commercially were developed by Ernst Abbe in the late 19th century.\nThe same principles are still used today. In this instrument, a thin layer of the liquid to be measured is placed between two prisms. Light is shone through the liquid at incidence angles all the way up to 90\u00b0, i.e., light rays parallel to the surface. The second prism should have an index of refraction higher than that of the liquid, so that light only enters the prism at angles smaller than the critical angle for total reflection. This angle can then be measured either by looking through a telescope, or with a digital photodetector placed in the focal plane of a lens. The refractive index n of the liquid can then be calculated from the maximum transmission angle \u03b8 as \"n\" = \"n\"G sin \"\u03b8\", where \"n\"G is the refractive index of the prism.\nThis type of device is commonly used in chemical laboratories for identification of substances and for quality control. Handheld variants are used in agriculture by, e.g., wine makers to determine sugar content in grape juice, and inline process refractometers are used in, e.g., chemical and pharmaceutical industry for process control.\nIn gemology, a different type of refractometer is used to measure the index of refraction and birefringence of gemstones. The gem is placed on a high refractive index prism and illuminated from below. A high refractive index contact liquid is used to achieve optical contact between the gem and the prism. At small incidence angles most of the light will be transmitted into the gem, but at high angles total internal reflection will occur in the prism. The critical angle is normally measured by looking through a telescope.\nRefractive index variations.\nUnstained biological structures appear mostly transparent under bright-field microscopy as most cellular structures do not attenuate appreciable quantities of light. Nevertheless, the variation in the materials that constitute these structures also corresponds to a variation in the refractive index. The following techniques convert such variation into measurable amplitude differences:\nTo measure the spatial variation of the refractive index in a sample phase-contrast imaging methods are used. These methods measure the variations in phase of the light wave exiting the sample. The phase is proportional to the optical path length the light ray has traversed, and thus gives a measure of the integral of the refractive index along the ray path. The phase cannot be measured directly at optical or higher frequencies, and therefore needs to be converted into intensity by interference with a reference beam. In the visual spectrum this is done using Zernike phase-contrast microscopy, differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC), or interferometry.\nZernike phase-contrast microscopy introduces a phase shift to the low spatial frequency components of the image with a phase-shifting annulus in the Fourier plane of the sample, so that high-spatial-frequency parts of the image can interfere with the low-frequency reference beam. In DIC the illumination is split up into two beams that are given different polarizations, are phase shifted differently, and are shifted transversely with slightly different amounts. After the specimen, the two parts are made to interfere, giving an image of the derivative of the optical path length in the direction of the difference in the transverse shift. In interferometry the illumination is split up into two beams by a partially reflective mirror. One of the beams is let through the sample before they are combined to interfere and give a direct image of the phase shifts. If the optical path length variations are more than a wavelength the image will contain fringes.\nThere exist several phase-contrast X-ray imaging techniques to determine 2D or 3D spatial distribution of refractive index of samples in the X-ray regime.\nApplications.\nThe refractive index is an important property of the components of any optical instrument. It determines the focusing power of lenses, the dispersive power of prisms, the reflectivity of lens coatings, and the light-guiding nature of optical fiber. Since the refractive index is a fundamental physical property of a substance, it is often used to identify a particular substance, confirm its purity, or measure its concentration. The refractive index is used to measure solids, liquids, and gases. It can be used, for example, to measure the concentration of a solute in an aqueous solution. It can also be used as a useful tool to differentiate between different types of gemstone, due to the unique chatoyance each individual stone displays. A refractometer is the instrument used to measure the refractive index. For a solution of sugar, the refractive index can be used to determine the sugar content (see Brix).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25882", "revid": "199747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25882", "title": "Roman Kingdom", "text": "Period of Roman history (c. 753 \u2013 c. 509 BC)\nThe Roman Kingdom, also known as the Roman monarchy and the regal period of ancient Rome, was the earliest period of Roman history, when the city and its territory were ruled by kings. According to tradition, the Roman Kingdom began with the city's founding c.\u2009753\u00a0BC, with settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber in central Italy, and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic c.\u2009509\u00a0BC.\nLittle is certain about the kingdom's history as no records and few inscriptions from the time of the kings have survived. The accounts of this period written during the Republic and the Empire are thought largely to be based on oral tradition.\nOrigin.\nThe site of the founding of the Roman Kingdom (and eventual Republic and Empire) included a ford where one could cross the river Tiber in central Italy. The Palatine Hill and hills surrounding it provided easily defensible positions in the wide fertile plain surrounding them. Each of these features contributed to the success of the city.\nThe traditional version of Roman history, which has come down principally through Livy (64 or 59 BC\u00a0\u2013 AD 12 or 17), Plutarch (46\u2013120), and Dionysius of Halicarnassus (c. 60 BC \u2013 after 7 BC), recounts that a series of seven kings ruled the settlement in Rome's first centuries. The traditional chronology, as codified by Varro (116 BC \u2013 27 BC) and Fabius Pictor (c. 270 \u2013 c. 200 BC), allows 243 years for their combined reigns, an average of almost 35 years. Since the work of Barthold Georg Niebuhr, modern scholarship has generally discounted this schema. The Gauls destroyed many of Rome's historical records when they sacked the city after the Battle of the Allia in 390 BC (according to Varro; according to Polybius, the battle occurred in 387\u20136), and what remained eventually fell prey to time or to theft. With no contemporary records of the kingdom surviving, all accounts of the Roman kings must be carefully questioned.\nMonarchy.\nThe kings following Romulus, the city's founder, were elected by the people of Rome to serve for life, and did not rely upon military force to gain or keep the throne. The only king to break fully with this tradition was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the final king, who according to tradition seized power from his predecessor and ruled as a tyrant.\nIn reality, most kings of Rome seem to have been leaders of armed bands who through persuasion or force acquired the support of the Roman aristocracy. The kings were not necessarily of Roman or Latin origin. Arnaldo Momigliano writes, \"There was probably only a thin dividing line between the band chief called in to help an existing \"rex\" [king] and a band chief called in to replace him and therefore to rule in his stead.\"\nThe insignia of the kings of Rome were twelve lictors (attendants or servants) wielding the symbolic fasces bearing axes, the right to sit upon a curule seat, the purple \"toga picta\", red shoes, and a white diadem around the head. Of all these insignia, the most important was the purple \"toga picta\".\nChief Executive.\nThe king was invested with supreme military, executive, and judicial authority through the use of \"imperium\", formally granted to the king by the Curiate Assembly with the passing of the \"Lex curiata de imperio\" at the beginning of each king's reign. The \"imperium\" of the king was held for life and protected him from ever being brought to trial for his actions. As the king was the sole owner of \"imperium\" in Rome at the time, he possessed ultimate executive power and unchecked military authority as the commander-in-chief of all of the Roman legions. Also, the laws that kept citizens safe from magistrates' misuse of \"imperium\" did not exist during the monarchical period.\nThe king had the power to either appoint or nominate all officials to offices. He would appoint a \"tribunus celerum\" to serve as both the tribune of the Ramnes tribe in Rome and as the commander of the king's personal bodyguard, the \"celeres\". The king was required to appoint the tribune upon entering office and the tribune left office upon the king's death. The tribune was second in rank to the king and also possessed the power to convene the Curiate Assembly and lay legislation before it.\nAnother officer appointed by the king was the \"praefectus urbi\", who acted as the warden of the city. When the king was absent from the city, the prefect held all of the king's powers and abilities, even to the point of being bestowed with \"imperium\" while inside the city.\nThe king also received the right to be the only person to appoint patricians to the Senate.\nChief Priest.\nWhat is known for certain is that the king alone possessed the right to the augury on behalf of Rome as its chief augur, and no public business could be performed without the will of the gods made known through auspices. The people knew the king as a mediator between them and the gods (cf. Latin \"pontifex\", \"bridge-builder\", in this sense, between men and the gods) and thus viewed the king with religious awe. This made the king the head of the national religion and its chief executive. Having the power to control the Roman calendar, he conducted all religious ceremonies and appointed lower religious offices and officers. It is said that Romulus himself instituted the augurs and was believed to have been the best augur of all. Likewise, King Numa Pompilius instituted the pontiffs and through them developed the foundations of the religious dogma of Rome.\nChief Legislator.\nUnder the kings, the Senate and Curiate Assembly had very little power and authority. They were not independent since they lacked the right to meet together and discuss questions of state at their own will. They could be called together only by the king (and the tribune in the case of the Curiate Assembly) and could discuss only the matters that the king laid before them. While the Curiate Assembly had the power to pass laws that had been submitted by the king, the Senate was effectively an honorary council. It could advise the king on his action but by no means could prevent him from acting. The only thing that the king could not do without the approval of the Senate and the Curiate Assembly was to declare war against a foreign nation.\nChief Judge.\nThe king's \"imperium\" both granted him military powers and qualified him to pronounce legal judgement in all cases as the chief justice of Rome. Though he could assign pontiffs to act as minor judges in some cases, he had supreme authority in all cases brought before him, both civil and criminal. This made the king supreme in times of both war and peace. While some writers believed there was no appeal from the king's decisions, others believed that a proposal for appeal could be brought before the king by any patrician during a meeting of the Curiate Assembly.\nTo assist the king, a council advised him during all trials, but this council had no power to control his decisions. Also, two criminal detectives (\"quaestores parricidi\") were appointed by him as well as a two-man criminal court (\"duumviri perduellionis\"), which oversaw cases of treason. According to Livy, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and final king of Rome, judged capital criminal cases without the advice of counsellors, thereby creating fear amongst those who might think to oppose him.\nElection of the kings.\nWhenever a king died, Rome entered a period of interregnum. Supreme power of the state would devolve to the Senate, which was responsible for finding a new king. The Senate would assemble and appoint one of its own members\u2014the interrex\u2014to serve for a period of five days with the sole purpose of nominating the next king of Rome. If no king were nominated at the end of five days, with the Senate's consent the interrex would appoint another Senator to succeed him for another five-day term. This process would continue until a new king was elected. Once the interrex found a suitable nominee to the kingship, he would bring the nominee before the Senate and the Curiate would review him. If the Senate passed the nominee, the interrex would convene the Curiate Assembly and preside over it during the election of the king. Once the nominee was proposed to the Curiate Assembly, the citizens of Rome could either accept or reject him. If accepted, the king-elect did not immediately enter office. Two other acts still had to take place before he was invested with the full regal authority and power.\nFirst, it was necessary to obtain the divine will of the gods respecting his appointment by means of the auspices, since the king would serve as high priest of Rome. This ceremony was performed by an augur, who conducted the king-elect to the citadel, where he was placed on a stone seat as the people waited below. If found worthy of the kingship, the augur announced that the gods had given favourable tokens, thus confirming the king's priestly character. The second act which had to be performed was the conferral of the \"imperium\" upon the king. The Curiate Assembly's previous vote only determined who was to be king, and had not by that act bestowed the necessary power of the king upon him. Accordingly, the king himself proposed to the Curiate Assembly a law granting him \"imperium\", and the Curiate Assembly by voting in favor of the law would grant it. In theory, the people of Rome elected their leader, but the Senate had most of the control over the process.\nSenate.\nAccording to legend, Romulus established the Senate after he founded Rome by personally selecting the most noble men (wealthy men with legitimate wives and children) to serve as a council for the city. As such, the Senate was the King's advisory council as the Council of State. The Senate was composed of 300 senators, with 100 senators representing each of the three ancient tribes of Rome: the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres. Within each tribe, a senator was selected from each of the tribe's ten curiae. The king had the sole authority to appoint the senators, but this selection was done in accordance with ancient custom.\nUnder the monarchy, the Senate possessed very little power and authority as the king held most of the political power of the state and could exercise those powers without the Senate's consent. The chief function of the Senate was to serve as the king's council and be his legislative coordinator. Once legislation proposed by the king passed the Curiate Assembly, the Senate could either veto it or accept it as law. The king was, by custom, to seek the advice of the Senate on major issues. However, it was left to him to decide what issues, if any, were brought before them and he was free to accept or reject their advice as he saw fit. Only the king possessed the power to convene the Senate, except during the interregnum, during which the Senate possessed the authority to convene itself.\n\"Dates follow Livy's chronology of reign-lengths. Consult particular article for details of each king.\"\nKings of Rome.\nRomulus.\nSon of the Vestal Virgin Rhea Silvia, ostensibly by the god Mars, the legendary Romulus was Rome's founder and first king. After he and his twin brother Remus had deposed King Amulius of Alba and reinstated the king's brother and their grandfather Numitor to the throne, they decided to build a city in the area where they had been abandoned as infants. After killing Remus in a dispute, Romulus began building the city on the Palatine Hill. His work began with fortifications. He permitted men of all classes to come to Rome as citizens, including slaves and freemen without distinction. He is credited with establishing the city's religious, legal and political institutions. The kingdom was established by unanimous acclaim with him at the helm when Romulus called the citizenry to a council for the purposes of determining their government.\nRomulus established the Senate as an advisory council with the appointment of 100 of the most noble men in the community. These men he called \"patres\" (from \"pater\", father, head), and their descendants became the patricians. To project command, he surrounded himself with attendants, in particular the twelve lictors. He created three divisions of horsemen (\"equites\"), called \"centuries\": \"Ramnes\" (Romans), \"Tities\" (after the Sabine king) and \"Luceres\" (Etruscans). He also divided the populace into 30 \"curiae\", named after 30 of the Sabine women who had intervened to end the war between Romulus and Tatius. The \"curiae\" formed the voting units in the popular assemblies (\"Comitia Curiata\").\nRomulus was behind one of the most notorious acts in Roman history, the incident commonly known as \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\". To provide his citizens with wives, Romulus invited the neighbouring tribes to a festival in Rome where the Romans committed a mass abduction of young women from among the attendees. The accounts vary from 30 to 683 women taken, a significant number for a population of 3,000 Latins (and presumably for the Sabines as well). War broke out when Romulus refused to return the captives. After the Sabines made three unsuccessful attempts to invade the hill settlements of Rome, the women themselves intervened during the Battle of the Lacus Curtius to end the war. The two peoples were united in a joint kingdom, with Romulus and the Sabine king Titus Tatius sharing the throne. In addition to the war with the Sabines, Romulus waged war with the Fidenates and Veientes and others.\nHe reigned for thirty-seven years. According to the legend, Romulus vanished at age fifty-four while reviewing his troops on the Campus Martius. He was reported to have been taken up to Mt. Olympus in a whirlwind and made a god. After initial acceptance by the public, rumours and suspicions of foul play by the patricians began to grow. In particular, some thought that members of the nobility had murdered him, dismembered his body, and buried the pieces on their land. These were set aside after an esteemed nobleman testified that Romulus had come to him in a vision and told him that he was the god Quirinus. He became not only one of the three major gods of Rome, but the very likeness of the city itself.\nA replica of Romulus's hut was maintained in the centre of Rome until the end of the Roman Empire.\nNuma Pompilius.\nAfter Romulus died, there was an interregnum for one year, during which ten men chosen from the Senate governed Rome as successive \"interreges\". Under popular pressure, the Senate finally chose the Sabine Numa Pompilius to succeed Romulus, on account of his reputation for justice and piety. The choice was accepted by the Curiate Assembly.\nNuma's reign was marked by peace and religious reform. He constructed a new temple to Janus and, after establishing peace with Rome's neighbours, closed the doors of the temple to indicate a state of peace. They remained closed for the rest of his reign. He established the Vestal Virgins at Rome, as well as the Salii, and the flamines for Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. He also established the office and duties of \"pontifex maximus\". Numa reigned for 43 years. He reformed the Roman calendar by adjusting it for the solar and lunar year, as well as by adding the months of January and February to bring the total number of months to twelve.\nTullus Hostilius.\nTullus Hostilius was as warlike as Romulus had been, completely unlike Numa as he lacked any respect for the gods. Tullus waged war against Alba Longa, Fidenae and Veii and the Sabines. During Tullus's reign, the city of Alba Longa was completely destroyed and Tullus integrated its population into Rome. Tullus is attributed with constructing a new home for the Senate, the Curia Hostilia, which survived for 562 years after his death.\nAccording to Livy, Tullus neglected the worship of the gods until, towards the end of his reign, he fell ill and became superstitious. However, when Tullus called upon Jupiter and begged assistance, Jupiter responded with a bolt of lightning that burned the king and his house to ashes. His reign lasted for 32 years.\nAncus Marcius.\nFollowing the mysterious death of Tullus, the Romans elected a peaceful and religious king in his place, Numa's grandson, Ancus Marcius. Much like his grandfather, Ancus did little to expand the borders of Rome and only fought wars to defend the territory. He also built Rome's first prison on the Capitoline Hill.\nAncus further fortified the Janiculum Hill on the western bank, and built the first bridge across the Tiber River. He also founded the port of Ostia Antica on the Tyrrhenian Sea and established Rome's first salt works, as well as the city's first aqueduct. Rome grew, as Ancus used diplomacy to peacefully unite smaller surrounding cities into alliance with Rome. Thus, he completed the conquest of the Latins and relocated them to the Aventine Hill, thus forming the plebeian class of Romans.\nHe died a natural death, like his grandfather, after 25 years as king, marking the end of Rome's Latin\u2013Sabine kings.\nLucius Tarquinius Priscus.\nLucius Tarquinius Priscus was the fifth king of Rome and the first of Etruscan birth. After immigrating to Rome, he gained favour with Ancus, who later adopted him as son. Upon ascending the throne, he waged wars against the Sabines and Etruscans, doubling the size of Rome and bringing great treasures to the city. To accommodate the influx of population, the Aventine and Caelian hills were populated.\nOne of his first reforms was to add 100 new members to the Senate from the conquered Etruscan tribes, bringing the total number of senators to 200. He used the treasures Rome had acquired from the conquests to build great monuments for Rome. Among these were Rome's great sewer systems, the Cloaca Maxima, which he used to drain the swamp-like area between the Seven Hills of Rome. In its place, he began construction on the Roman Forum. He also founded the Roman games.\nPriscus initiated great building projects, including the city's first bridge, the Pons Sublicius. The most famous is the Circus Maximus, a giant stadium for chariot races. After that, he started the building of the temple-fortress to the god Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. However, before it was completed, he was killed by a son of Ancus Marcius, after 38 years as king. His reign is best remembered for introducing the Roman symbols of military and civil offices, and the Roman triumph, being the first Roman to celebrate one.\nServius Tullius.\nPriscus was succeeded by his son-in-law Servius Tullius, Rome's second king of Etruscan birth, and the son of a slave. Like his father-in-law, Servius fought successful wars against the Etruscans. He used the booty to build the first wall all around the Seven Hills of Rome, the \"pomerium\". He also reorganized the army.\nServius Tullius instituted a new constitution, further developing the citizen classes. He instituted Rome's first census, which divided the population into five economic classes, and formed the Centuriate Assembly. He used the census to divide the population into four urban tribes based on location, thus establishing the Tribal Assembly. He also oversaw the construction of the Temple of Diana on the Aventine Hill.\nServius' reforms made a big change in Roman life: voting rights based on socio-economic status, favouring elites. However, over time, Servius increasingly favoured the poor in order to gain support from plebeians, often at the expense of patricians. After a 44-year reign, Servius was killed in a conspiracy by his daughter Tullia and her husband Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.\nIn the 1st century AD, the emperor Claudius mentioned Mastarna, an Etruscan adventurer who became king of Rome after the death of his chief Caelius Vibenna; Claudius identified Mastarna with Servius Tullius. Mastarna and Caelius Vibenna are also depicted on the Fran\u00e7ois Tomb, a painted tomb with Etruscan inscriptions usually dated to the 4th or 3rd century BC. Mastarna\u2014whose name appears to be the Etruscan form of the Latin title 'leader'\u2014may have become king of Rome in the time of the Tarquinii. Momigliano writes that Mastarna \"is so different from the traditional Servius Tullius that it appears prudent to keep the two apart.\"\nLucius Tarquinius Superbus.\nThe seventh and final king of Rome was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. He was the son of Priscus and the son-in-law of Servius, whom he and his wife had killed. He ruled for 25 years.\nTarquinius waged a number of wars against Rome's neighbours, including against the Volsci, Gabii and the Rutuli. He also secured Rome's position as head of the Latin cities. He also engaged in a series of public works, notably the completion of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, and works on the Cloaca Maxima and the Circus Maximus. However, Tarquin's reign is remembered for his use of violence and intimidation to control Rome and his disrespect for Roman custom and the Roman Senate.\nTensions came to a head when the king's son, Sextus Tarquinius, raped Lucretia, wife and daughter to powerful Roman nobles. Lucretia told her relatives about the attack, and committed suicide to avoid the dishonour of the episode. Four men, led by Lucius Junius Brutus, and including Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, Publius Valerius Poplicola, and Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus incited a revolution that deposed and expelled Tarquinius and his family from Rome in 509 BC. Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus became Rome's first consuls, marking the beginning of the Roman Republic. An attempt by the Etruscan ruler Lars Porsena to restore the Tarquinii to power was abandoned, and a subsequent attack by Porsena's son on Aricia was beaten back by the Latins and their allies from Cumae.\nIn the 1st century AD, the Roman historians Tacitus and Pliny recorded an alternative tradition, according to which Porsena had actually captured Rome and imposed humiliating conditions on the Romans. Thus, some modern scholars have suggested that Porsena took Rome and from there attacked Aricia, withdrawing after his defeat. According to Tim Cornell, rather than trying to restore the Tarquinii at all, it is more likely that Porsena abolished the Roman monarchy, and that the republic was established after his departure. Momigliano writes that, if Porsena did in fact take Rome, he must have installed a new Etruscan ruler there, and the Romans probably did not elect their first consuls until after the defeat of Porsena by the other Latins and the Cumaeans.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R\u00e1n and her husband \u00c6gir, a j\u00f6tunn who also personifies the sea, and the two together produced nine daughters who personify the waves. The goddess is frequently associated with a net, which she uses to capture sea-goers. According to the prose introduction to a poem in the \"Poetic Edda\" and in \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\", R\u00e1n once loaned her net to the god Loki.\nR\u00e1n is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled during the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the \"Prose Edda\", written during the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in both \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\" and \"Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna\"; and in the poetry of skalds, such as \"Sonatorrek\", a 10th-century poem by Icelandic skald Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson.\nEtymology.\nThe Old Norse common noun \"r\u00e1n\" means 'plundering' or 'theft, robbery'. In turn, scholars view the theonym \"R\u00e1n\" as meaning, for example, 'theft, robbery'. On the etymology of the theonym, scholar Rudolf Simek says, \"although the meaning of the name has not been fully clarified, R\u00e1n was probably understood as being 'robber' ... and has nothing to do with [Old Norse] \"r\u00e1\u00f0a\" 'rule'.\nBecause R\u00e1n is a personification of the sea, skalds employ her name in a variety of kennings to refer to the sea. Examples include \"R\u00e1nar-land\" ('R\u00e1n's land'), \"-salr\" ('R\u00e1n's hall'), and \"-vegr\" ('R\u00e1n's way'), and also \"r\u00e1n-be\u00f0r\" ('the bed of R\u00e1n') meaning 'the bed of the sea'.\nAttestations.\n\"Sonatorrek\".\nR\u00e1n and \u00c6gir receive mention in the poem \"Sonatorrek\" attributed to 10th century Icelandic skald Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson. In the poem, Egill laments the death of his son B\u00f6\u00f0var, who drowned at sea during a storm:\nIn one difficult stanza later in the poem, the skald expresses the pain of losing his son by invoking the image of slaying the personified sea, personified as \u00c6gir (Old Norse \"\u01eblsmi\u00f0[r]\" 'ale-smith') and R\u00e1n (\"\u00c6gis man\" '\u00c6gir's wife'):\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nR\u00e1n receives three mentions in the \"Poetic Edda\"; twice in poetry and once in prose. The first mention occurs in a stanza in \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I\", when the valkyrie Sigr\u00fan assists the ship of the hero Helgi Hundingsbane as it encounters ferocious waters:\nIn the notes for her translation, Larrington says that R\u00e1n \"seeks to catch and drown men in her net\" and that \"to give someone to the sea-goddess is to drown them.\"\nThe second instance occurs in a stanza found in \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0ssonar\". In this stanza, the hero Atli references R\u00e1n while flyting with Hr\u00edmger\u00f0r, a female j\u00f6tunn:\nFinally, in the prose introduction to \"Reginsm\u00e1l\", Loki visits R\u00e1n (here rendered as \"Ron\") to borrow her net:\n[Odin and H\u0153nir] sent Loki to get the gold; he went to Ron and got her net, and went then to Andvari's fall and cast the net in front of the pike, and the pike leaped into the net.\nTranslator Henry Adams Bellows notes how this version of the narrative differs from how it appears in other sources, where Loki catches the pike with his own hands.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nThe \"Prose Edda\" sections \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" and \"H\u00e1ttatal\" contain several references to R\u00e1n. Section 25 of \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" (\"How shall sea be referred to?\") lists ways in which poets may refer to the sea, including \"husband of Ran\" and \"land of Ran and of \u00c6gir's daughters\", but also \"father of \u00c6gir's daughters\".\nIn the same section, the author cites a fragment of a work by the 11th century Icelandic skald Hofgar\u00f0a-Refr Gestsson, where R\u00e1n is referred to as 'Gymir's ... v\u00f6lva':\nThe section's author comments that the stanza \"[implies] that they are all the same, \u00c6gir and Hler and Gymir. The author follows with a quote from another stanza by the skald that references R\u00e1n:\nBut sea-crest-Sleipnir [ship], spray-driven, tears his breast, covered with red paint, out of white Ran's mouth [the sea's grasp].\nChapter 33 of \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" discusses why skalds may refer to gold as \"\u00c6gir's fire\". The section traces the kenning to a narrative surrounding \u00c6gir, in which the j\u00f6tunn employs \"glowing gold\" in the center of his hall to light it \"like fire\" (which the narrator compares to flaming swords in Valhalla). The section explains that \"Ran is the name of \u00c6gir's wife, and the names of their nine daughters are as was written above ... Then the \u00c6sir discovered that Ran had a net in which she caught everyone that went to sea ... so this is the story of the origin of gold being called fire or light or brightness of \u00c6gir, Ran or \u00c6gir's daughters, and from such kennings the practice has now developed of calling gold fire of the sea and of all terms for it, since \u00c6gir and Ran's names are also terms for the sea, and hence gold is now called fire of lakes or rivers and of all river-names.\"\nIn the \"Nafna\u00feulur\" section of \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", R\u00e1n appears in a list of goddesses (Old Norse \"\u00e1synjur\").\n\"V\u00f6lsunga saga\" and \"Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna\".\nR\u00e1n receives a single mention in \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\". Like in the prose introduction to the eddic poem \"Reginsm\u00e1l\" (discussed above), \"they sent Loki to obtain the gold. He went to Ran and got her net.\"\nIn the legendary saga \"Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna\", Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fr and his men find themselves in a violent storm, and the protagonist mourns that he will soon rest in R\u00e1n's bed:\nThe protagonist then decides that as they are to \"go to R\u00e1n\" (\"at til R\u00e1nar skal fara\") they would better do so in style with gold on each man. He divides the gold and talks of her again:\nScholarly reception and interpretation.\nAccording to Rudolf Simek, \"... R\u00e1n is the ruler of the realm of the dead at the bottom of the sea to which people who have drowned go.\" Simek says that \"while \u00c6gir personifies the sea as a friendly power, R\u00e1n embodies the sinister side of the sea, at least in the eyes of the late Viking Age Icelandic seafarers.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25892", "revid": "4064894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25892", "title": "Roxy Music", "text": "English art rock band\nRoxy Music were an English rock band formed in 1970 by Bryan Ferry (lead vocals/keyboards/principal songwriter) and Graham Simpson (bass). By the time the band recorded their first album in early 1972, Ferry and Simpson were joined by Andy Mackay (saxophone/oboe), Phil Manzanera (guitar), Paul Thompson (drums) and Brian Eno (synthesizer). Simpson departed in mid-1972, from which point the bassist position in the band would be unstable, while Eno was replaced by Eddie Jobson (synthesizer/keyboards/violin) in mid-1973. By 1980, the band was reduced to a core trio of Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera, augmented by various backing musicians.\nBeginning with their first album, Roxy Music became a successful act in Europe and Australia during the 1970s. The band pioneered more musically sophisticated elements of glam rock, significantly influencing early English punk music, and provided a model for many new wave acts while innovating elements of electronic composition. The group also conveyed their distinctive brand of visual and musical sophistication with their focus on glamorous fashions.\nRoxy Music split in 1976, reformed in 1978, and split again in 1983. Their final studio album was \"Avalon\" (1982), which was certified Platinum in the United States, where the band had spent their first ten years as a moderately successful cult band. In 2001, Ferry, Mackay, Manzanera and Thompson reunited for a concert tour and have toured together intermittently ever since, most recently in 2022 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their first album.\nOutside the band, Ferry and Eno have had influential solo careers. Ferry has frequently enlisted Roxy Music members as backing musicians during his solo career, and Eno became one of the most significant British record producers of the late 20th century. In 2019, Roxy Music were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1970\u20131971).\nIn November 1970, Bryan Ferry, who had just lost his job teaching ceramics at a girls' school for holding impromptu record-listening sessions, advertised for a keyboardist to collaborate with him and Graham Simpson, a bassist he knew from his Newcastle University formed band, the Gas Board, and with whom he collaborated on his first songs. Andy Mackay replied to Ferry's advertisement. Although more proficient on saxophone and oboe, Mackay owned an EMS VCS 3 synthesizer.\nMackay had met Brian Eno during university days, as both were interested in avant-garde and electronic music. Although Eno was a non-musician, he could operate a synthesizer and owned a Revox reel-to-reel tape machine, so Mackay convinced him to join the band as a technical adviser. Before long Eno was an official member of the group. Rounding out the original sextet were guitarist Roger Bunn (who had issued the well-regarded solo studio album \"Piece of Mind\" earlier in 1970) and drummer Dexter Lloyd, a classically trained timpanist.\nThe group's name was derived from Ferry and Mackay making a list of old cinemas, and Ferry picking Roxy because it had a \"resonance\", some \"faded glamour\", and \"didn't really mean anything\". After learning of an American band with the name Roxy, Ferry changed the name to Roxy Music, a play on \"rock music\".\nAt some time during late 1970/early 1971, Ferry auditioned as lead vocalist for King Crimson, who were seeking a replacement for Gordon Haskell. While Robert Fripp and Peter Sinfield decided Ferry's voice was unsuitable for King Crimson's material, they were impressed with his talent and helped the fledgling Roxy Music to obtain a recording contract with E.G. Records.\nIn 1971, Roxy Music recorded a demo tape of some early compositions. In the spring of that year, Lloyd left the band, and an advertisement was placed in \"Melody Maker\" saying \"wonder drummer wanted for an avant rock group\". Paul Thompson responded to the advertisement and joined the band in June 1971.\nBunn left the group at the end of the summer of 1971, and in October, Roxy Music advertised in \"Melody Maker\" seeking the \"Perfect Guitarist\". The successful applicant was David O'List, former guitarist with the Nice. Phil Manzanera\u2014soon to become a group member\u2014was one of about twenty other players who also auditioned. Although he did not initially make the band as a guitarist, the group were impressed enough with Manzanera that he was invited to become Roxy Music's roadie, an offer which he accepted. In December 1971, after a year of writing and rehearsing, Roxy Music began playing live, with their first show at the Friends of the Tate Gallery Christmas show in London.\nThe band's fortunes were greatly increased by the support of broadcaster John Peel and \"Melody Maker\" journalist Richard Williams. Williams became an enthusiastic fan after meeting Ferry and being given a demonstration tape during mid-1971, and wrote the first major article on the band, featured on \"Melody Maker\"'s \"Horizons\" page in the edition of 7 August 1971. This line-up of Roxy Music (Ferry/Mackay/Eno/Simpson/Thompson/O'List) recorded a BBC session shortly thereafter.\nFirst two studio albums (1972\u20131973).\nIn early February 1972, guitarist O'List quit the group abruptly after an altercation with Paul Thompson, which took place at their audition for David Enthoven of E.G. Management. When O'List did not show up for the next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band's sound mixer. When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O'List's permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, who was a friend of his elder brother, and Soft Machine's Robert Wyatt. Two weeks after Manzanera joined the band, Roxy Music signed with E.G. Management.\nE.G. Management financed the recording of the tracks for their debut album, \"Roxy Music\", recorded in March\u2013April 1972 and produced by King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield. Both the album and its famous cover artwork by photographer Karl Stoecker were apparently completed before the group signed with Island Records. A&amp;R staffer Tim Clark later stated that although he argued strongly that Island should contract them, company boss Chris Blackwell at first seemed unimpressed and Clark assumed he was not interested. A few days later, however, Clark and Enthoven were standing in the hallway of the Island offices examining cover images for the album when Blackwell walked past, glanced at the artwork and said \"Looks great! Have we got them signed yet?\" The band signed with Island Records a few days later. The album was released in June to good reviews and became a major success, reaching No.\u00a010 on the UK Albums Chart in September 1972. Manzanera said in an interview in 2024 that the band received five percent of the profits, to be divided between six musicians.\nDuring the first half of 1972, bassist Graham Simpson became increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative, which led to his leaving the band almost immediately after the recording of the debut album. From this point on, the bassist position in Roxy Music would be unstable, with Peter Paul, Rik Kenton, John Porter, John Gustafson, Sal Maida, John Wetton and Rick Wills all passing in and out of the band over the next four years.\nTo bring more attention to their studio album, Roxy Music decided to record and release a single. Their debut single was \"Virginia Plain\", which scored No.\u00a04 on the UK singles chart. The band's eclectic visual image, captured in their debut performance on the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\", became a cornerstone for the glam trend in the UK. The success of the single caused a renewed interest in the album.\nRoxy Music's second album, \"For Your Pleasure\", was released in March 1973. It marked the beginning of the band's long, successful collaboration with producer Chris Thomas, who worked on all of the group's classic albums and singles in the 1970s. The album was promoted with the non-album single \"Pyjamarama\"; no album track was released as a single. At the time Ferry was dating French model Amanda Lear; she was photographed with a black jaguar for the front cover of the album, while Ferry appears on the back cover as a dapper chauffeur standing behind a limousine.\n\"Stranded\", \"Country Life\", \"Siren\", and solo projects (1973\u20131977).\nSoon after the tour to promote \"For Your Pleasure\" ended, Brian Eno left Roxy Music amidst increasing differences with Ferry. He was replaced by 18-year-old multi-instrumentalist Eddie Jobson, formerly of progressive rockers Curved Air, who played keyboards and electric violin. Although some fans lamented the loss of the experimental attitude and camp aesthetic that Eno had brought to the band, the classically trained Jobson was a more accomplished musician.\n\"Rolling Stone\" referred to the band's next two albums, \"Stranded\" (1973) and \"Country Life\" (1974), as marking \"the zenith of contemporary British art rock\". The songs on these albums also cemented Ferry's persona as the epitome of the suave, jaded Euro-sophisticate. Although this persona undoubtedly began as a deliberately ironic device, during the mid-1970s it seemed to merge with Ferry's real life, as the working-class miner's son from the north of England became an international rock star and an icon of male style.\nOn the first two Roxy Music albums, all songs were written solely by Bryan Ferry. Beginning with \"Stranded\", Mackay and Manzanera began to co-write some material. Gradually, their songwriting and musicianship became more integrated into the band's sound, although Ferry remained the dominant songwriter; throughout their career, all but one of Roxy Music's singles were written either wholly or jointly by Ferry (Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson did individually write a few of the band's B-sides). \"Stranded\" was released in November 1973, and produced the Top 10 single \"Street Life\".\nThe fourth album, \"Country Life\", was released in 1974, and was the first Roxy Music album to enter the US Top 40 of the \"Billboard\" 200, albeit at No.\u00a037. \"Country Life\" was met with widespread critical acclaim, with \"Rolling Stone\" referring to it \"as if Ferry ran a cabaret for psychotics, featuring chanteurs in a state of shock\". Roxy Music's fifth album \"Siren\" (1975) contained their only US Top 40 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, \"Love Is the Drug\", while Jobson received his only writing credit in Roxy Music on the song \"She Sells\", a co-write with Ferry. The album cover featured American model Jerry Hall, who became Ferry's girlfriend and eventual fianc\u00e9e, before leaving him for Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones in 1977.\nAfter the concert tours in support of \"Siren\" in 1976, Roxy Music disbanded. Their live album \"Viva!\" was released in August 1976. In 1976, Manzanera reunited with Eno on the critically acclaimed one-off \"801 Live\" album.\nFinal studio albums and hiatus (1978\u20131983).\nRoxy Music reunited during 1978 to record a new studio album, \"Manifesto\", but with a reshuffled line-up. Jobson was reportedly not contacted for the reunion; at the time, he was touring and recording with his own band, U.K.. The core band of Ferry, Mackay, Manzanera and Thompson were augmented by Paul Carrack on keyboards, with bass split between Alan Spenner and Gary Tibbs. Tibbs and keyboardist Dave Skinner played on the subsequent tour.\nThree singles were issued from \"Manifesto\", including the major UK hits \"Angel Eyes\" (UK No.\u00a04), and \"Dance Away\" (UK No.\u00a02). Both these tracks are significantly different from the album versions, as \"Dance Away\" was remixed for single release, and \"Angel Eyes\" was entirely re-recorded, with a disco, rather than rock, arrangement.\nAfter the tour and before the recording of the next album, \"Flesh + Blood\" (1980), Thompson broke his thumb in a motorcycle mishap and took a leave from the band. After Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera completed the album with several session drummers, Thompson rejoined them, briefly, in the spring of 1980, and made some television appearances as part of the album's early promotion. By the time the \"Flesh + Blood\" tour properly began, Thompson had left again due to musical differences with Ferry.\nAt this point, the band officially became a core trio of Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera, augmented by a variety of musicians over the next few years, including Alan Spenner, Gary Tibbs, Paul Carrack, drummer Andy Newmark and guitarist Neil Hubbard. \"Flesh + Blood\" became a huge commercial success in their homeland, as the album went to No.\u00a01 on the UK charts, and spun off three UK hits: \"Oh Yeah\" (UK No.\u00a05), \"Over You\" (UK No.\u00a05), and \"Same Old Scene\" (UK No.\u00a012).\nHowever, the band's new reliance on expert session musicians (a situation favoured by Ferry and grudgingly tolerated by Mackay and Manzenera), caused a distinct change in Roxy Music's musical style, becoming smoother and more slick than their earlier work. The change of direction received mixed critical reception, with \"Rolling Stone\" panning \"Manifesto\" (\"Roxy Music has not gone disco. Roxy Music has not particularly gone anywhere else either.\") as well as \"Flesh + Blood\" (\"such a shockingly bad Roxy Music record that it provokes a certain fascination\"), while others were more positive, including \"Melody Maker\", who said of \"Manifesto\", \"...reservations aside, this may be the first such return bout ever attempted with any degree of genuine success: a technical knockout against the odds.\"\nIn 1981, Roxy Music recorded the non-album single \"Jealous Guy\". A cover version of a song written and originally recorded by John Lennon, Roxy Music recorded \"Jealous Guy\" as a tribute to Lennon after his 1980 murder. The song topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in March 1981, becoming the band's only No.\u00a01 single.\nLater, with more sombre and carefully sculpted soundscapes, the band's eighth and final studio album, \"Avalon\" (1982), recorded at Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, was a major commercial success and restored the group's critical reputation. The album included the successful single \"More Than This\", as well as several other Roxy Music classics, such as \"Avalon\", \"The Main Thing\", \"The Space Between\", \"True to Life\", and \"To Turn You On\". Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera (augmented by several additional players) toured extensively from August 1982 to May 1983, with the \"Avalon\" tour being documented on the band's second live album \"The High Road\", released in March 1983. A home video, also titled \"The High Road\", captured an August 1982 show at Fr\u00e9jus where Roxy Music co-headlined with King Crimson (whose set from the same show was released on home video as \"The Noise\"). A further live album from this tour, \"Heart Still Beating\", was released in 1990.\n\"Avalon\" reached No.\u202f1 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Platinum in the United States and Canada. It was widely praised by critics for its atmospheric production and mature songwriting, often cited as the band's most refined work. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it among the \"100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s.\"\nAfter completion of the \"Avalon\" tour, Roxy Music dissolved. For the next eighteen years Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera all devoted themselves full-time to solo careers.\nReunions (2001\u20132011, 2019, 2022).\nFerry, Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson re-formed in 2001 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band, and toured extensively. A festival performance in Portugal and a short tour of the United States followed. Absent was Brian Eno, who criticised the motives of the band's reunion, saying, \"I just don't like the idea. It leaves a bad taste\". Later Eno remarked that his comment had been taken out of context. Manzanera and Thompson recorded and toured with Ferry on his eleventh solo studio album \"Frantic\" (2002). Eno also contributed to \"Frantic\" on the track \"I Thought\".\nDuring 2002, Image Entertainment, Inc., released the concert DVD \"Roxy Music Live at the Apollo\" featuring performances of 20 songs plus interviews and rehearsal footage.\nIn 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked the group No.\u00a098 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\nRoxy Music gave a live performance at the Isle of Wight Festival 2005 on 11 June 2005, their first UK concert since the 2001\u20132002 world tour. On 2 July 2005, the band played \"Jealous Guy\", \"Do the Strand\", and \"Love is the Drug\" at the Berlin contribution to Live 8; \"Do the Strand\" is available on the four-disc DVD collection, and \"Love Is the Drug\" can be found on the \"Live 8 Berlin\" DVD.\nIn March 2005, it was announced on Phil Manzanera's official site that the band, including Brian Eno, had decided to record an album of new material. The project would mark the first time Eno worked with Roxy Music since 1973's \"For Your Pleasure\". After a number of denials that he would be involved with any Roxy Music reunion, on 19 May 2006 Eno revealed that he had contributed two songs to the new album as well as playing keyboards on other tracks. He did, however, rule out touring with the band.\nDuring early 2006 a classic Roxy Music track, \"The Main Thing\", was remixed by Malcolm Green and used as the soundtrack to a pan-European television commercial for the Opel Vectra featuring celebrated football referee Pierluigi Collina. In July that year, the band toured Europe. They concentrated mostly on places they had never visited before, such as Serbia and North Macedonia. Drummer Andy Newmark, who had been one of the many additional musicians Roxy Music worked with during the 1979\u20131983 period, performed during the tour, as Thompson withdrew due to health issues, and Oliver Thompson (guitar) made his first appearance with the band.\nIn a March 2007 interview, Ferry confirmed that the next Roxy Music album was definitely being made, but would not be released for another \"year and a half\", as he had just released and toured behind his twelfth solo studio album, \"Dylanesque\", consisting of Bob Dylan covers. In October that year, Ferry said the album would include a collaboration with Scissor Sisters. In 2009, he announced that the material from these sessions would instead be released as a Ferry solo studio album, with Eno playing on \"a couple of tracks\". The album was released in 2010 as the Ferry solo studio album \"Olympia\". It featured contributions from Eno, Manzanera, and Mackay (amongst many other session players).\nOver the summer of 2010, Roxy Music headlined various festivals across the world, including Lovebox at London's Victoria Park, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, County Laois, Ireland, and Bestival on the Isle of Wight. Owing to illness, Thompson was replaced on three dates of the tour by Andy Newmark, but returned for the Bestival set.\nRoxy Music performed seven dates around the UK in January and February 2011, in a tour billed For Your Pleasure, to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary. They toured Australia and New Zealand between February and March for a further eight shows.\nIn 2012, Virgin Records released a box set entitled \"Roxy Music: The Complete Studio Recordings 1972\u20131982\", celebrating 40 years since the release of the band's debut in 1972.\nIn a \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" interview on 3 November 2014, Manzanera stated that Roxy Music had been inactive since 2011 and were unlikely to perform together again. Of a new studio album, he told \"Classic Rock\", \"We all listened to it and thought, 'We can't do this. It's not going to be any good. Let's just bin it.' And so it's just sitting there on our personal computers. Maybe one day it'll get finished. But there's no point in putting it out if it's not great.\"\nOn 29 March 2019, Roxy Music were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Ferry, Mackay, Manzanera and Eddie Jobson performing a six-song set at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\nRoxy Music reformed in 2022 for a 50th anniversary tour of the United Kingdom and the United States to be held that autumn. Most North American tour dates featured St. Vincent as a supporting act. Nil\u00fcfer Yanya was the UK starter act.\nStyle.\nRoxy Music have been associated with a range of genres including art rock, glam rock, pop rock, progressive rock, art pop, new wave, soft rock, synth-pop and sophisti-pop. The early style and presentation of Roxy Music was influenced by the art school backgrounds of its principal members. Ferry, Mackay and Eno all had studied at prominent UK art colleges during the mid-to-late 1960s, when these institutions were introducing courses that avoided traditional art teaching practice, with its emphasis on painting, and instead focused on more recent developments, most notably pop art, and explored new concepts such as cybernetics. As writer Michael Bracewell notes in his book \"Roxy: The Band that Invented an Era\", Roxy Music was created expressly by Ferry, Mackay and Eno as a means of combining their mutual interests in music, modern art and fashion.\nFerry studied at Newcastle University in the 1960s under renowned pop artist and educator Richard Hamilton, and many of Ferry's university friends, classmates and tutors\u2014e.g. Rita Donagh and Tim Head\u2014became well-known artists in their own right. Eno studied at Winchester School of Art and although his iconoclastic style became apparent early and caused some conflict with the college establishment, it also resulted in him meeting important artists and musicians including Cornelius Cardew and Gavin Bryars. His interest in electronic music also resulted in his first meetings with Andy Mackay, who was studying at University of Reading and who had likewise developed a strong interest in avant-garde and electronic music.\nThe three eventually joined forces in London during 1970\u201371 after meeting through mutual friends and decided to form a rock band.\nRoxy Music were initially influenced by other artists of the time including the Beatles, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Elton John, the Animals, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Jimi Hendrix, the Velvet Underground and the Who, as well as American rock and roll acts and genres such as Elvis Presley and Motown. Ferry stated that Roxy Music's unique sound came as a result of the diverse and eclectic musical backgrounds of the band's members; \"I had lots of musical influences, Phil Manzanera had this Latin heritage, being born in South America. Saxophone and oboe player Andy Mackay was classically trained. Eno with his deep interest in experimental music. They were specialists in their field. Paul Thompson brought a lot, with his very powerful, earthy drumming.\"\nRoxy Music were one of the first rock music groups to create and maintain a carefully crafted look and style, which included their stage presentation, music videos, album and single cover designs, and promotional materials such as posters, handbills, cards and badges. They were assisted in this by a group of friends and associates who helped to sculpt the classic Roxy Music 'look', notably fashion designer Antony Price, hair stylist Keith Mainwaring, photographer Karl Stoecker, the group's \"PR consultant\" Simon Puxley (a former university friend of Mackay) and Ferry's art school classmate Nicholas de Ville. Well-known critic Lester Bangs went so far as to say that Roxy Music represented \"the triumph of artifice\". Ferry later attributed the band's look to his interest in American music and popular culture icons including Marilyn Monroe, Motown and Stax Records artists. He also stated he wanted to create an alternative image to publicity shots of pop and rock groups at the time which would feature artists \"in a dreary street, looking rather sullen. Which was the norm.\"\nThe band's self-titled debut album, produced by King Crimson's Pete Sinfield, was the first in a series of albums with increasingly sophisticated covers, with art direction by Ferry in collaboration with his friend Nick De Ville. The album artwork imitated the visual style of classic \"girlie\" and fashion magazines, featuring high-fashion shots of scantily clad models Amanda Lear, Marilyn Cole and Jerry Hall, each of whom had romances with Ferry during the time of their contributions, as well as model Kari-Ann Moller who appears on the cover of the first Roxy Music studio album but who was not otherwise involved with anyone in the band, and who later married Mick Jagger's brother Chris. The title of the fourth Roxy Music studio album, \"Country Life\", was intended as a parody of the well-known British rural magazine \"Country Life\", and the visually punning front cover photo featured two models (two German fans, Constanze Karoli\u2014sister of Can's Michael Karoli\u2014and Eveline Grunwald) clad only in semi-transparent lingerie standing against an evergreen hedge. As a result, in many areas of the US the album was sold in an opaque plastic wrapper because retailers refused to display the cover. Later, an alternative cover, featuring just a picture of the forest, was used.\nLegacy and influence.\nIn 2005, Tim de Lisle of \"The Guardian\" argued that Roxy Music are the second most influential British band after the Beatles. He wrote, \"Somehow, in a landscape dominated by Led Zeppelin at one end and the Osmonds at the other, they managed to reach the Top 10 with a heady mixture of futurism, retro rock'n'roll, camp, funny noises, silly outfits, art techniques, film references and oboe solos. And although their popularity has ebbed and flowed, their influence has been strikingly consistent.\" In 2019, \"The Economist\" also described them as \"the best British art-rock band since the Beatles\", arguing that \"among English rock acts of that time, their spirit of adventure and their impact\" was \"surpassed only\" by David Bowie. Bowie himself cited Roxy Music as one of his favourite British groups and in a 1975 television interview described Bryan Ferry as \"spearheading some of the best music to come out of England.\"\nRoxy Music's sound and visual style have been described as a significant influence on later genres and subcultures such as electronic music, punk rock, disco, new wave and new romantic. They were a major influence on the next generation of bands such as Duran Duran, Simple Minds, The Human League and ABC, with members declaring their admiration of the band and its influence on their work. They were an influence on the early 1980s British new romantic-movement with bands such as Ultravox, Visage and Spandau Ballet, as well as new wave art rock-bands such as Magazine, Cabaret Voltaire, and the American bands Devo and Talking Heads.\nMadness are among the artists that have cited Roxy Music as an influence. They paid tribute to Bryan Ferry in the song \"4BF\" (the title is a reference to the song \"2HB\", itself a tribute to Humphrey Bogart from the first Roxy Music studio album). Other artists who have cited or been described as influenced by Roxy Music include Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Melvins, Wire, Parquet Courts, Crime, Nile Rodgers, Siouxsie and the Banshees, U2, the Smiths, Radiohead, Scissor Sisters, Imogen Heap, Goldfrapp, Pulp, Sex Pistols, Todd Terje and Franz Ferdinand.\nIn 1997, bassist John Taylor of Duran Duran produced the tribute album \"Dream Home Heartaches... Remaking/Remodeling Roxy Music\". The compilation features Taylor as well as Dave Gahan (Depeche Mode) and Low Pop Suicide, among others.\nSex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones named his first band \"the Strand\" after the Roxy Music song \"Do the Strand\". Jones has also described Roxy Music's style as a strong influence on the later punk craze of which he would go on to become a part, and cited their first album as one of his all-time favourites.\nThe electronic band Ladytron took their name from the title of a song from Roxy Music's first album.\nThe British band Bananarama took their name, in part, from the Roxy Music song \"Pyjamarama\".\nCultural legacy and fashion influence.\nRoxy Music\u2019s emphasis on style, glamour, and artifice played a key role in shaping the visual language of 1970s and 1980s pop culture. Frontman Bryan Ferry\u2019s suave image and the band\u2019s fashion-forward album covers, often featuring models in provocative poses, influenced both the glam rock and New Romantic movements. Fashion designer Antony Price, who worked closely with the band, helped define their iconic look. The band\u2019s art-directed aesthetic has been referenced by designers such as Hedi Slimane and Raf Simons, and was an early model of fashion-music collaboration later popularised by artists like Madonna and Lady Gaga.\nMembers.\nCurrent line-up\nFormer members\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has worked extensively as a session musician and collaborator, notably with David Bowie, Blondie, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Daryl Hall, the Roches, Talking Heads, and David Sylvian. He also composed the startup sound of Windows Vista, in collaboration with Tucker Martine and Steve Ball. His discography includes contributions to more than 700 official releases.\nHis compositions often feature unusual asymmetric rhythms, influenced by classical and folk traditions. His innovations include a tape delay system known as \"Frippertronics\" (superseded in the 1990s by a more sophisticated digital system called \"Soundscapes\") and New Standard Tuning.\nFripp is married to English singer and actress Toyah Willcox.\nEarly life.\nRobert Fripp was born in Wimborne Minster, a town in Dorset, England, the second child of a working-class family. His mother Edith (\"n\u00e9e\" Greene; 1914\u20131993) was from a Welsh mining family; Fripp considers himself to be half Welsh. Her earnings from working at the Bournemouth Records Office allowed his father, Arthur Henry Fripp (1910\u20131985) to start a business as an estate agent. In 1957, at age eleven, Fripp received a guitar for Christmas from his parents and recalled, \"Almost immediately I knew that this guitar was going to be my life\". He then took guitar lessons from Kathleen Gartell and Don Strike; Elvis Presley's guitarist Scotty Moore inspired Fripp to play rock and roll, moving on to traditional jazz at thirteen and modern jazz at fifteen. Fripp has cited jazz musicians Charlie Parker and Charles Mingus as musical influences during this time.\nIn 1961, the fifteen-year-old Fripp joined his first band, the Ravens, which also included Gordon Haskell on bass. After they split in the following year, Fripp concentrated on his O-level studies and joined his father's firm as a junior negotiator. At this point, he intended to study estate management and, eventually, take over his father's business. However, at seventeen, Fripp decided to become a professional musician. He became the guitarist in the jazz outfit The Douglas Ward Trio, playing in the Chewton Glen hotel in New Milton, followed by a stint in the rock and roll band The League of Gentlemen, which included two former Ravens members. For a time, he gave guitar lessons to a local Wimborne friend, Al Stewart, who went on to achieve fame as a singer-songwriter. Much later, when Fripp was asked if any of his guitar students had found success, he replied, \"Only one of them ever made it, and that was Al Stewart, and he did it by ignoring everything I ever tried to teach him.\u201d\nIn 1965, Fripp left the group to attend Bournemouth College, where he studied economics, economic history, and political history for his A-levels. In February 1965, Fripp went to see the Duke Ellington Orchestra, an experience which moved him deeply. He subsequently spent three further years playing light jazz in the Majestic Dance Orchestra at Bournemouth's Majestic Hotel (replacing Andy Summers, who had left for London with Zoot Money). During this time, Fripp met musicians that he would collaborate with in his career, including John Wetton, Richard Palmer-James, and Greg Lake. At age 21, going back home from college late at night, Fripp tuned on to Radio Luxembourg, where he heard the last moments of the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\". \"Galvanized\" by the experience, he went on to listen to the Beatles' 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's string quartets, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's \"New World Symphony\", Jimi Hendrix's \"Are You Experienced\" and John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. Many years later, Fripp would recall that \"although all the dialects are different, the voice was the same... I knew I couldn't say no\". As a band leader, Fripp pointed out that Miles Davis and Duke Ellington inspired him to seek \"constant change\".\nCareer.\n1967\u20131974: Giles, Giles and Fripp and King Crimson.\nIn 1967, Fripp responded to an advertisement placed by Bournemouth-born brothers Peter and Michael Giles, who wanted to work with a singing organist. Though Fripp was not what they sought, his audition with them was a success and the trio relocated to London and became Giles, Giles and Fripp. Their only studio album, \"The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp\", was released in 1968. Despite the recruitment of two further members \u2013 singer Judy Dyble (formerly with Fairport Convention and later of Trader Horne) and multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald \u2013 Fripp felt that he was outgrowing the eccentric pop approach favoured by Peter Giles, preferring the more ambitious compositions being written by McDonald, and the band broke up in 1968.\nAlmost immediately, Fripp, McDonald and Michael Giles formed the first lineup of King Crimson in mid-1968, recruiting Fripp's old Bournemouth College friend Greg Lake as lead singer and bassist and McDonald's writing partner Peter Sinfield as lyricist, light show designer and general creative consultant. King Crimson's debut album, \"In the Court of the Crimson King\", was released in late 1969 to great success: drawing on rock, jazz and European folk/classical music ideas, it is now regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of progressive rock. The band was tipped for stardom, but, due to growing musical differences between Fripp on one side and Giles and McDonald on the other, broke up after its first American tour in 1970. A despondent Fripp offered to leave if it would allow King Crimson to survive; however, Giles and McDonald had independently decided that the band's music was \"more Fripp's than theirs\" and that it would be better if they were the ones to leave.\nDuring the recording of the band's second album \"In the Wake of Poseidon\", Greg Lake departed to form Emerson, Lake and Palmer with Keith Emerson of the Nice and Carl Palmer of Atomic Rooster. King Crimson issued two more albums, \"Lizard\" and \"Islands,\" with Fripp and Sinfield the only constants in a regularly changing lineup variously including Gordon Haskell, woodwind player Mel Collins, drummers Andy McCulloch and Ian Wallace and future Bad Company bassist Boz Burrell, in addition to a palette of guest players. Fripp was listed as the sole composer of the band's music during this time, which built on the first album's blueprint but progressed further into jazz-rock and free jazz while also taking form from Sinfield's esoteric lyrical and mythological concepts.\nIn 1971, Fripp ousted Sinfield and took over \"de facto\" leadership of King Crimson (although he has always formally rejected the label, preferring to describe his role as \"quality control\" or \"a kind of glue\"). From this point onwards, Fripp would be the only constant member of the band, which in turn would be defined primarily by his compositional and conceptual ideas. With avant-garde percussionist Jamie Muir, violinist David Cross, former Family bassist and singer John Wetton and former Yes drummer Bill Bruford now in the ranks, King Crimson produced three more albums of innovative and increasingly experimental rock, shedding members as they progressed: beginning with \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\", progressing with \"Starless and Bible Black\" after Muir's departure and culminating in \"Red\" after Cross was fired. Fripp formally disbanded the group in 1974, in what eventually turned out to be merely the first in a regular series of long hiatuses and further transformations.\n1971\u20131985: Collaborations, side projects, and solo career.\nFripp pursued side projects during King Crimson's less active periods. He worked with Keith Tippett (and others who appeared on King Crimson records) on projects far from rock music, playing with and producing Centipede's \"Septober Energy\" in 1971 and \"Ovary Lodge\" in 1973. During this period he also worked with Van der Graaf Generator, playing on their albums \"H to He, Who Am the Only One\" and \"Pawn Hearts\". He produced Matching Mole's \"Matching Mole's Little Red Record\" in 1972. Prior to forming the \"Larks\"-era KC, he collaborated on a spoken-word album with a woman he described as \"a witch\", but the resulting \"Robert Fripp &amp; Walli Elmlark: The Cosmic Children of Rock\" was never officially released.\nWith Brian Eno, Fripp recorded \"(No Pussyfooting)\" in 1972, and \"Evening Star\" in 1974. These experimented with several avant-garde musical techniques that were new to rock. On \"The Heavenly Music Corporation\" from \"(No Pussyfooting)\", Fripp used a delay system using two modified Revox A77 reel-to-reel tape machines. The technique went on to play a central role in Fripp's later work, and became known as \"Frippertronics\".\nIn 1973, Fripp performed the guitar solo on \"Baby's on Fire\" from Eno's solo album \"Here Come the Warm Jets\". In 1975, Fripp and Eno played live shows in Europe, and Fripp also contributed guitar solos to Eno's 1975 album \"Another Green World\".\nFripp started what was intended as a permanent sabbatical from his musical career in 1975, during which he studied at J. G. Bennett's International Academy for Continuous Education, becoming interested in the mystical and philosophical ideas of Bennett's teacher George Gurdjieff. He returned to musical work the following year as a session guitarist on Peter Gabriel's debut solo album, released in 1977. Fripp toured with Gabriel to support the album, but used the pseudonym \"Dusty Rhodes\" and concealed himself on stage.\nFripp also produced and played on Gabriel's second album in 1978. \"Robert is particularly skilful at keeping things fresh, and I like that a lot,\" Gabriel enthused. \"I was very interested in Robert's experimental side; that corresponded exactly to what I wanted to do on this second record\u2026 There are two \"(Fripp)\" solos: one on 'On the Air' and the other on 'White Shadow'. And then he plays on 'Exposure'. He gives the colour to this piece, being fifty per cent responsible for its construction. And he also plays classical guitar here and there. He's a musician I admire a lot, because he's one of the only ones to mix discipline and madness with so much talent.\"\nIn 1977, Fripp played on David Bowie's album \"Heroes\" at Eno's invitation. Fripp soon collaborated with Daryl Hall on \"Sacred Songs\".\nDuring this period, Fripp began working on solo material, with contributions from poet/lyricist Joanna Walton and several other musicians, including Eno, Gabriel, and Hall (including the latter's partner, John Oates), as well as Peter Hammill, Jerry Marotta, Phil Collins, Tony Levin and Terre Roche. This material eventually became his first solo album, \"Exposure\", released in 1979, followed by the \"Frippertronics\" tour in the same year.\nWhile living in New York, Fripp contributed to albums and live performances by Blondie (\"Parallel Lines\") and Talking Heads (\"Fear of Music\"), and produced The Roches' first and third albums, which featured several of Fripp's characteristic guitar solos. A second set of sessions with Bowie produced \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\", and he collaborated with Gabriel again on his third solo album. With Blondie, Fripp appeared live on stage at the Hammersmith Odeon on 12 January 1980, participating in a cover version of Bowie's \"'Heroes'\".\nIn 1980, Fripp would release \"God Save the Queen/Under Heavy Manners,\" a project that saw two different musical approaches to Frippertronics on one LP. The \"A\" side of the record, titled \"God Save the Queen\" attempted what Fripp referred to as \"pure Frippertronics\" which is \"where Frippertronics is used alone.\" The \"B\" side of the record, titled \"Under Heavy Manners\" featured a collaboration with bassist Busta Jones, drummer Paul Duskin, and David Byrne of Talking Heads (as Absalm el Habib). The sounds of this side of the record featured what Fripp called \"Discotronics\" which was defined as \"that musical experience resulting at the interstice of Frippertronics and disco.\"\nConcurrent to this, Fripp would assemble what he called a \"second-division touring new wave instrumental dance band\" under the name League of Gentlemen, with bassist Sara Lee, keyboardist Barry Andrews and drummer Johnny Elichaoff (credited as \"Johnny Toobad\"). Elichaoff was later replaced by Kevin Wilkinson. The LOG toured for the duration of 1980.\nIn 1985 he produced the album \"Journey to Inaccessible Places\" by classical pianist Elan Sicroff, released on the Editions E.G. label.\n1981\u20131984: Reforming King Crimson.\n1981 saw the formation of a new King Crimson lineup, reuniting Fripp with Bruford and opening a new partnership with two American musicians: bassist/Chapman Stick player Tony Levin (who had played with Fripp on \"Exposure\" and in the first Peter Gabriel touring band) and Adrian Belew, a singer and guitarist who had previously played with Bowie, Talking Heads and Frank Zappa. Although the band had been conceptualised under the name Discipline, it came to Fripp's attention that the other members thought the name King Crimson was more appropriate: for Fripp, King Crimson had always been \"a way of doing things\" rather than a particular group of musicians. With the more pop-inspired Belew as main songwriter (complementing Fripp as main instrumental composer) the band took on a new style incorporating influences from Indonesian gamelan, new wave, and classical minimalism, with both guitarists experimenting extensively with guitar synthesizers. After releasing three albums (\"Discipline\", \"Beat\" and \"Three of a Perfect Pair\"), Fripp dissolved the band in 1984.\nDuring this period Fripp made two albums with Andy Summers of The Police. On \"I Advance Masked\", Fripp and Summers played all the instruments. \"Bewitched\" was dominated more by Summers, who produced the record and collaborated with other musicians in addition to Fripp.\nIn 1982 Fripp produced and played guitar on \"Keep On Doing\" by the Roches. \"Village Voice\" rock critic Robert Christgau wrote that the album \"sounds so good I'm beginning to believe Robert Fripp was put on earth to produce the Roches.\"\nGuitar Craft.\nFripp was offered a teaching position at the American Society for Continuous Education (ASCE) at Claymont Court in Charles Town, West Virginia, in 1984. He had been involved with the ASCE since 1978, eventually serving on its board of directors, and had long been considering the idea of teaching guitar through ideas derived from Bennett and Gurdjieff. His course, Guitar Craft, was begun in 1985, an offshoot of which was a performance group, \"the League of Crafty Guitarists\", which has released several albums. In 1986, he released the first of two collaborations with his wife, Toyah Willcox. The members of the California Guitar Trio are former members of The League of Crafty Guitarists and have also toured with King Crimson. Fripp is the patron of the Guitar Circle of Europe, which was founded in 2007, and of the Seattle Circle Guitar\u00a0School, which was founded in 2010.\nIn February 2009, Fripp recommended that Guitar Craft cease to exist on its 25th anniversary in 2010.\nOn 1 September 2022 Fripp published \"The Guitar Circle\", a book of writings concerning Guitar Craft.\nSoundscapes.\nFripp returned to recording solo in 1994, using an updated version of the Frippertronics technique that creates loops employing digital technology instead of analogue tapes. Fripp has released a number of records that he called \"soundscapes\", including \"1999\", \"Radiophonics\", \"A Blessing of Tears\", \"That Which Passes\", \"November Suite\", \"The Gates of Paradise\", \"Love Cannot Bear\" and \"At the End of Time\", as well as numerous download-only live recordings. (The sampler \"Pie Jesu\" consists of material compiled from \"A Blessing of Tears\" and \"The Gates of Paradise\".)\n1990s collaborations with David Sylvian and others.\nFripp's collaborations with David Sylvian feature some of his most exuberant guitar playing. Fripp contributed to Sylvian's twenty-minute track \"Steel Cathedrals\" from his \"\" album of 1985. Then Fripp performed on several tracks from Sylvian's 1986 release, \"Gone to Earth\".\nIn late 1991, Fripp had asked Sylvian to join a re-forming King Crimson as a vocalist. Sylvian declined the invitation, but proposed a possible collaboration between the two that would eventually become a tour of Japan and Italy in the spring of 1992.\nAlso in 1991, Fripp released an album with the project Sunday All Over The World, also featuring his wife Toyah Willcox, former League of Crafty Guitarists member Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick, and drummer Paul Beavis. The prior name of this band was Fripp Fripp, and they toured as such in 1988. They renamed to SAOTW, and toured again as SAOTW, in 1989.\nIn July 1993, Sylvian and Fripp released the collaborative effort \"The First Day\". Other contributors were soon-to-be King Crimson member Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick and Jerry Marotta (who, like Sylvian, almost became a member of King Crimson) on drums. When the group toured to promote the CD, future King Crimson member Pat Mastelotto took over the drumming spot. The live document \"Damage\" was released in 1994, as was the joint venture, \"Redemption \u2013 Approaching Silence\", which featured Sylvian's ambient sound sculptures (Approaching Silence) accompanying Fripp reading his own text (Redemption).\nDuring the early and mid-1990s Fripp contributed guitar/soundscapes to \"Lifeforms\" (1994) by the Future Sound of London and \"Cydonia\" (released 2001) by the Orb, as well as \"FFWD\", a collaborative effort with the latter's members. In addition, Fripp worked with Brian Eno co-writing and supplying guitar to two tracks for a CD-ROM project released in 1994 entitled \"Headcandy\" created by Chris Juul and Doug Jipson. Eno thought the visual aspects of the disc (video feedback effects) were very disappointing upon completion, and regretted participation. During this period, Fripp also contributed to albums by No-Man and the Beloved (1994's \"Flowermouth\" and 1996's \"X\", respectively). He also contributed soundscapes and guitar to two albums by the UK band Iona: 1993's \"Beyond These Shores\" and 1996's \"Journey into the Morn\".\n1994\u20132010: King Crimson redux.\nIn late 1994, Fripp re-formed King Crimson for its fifth incarnation, adding Trey Gunn and Pat Mastelotto to the 1980s quartet in a configuration known as a \"double trio\". This line-up released the \"VROOOM\" EP in 1994 and the \"THRAK\" album the following year.\nThough musically and relatively commercially successful, the double-trio King Crimson proved difficult to sustain in the long-term. From 1997 to 1999, the band \"fraKctalised\" into five experimental instrumental sub-groups known as ProjeKcts. By 1998 Bruford had quit the band altogether: in 2000, Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto reunited as a four-piece King Crimson. This lineup produced two industrial metal-influenced studio albums, \"the construKction of light\" in 2000 and \"The Power to Believe\" in 2003.\nGunn departed at the end of 2003. Although Levin immediately returned to replace him, another hiatus followed until King Crimson reappeared in 2007 with the addition of Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison. This version of the band toured the eastern United States in 2008, reassessing the 1981-2003 back catalogue and introducing lengthy duets between the two drummers. No new original material was recorded by this line-up, and in 2010, Fripp announced that King Crimson were on another indefinite hiatus.\nWork with G3, Porcupine Tree, Slow Music, Theo Travis, the Humans and others.\nIn 2004, Fripp toured with Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as part of their G3 series. He also worked at Microsoft's studios to record the startup sound for Windows Vista. Fripp designed the soundscape and composed the melody, while Tucker Martine created the rhythm and Microsoft's Steve Ball added the harmonies and created the final arrangement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nthis interesting factoid: in addition to 200 million Vista users with the 4 note splash, an extract from the Soundscapes' Vista sessions is estimated to strike up 91% of 32 trillion times on the new MS Mail programme this year. So, one of the planet's least popular music forms will also be the planet's most sounded in 2008. This has to be some kind of a record.\nFripp's online diary at dgmlive.com\nIn late 2005 and early 2006, Fripp joined R.E.M./Nine Inch Nails drummer Bill Rieflin's improvisational Slow Music project, along with R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Fred Chalenor, session drummer Matt Chamberlain and Hector Zazou on electronics. This collective of musicians toured the west coast of America in May 2006.\nIn 2006 Fripp contributed his composition \"At The End Of Time\" to the Artists for Charity album \"Guitarists 4 the Kids\", produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged children. Throughout 2006, Fripp performed many solo concerts of soundscapes in intimate settings in churches around England and Estonia. In October 2006, ProjeKct Six (Fripp and Adrian Belew) played at select venues on the east coast of the U.S., opening for Porcupine Tree. In the same year, Fripp contributed to two songs from Porcupine Tree's \"Fear of a Blank Planet\" (\"Way Out of Here\" and \"Nil Recurring\"). Fripp also sporadically performed as an opening act for Porcupine Tree on various tours from 2006 through 2009.\nIn 2008, Fripp collaborated with Theo Travis on an album of guitar and flute-or-saxophone duets called 'Thread', and the duo played a brief English tour in 2009 (repeating the collaboration with the \"Follow\" album in 2012). Also in 2009, Fripp played a concert with the band the Humans (which consists of his wife Toyah Willcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), appeared on Judy Dyble's \"Talking With Strangers\" (along with Pat Mastelotto and others) and played on two tracks on Jakko Jakszyk's album \"The Bruised Romantic Glee Club\". In 2010, Fripp contributed a guitar solo to an extended version of the song 'Heathen Child' by Grinderman, released as a B-side on the 'Super Heathen Child' single.\nIn 2021, the ambient/electronica album Leviathan was released. Fripp produced it and played guitar, in collaboration with British EDM Duo The Grid.\n\"A Scarcity of Miracles\", musical 'retirement' and new lineup of King Crimson.\nIn May 2011, Jakko Jakszyk, Robert Fripp and Mel Collins released \"A Scarcity of Miracles: A King Crimson ProjeKct\" on the Panegyric label. The album also featured contributions by Tony Levin and Gavin Harrison, leading to speculation that the project was a dry run for a new King Crimson lineup.\nIn an interview published 3 August 2012, Fripp stated that he had retired from working as a professional musician, citing long-standing differences with Universal Music Group and stating that working within the music industry had become \"a joyless exercise in futility\". This retirement proved to be short-lived, only lasting as long as it took to come to a settlement with UMG.\nIn his online diary entry for 6 September 2013, Fripp announced the return of King Crimson as a seven-piece unit with \"four Englishmen and three Americans\". The new lineup was Fripp, Levin, both Mastelotto and Harrison on drums, returning 1970s band member Mel Collins and two new members: Jakko Jakszyk as singer and second guitarist, and Bill Rieflin as a third drummer. This version of the band went on tour in 2014 and 2015 with a setlist reworking and reconfiguring the band's 1960s and 1970s material (plus songs from \"A Scarcity of Miracles\" and new compositions). In early 2016, it was announced that former Lemon Trees/Noel Gallagher drummer Jeremy Stacey would substitute for Rieflin on that year's tour while the latter was on sabbatical. King Crimson continued touring as a seven- or eight-piece unit with Stacey as a permanent member on drums and keyboards, plus Rieflin (when available) on keyboards and \"fairy dusting\" until 2021. Rieflin last played with Crimson in 2018; he died 24 March 2020.\nEquipment.\nDuring the early years of King Crimson (1968\u201374), Fripp used two Gibson Les Paul guitars from 1957 and 1959. The '57 guitar featured three humbucker pick-ups (with one volume control on the pickguard controlling the middle pick-up). In the band's 1980s era, he favoured Roland GR-303 &amp; GR-808 guitars for both straight guitar and synth control. In subsequent years, Fripp has used customized Les Paul-style guitars by Tokai, 48th St Custom, and Fernandes.\nA signature model named for the guitarist (Crimson Guitars Robert Fripp Signature) features Fernandes Sustainer and MIDI pickups with a Les Paul-style body. A significant difference from the Gibson Les Paul is that the signature model is built using a deep set neck tenon rather than a traditional set neck.\nFripp recommended that Guitar Craft students adopt the Ovation 1867 Legend steel-string acoustic guitar. \"Fripp liked the way the Ovation 1867 fitted against his body, which made it possible for him to assume the right-arm picking position he had developed using electric guitars over the years; on deeper-bodied guitars, the Frippian arm position is impossible without uncomfortable contortions\", according to Tamm. While the 1867 Legend is no longer manufactured, it influenced the design of the Guitar\u00a0Craft Pro\u00a0Model of Guitar\u00a0Craft Guitars, which has been endorsed by Fripp.\nGuitar technique.\nFripp began playing guitar at the age of eleven. When he started, he was tone deaf and had no rhythmic sense, weaknesses which led him later to comment that \"Music so wishes to be heard that it sometimes calls on unlikely characters to give it voice.\" He was also naturally left-handed but opted to play the guitar right-handed.\nWhile being taught guitar basics by his teacher Don Strike, Fripp began to develop the technique of crosspicking, which became one of his specialities. Fripp teaches crosspicking to his students in Guitar\u00a0Craft.\nIn 1985, Fripp began using a tuning he called \"New Standard Tuning\" (C2-G2-D3-A3-E4-G4), which would also become popularised in Guitar Craft.\nFripp's guitar technique, unlike most rock guitarists of his era, is not blues-based but rather influenced by avant-garde jazz and European classical music. He combines rapid alternate picking and crosspicking with motifs employing whole-tone or diminished pitch structures and extended sixteenth-note patterns in \"moto perpetuo\".\nRather than stand when performing, he seats himself on a stool (unusual for a performer in rock music), and by doing so was called in a May 1974 issue of \"Guitar Player\" \"the guitarist who sits on stage\".\nPersonal life.\nFripp married singer and actress Toyah Willcox on 16 May 1986 in Poole. From December 1987 until July 1999 they lived at and renovated Reddish House, the former home of Cecil Beaton, in the village of Broad Chalke in Wiltshire.\nFripp previously lived at Thornhill Cottage, Holt, Dorset (1971\u20131980) and Fernhill House, Witchampton (1980\u20131987). After Reddish House, the couple lived at Evershot Old Mansion (1999\u20132001). They then moved to their present home in Pershore, Worcestershire. The couple have no children and have arranged their will so as to leave their assets to the establishment of a musical educational trust for children.\nFripp is the patron of the Seattle Circle Guitar School in the United States and the Shallal Dance Theatre in Penzance. He also has had engagements as a motivational speaker, often at events with his sister Patricia, who is a keynote speaker and speech coach.\nFripp is a pescetarian. Nevill Drury details in \"Music for Inner Space: Techniques for Meditation &amp; Visualisation\" that Fripp was interested in the Hermetic Qabalah, Wicca, German Renaissance philosopher Paracelsus, and George Gurdjieff via J. G. Bennett.\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdowns, Fripp and Willcox uploaded many short, humorous videos to YouTube, usually covers of well-known songs, and mostly titled \"Toyah and Robert's Sunday Lunch\". According to rock and metal news website MetalSucks, their stories about these covers were extremely popular; their cover of Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\" was the site's sixth-most popular story that year. The duo toured the UK in 2023, performing the \"Sunday Lunch\" songs in concert.\nAlfie Fripp, the last of the \"39ers\", shot down by the Luftwaffe and then held in 12 different POW camps during World War II, was his uncle.\nAwards and honours.\nAsteroid 81947 Fripp, discovered by Marc Buie at Cerro Tololo in 2000, was named in his honour. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 May 2019 (M.P.C. 114955).\nFripp is ranked 62nd on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 2011 list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, having been ranked 42nd by David Fricke on its 2003 list. Tied with Andr\u00e9s Segovia, he is ranked 47th on Gibson's Top 50 guitarists of all time.\nDiscipline Global Mobile.\nIn 1992, Fripp and producer/online content developer David Singleton co-founded Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) as an independent music\u00a0label. DGM releases music by Fripp, KC, related acts, and other artists in CDs and in downloadable files. A 1998 \"Billboard\" profile stated that DGM had ten staff-members in Salisbury (England) and Los Angeles (USA). DGM has an aim \"to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed.\" DGM insists that its artists retain all copyrights; consequently, even DGM's \"knotwork\" corporate-logo \"(pictured above)\" is owned by its designer, Steve Ball; the \"knotwork\" logo appeared earlier on the cover of later versions of the \"Discipline\" album. DGM's aims were called \"exemplary\" by Bill , who wrote that \"Fripp has done something very important for the possibilities of experimental music\" in creating DGM, which \"has played a major role in creating favorable conditions for\" King Crimson.\nDGM publishes an on-line diary by Fripp, who often comments on performances and on relations with fans. A moderated forum allows fans to ask questions or to leave comments. Together, Fripp's diary and the fan\u00a0forum display delayed\u00a0dialogs in which Fripp and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings.\nCopyright infringement complaints.\nIn 2009, Fripp released a statement claiming that EMI and Sanctuary Universal had uploaded music to various music stores without his consent, stating \"NONE of these downloads were licensed, authorised or legitimised. that is, every single download of any KC track represents copyright violation. or, to use one syllable instead of seven, theft.\"\nIn 2011, Fripp complained that the streaming service Grooveshark continued to stream his music despite his having delivered repeated takedown notices. Fripp and Grooveshark's correspondence was published by \"Digital Music News\" and in his diaries, which appear on the website of Discipline Global Mobile.\nFripp's published exchange was included in a suit against Grooveshark by Universal Music Group, which was filed in November 2011. UMG cited internal documents revealing that Grooveshark employees uploaded thousands of illegal copies of UMG-owned recordings. Fripp had previous experience protecting his music in litigation with music companies.\nFripp has stated that he believes \"Unauthorised streaming or MP3 giveaways \u2013 it amounts to the same thing \u2013 copyright theft.\"\nDiscography.\nFripp has been extremely active as a recording musician and a producer. He has contributed to more than 700 official releases. The Robert Fripp Discography Summary, compiled by John Relph, also lists 120 compilations and 315 unauthorised releases (such as bootlegs). This means that more than 1100 releases (including both official and unofficial ones, as well as both studio and live recordings) can be found with Fripp participating. Studio releases are listed here.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nRobert Fripp's official website - https:// (2024)\nDiscipline Global Mobile (DGM) - https:// is a small, mobile, independent music company that aspires to Intelligence.

He is also an advocate for U.S. space superiority, writing that \"in the 21st century, victory on land, sea or in the air will go to the power that controls space\" and that \"if we desire peace on Earth, we need to prepare for war in space.\"\nHe and his colleague at Martin Marietta, David Baker, were the driving force behind Mars Direct, a proposal in a 1990 research paper intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission. The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey. A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their \"design reference mission\". He questions the delay and cost-to-benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Apollo program-like return to the Moon, as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen, water, or energy; these resources are producible on Mars, and he expects people would be there thereafter.\nDisappointed with the lack of interest from government in Mars exploration and after the success of his book \"The Case for Mars\" (1996), as well as leadership experience at the National Space Society, Zubrin established the Mars Society in 1998. This is an international organization advocating a human mission to Mars as a goal, by private funding if possible.\nEarly life.\nZubrin was born in Brooklyn, New York City on April 9, 1952. His father was descended from Russian Jewish immigrants.\nCareer.\nZubrin was awarded his first patent at age\u00a020 in 1972 for Three-player chess.\nZubrin holds a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Rochester (1974); he was a science teacher for 7\u00a0years before becoming an engineer. He earned a M.S. in Nuclear Engineering (1984), a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics (1986), and a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering (1992) \u2014 all from the University of Washington. He has developed a number of concepts for space propulsion and exploration, and is the author of over 200\u00a0technical and non-technical papers and several books. He is also President of both the Mars Society and Pioneer Astronautics, a private company that does research and development on innovative aerospace technologies. Zubrin is the co-inventor on a U.S. design patent and a U.S. utility patent on a hybrid rocket/airplane, and on a U.S. utility patent on an oxygen supply system (see links below).\nZubrin's inventions include the nuclear salt-water rocket and co-inventor (with Dana Andrews) of the magnetic sail. Zubrin is fellow at Center for Security Policy.\nDuring his professional career, Zubrin was a member of Lockheed Martin's scenario development team charged with developing strategies for space exploration. He was also \"a senior engineer with the Martin Marietta Astronautics company, working as one of its leaders in development of advanced concepts for interplanetary missions\". During his time at Martin Marietta, he drafted ideas for a potential single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft, and developed the Black Colt. However, he would eventually leave Martin Marietta to co-form Pioneer Rocketplane with Mitchell Burnside Clapp, an aerospace engineer from the US Air Force, due to a perceived lack of interest in reducing launch costs at larger aerospace firms. In his book, \"Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization\", Zubrin would write about how both large aerospace firms, and the US Government, would fail to reduce the costs of spaceflight.\nIn 1998, Zubrin founded the Mars Society, and in the following years, was able to attract large amounts of public interest to potential human colonisation on Mars. The work of the Mars Society was successful enough as to encourage the US Government to not cut funding for several Mars rover missions. \nPioneer Astronautics.\nIn 1996 Zubrin founded Pioneer Astronautics (formerly Pioneer Invention), a research and development company committed to developing innovative technologies to further space exploration and improve life on earth. The company relied primarily on small business research contracts and tackled a large variety of space-relevant problems.\nOn 13 July 2020 Voyager Space Holdings announced its acquisition of Pioneer Astronautics.\nPioneer Energy.\nIn 2008 Zubrin founded Pioneer Energy, a research and development firm headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado. The company's focus is to develop mobile Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) systems that can enable CO2-based EOR for both small and large oil producers in the United States. The company has also developed a number of new processes for manufacturing synthetic fuels.\nThe ethics of terraforming.\nZubrin is an advocate of a moderately anthropocentric position in the ethics of terraforming. Discussions of the ethics of terraforming often make reference to a series of public debates Zubrin has held with his friend Christopher McKay, who advocates a moderately biocentric position on the ethics of terraforming. For example, a written account of some of these debates is available in \"On to Mars: Colonizing a New World\", as a joint article, \"Do indigenous Martian bacteria have precedence over human exploration?\" (pp.\u00a0177\u2013182)\nCultural references.\nAn aged Robert Zubrin also appears as a background character in \"The Martian Race\" (1999) by Gregory Benford, a science fiction novel depicting early human explorers on Mars in the very near future. Benford, who is also an astrophysicist, is a longtime member of both the board of directors and the steering committee of the Mars Society.\nIn Martin Burckhardt's science fiction novel \"Score\", the Mars Expedition Astronauts send 90-year-old Robert Zubrin a video reply thanking him for his work over the years after receiving a congratulatory one from him for their successful landing on Mars.\nZubrin was featured in a 2007 CBC News documentary special, \"The Passionate Eye\", titled \"The Mars Underground\".\nThe songwriter and musician Frank Black (alias Black Francis of the Pixies) penned an homage to Zubrin, \"Robert Onion\", on the album \"Dog in the Sand\". The lyrics are in the form of an acrostic, spelling \"Robert The Case for Mars Zubrin\".\nIn 2010 Robert Zubrin was featured in the Symphony of Science video \"The Case for Mars\" along with Carl Sagan, Brian Cox, and Penelope Boston.\nThe fictional character Dr.\u00a0Zachary Walzer in the 2010\u20132011 independent VODO series \"Pioneer One\" was inspired by Zubrin.\nIn 2016, Zubrin was one of several scientists and engineers interviewed in the National Geographic miniseries \"Mars\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most modern roads are paved.\nThe words \"road\" and \"street\" are commonly considered to be interchangeable, but the distinction is important in urban design. Roads differ from streets, whose primary use is local access. They also differ from stroads, which combine the features of streets and roads.\nThere are many types of roads, including parkways, avenues, controlled-access highways (freeways, motorways, and expressways), tollways, highways, and local roads.\nThe primary features of roads include lanes, sidewalks (pavement), roadways (carriageways), medians, shoulders, verges, bike paths (cycle paths), and shared-use paths.\nDefinitions.\nHistorically, many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or some maintenance.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines a road as \"a line of communication (travelled way) using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips open to public traffic, primarily for the use of road motor vehicles running on their own wheels\", which includes \"bridges, tunnels, supporting structures, junctions, crossings, interchanges, and toll roads, but not cycle paths\".\nThe Eurostat, ITF and UNECE \"Glossary for Transport Statistics Illustrated\" defines a road as a \"Line of communication (traveled way) open to public traffic, primarily for the use of road motor vehicles, using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips. [...] Included are paved roads and other roads with a stabilized base, e.g. gravel roads. Roads also cover streets, bridges, tunnels, supporting structures, junctions, crossings and interchanges. Toll roads are also included. Excluded are dedicated cycle lanes.\"\nThe 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic defines a road as the entire surface of any way or street open to public traffic.\nIn urban areas roads may diverge through a city or village and be named as streets, serving a dual function as urban space easement and route. Modern roads are normally smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel.\nAustralia.\nPart 2, Division 1, clauses 11\u201313 of the National Transport Commission Regulations 2006 defines a road in Australia as 'an area that is open to or used by the public and is developed for, or has as one of its main uses, the driving or riding of motor vehicles.'\nFurther, it defines a shoulder (typical an area of the road outside the edge line, or the curb) and a road-related area which includes green areas separating roads, areas designated for cyclists and areas generally accessible to the public for driving, riding or parking vehicles.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, the definition of a road is broad in common law where the statutory definition includes areas the public has access to, by right or not. Beaches, publicly accessible car parks and yards (even if privately owned), river beds, road shoulders (verges), wharves and bridges are included. However, the definition of a road for insurance purposes may be restricted to reduce risk.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom \"The Highway Code\" details rules for \"road users\", but there is some ambiguity between the terms \"highway\" and \"road\". For the purposes of the English law, Highways Act 1980, which covers England and Wales but not Scotland or Northern Ireland, road is \"any length of highway or of any other road to which the public has access, and includes bridges over which a road passes\". This includes footpaths, bridleways and cycle tracks, and also road and driveways on private land and many car parks. Vehicle Excise Duty, a road use tax, is payable on some vehicles used on the public road.\nThe definition of a road depends on the definition of a highway; there is no formal definition for a highway in the relevant Act. A 1984 ruling said \"the land over which a public right of way exists is known as a highway; and although most highways have been made up into roads, and most easements of way exist over footpaths, the presence or absence of a made road has nothing to do with the distinction. Another legal view is that while a highway historically included footpaths, bridleways, driftways, etc., it can now be used to mean those ways that allow the movement of motor vehicles, and the term \"rights of way\" can be used to cover the wider usage.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, laws distinguish between \"public roads\", which are open to public use, and \"private roads\", which are privately controlled.\nHistory.\nThe assertion that the first pathways were the trails made by animals has not been universally accepted; in many cases animals do not follow constant paths. Some believe that some roads originated from following animal trails. The Icknield Way may exemplify this type of road origination, where human and animal both selected the same natural line. By about 10,000 BC human travelers used rough roads/pathways.\nIn transport engineering, subgrade is the native material underneath a constructed road.\nRoad construction requires the creation of an engineered continuous right-of-way or roadbed, overcoming geographic obstacles and having grades low enough to permit vehicle or foot travel, and may be required to meet standards set by law or official guidelines. The process is often begun with the removal of earth and rock by digging or blasting, construction of embankments, bridges and tunnels, and removal of vegetation (this may involve deforestation) and followed by the laying of pavement material. A variety of road building equipment is employed in road building.\nAfter design, approval, planning, legal, and environmental considerations have been addressed alignment of the road is set out by a surveyor. The radii and gradient are designed and staked out to best suit the natural ground levels and minimize the amount of cut and fill. Great care is taken to preserve reference benchmarks.\nRoads are designed and built for primary use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Storm drainage and environmental considerations are a major concern. Erosion and sediment controls are constructed to prevent detrimental effects. Drainage lines are laid with sealed joints in the road easement with runoff coefficients and characteristics adequate for the land zoning and storm water system. Drainage systems must be capable of carrying the ultimate design flow from the upstream catchment with approval for the outfall from the appropriate authority to a watercourse, creek, river or the sea for drainage discharge.\nA borrow pit (source for obtaining fill, gravel, and rock) and a water source should be located near or in reasonable distance to the road construction site. Approval from local authorities may be required to draw water or for working (crushing and screening) of materials for construction needs. The topsoil and vegetation is removed from the borrow pit and stockpiled for subsequent rehabilitation of the extraction area. Side slopes in the excavation area are not steeper than one vertical to two horizontal for safety reasons.\nOld road surfaces, fences, and buildings may need to be removed before construction can begin. Trees in the road construction area may be marked for retention. These protected trees should not have the topsoil within the area of the tree's drip line removed and the area should be kept clear of construction material and equipment. Compensation or replacement may be required if a protected tree is damaged. Much of the vegetation may be mulched and put aside for use during reinstatement. The topsoil is usually stripped and stockpiled nearby for rehabilitation of newly constructed embankments along the road. Stumps and roots are removed and holes filled as required before the earthwork begins. Final rehabilitation after road construction is completed will include seeding, planting, watering and other activities to reinstate the area to be consistent with the untouched surrounding areas.\nProcesses during earthwork include excavation, removal of material to spoil, filling, compacting, construction and trimming. If rock or other unsuitable material is discovered it is removed, moisture content is managed and replaced with standard fill compacted to meet the design requirements (generally 90\u201395% relative compaction). Blasting is not frequently used to excavate the roadbed as the intact rock structure forms an ideal road base. When a depression must be filled to come up to the road grade the native bed is compacted after the topsoil has been removed. The fill is made by the \"compacted layer method\" where a layer of fill is spread then compacted to specifications, under saturated conditions. The process is repeated until the desired grade is reached.\nGeneral fill material should be free of organics, meet minimum California bearing ratio (CBR) results and have a low plasticity index. The lower fill generally comprises sand or a sand-rich mixture with fine gravel, which acts as an inhibitor to the growth of plants or other vegetable matter. The compacted fill also serves as lower-stratum drainage. Select second fill (sieved) should be composed of gravel, decomposed rock or broken rock below a specified particle size and be free of large lumps of clay. Sand clay fill may also be used. The roadbed must be \"proof rolled\" after each layer of fill is compacted. If a roller passes over an area without creating visible deformation or spring the section is deemed to comply.\nGeosynthetics such as geotextiles, geogrids, and geocells are frequently used in the various pavement layers to improve road quality. These materials and methods are used in low-traffic private roadways as well as public roads and highways. Geosynthetics perform four main functions in roads: separation, reinforcement, filtration, and drainage; which increase the pavement performance, reduce construction costs and decrease maintenance.\nThe completed roadway is finished by paving or left with a gravel or other natural surface. The type of road surface is dependent on economic factors and expected usage. Safety improvements such as traffic signs, crash barriers, raised pavement markers and other forms of road surface marking are installed.\nAccording to a May 2009 report by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and TRIP \u2013 a national transportation research organization \u2013 driving on rough roads costs the average American motorist approximately $400 a year in extra vehicle operating costs. Drivers living in urban areas with populations more than 250,000 are paying upwards of $750 more annually because of accelerated vehicle deterioration, increased maintenance, additional fuel consumption, and tire wear caused by poor road conditions.\nWhen a single carriageway road is converted into dual carriageway by building a second separate carriageway alongside the first, it is usually referred to as \"duplication\", \"twinning\" or \"doubling\". The original carriageway is changed from two-way to become one-way, while the new carriageway is one-way in the opposite direction. In the same way as converting railway lines from single track to double track, the new carriageway is not always constructed directly alongside the existing carriageway.\nReallocation.\nRoads that are intended for use by a particular mode of transport can be reallocated for another mode of transport, i.e. by using traffic signs. For instance, in the ongoing road space reallocation effort, some roads (particularly in city centers) which are intended for use by cars are increasingly being repurposed for cycling and/or walking.\nMaintenance.\nLike all structures, roads deteriorate over time. Deterioration is primarily due to environmental effects such as frost heaves, thermal cracking and oxidation often contribute, however accumulated damage from vehicles also contributes. According to a series of experiments carried out in the late 1950s, called the AASHO Road Test, it was empirically determined that the effective damage done to the road is roughly proportional to the fourth power of axle weight. A typical tractor-trailer weighing 80,000 pounds (36.287 t) with 8,000 pounds (3.629 t) on the steer axle and 36,000 pounds (16.329 t) on both of the tandem axle groups is expected to do 7,800 times more damage than a passenger vehicle with 2,000 pounds (0.907 t) on each axle. Potholes on roads are caused by rain damage and vehicle braking or related construction work.\nPavements are designed for an expected service life or design life. In some parts of the United Kingdom the standard design life is 40 years for new bitumen and concrete pavement. Maintenance is considered in the whole life cost of the road with service at 10, 20 and 30-year milestones. Roads can be and are designed for a variety of lives (8-, 15-, 30-, and 60-year designs). When pavement lasts longer than its intended life, it may have been overbuilt, and the original costs may have been too high. When a pavement fails before its intended design life, the owner may have excessive repair and rehabilitation costs. Some asphalt pavements are designed as perpetual pavements with an expected structural life in excess of 50 years.\nMany asphalt pavements built over 35 years ago, despite not being specifically designed as a perpetual pavement, have remained in good condition long past their design life. Many concrete pavements built since the 1950s have significantly outlived their intended design lives. Some roads like Chicago's Wacker Drive, a major two-level (and at one point, three-level) roadway in the downtown area, are being rebuilt with a designed service life of 100 years.\nVirtually all roads require some form of maintenance before they come to the end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, asperity, roughness, rutting and texture. Software algorithms use this data to recommend maintenance or new construction.\nMaintenance treatments for asphalt concrete generally include thin asphalt overlays, crack sealing, surface rejuvenating, fog sealing, micro milling or diamond grinding and surface treatments. Waterblasting can also be part of the maintenance. It increases the friction of the surface through a slight removal of the top bitumen layer as well as brigheting the surface which leads to less wear through temperature in the bottom layers of the surface. \nThin surfacing preserves, protects and improves the functional condition of the road while reducing the need for routing maintenance, leading to extended service life without increasing structural capacity.\nOlder concrete pavements that develop faults can be repaired with a dowel bar retrofit, in which slots are cut in the pavement at each joint, and dowel bars are placed in the slots, which are then filled with concrete patching material. This can extend the life of the concrete pavement for 15 years.\nResponsibility for road maintenance lies with public authorities at various levels of government including state and local government in the United States, supported by the Federal Highway Administration, National Highways and local authorities in England, Transport Scotland in Scotland. Some roads are constructed and maintained by a private-sector consortium established under a public-private partnership such as those in England funded by the Private Finance Initiative.\nFailure to maintain roads properly can create significant costs to society. A 2009 report released by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimated that about 50% of the roads in the US are in bad condition, with urban areas worse. The report estimates that urban drivers pay an average of $746/year on vehicle repairs while the average US motorist pays about $335/year. In contrast, the average motorist pays about $171/year in road maintenance taxes (based on 600 gallons/year and $0.285/gallon tax).\nSlab stabilization.\nDistress and serviceability loss on concrete roads can be caused by loss of support due to voids beneath the concrete pavement slabs. The voids usually occur near cracks or joints due to surface water infiltration. The most common causes of voids are pumping, consolidation, subgrade failure and bridge approach failure. Slab stabilization is a non-destructive method of solving this problem and is usually employed with other concrete pavement restoration methods including patching and diamond grinding. The technique restores support to concrete slabs by filing small voids that develop underneath the concrete slab at joints, cracks or the pavement edge.\nThe process consists of pumping a cementitious grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base. The grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.\nSlab stabilization does not correct depressions, increase the design structural capacity, stop erosion or eliminate faulting. It does, however, restore the slab support, therefore, decreasing deflections under the load. Stabilization should only be performed at joints and cracks where the loss of support exists. Visual inspection is the simplest manner to find voids. Signs that repair is needed are transverse joint faulting, corner breaks and shoulder drop off and lines at or near joints and cracks. Deflection testing is another common procedure used to locate voids. It is recommended to do this testing at night as during cooler temperatures, joints open, aggregate interlock diminishes and load deflections are at their highest.\nTesting.\nGround penetrating radar pulses electromagnetic waves into the pavement and measures and graphically displays the reflected signal. This can reveal voids and other defects.\nThe epoxy/core test, detects voids by visual and mechanical methods. It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter hole through the pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part epoxy is poured into the hole \u2013 dyed for visual clarity. Once the epoxy hardens, technicians drill through the hole. If a void is present, the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence.\nCommon stabilization materials include pozzolan-cement grout and polyurethane. The requirements for slab stabilization are strength and the ability to flow into or expand to fill small voids. Colloidal mixing equipment is necessary to use the pozzolan-cement grouts. The contractor must place the grout using a positive-displacement injection pump or a non-pulsing progressive cavity pump. A drill is also necessary but it must produce a clean hole with no surface spalling or breakouts. The injection devices must include a grout packer capable of sealing the hole. The injection device must also have a return hose or a fast-control reverse switch, in case workers detect slab movement on the uplift gauge. The uplift beam helps to monitor the slab deflection and has to have sensitive dial gauges.\nJoint sealing.\nAlso called joint and crack repair, this method's purpose is to minimize infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in concrete pavement restoration techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.\nSafety considerations.\nCareful design and construction of roads can increase road traffic safety and reduce the harm (deaths, injuries, and property damage) on the highway system from traffic collisions.\nOn neighborhood roads traffic calming, safety barriers, pedestrian crossings and cycle lanes can help protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers.\nLane markers in some countries and states are marked with Cat's eyes or Botts dots. Botts dots are not used where it is icy in the winter, because frost and snowplows can break the glue that holds them to the road, although they can be embedded in short, shallow trenches carved in the roadway, as is done in the mountainous regions of California.\nFor major roads risk can be reduced by providing limited access from properties and local roads, grade separated junctions and median dividers between opposite-direction traffic to reduce the likelihood of head-on collisions.\nThe placement of energy attenuation devices (e.g. guardrails, wide grassy areas, sand barrels) is also common. Some road fixtures such as road signs and fire hydrants are designed to collapse on impact. Light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them. Highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road. During heavy rains, if the elevation of the road surface is not higher than the surrounding landscape, it may result in flooding.\nSpeed limits can improve road traffic safety and reduce the number of road traffic casualties from traffic collisions. In their \"World report on road traffic injury prevention\" report, the World Health Organization (WHO) identify speed control as one of various interventions likely to contribute to a reduction in road casualties.\nRoad conditions.\nRoad conditions are the collection of factors describing the ease of driving on a particular stretch of road, or on the roads of a particular locality, including the quality of the pavement surface, potholes, road markings, and weather. It has been reported that \"[p]roblems of transportation participants and road conditions are the main factors that lead to road traffic accidents\". It has further been specifically noted that \"weather conditions and road conditions are interlinked as weather conditions affect the road conditions\". Specific aspects of road conditions can be of particular importance for particular purposes. For example, for autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars, significant road conditions can include \"shadowing and lighting changes, road surface texture changes, and road markings consisting of circular reflectors, dashed lines, and solid lines\".\nVarious government agencies and private entities, including local news services, track and report on road conditions to the public so that drivers going through a particular area can be aware of hazards that may exist in that area. News agencies, in turn, rely on tips from area residents with respect to certain aspects of road conditions in their coverage area.\nEnvironmental performance.\nCareful design and construction of a road can reduce any negative environmental impacts.\nWater management systems can be used to reduce the effect of pollutants from roads. Rainwater and snowmelt running off of roads tends to pick up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, trash and other pollutants and result in water pollution. Road runoff is a major source of nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are created as combustion byproducts of gasoline and other fossil fuels.\nDe-icing chemicals and sand can run off into roadsides, contaminate groundwater and pollute surface waters; and road salts can be toxic to sensitive plants and animals. Sand applied to icy roads can be ground up by traffic into fine particulates and contribute to air pollution.\nRoads are a chief source of noise pollution. In the early 1970s, it was recognized that design of roads can be conducted to influence and minimize noise generation. Noise barriers can reduce noise pollution near built-up areas. Regulations can restrict the use of engine braking.\nMotor vehicle emissions contribute air pollution. Concentrations of air pollutants and adverse respiratory health effects are greater near the road than at some distance away from the road. Road dust kicked up by vehicles may trigger allergic reactions. In addition, on-road transportation greenhouse gas emissions are the largest single cause of climate change, scientists say.\nRegulation.\nRight- and left-hand traffic.\nTraffic flows on the right or on the left side of the road depending on the country. In countries where traffic flows on the right, traffic signs are mostly on the right side of the road, roundabouts and traffic circles go counter-clockwise/anti-clockwise, and pedestrians crossing a two-way road should watch out for traffic from the left first. In countries where traffic flows on the left, the reverse is true.\nAbout 33% of the world by population drive on the left, and 67% keep right. By road distances, about 28% drive on the left, and 72% on the right, even though originally most traffic drove on the left worldwide.\nEconomics.\nTransport economics is used to understand both the relationship between the transport system and the wider economy and the complex effects of the road network structure when there are multiple paths and competing modes for both personal and freight (road/rail/air/ferry) and where induced demand can result in increased on decreased transport levels when road provision is increased by building new roads or decreased (for example California State Route 480). Roads are generally built and maintained by the public sector using taxation although implementation may be through private contractors). or occasionally using road tolls.\nPublic-private partnerships are a way for communities to address the rising cost by injecting private funds into the infrastructure. There are four main ones:\nSociety depends heavily on efficient roads. In the European Union (EU) 44% of all goods are moved by trucks over roads and 85% of all people are transported by cars, buses or coaches on roads. The term was also commonly used to refer to roadsteads, waterways that lent themselves to use by shipping.\nConstruction costs.\nAccording to the New York State Thruway Authority, some sample per-mile costs to construct multi-lane roads in several US northeastern states were:\nStatistics.\nThe United States has the largest network of roads of any country with as of 2009. The Republic of India has the second-largest road system globally with of road (2013). The People's Republic of China is third with of road (2007). The Federative Republic of Brazil has the fourth-largest road system in the world with (2002). See List of countries by road network size. When looking only at expressways, the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) in China has a total length of at the end of 2006, and 60,300\u00a0km at the end of 2008, second only to the United States with in 2005. However, as of 2017, China has 130,000\u00a0km of Expressways.\nGlobal connectivity.\nEurasia, Africa, North America, South America, and Australia each have an extensive road network that connects most cities.\nThe North and South American road networks are separated by the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the only interruption in the Pan-American Highway. Eurasia and Africa are connected by roads on the Sinai Peninsula. The European Peninsula is connected to the Scandinavian Peninsula by the \u00d8resund Bridge, and both have many connections to the mainland of Eurasia, including the bridges over the Bosphorus. Antarctica has very few roads and no continent-bridging network, though there are a few ice roads between bases, such as the South Pole Traverse. Bahrain is the only island country to be connected to a continental network by road (the King Fahd Causeway to Saudi Arabia).\nEven well-connected road networks are controlled by many different legal jurisdictions, and laws such as which side of the road to drive on vary accordingly.\nMany populated domestic islands are connected to the mainland by bridges. A very long example is the Overseas Highway connecting many of the Florida Keys with the continental United States.\nEven on mainlands, some settlements have no roads connecting with the primary continental network, due to natural obstacles like mountains or wetlands, or high cost compared to the population served. Unpaved roads or lack of roads are more common in developing countries, and these can become impassible in wet conditions. As of 2014, only 43% of rural Africans have access to an all-season road. Due to steepness, mud, snow, or fords, roads can sometimes be passable only to four-wheel drive vehicles, those with snow chains or snow tires, or those capable of deep wading or amphibious operation.\nMost disconnected settlements have local road networks connecting ports, buildings, and other points of interest.\nWhere demand for travel by road vehicle to a disconnected island or mainland settlement is high, roll-on/roll-off ferries are commonly available if the journey is relatively short. For long-distance trips, passengers usually travel by air and rent a car upon arrival. If facilities are available, vehicles and cargo can also be shipped to many disconnected settlements by boat, or air transport at much greater expense. The island of Great Britain is connected to the European road network by Eurotunnel Shuttle \u2013 an example of a car shuttle train which is a service used in other parts of Europe to travel under mountains and over wetlands.\nIn polar areas, disconnected settlements are often more easily reached by snowmobile or dogsled in cold weather, which can produce sea ice that blocks ports, and bad weather that prevents flying. For example, resupply aircraft are only flown to Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station October to February, and many residents of coastal Alaska have bulk cargo shipped in only during the warmer months. Permanent darkness during the winter can also make long-distance travel more dangerous in polar areas. Continental road networks do reach into these areas, such as the Dalton Highway to the North Slope of Alaska, the R21 highway to Murmansk in Russia, and many roads in Scandinavia (though due to fjords water transport is sometimes faster). Large areas of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia are sparsely connected. For example, all 25 communities of Nunavut are disconnected from each other and the main North American road network.\nRoad transport of people and cargo by may also be obstructed by border controls and travel restrictions. For example, travel from other parts of Asia to South Korea would require passage through the hostile country of North Korea. Moving between most countries in Africa and Eurasia would require passing through Egypt and Israel, which is a politically sensitive area.\nSome places are intentionally car-free, and roads (if present) might be used by bicycles or pedestrians.\nRoads are under construction to many remote places, such as the villages of the Annapurna Circuit, and a road was completed in 2013 to M\u00eadog County. However, in some remote mountain areas, road (or transport) development can be devastating to communities, causing tourism to be cut off and settlements to be abandoned. Additional intercontinental and transoceanic fixed links have been proposed, including a Bering Strait crossing that would connect Eurasia-Africa and North America, a Malacca Strait Bridge to the largest island of Indonesia from Asia, and a Strait of Gibraltar crossing to connect Europe and Africa directly.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They provided efficient means for the overland movement of armies, officials, civilians, inland carriage of official communications, and trade goods. Roman roads were of several kinds, ranging from small local roads to broad, long-distance highways built to connect cities, major towns and military bases. These major roads were often stone-paved and metaled, cambered for drainage, and were flanked by footpaths, bridleways and drainage ditches. They were laid along accurately surveyed courses, and some were cut through hills or conducted over rivers and ravines on bridgework. Sections could be supported over marshy ground on rafted or piled foundations.\nAt the peak of Rome's development, no fewer than 29 great military highways radiated from the capital, and the empire's 113 provinces were interconnected by 372 great roads. The whole comprised more than of roads, of which over were stone-paved. In Gaul alone, no less than of roadways are said to have been improved, and in Britain at least . The courses (and sometimes the surfaces) of many Roman roads survived for millennia; some are overlaid by modern roads.\nRoman systems.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The extraordinary greatness of the Roman Empire manifests itself above all in three things: the aqueducts, the paved roads, and the construction of the drains.\"\n Dionysius of Halicarnassus, \"Ant. Rom. 3.67.5\"\nLivy mentions some of the most familiar roads near Rome, and the milestones on them, at times long before the first paved road\u2014the Appian Way. Unless these allusions are just simple anachronisms, the roads referred to were probably at the time little more than levelled earthen tracks. Thus, the Via Gabiana (during the time of Porsena) is mentioned in about 500 BC; the Via Latina (during the time of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus) in about 490 BC; the Via Nomentana (also known as \"Via Ficulensis\"), in 449 BC; the Via Labicana in 421 BC; and the Via Salaria in 361 BC.\nIn the Itinerary of Antoninus, the description of the road system is as follows:\nWith the exception of some outlying portions, such as Britain north of the Wall, Dacia, and certain provinces east of the Euphrates, the whole Empire was penetrated by these \"itinera\" (plural of \"iter\"). There is hardly a district to which we might expect a Roman official to be sent, on service either civil or military, where we do not find roads. They reach the Wall in Britain; run along the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates; and cover, as with a network, the interior provinces of the Empire.\nA road map of the empire reveals that it was generally laced with a dense network of prepared \"viae\". Beyond its borders there were no paved roads; however, it can be supposed that footpaths and dirt roads allowed some transport. There were, for instance, some pre-Roman ancient trackways in Britain, such as the Ridgeway and the Icknield Way.\nLaws and traditions.\n The Laws of the Twelve Tables, dated to about 450 BC, required that any public road (Latin \"via\") be 8\u00a0Roman feet (perhaps about 2.37 m) wide where straight and twice that width where curved. These were probably the minimum widths for a \"via\"; in the later republic, widths of around 12 Roman feet were common for public roads in rural regions, permitting the passing of two carts of standard (4 foot) width without interference to pedestrian traffic. Actual practices varied from this standard. The Tables command Romans to build public roads and give wayfarers the right to pass over private land where the road is in disrepair. Building roads that would not need frequent repair therefore became an ideological objective, as well as building them as straight as practicable to construct the shortest possible roads, and thus save on material.\nRoman law defined the right to use a road as a \"servitus\", or liability. The \"ius eundi\" (\"right of going\") established a claim to use an \"iter\", or footpath, across private land; the \"ius agendi\" (\"right of driving\"), an \"actus\", or carriage track. A \"via\" combined both types of \"servitutes\", provided it was of the proper width, which was determined by an \"arbiter\". The default width was the \"latitudo legitima\" of 8\u00a0feet. Roman law and tradition forbade the use of vehicles in urban areas, except in certain cases. Married women and government officials on business could ride. The \"Lex Julia Municipalis\" restricted commercial carts to night-time access in the city within the walls and within a mile outside the walls.\nTypes.\nRoman roads varied from simple corduroy roads to paved roads using deep roadbeds of tamped rubble as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry, as the water would flow out from between the stones and fragments of rubble instead of becoming mud in clay soils. According to Ulpian, there were three types of roads:\n\"Viae publicae, consulares, praetoriae\" and \"militares\".\nThe first type of road included public high or main roads, constructed and maintained at the public expense, and with their soil vested in the state. Such roads led either to the sea, to a town, to a public river (one with a constant flow), or to another public road. Siculus Flaccus, who lived under Trajan (98\u2013117), calls them \"viae publicae regalesque\", and describes their characteristics as follows:\nRoman roads were named after the censor who had ordered their construction or reconstruction. The same person often served afterwards as consul, but the road name is dated to his term as censor. If the road was older than the office of censor or was of unknown origin, it was named for its destination or the region through which it mainly passed. A road was renamed if the censor ordered major work on it, such as paving, repaving, or rerouting. With the term \"viae regales\" compare the roads of the Persian kings (who probably organized the first system of public roads) and the King's Highway. With the term \"viae militariae\" compare the Icknield Way (\"Icen-hilde-weg\", or \"War-way of the Iceni\").\nThere were many other people, besides special officials, who from time to time and for a variety of reasons sought to connect their names with a great public service like that of the roads. Gaius Gracchus, when Tribune of the People (123\u2013122 BC), paved or gravelled many of the public roads and provided them with milestones and mounting-blocks for riders. Gaius Scribonius Curio, when Tribune (50 BC), sought popularity by introducing a Lex Viaria, under which he was to be chief inspector or commissioner for five years. Dio Cassius mentions that the Second Triumvirate obliged the Senators to repair the public roads at their own expense.\n\"Viae privatae, rusticae, glareae\" and \"agrariae\".\nThe second category included private or country roads, originally constructed by private individuals, in whom their soil was vested and who had the power to dedicate them to the public use. Such roads benefited from a right of way in favor either of the public or of the owner of a particular estate. Under the heading of \"viae privatae\" were also included roads leading from the public or high roads to particular estates or settlements; Ulpian considers these to be public roads.\nFeatures off the \"via\" were connected to the \"via\" by \"viae rusticae\", or secondary roads. Both main or secondary roads might either be paved or left unpaved with a gravel surface, as they were in North Africa. These prepared but unpaved roads were \"viae glareae\" or \"sternendae\" (\"to be strewn\"). Beyond the secondary roads were the \"viae terrenae\", \"dirt roads\".\n\"Viae vicinales\".\nThe third category comprised roads at or in villages, districts, or crossroads, leading through or towards a \"vicus\" or village. Such roads ran either into a high road or into other \"viae vicinales\", without any direct communication with a high road. They were considered public or private, according to the fact of their original construction out of public or private funds or materials. Such a road, though privately constructed, became a public road when the memory of its private constructors had perished.\nSiculus Flaccus describes \"viae vicinales\" as roads \"de publicis quae divertunt in agros et saepe ad alteras publicas perveniunt\" (which turn off the public roads into fields, and often reach to other public roads). The repairing authorities, in this case, were the \"magistri pagorum\" or magistrates of the cantons. They could require the neighboring landowners either to furnish laborers for the general repair of the \"viae vicinales\", or to keep in repair, at their own expense, a certain length of road passing through their respective properties.\nGovernance and financing.\nWith the conquest of Italy, prepared \"viae\" were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building \"viae\" was a military responsibility and thus came under the jurisdiction of a consul. The process had a military name, \"viam munire\", as though the \"via\" were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called \"viae vicinales\". Roads were not free to use; tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. Freight costs were made heavier still by import and export taxes. These were only the charges for using the roads. Costs of services on the journey went up from there.\nFinancing road building was a Roman government responsibility. Maintenance, however, was generally left to the province. The officials tasked with fund-raising were the \"curatores viarum\". They had a number of methods available to them. Private citizens with an interest in the road could be asked to contribute to its repair. High officials might distribute largesse to be used for roads. Censors, who were in charge of public morals and public works, were expected to fund repairs \"su\u00e2 pecuni\u00e2\" (with their own money). Beyond those means, taxes were required.\nA \"via\" connected two cities. \"Viae\" were generally centrally placed in the countryside. The construction and care of the public roads, whether in Rome, in Italy, or in the provinces, was, at all periods of Roman history, considered to be a function of the greatest weight and importance. This is clearly shown by the fact that the censors, in some respects the most venerable of Roman magistrates, had the earliest paramount authority to construct and repair all roads and streets. Indeed, all the various functionaries, including emperors, who succeeded the censors in this portion of their duties, may be said to have exercised a devolved censorial jurisdiction.\nCosts and civic responsibilities.\nThe devolution to the censorial jurisdictions became a practical necessity, resulting from the growth of the Roman dominions and the diverse labors which detained the censors in the capital city. Certain \"ad hoc\" official bodies successively acted as constructing and repairing authorities. In Italy, the censorial responsibility passed to the commanders of the Roman armies and later to special commissioners, and in some cases perhaps to the local magistrates. In the provinces, the consul or praetor and his legates received authority to deal directly with the contractor.\nThe care of the streets and roads within the Roman territory was committed in the earliest times to the censors. They eventually made contracts for paving the street inside Rome, including the Clivus Capitolinus, with lava, and for laying down the roads outside the city with gravel. Sidewalks were also provided. The aediles, probably by virtue of their responsibility for the freedom of traffic and policing the streets, co-operated with the censors and the bodies that succeeded them.\nIt would seem that in the reign of Claudius the quaestors had become responsible for the paving of the streets of Rome or at least shared that responsibility with the \"quattuorviri viarum\". It has been suggested that the quaestors were obliged to buy their right to an official career by personal outlay on the streets. There was certainly no lack of precedents for this enforced liberality, and the change made by Claudius may have been a mere change in the nature of the expenditure imposed on the quaestors.\nOfficial bodies.\nThe official bodies which first succeeded the censors in the care of the streets and roads were:\nBoth these bodies were probably of ancient origin. The first mention of either body occurs in the \"Lex Julia Municipalis\" in 45 BC. The quattuorviri were afterwards called \"quattuorviri viarum curandarum\". The extent of jurisdiction of the duoviri is derived from their full title as \"duoviri viis extra propiusve urbem Romam passus mille purgandis\". Their authority extended over all roads between their respective gates of issue in the city wall and the first milestone beyond.\nIn case of an emergency in the condition of a particular road, men of influence and liberality were appointed, or voluntarily acted, as \"curatores\" or temporary commissioners to superintend the work of repair. The dignity attached to such a curatorship is attested by a passage of Cicero. Among those who performed this duty in connection with particular roads was Julius Caesar, who became \"curator\" (67 BC) of the Via Appia and spent his own money liberally upon it. Certain persons appear also to have acted alone and taken responsibility for certain roads.\nIn the country districts, the magistri pagorum had authority to maintain the \"viae vicinales\". In Rome each householder was legally responsible for the repairs to that portion of the street which passed his own house; it was the duty of the aediles to enforce this responsibility. The portion of any street which passed a temple or public building was repaired by the aediles at the public expense. When a street passed between a public building or temple and a private house, the public treasury and the private owner shared the expense equally. \nChanges under Augustus.\nThe governing structure was changed by Augustus, who in the course of his reconstitution of the urban administration, both abolished and created new offices in connection with the maintenance of public works, streets, and aqueducts in and around Rome. The task of maintaining the roads had previously been administered by two groups of minor magistrates, the \"quattuorviri\" (a board of four magistrates to oversee the roads inside the city) and the \"duoviri\" (a board of two to oversee the roads outside the city proper) who were both part of the \"collegia\" known as the \"vigintisexviri\" (literally meaning \"Twenty-Six Men\").\nAugustus, finding the \"collegia\" ineffective, especially the boards dealing with road maintenance, reduced the number of magistrates from 26 to 20. Augustus abolished the \"duoviri\" and later granted the position as superintendent (according to Dio Cassius) of the road system connecting Rome to the rest of Italy and provinces beyond. In this capacity he had effectively given himself and any following emperors a paramount authority which had originally belonged to the city censors. The \"quattuorviri\" board was kept as it was until at least the reign of Hadrian (117 to 138 AD). Furthermore, he appointed praetorians to the offices of \"road-maker\" and assigning each one with two lictors, making the office of curator of each of the great public roads a perpetual magistracy rather than a temporary commission.\nThe persons appointed under the new system were of senatorial or equestrian rank, depending on the relative importance of the roads assigned to them. It was the duty of each curator to issue contracts for the maintenance of his road and to see that the contractor who undertook said work performed it faithfully, as to both quantity and quality. Augustus also authorized the construction of sewers and removed obstructions to traffic, as the \"aediles\" did in Rome.\nIt was in the character of an imperial curator (though probably armed with extraordinary powers) that Corbulo denounced the \"magistratus\" and \"mancipes\" of the Italian roads to Tiberius. He pursued them and their families with fines and imprisonment and was later rewarded with a consulship by Caligula, who also shared the habit of condemning well-born citizens to work on the roads. Under the rule of Claudius, Corbulo was brought to justice and forced to repay the money which had been extorted from his victims.\nOther \"curatores\".\nSpecial \"curatores\" for a term seem to have been appointed on occasion, even after the institution of the permanent magistrates bearing that title. The emperors who succeeded Augustus exercised a vigilant control over the condition of the public highways. Their names occur frequently in the inscriptions to restorers of roads and bridges. Thus, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Trajan, and Septimius Severus were commemorated in this capacity at Em\u00e9rita. The Itinerary of Antoninus (which was probably a work of much earlier date and republished in an improved and enlarged form under one of the Antonine emperors) remains as standing evidence of the minute care which was bestowed on the service of the public roads.\nConstruction and engineering.\nAncient Rome boasted impressive technological feats, using many advances that were lost during the Middle Ages. Some of these accomplishments would not be rivaled in Europe until the Modern Age. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier designs. Some of the common, earlier designs incorporated arches.\nPractices and terminology.\nRoman road builders aimed at a regulation width (see Laws and traditions above), but actual widths have been measured at between and more than . Today, the concrete has worn from the spaces around the stones, giving the impression of a very bumpy road, but the original practice was to produce a surface that was no doubt much closer to being flat. Many roads were built to resist rain, freezing and flooding. They were constructed to need as little repair as possible. \nRoman construction took a directional straightness. Many long sections are ruler-straight, but it should not be thought that all of them were. Some links in the network were as long as . Gradients of 10%\u201312% are known in ordinary terrain, 15%\u201320% in mountainous country. The Roman emphasis on constructing straight roads often resulted in steep slopes relatively impractical for most commercial traffic; over the years the Romans realized this and built longer but more manageable alternatives to existing roads. Roman roads were generally built with the road cutting through the hill, rather than with a serpentine pattern of switchbacks curving around it.\nAs to the standard Imperial terminology that was used, the words were localized for different elements used in construction and varied from region to region. Also, in the course of time, the terms \"via munita\" and \"v\u00eda publica\" became identical.\nMaterials and methods.\n\"Viae\" were distinguished according to their public or private character, as well as according to the materials employed and the methods followed in their construction. Ulpian divided them up in the following fashion:\nAccording to Isidore of Sevilla, the Romans borrowed the knowledge of construction of \"viae munitae\" from the Carthaginians, though certainly inheriting some construction techniques from the Etruscans.\n\"Via terrena\".\nThe \"Viae terrenae\" were plain roads of leveled earth. These were mere tracks worn down by the feet of humans and animals, and possibly by wheeled carriages.\n\"Via glareata\".\nThe \"Viae glareatae\" were earthen roads with a gravel surface or a gravel subsurface and paving on top. Livy speaks of the censors of his time as being the first to contract for paving the streets of Rome with flint stones, for laying gravel on the roads outside the city, and for forming raised footpaths at the sides. In these roads, the surface was hardened with gravel, and although pavements were introduced shortly afterwards, the blocks were laid on a bed of small stones. Examples include the Via Praenestina and Via Latina.\n\"Via munita\".\nThe best sources of information as regards the construction of a regulation \"via munita\" are:\nAfter the civil engineer looked over the site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the \"agrimensores\" went to work surveying the road bed. They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a \"groma\", which helped them obtain right angles. The \"gromatici\", the Roman equivalent of rod men, placed rods and put down a line called the \"rigor\". As they did not possess anything like a transit, a surveyor tried to achieve straightness by looking along the rods and commanding the \"gromatici\" to move them as required. Using the \"gromae\" they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road. If the surveyor could not see his desired endpoint, a signal fire would often be lit at the endpoint in order to guide the surveyor. The \"libratores\" then began their work using ploughs and, sometimes with the help of legionaries, with spades excavated the road bed down to bedrock or at least to the firmest ground they could find. The excavation was called the \"fossa\", the Latin word for ditch. The depth varied according to terrain.\nThe method varied according to geographic locality, materials available, and terrain, but the plan or ideal at which the engineer aimed was always the same. The road was constructed by filling the \"fossa\". This was done by layering rock over other stones. Into the \"fossa\" was placed large amounts of rubble, gravel and stone, whatever fill was available. Sometimes a layer of sand was put down, if it was locally available. When the layers came to within 1 yd (1 m) or so of the surface, the subsurface was covered with gravel and tamped down, a process called \"pavire\", or \"pavimentare\". \nThe flat surface was then the \"pavimentum\". It could be used as the road, or additional layers could be constructed. A \"statumen\" or \"foundation\" of flat stones set in cement might support the additional layers. The final steps utilized lime-based mortar, which the Romans had discovered. They seem to have mixed the mortar and the stones in the ditch. First a small layer of coarse concrete, the \"rudus\", then a layer of fine concrete, the nucleus, went onto the pavement or \"statumen\". Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square paving stones, called the \"summa crusta\". The \"crusta\" was crowned for drainage.\nAn example is found in an early basalt road by the Temple of Saturn on the Clivus Capitolinus. It had travertine paving, polygonal basalt blocks, concrete bedding (substituted for the gravel), and a rain-water gutter.\nEngineering works.\nRomans preferred to engineer solutions to obstacles rather than circumvent them. Outcrops of stone, ravines, or hilly or mountainous terrain called for cuts and tunnels. An example of this is found on the Roman road from C\u0103z\u0103ne\u0219ti near the Iron Gates. This road was half carved into the rock, about 5ft to 5ft 9in (1.5 to 1.75m); the rest of the road, above the Danube, was made from wooden structure, projecting out of the cliff. The road functioned as a towpath, making the Danube navigable. Tabula Traiana memorial plaque in Serbia is all that remains of the now-submerged road.\nRoman bridges were some of the first large and lasting bridges created. River crossings were achieved by bridges, or \"pontes\". Single slabs went over rills. A bridge could be of wood, stone, or both. Wooden bridges were constructed on pilings sunk into the river, or on stone piers. Stone arch bridges were used on larger or more permanent crossings. Most bridges also used concrete, which the Romans were the first to use for bridges. Roman bridges were so well constructed that many remain in use today.\nCauseways were built over marshy ground. The road was first marked out with pilings. Between them were sunk large quantities of stone so as to raise the causeway to more than above the marsh. In the provinces, the Romans often did not bother with a stone causeway but used log roads (\"pontes longi\").\nMilitary and citizen utilization.\nThe public road system of the Romans was thoroughly military in its aims and spirit. It was designed to unite and consolidate the conquests of the Roman people, whether within or without the limits of Italy proper. A legion on the march brought its own baggage train (\"impedimenta\") and constructed its own camp (\"castra\") every evening at the side of the road.\nMilestones and markers.\nMilestones divided the Via Appia even before 250 BC into numbered miles, and most \"viae\" after 124 BC. The modern word \"mile\" derives from the Latin \"milia passuum\", \"one thousand paces\", each of which was five Roman feet, or in total . A milestone, or \"miliarium\", was a circular column on a solid rectangular base, set more than into the ground, standing tall, in diameter, and weighing more than 2 tons. At the base was inscribed the number of the mile relative to the road it was on. In a panel at eye height was the distance to the Roman Forum and various other information about the officials who made or repaired the road and when. These \"miliaria\" are valuable historical documents today, and their inscriptions are collected in Volume XVII of the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\". Milestones permitted distances and locations to be known and recorded exactly. It was not long before historians began to refer to the milestone at which an event occurred.The Romans had a preference for standardization wherever possible, so Augustus, after becoming permanent commissioner of roads in 20 BC, set up the \"miliarium aureum\" (\"golden milestone\") near the Temple of Saturn. All roads were considered to begin from this gilded bronze monument. On it were listed all the major cities in the empire and distances to them. Constantine called it the \"umbilicus Romae\" (\"navel of Rome\"), and built a similar\u2014although more complex\u2014monument in Constantinople, the Milion.\nItinerary maps and charts.\nCombined topographical and road-maps may have existed as specialty items in some Roman libraries, but they were expensive, hard to copy and not in general use. Travelers wishing to plan a journey could consult an \"itinerarium\", which in its most basic form was a simple list of cities and towns along a given road and the distances between them. It was only a short step from lists to a master list, or a schematic route-planner in which roads and their branches were represented more or less in parallel, as in the . From this master list, parts could be copied and sold on the streets. \nThe most thorough used different symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The Roman government from time to time would produce a master road itinerary. The first known were commissioned in 44 BC by Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Three Greek geographers, Zenodoxus, Theodotus and Polyclitus, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary; the task required over 25 years, and the resulting stone-engraved master itinerary was set up near the Pantheon. Travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies from it.\nVehicles and transportation.\nOutside the cities, Romans were avid riders and rode on or drove quite a number of vehicle types, some of which are mentioned here. Carts driven by oxen were used. Horse-drawn carts could travel up to per day, while pedestrians traveled per day. For purposes of description, Roman vehicles can be divided into the car, the coach, and the cart. Cars were used to transport one or two individuals, coaches were used to transport parties, and carts to transport cargo.\nOf the cars, the most popular was the \"carrus\", a standard chariot form descending to the Romans from a greater antiquity. The top was open, the front closed. One survives in the Vatican. It carried a driver and a passenger. A \"carrus\" with two horses was a \"biga\"; three horses, a \"triga\"; and four horses a \"quadriga\". The tires were of iron. When not in use, its wheels were removed for easier storage. A more luxurious version, the \"carpentum\", transported women and officials. It had an arched overhead covering of cloth and was drawn by mules. A lighter version, the \"cisium\", equivalent to a gig, was open above and in front and had a seat. Drawn by one or two mules or horses, it was used for cab work, the cab drivers being called \"cisiani\". The builder was a \"cisarius\".\nOf the coaches, the mainstay was the \"raeda\" or \"reda\", which had four wheels. The high sides formed a sort of box in which seats were placed, with a notch on each side for entry. It carried several people with baggage up to the legal limit of 1,000 Roman \"librae\" (pounds), modern equivalent . It was drawn by teams of oxen, horses or mules. A cloth top could be put on for weather, in which case it resembled a covered wagon. The \"raeda\" was probably the main vehicle for travel on the roads. \"Raedae meritoriae\" were hired coaches. The \"fiscalis raeda\" was a government coach. The driver and the builder were both referred to as a \"raedarius\".\nOf the carts, the main one was the \"plaustrum\" or \"plostrum\". This was simply a platform of boards attached to wheels and a cross-tree. The wheels, or \"tympana\", were solid and were several centimetres (inches) thick. The sides could be built up with boards or rails. A large wicker basket was sometimes placed on it. A two-wheel version existed along with the normal four-wheel type called the \"plaustrum maius\".\nThe military used a standard wagon. Their transportation service was the \"cursus clabularis\", after the standard wagon, called a \"carrus clabularius\", \"clabularis\", \"clavularis\", or \"clabulare\". It transported the \"impedimenta\" (baggage) of a military column.\nWay stations and traveler inns.\nFor non-military officials and people on official business who had no legion at their service, the government maintained way stations, or \"mansiones\" (\"staying places\"), for their use. Passports were required for identification. \"Mansiones\" were located about apart. There the official traveller found a complete \"villa\" dedicated to his use. Often a permanent military camp or a town grew up around the \"mansio\". For non-official travelers in need of refreshment, a private system of \"inns\" or \"cauponae\" were placed near the \"mansiones\". They performed the same functions but were somewhat disreputable, as they were frequented by thieves and prostitutes. Graffiti decorate the walls of the few whose ruins have been found.\nGenteel travelers needed something better than \"cauponae\". In the early days of the \"viae\", when little unofficial provision existed, houses placed near the road were required by law to offer hospitality on demand. Frequented houses no doubt became the first \"tabernae\", which were hostels, rather than the \"taverns\" we know today. As Rome grew, so did its \"tabernae\", becoming more luxurious and acquiring good or bad reputations as the case might be. An example is the \"Tabernae Caediciae\" at Sinuessa on the Via Appia. It had a large storage room containing barrels of wine, cheese and ham. Many cities of today grew up around a \"taberna\" complex, such as Rheinzabern in the Rhineland, and Saverne in Alsace.\nA third system of way stations serviced vehicles and animals: the \"mutationes\" (\"changing stations\"). They were located every . In these complexes, the driver could purchase the services of wheelwrights, cartwrights, and \"equarii medici\", or veterinarians. Using these stations as chariot relays, Tiberius hastened in 24 hours to join his brother, Drusus Germanicus, who was dying of gangrene as a result of a fall from a horse.\nPost offices and services.\nTwo postal services were available under the empire, one public and one private. The \"cursus publicus\", founded by Augustus, carried the mail of officials by relay throughout the Roman road system. The vehicle for carrying mail was a \"cisium\" with a box, but for special delivery a horse and rider was faster. On average a relay of horses could carry a letter in a day. The postman wore a characteristic leather hat, the \"petanus\". The postal service was a somewhat dangerous occupation, as postmen were a target for bandits and enemies of Rome. Private mail of the well-to-do was carried by \"tabellarii\", an organization of slaves available for a price.\nLocations.\nThere are many examples of roads that still follow the route of Roman roads.\nItaly.\nMajor roads\nOthers\nOther areas.\nAfrica\nAlbania / North Macedonia / Greece / Turkey\nAustria / Serbia / Bulgaria / Turkey\nBulgaria / Romania\nCyprus\nFrance\nIn France, a Roman road is called \"voie romaine\" in vernacular language.\nGermania Inferior (Germany, Belgium, Netherlands)\nMiddle East\nRomania\nSpain and Portugal\nSyria\nTrans-Alpine roads\nThese roads connected modern Italy and Germany:\nTrans-Pyrenean roads\nConnecting Hispania and Gallia:\nTurkey\nUnited Kingdom\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral information.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\nMaps.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRoad descriptions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRoman law regarding public and private domain.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRoad construction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25901", "revid": "1318225793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25901", "title": "Roberto Clemente", "text": "Puerto Rican baseball player (1934\u20131972)\nRoberto Enrique Clemente Walker (; August 18, 1934 \u2013 December 31, 1972) was a Puerto Rican professional baseball player who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, primarily as a right fielder. On December 31, 1972, Clemente was killed when his Douglas DC-7 airplane, which he had chartered for a flight to take and deliver emergency relief goods for the survivors of a massive earthquake in Nicaragua, crashed and plunged into the water off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico. He was 38 years old. After his untimely death, the National Baseball Hall of Fame changed its rules so that a player who had been dead for at least six months would be eligible for entry. In 1973, Clemente was posthumously inducted, becoming the first player from the Caribbean and second of Hispanic descent (after Lefty Gomez in 1972) to be honored in the Hall of Fame. He is widely referred to as \"The Great One.\"\nBorn in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Clemente was a track and field star and an Olympic hopeful in his youth before deciding to turn his full attention to baseball. His professional career began at the age of eighteen, with the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League. He quickly attracted the attention of the Brooklyn Dodgers who signed him to a bonus of $10,000. However, due to the bonus rule under which Clemente had signed and the Dodgers' decision to send him to the minor leagues, they lost Clemente to the Pittsburgh Pirates who drafted him after the 1954 season.\nClemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He was the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1966, the NL batting leader in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a Gold Glove Award winner for 12 consecutive seasons from 1961 through 1972. His batting average was over .300 for 13 seasons and he had 3,000 hits during his major league career. He also was a two-time World Series champion. Clemente was the first player from the Caribbean and Latin America to win a World Series as a starting position player (1960), to receive an NL MVP Award (1966), and to receive a World Series MVP Award (1971).\nDuring the offseason, in addition to playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, Clemente was involved in charity work in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In 1972, he died in a plane crash at the age of 38 while en route to deliver aid to victims of the Nicaragua earthquake. The following season, the Pittsburgh Pirates retired his uniform number 21. In his honor, Major League baseball renamed the Commissioner's Award, given to the player who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team\", to the Roberto Clemente Award.\nEarly life.\nClemente was born on August 18, 1934, in Barrio San Ant\u00f3n in Carolina, Puerto Rico, to Luisa Walker and Melchor Clemente. He was the youngest of seven siblings (three were from his mother's previous marriage). During Clemente's childhood, his father worked as a foreman for sugar cane crops located in the municipality in the northeastern part of the island. Because the family's resources were limited, Clemente and his brothers worked alongside his father in the fields, loading and unloading trucks.\nClemente had first shown interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios. When he was fourteen, he was recruited by Roberto Mar\u00edn to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after he was seen playing baseball in barrio San Ant\u00f3n. He was with the team two years as a shortstop.\nClemente's interest in baseball grew as he would watch games in Puerto Rico's winter baseball league as a kid. San Juan was a popular destination for barnstorming teams and players who wanted to continue playing in the winter months. Watching the games, Clemente was inspired by Monte Irvin, a right fielder for the Negro leagues' Newark Eagles. \nHe attended Julio Vizcarrondo High School in Carolina where he was a track and field star, participating in the high jump and javelin throw. Clemente was considered good enough to represent Puerto Rico at the Olympics. He later stated that throwing the javelin helped in strengthening his arm and with his footwork and release. Despite his all-around athletic skill, however, Clemente decided to focus on baseball and went on to join Puerto Rico's amateur league, playing for the Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of Juncos.\nProfessional career.\nPuerto Rican baseball (1952\u20131954).\nClemente's professional career began at age 18 when he accepted a contract from Pedr\u00edn Zorrilla with Cangrejeros de Santurce (\"Crabbers\"), a winter league team and franchise of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League (LBPPR). Clemente signed with the team on October 9, 1952. He was a bench player during his first season but was promoted to the Cangrejeros' starting lineup the following season. During this season he hit .288 as the team's leadoff hitter.\nWhile Clemente was playing in the Puerto Rican League, the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract of $15,000 \u2013 $10,000 bonus and $5000 league minimum salary. Clemente signed with them on February 19, 1954.\nMinor league baseball (1954).\nAt the time of Clemente's signing, the bonus rule implemented by Major League Baseball was still in effect. The rule stipulated that when a major league team signed a player to a contract with a signing bonus in excess of $4,000 ($ today), the team was required to keep that player on their 25-man active roster for two full seasons and failure to comply with the rule would result in the team losing the rights to that player's contract, and the player would then be exposed to the waiver wire.\nAs Clemente's bonus was larger than $4,000, he was considered a bonus baby. However, the Dodgers decided against benching him for two years in the majors and decided to place him with the Montreal Royals, their International League Triple-A affiliate. While it is often believed that the Dodgers instructed manager Max Macon to use Clemente sparingly to prevent him from being drafted under the Rule 5 Draft, Macon himself denied it. Box scores also suggest that Macon platooned Clemente the same as he did with other outfielders.\nAffected early on by both climate and language differences, Clemente received assistance from bilingual teammates such as infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black.\nBlack was the original target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' scouting trip to Richmond on June 1, 1954. Noticing Clemente in batting practice, Pirates scout Clyde Sukeforth made inquiries and soon learned about Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby. Twelve years later, manager Macon acknowledged that \"we tried to sneak him through the draft, but it didn't work\" but denied being instructed to not play Clemente, stating that the player needed time to develop and was struggling against Triple-A pitching. However, Pittsburgh noticed his raw talents; as Sukeforth recalled years later, \"I knew then he'd be our first draft choice. I told Montreal manager Max Macon to take good care of 'our boy' and see that he didn't get hurt.\"\nIn 87 games with the Royals, Clemente hit .257 with two home runs. The first home run of his North American baseball career came on July 25, 1954; Clemente's extra inning, walk-off home run was hit in his first at-bat after entering the game as a defensive replacement. His only other minor league home run came on September 5. On his 20th birthday, August 8, he made a notable game-ending outfield assist, cutting down the potential tying run at the plate.\nAt the end of the season, Clemente returned to play for Santurce where one of his teammates was Willie Mays. While with the team, the Pirates made Clemente the first selection of the Rule 5 draft that took place on November 22, 1954.\nMajor League Baseball (1955\u20131972).\nFor all but the first seven weeks of his major league career, Clemente wore number 21, so chosen because his full name of Roberto Clemente Walker had that many letters. For his first few weeks, Clemente wore the number 13, as his teammate Earl Smith was wearing number 21. It was later reassigned to Clemente.\nDuring the off-seasons (except the 1958\u201359, 1962\u201363, 1965\u201366, 1968\u201369, 1971\u201372, and 1972\u201373 seasons), Clemente played professionally for the Cangrejeros de Santurce, Criollos de Caguas, and Senadores de San Juan in the Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional de Puerto Rico, where he was considered a star. He sometimes managed the San Juan team.\nIn September 1958, Clemente joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He served his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island, South Carolina, Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. At Parris Island, Clemente received recruit training with Platoon 346 of the 3rd Recruit Battalion. The rigorous Marine Corps training programs helped Clemente physically; he added strength by gaining ten pounds and said his back troubles, caused by being in a 1954 auto accident, disappeared as a result of the training. He was a private first class in the Marine Corps Reserve until September 1964.\nClemente would face racism throughout his Major League career, particularly from journalists. Former Pirates teammate Bill Mazeroski wrote that some sports writers, \"tried to make him look like an ass by getting him to say controversial things and then they wrote how the Puerto Rican hot dog was popping off again.\" The language barrier between Clemente and the American journalists created a divide which led Clemente to be distrustful of the media. Mazeroski wrote that, \"writers who couldn't speak three words of Spanish tried to make him look silly, but he's an intelligent man who knows people and knows the game.\" Clemente's disagreements with the media were worsened by his open expression of anger at the continued discrimination in baseball. His outspoken nature earned him a reputation for being hot-tempered that followed him through his career. \nEarly years.\nThe Pirates struggled through several difficult seasons through the 1950s. They did have a winning season in 1958, their first since 1948.\nClemente debuted with the Pirates on April 17, 1955, wearing uniform number 13, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Early in his career with the Pirates, he was frustrated by racial and ethnic tensions, with sniping by the local media and some teammates. Clemente responded to this by saying \"I don't believe in color.\" He said that, during his upbringing, he was taught never to discriminate against someone based on ethnicity.\nClemente was at a double disadvantage, as he was a Latin American and Caribbean player whose first language was Spanish and was of African descent. Clemente's hometown newspaper, the \"San Juan Star\" wrote that, \"Clemente is a black Puerto Rican. That makes him doubly dubious. His native tongue is foreign to button-down America, and so is his color.\" The year before, the Pirates had hired Curt Roberts, their first African-American player. They were the fifth team in the NL and ninth in the major leagues to do so, seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line by joining the Dodgers. When Clemente arrived in Pittsburgh, Roberts befriended him and helped him adjust to life in the major league, as well as in the Pittsburgh area.\nDuring his rookie season, Clemente had to sit out several games, as he had suffered a lower back injury in Puerto Rico the previous winter. A speeding, drunk driver rammed into his car at an intersection. He finished his rookie season with a .255 batting average, despite trouble hitting certain types of pitches. His defensive skills were highlighted during this season.\nThe following season, on July 25, 1956, at Forbes Field, Clemente erased a three-run, ninth-inning deficit against the Chicago Cubs with a bases-clearing inside-the-park home run off pitcher Jim Brosnan, thus becoming the first\u2014and, as yet, only\u2014player in modern Major League history (since 1900) to hit a documented walk-off, inside-the-park grand slam. While rounding third, Clemente ran through a stop sign from Pirates manager Bobby Bragan, a decision which infuriated Brosnan. In the October 24, 1960, edition of \"Life\" magazine, Brosnan wrote that Clemente's heroics, \"excited the fans, startled the manager, shocked me and disgusted my club.\" After the game, Bragan announced that Clemente would not be fined the $25 that was the standard punishment for a player who missed a sign. Pittsburgh-based sportswriter John Steigerwald said that a walk-off, inside-the-park grand slam, \"\"may\" have been done only once in the history of baseball.\"\nClemente was still fulfilling his Marine Corps Reserve duty during spring of 1959 and set to be released from Camp Lejeune until April 4. A Pennsylvania state senator, John M. Walker, wrote to US Senator Hugh Scott requesting an early release on March 4 so Clemente could join the team for spring training.\nStardom.\nEarly in the 1960 season, Clemente led the league with a .353 batting average, and the 14 extra-base hits and 25 RBIs recorded in May alone resulted in Clemente's selection as the National League's Player of the Month. His batting average would remain above the .300 mark throughout the course of the campaign. On August 5 at Forbes Field, Clemente crashed into the right-field wall while making a pivotal play, depriving San Francisco's Willie Mays of a leadoff, extra-base hit in a game eventually won by Pittsburgh, 1\u20130. The resulting injury necessitated five stitches to the chin and a five-game layoff for Clemente, while the catch itself was described by Giants beat writer Bob Stevens as \"rank[ing] with the greatest of all time, as well as one of the most frightening to watch and painful to make.\" The Pirates compiled a 95\u201359 record during the regular season, winning the NL pennant, and defeated the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series. Clemente batted .310 in the series, hitting safely at least once in every game. His .314 batting average, 16 home runs, and defensive playing during the course of the season had earned him his first spot on the NL All-Star roster as a reserve player, and he replaced Hank Aaron in right field during the 7th and 8th innings in the second All-Star game held that season (two All-Star games were held each season from 1959 through 1962).\nDuring spring training in 1961, following advice from Pirates' batting coach George Sisler, Clemente tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat to slow the speed of his swing. During the 1961 season, Clemente was named the starting NL right fielder for the first of two All-Star games and went 2 for 4; he hit a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team's first run, then drove in the second with a sacrifice fly. With the AL ahead 4\u20133 in the 10th inning, he teamed with fellow future HOFers Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, and Frank Robinson to engineer a come-from-behind 5\u20134 NL victory, culminating in Clemente's walk-off single off knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm. Clemente started again in right field for the second All-Star game held that season and was 0 for 2, flying and grounding out in the 2nd and 4th innings. That season he received his first Gold Glove Award.\nFollowing the 1961 season, he traveled to Puerto Rico along with Orlando Cepeda, who was a native of Ponce. When both players arrived, they were received by 18,000 people. During this time, he was also involved in managing the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rican League, as well as playing with the team during the major league off-season. During the course of the winter league, Clemente injured his thigh while doing some work at home but wanted to participate in the league's all-star game. He pinch-hit in the game and got a single, but experienced a complication of his injury as a result, and had to undergo surgery shortly after being carried off the playing field. This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the 1965 season, during which he batted .257. Although he was inactive for many games, when he returned to the regular starting lineup, he got hits in 33 out of 34 games and his batting average climbed up to .340. He participated as a pinch hitter and replaced Willie Stargell playing left field during the All-Star Game on July 15.\nClemente was an All-Star every season he played in the 1960s other than 1968\u2014the only year in his career after 1959 in which he failed to hit above .300\u2014and a Gold Glove winner for each of his final 12 seasons, beginning in 1961. He won the NL batting title four times: 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and won the league's MVP Award in 1966, hitting .317 with a career-high 29 home runs and 119 RBIs. In 1967, Clemente registered a career-high .357 batting average, hit 23 home runs, and batted in 110 runs. Following that season, in an informal poll conducted by \"Sport Magazine\" at baseball's Winter Meetings, a plurality of major league GMs declared Clemente \"the best player in baseball today,\" edging out AL Triple Crown winner Carl Yastrzemski by a margin of 8 to 6, with one vote each going to Hank Aaron, Bob Gibson, Bill Freehan and Ron Santo. He had the most hits for all players in the 1960s with 1,877.\nIn an effort to make him seem more American, sportswriters started calling him \"Bob\" or \"Bobby\". His baseball cards even listed him as \"Bob Clemente\", a practice that persisted through to 1969. He disliked the practice, which he felt was disrespectful to his Puerto Rican and Latino heritage. Clemente would correct reporters who referred to him as \"Bob\" during post-game interviews, but the issue continued throughout the 1960s.\nFinal seasons.\nThe 1970 season was the last one that the Pirates played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium; for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was an emotional situation. The Pirates' final game at Forbes Field occurred on June 28, 1970. That day, Clemente said that it was hard to play in a different field, saying, \"I spent half my life there.\" The night of July 24, 1970, was declared \"Roberto Clemente Night\"; on this day, several Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium and cheered Clemente while wearing traditional Puerto Rican attire. A ceremony to honor Clemente took place, during which he received a scroll with 300,000 signatures compiled in Puerto Rico, and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity work following Clemente's request.\nDuring the 1970 season, Clemente compiled a .352 batting average; the Pirates won the NL East pennant but were subsequently eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds. During the offseason, Roberto Clemente experienced some tense situations while he was working as manager of the Senadores and when his father, Melchor Clemente, experienced medical problems and underwent surgery.\nIn the 1971 season, the Pirates won the NL East, defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games to win the NL pennant, and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. Baltimore had won 101 games (third season in row with 100+ wins) and swept the American League Championship Series, both for the third consecutive year, and were the defending World Series champions. The Orioles won the first two games in the series, but Pittsburgh won the championship in seven games. This marked the second occasion that Clemente helped win a World Series for the Pirates. Over the course of the series, Clemente had a .414 batting average (12 hits in 29 at-bats), performed well defensively, and hit a solo home run in the deciding 2\u20131 seventh game victory. Following the conclusion of the season, he received the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.\nAlthough he was frustrated and struggling with injuries, Clemente played in 102 games and hit .312 during the 1972 season. He also made the annual NL All-Star roster for the fifteenth (15th) time (he played in 14/15 All-Star games) and won his twelfth consecutive Gold Glove.\nOn September\u00a030, he hit a double in the fourth inning off Jon Matlack of the New York Mets at Three Rivers Stadium for his 3,000th. It was his last regular season at-bat of his career. By playing in right field in one more regular season game, on October 3, Clemente tied Honus Wagner's record for games played as a Pittsburgh Pirate, with 2,433 games played. In the NL playoffs that season, he batted .235 as he went 4 for 17. His last game was October 11, 1972, at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium in the fifth and final game of the 1972 NLCS, won by the Reds in the bottom of the 9th inning. Clemente had his final hit (single) in the 1st inning; his final plate appearance was an intentional walk in the 8th inning. He and Bill Mazeroski were the last Pirate players remaining from the 1960 World Series championship team.\nCharity work and death.\nClemente spent much of his time during the off-season involved in charity work. One of the projects he was most invested in was creating a sports center for disadvantaged youth in Puerto Rico. In 1967, Clemente told reporters, \"The biggest thing I want to do is for the youths... for the kids. When I am ready to quit baseball I will have my sports center... to me it will be the most important thing in the world.\" The center was so important to Clemente that shortly before recording his 3,000th hit, he told his manager Danny Murtaugh that the most important moment of his life would not be the hit, but the creation of the center. The project stalled after his death until his widow, Vera Clemente, attained corporate assistance for the center in the late 1980s. Now, many professional Puerto Rican players have trained at the center. \nClemente visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series. When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.\nThe airplane which he chartered for the New Year's Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by . It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.\nA search and rescue effort was immediately launched, led by the USCGC \"Sagebrush\". A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case which apparently belonged to Clemente was the only personal item of his which was recovered from the plane. Clemente's teammate and close friend Manny Sanguill\u00e9n was the only member of the Pirates who did not attend Roberto's memorial service. Instead, the Pirates catcher chose to dive into the waters where Clemente's plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane were never recovered.\nMontreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico, had helped him load the plane. Because Clemente wanted Walker, who was single, to go and enjoy New Year's Eve, Clemente told him not to join him on the flight. A few hours later, Walker returned to his condo and discovered that the plane carrying Clemente had crashed.\nImmediately following Clemente's death, a relief-aid organization for the victims of the Nicaraguan earthquake was created in his name. President Richard Nixon was one of the most prominent contributors to Roberto Clemente Memorial Fund. Shortly after the inception of the fund, donations grew to $350,000.\nIn an interview for the ESPN documentary series \"SportsCentury\" in 2002, Clemente's widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had told her several times that he thought he was going to die young. Indeed, while he was being asked when he would get his 3,000th career hit by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities, Clemente's response was \"Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, like I said before, you never know because God tells you how long you're going to be here. So you never know what can happen tomorrow.\"\nCareer overall.\nAt the time of his death, Clemente had established several records with the Pirates, including most triples in a single game (three) and hits in two consecutive games (ten). He won 12 Gold Glove Awards and shares the record of most won among outfielders with Willie Mays.\nClemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He won the NL MVP Award in 1966, and was named NL Player of the Month Award three times (May 1960, May 1967, July 1969). Clemente led the Pirates to two World Series titles, being named World Series MVP in 1971.\nClemente had two three-home run games in his career, as well as eight five-hit games in MLB.\nHonors and legacy.\nSince the high point of his playing career, Clemente has been widely referred to as \"The Great One\", a nickname coined by sportscaster Bob Prince.\nIn 1973, President Richard Nixon posthumously honored Clemente with the Presidential Citizens Medal. That same day, Congress honored Clemente with the Congressional Gold Medal. In 2003, President George W. Bush awarded Clemente the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \nClemente is an iconic sports figure in Puerto Rico, widely revered by his people. The Coliseo Roberto Clemente, opened in 1973 in San Juan, and Estadio Roberto Clemente, opened in 2000 in Carolina, are both named in his honor. In 2012, the Puerto Rico Professional Baseball League (LBPPR) was renamed Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente, the number 21 was also permanently retired. In 2022, the government of Puerto Rico granted Clemente the formal recognition of \"pr\u00f3cer\" (national hero). \nOn March 20, 1973, the Baseball Writers' Association of America held a special election for the Baseball Hall of Fame. They voted to waive the waiting period for Clemente, due to the circumstances of his death, and posthumously elected him for induction into the Hall of Fame, giving him 393 out of 424 available votes, for 92.7% of the votes. In 2003, he was inducted into the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame. He was named to Major League Baseball's Latino Legends Team in 2005. In 2007, Clemente was selected for the All Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team for the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Gold Glove Award. Clemente was elected to the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010, and the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015. \nClemente's number 21 was retired by the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 6, 1973, a few weeks after his election to the Hall of Fame. There have been calls for MLB to retire number 21 league-wide, as was done with Jackie Robinson's number 42 in 1997, but the sentiment has been opposed by the Robinson family. In 1973, Major League Baseball renamed the Commissioner's Award to the Roberto Clemente Award. It has been awarded every year to a player with outstanding baseball playing skills who is personally involved in community work. A trophy and a donation check for a charity of the player's choice are presented annually at the World Series. In 2002, 30 years after his death, Major League Baseball proclaimed September 15 as \"Roberto Clemente Day\".\nIn 1974, the Harlem River State Park in Morris Heights, The Bronx, New York City, was renamed Roberto Clemente State Park in his honor. In 2013, forty years after his election to the Hall of Fame, a statue was unveiled at the park. It was the first statue honoring a Puerto Rican to be unveiled in New York City. Near the old Forbes Field where Clemente began his major league career, the city of Pittsburgh renamed a street in his honor. Additionally, the city named Roberto Clemente Memorial Park in his honor. At Pirate City, the Pirates spring training home in Bradenton, Florida, a section of 27th Street East is named Roberto Clemente Memorial Highway. Over a dozen schools in the United States have been named after Clemente, including the Roberto Clemente Community Academy in Chicago, and the Roberto Clemente Charter School in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\nThe United States Postal Service issued a Roberto Clemente postal stamp on August 17, 1984. The stamp was designed by Juan Lopez-Bonilla and shows Clemente wearing a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cap with a Puerto Rican flag in the background. The Pirates originally erected a statue in memory of Clemente at Three Rivers Stadium, just before the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It has since been moved to PNC Park when it opened in 2001, and stands outside the park's centerfield gates.\nIn 1999, Clemente was ranked number 20 on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking Latin American and Caribbean player on the list. Later that year, he was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, \"The Athletic\" ranked Clemente at number 40 on its \"Baseball 100\" list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.\nPersonal life.\nClemente was married on November 14, 1964 to Vera Zabala at San Fernando Church in Carolina. The couple had three children: Roberto (often referred to as \"Roberto Jr.\"), born in 1965; Luis Roberto, born in 1966; and Roberto Enrique, born in 1969. Vera Clemente died on November 16, 2019, aged 78.\nClemente was a devout Catholic. In the 2010s, there was an initiative to have him canonized by the Catholic Church.\nClemente's older brother Justino visited the Baseball Hall of Fame, and provided insight to the language barrier and racism Roberto faced. Justino died in March, 2025 at the age of 97.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBook sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nArticles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Voters give each candidate a numerical score, and the candidate with the highest average score is elected. Score voting includes the well-known approval voting (used to calculate approval ratings), but also lets voters give partial (in-between) approval ratings to candidates.\nUsage.\nPolitical use.\nHistorical.\nA crude form of score voting was used in some elections in ancient Sparta, by measuring how loudly the crowd shouted for different candidates. This has a modern-day analog of using clapometers in some television shows and the judging processes of some athletic competitions.\nBeginning in the 13th century, the Republic of Venice elected the Doge of Venice using a multi-stage process with multiple rounds of score voting. This may have contributed to the Republic's longevity, being partly responsible for its status as the longest-lived democracy in world history. Score voting was used in Greek legislative elections beginning in 1864, during which time it had a many-party system; it was replaced with party-list proportional representation in 1923.\nAccording to Steven J. Brams, approval was used for some elections in 19th century England.\nCurrent.\nScore voting is used to elect candidates who represent parties in Latvia's Saeima (parliament) in an open list system.\nThe selection process for the Secretary-General of the United Nations uses a variant on a three-point scale (\"Encourage\", \"Discourage\", and \"No Opinion\"), with permanent members of the United Nations Security Council holding a veto over any candidate.\nProportional score voting was used in Swedish elections in the early 20th century, prior to being replaced by party-list proportional representation. It is still used for local elections.\nIn 2018, Fargo, North Dakota, passed a local ballot initiative adopting approval voting for the city's local elections, becoming the first US city to adopt the method.\nScore voting is used by the Green Party of Utah to elect officers, on a 0\u20139 scale.\nThe Pirate Party Germany uses variants of score voting such as Reweighted Range Voting (RRV) in some of its internal elections. The system has been used in the Bavarian branch for selecting candidates for the Bundestag list, and in the NRW branch for general decision-making and internal elections.\nNon-political use.\nMembers of Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee are elected based on a three-point scale (\"Support\", \"Neutral\", \"Oppose\").\nNon-governmental uses of score voting are common, such as in Likert scales for customer satisfaction surveys and mechanism involving users rating a product or service in terms of \"stars\" (such as rating movies on IMDb, products at Amazon, apps in the iOS or Google Play stores, etc.). Judged sports such as gymnastics generally rate competitors on a numeric scale.\nA multi-winner proportional variant called Thiele's method or reweighted range voting is used to select five nominees for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects rated on a 0\u201310 scale.\nExample.\nSuppose Tennessee is holding an election on the location of its capital. The population is split between four cities, and all the voters want the capital to be as close to them as possible. The options are:\nSuppose that 100 voters each decided to grant from 0 to 10 points to each city such that their most liked choice got 10 points, and least liked choice got 0 points, with the intermediate choices getting an amount proportional to their relative distance.\nNashville, the capital in real life, likewise wins in the example.\nFor comparison, note that traditional first-past-the-post would elect Memphis, even though most citizens consider it the worst choice, because 42% is larger than any other single city. Instant-runoff voting would elect the 2nd-worst choice (Knoxville), because the central candidates would be eliminated early (and Chattanooga voters preferring Knoxville above Nashville). In approval voting, with each voter selecting their top two cities, Nashville would win because of the significant boost from Memphis residents.\nProperties.\nScore voting allows voters to express preferences of varying strengths, making it a rated voting system.\nScore voting is not vulnerable to the less-is-more paradox, i.e. raising a candidate's rating can never hurt their chances of winning. Score also satisfies the participation criterion, i.e. a candidate can never lose as a result of voters turning out to support them. Score voting satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives, and does not tend to exhibit spoiler effects.\nIt does not satisfy the Condorcet criterion, i.e. the method does not always agree with the majority rule. However, when voters all vote strategically, basing their votes on polling or past election results, the majority-preferred candidate will win.\nStrategy.\nIdeal score voting strategy for well-informed voters is generally identical to their optimal approval voting strategy; voters will want to give their least and most favorite candidates a minimum and a maximum score, respectively. The game-theoretical analysis shows that this claim is not fully general, but holds in most cases. Another strategic voting tactic is given by the weighted mean utility theorem, maximum score for all candidates preferred compared to the expected winners weighted with winning probability and minimum score for all others.\nPapers have found that \"experimental results support the concept of bias toward unselfish outcomes in large elections.\" The authors observed what they termed ethical considerations dominating voter behavior as pivot probability decreased. This would imply that larger elections, or those perceived as having a wider margin of victory, would result in fewer tactical voters.\nHow voters precisely grade candidates is a topic that is not fully settled, although experiments show that their behavior depends on the grade scale, its length, and the possibility to give negative grades.\nSTAR voting (Score Then Automatic Runoff) is a variant proposed to address some concerns about strategic exaggeration in score voting. Under this system, each voter may assign a score (from 0 to the maximum) to any number of candidates. Of the two highest-scoring candidates, the winner is the one most voters ranked higher. The runoff step was introduced to mitigate the incentive to exaggerate ratings in ordinary score voting.\nAdvocacy.\nAlbert Heckscher was one of the earliest proponents, advocating for a form of score voting he called the \"immanent method\" in his 1892 dissertation, in which voters assign any number between -1 and +1 to each alternative, simulating their individual deliberation.\nCurrently, score voting is advocated by The Center for Election Science. Since 2014, the Equal Vote Coalition advocates a variant method (STAR) with an extra second evaluation step to address some of the criticisms of traditional score voting.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "25912", "revid": "1215005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25912", "title": "The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show", "text": "American animated comedy television series\nThe Ren &amp; Stimpy Show, commonly referred to as simply Ren &amp; Stimpy, is an American animated comedy television series created by John Kricfalusi for Nickelodeon. The series follows the misadventures of Ren H\u00f6ek, an emotionally unstable and psychotic chihuahua dog; and Stimpy, a good-natured and dimwitted Manx cat. Originally produced by Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8, the series aired on Nickelodeon from August 11, 1991 to December 16, 1995, with its last episode airing on MTV on October 20, 1996, spanning a total of five seasons and 52 episodes. The third to be aired of the original three Nickelodeon animated series known as \"Nicktoons\", alongside \"Doug\" and \"Rugrats\", it is one of the progenitor series of the brand.\nThe series received widespread critical acclaim for its visuals, animation, and surreal nature. However, it generated significant controversy for its dark humor, sexual innuendos, adult humor, violence, and shock value, contributing to Kricfalusi's termination in 1992, due to altercations with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices and production delays. Games Animation produced the show's remaining three seasons, which received criticism for a perceived decline in quality.\nAn adult animated reboot, \"Ren &amp; Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"\", was produced by Kricfalusi and Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 and aired on Spike TV in 2003, being canceled early due to production delays. On August 5, 2020, Comedy Central announced a second adult reboot of the series without Kricfalusi's involvement.\nPremise.\nThe series centers on Ren H\u00f6ek (voiced by John Kricfalusi in seasons 1\u20132; Billy West in seasons 2\u20135), a hot-tempered, psychotic, \"asthma-hound\" chihuahua, and Stimpson J. \"Stimpy\" Cat (also voiced by Billy West), a dimwitted and happy-go-lucky Manx cat. The duo fill various roles from episode to episode, including outer-space explorers, Old West horse thieves, and nature-show hosts, and are usually at odds with each other in these situations. While the show was sometimes set in the present day, the show's crew tended to avoid \"contemporary\" jokes about current events. The show extensively features off-color and absurdist humor, as well as slapstick akin to animated shorts of the 1950s.\nThe show features a host of supporting characters. Due to the nature of the show, they do not have consistent appearances or even designs; those who do appear repeatedly have different roles in each appearance, being either a part of the storyline or making cameo appearances with little bearing on the plot. Some, such as Mr. Horse, are exclusively cameo-based, spontaneously appearing as a running gag. George Liquor makes his first appearances in the show through cameos or as a supporting character, as demonstrated in \"Dog Show\" and \"Man's Best Friend\".\nDevelopment and history.\nConception.\nAccording to animator Bill Wray, John Kricfalusi created the characters Ren and Stimpy in 1978 for \"personal amusement\" while studying at Sheridan College. He was inspired to create Ren by an Elliott Erwitt photograph, printed on a postcard, called \"New York City, 1946\", showing a sweatered chihuahua at a woman's feet. Stimpy's design was inspired by a Tweety cartoon called \"A Gruesome Twosome\", where the cats in the animation had big noses.\nApproached by Nickelodeon for ideas for a show, Kricfalusi presented three. One was a variety show called \"Your Gang\" or \"Our Gang\" in which children presented cartoons, each parodying a different genre. Ren and Stimpy were pets of one of the presenters, and their cartoons would be in the style of \"Tom and Jerry\". Vanessa Coffey, vice president of animation production, was uninterested in the ideas, but liked Ren and Stimpy, singling them out for their own series.\nProduction of the pilot began in the summer of 1989, after \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\" was successfully pitched to Nickelodeon, and was conducted by Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8, Kricfalusi's Los Angeles-based animation company. A few months later, after the pilot had been screened at film festivals, it was announced that the show would be one of the channel's first Nicktoons.\nSp\u00fcmc\u00f8 (1991\u20131993).\nThe series premiered on August 11, 1991, alongside two other Nicktoons, \"Doug\" and \"Rugrats\". Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 continued to produce the show for the next two years while encountering issues with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department. The show was known for its lack of early merchandising; according to Wray, the initial lack of merchandise was \"the unique and radical thing\" about \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\", as no toy company planned for any merchandise for the show, and Nickelodeon did not want to use \"over-exploitive\" merchandising.\nKricfalusi described his early period with Nickelodeon as being \"simple\", as he got along with Coffey, the sole executive of the program. When another executive was added, they wanted to alter or discard some of the \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" episodes, but Kricfalusi says the episodes stayed intact since he did a \"trade\" with Coffey: he would have some \"really crazy\" episodes in exchange for some \"heart-warming\" episodes. Kricfalusi also said that the program was the \"safest project [he] ever worked on\" while explaining the meaning of \"safe\" as \"spend a third of what they spend now per picture, hire proven creative talent, and let them entertain.\" He estimated Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8's run of \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\" cost around $6 million to produce.\nThe relationship between Kricfalusi and Nickelodeon deteriorated to the point where Kricfalusi would communicate with Nickelodeon only through his lawyer. News outlets and several of the series' staff ascribe the tension to episodes not being delivered promptly. Author Andy Mangels, writing for \"Wizard\" magazine, commented that \"Kricfalusi's lax treatment of deadlines angered not only the networks, but his loyal viewers as well.\" However, some of the delays were attributed to Nickelodeon's prolonged approval process and withdrawal of approval from scenes and episodes that had been previously approved. Another point of contention was the direction of the series. Kricfalusi cites the episode \"Man's Best Friend\" as the primary reason for his dismissal; the character George Liquor is depicted in the episode as an abusive father figure, and Nickelodeon did not want the show to be so frightening and dramatic.\nGames Animation (1993\u20131996).\nNickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi's contract in late September 1992 and offered him the position of consultant for \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\", but he refused to \"sell out\". The network moved production from Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 to its newly founded animation studio, Games Animation, which later became Nickelodeon Animation Studio. Bob Camp replaced Kricfalusi as director, while West, having refused Kricfalusi's request to leave along with him, voiced Ren in addition to Stimpy.\nFans and critics felt this was a turning point in the show, with the new episodes being a considerable step down from the standard of those that preceded them. Ted Drozdowski, resident critic of \"The Boston Phoenix\", stated that \"the bloom faded\" on \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\". Animation historian Michael Barrier writes that while the creators of the Games episodes used crude jokes that were similar to those used by Kricfalusi, they did not \"find the material particularly funny; they were merely doing what was expected\".\nThe series ended its original run on Nickelodeon on December 16, 1995, with \"A Scooter for Yaksmas\", and had a total of five seasons and 51 episodes, although one episode from the final season, \"Sammy and Me/The Last Temptation\", remained unaired. Almost a year later, the episode aired on Nickelodeon's sister network, MTV, on October 20, 1996.\nProduction.\nProcess.\nThe animation production methods used in \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\" were similar to those found in Golden Age cartoons of the early 20th century, where a director supervised the entire process. These methods are in contrast with animation production methods in the 1980s, where there was one director for animation and a different director for voice actors, and the cartoons were created with a \"top-down\" approach to tie in with toy production.\nAnimator Vincent Waller compared working on \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" and \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" in an interview: \"Working on \"Ren and Stimpy\" and \"SpongeBob\" was very similar. They're both storyboard-driven shows, which means they give us an outline from a premise after the premise has been approved. We take the outline and expand on it, writing the dialogue and gags. That was very familiar.\"\nAnimation.\nThe show's aesthetics draw on Golden Age cartoons, particularly those of animator Bob Clampett from the 1940s in the way the characters' emotions powerfully distort their bodies. The show's style emphasizes unique expressions, intense and specific acting and strong character poses. One of the show's most notable visual trademarks is the detailed paintings of gruesome close-ups, along with the blotchy ink stains that on occasion replace the standard backgrounds, reminiscent of \"holes in reality or the vision of a person in a deep state of dementia\". This style was developed from Clampett's \"Baby Bottleneck\", which features several scenes with color-cards for backgrounds. The show incorporated norms from \"the old system in TV and radio\" where the animation would feature sponsored products to tie in with the cartoon, but in lieu of real advertisements, it featured fake commercial breaks advertising nonexistent products, most notably \"Log\".\nKricfalusi cited Carbunkle Cartoons, an animation studio headed by Bob Jaques and Kelly Armstrong, for their work on the show's best episodes, improving the acting with subtle nuances and wild animation that could not be done with overseas animation studios. KJ Dell'Antonia of \"Common Sense Media\" describes the show's style as changing \"from intentionally rough to much more polished and plushie-toy ready.\"\nVoice acting.\nKricfalusi originally voiced Ren, styled after a demented Peter Lorre from the film \"The Maltese Falcon\". When Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi's contract, Billy West, already the voice of Stimpy, took the role using a combination of Burl Ives, Kirk Douglas, and a slight \"south of the border accent\" for the rest of the Nickelodeon run. West voiced Stimpy for the Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 and Games Animation episodes, basing the voice on an \"amped-up\" Larry Fine. Some notable artists and performers who voiced incidental characters on the show were Frank Zappa (in his final public performance before his death), Jack Carter, Stan Freberg, Tommy Davidson, Randy Quaid, Gilbert Gottfried, Rosie O'Donnell, Dom DeLuise, Phil Hartman, Mark Hamill and Soleil Moon Frye.\nMusic.\n\"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\" features a wide variety of music, spanning rockabilly, folk, pop, jazz, classical music, jingles, and more. The opening theme, \"Dog Pound Hop\", was performed by a group of Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 employees under the name \"Die Screaming Leiderh\u00f4sens\"; they include developer Jim Smith, animator Chris Reccardi and production assistant Scott Huml. Three \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" albums have been released. In 1993 a compilation album, \"You Eediot!\", was released as a soundtrack album. The album's front cover is a parody of The Beatles' 11th studio album \"Abbey Road\".\nStimpy's rousing anthem titled \"Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy\" was composed by Chris Reccardi and written by Charlie Brissette and John Kricfalusi. A cover of this song, performed by Wax, is included on the 1995 tribute album \"\", produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records.\nControversy and censorship.\nThe program's staff did not want to create an \"educational\" series, a stance that bothered Nickelodeon, leading to the series being criticized by parent groups. Some segments of the show were altered to exclude references to religion, politics, alcohol, violence, and tobacco. The episode \"Powdered Toast Man\" had a cross removed from the Pope's hat and the credit was changed to \"the man with the pointy hat\". The same episode had a segment featuring the burning of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights that was removed, while in \"Dog Show\", the last name of the character George Liquor was removed, being changed to simply \"George, American\". Many other episodes included someone smoking a cigar, pipe, or a cigarette.\nSeveral episodes had violent, gruesome, or suggestive scenes shortened or removed, including a sequence involving a severed head, a close-up of Ren's face being grated against a man's stubble, and a scene that was shortened where Ren receives multiple punches to the stomach from a baby. In the second-season episode \"Sven H\u00f6ek\", during the scene where Ren fantasizes about Stimpy and his cousin Sven's deaths after they break all of his prized possessions, his line \"Then...I'm going to gouge your eyes out...yeah...\" was cut. One infamous episode, \"Man's Best Friend\", was banned by Nickelodeon for its violent content. Neither Nickelodeon nor MTV would air the episode. Years later on Spike TV, the show's revival, \"Ren &amp; Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"\", debuted with this banned episode as their unofficial pilot, receiving a TV-MA rating. Games Animation, however, was allowed to include more risqu\u00e9 content and occasional graphic violence.\nEpisodes.\nThe series ran for five seasons, spanning 52 episodes. The show was produced by Kricfalusi's animation studio Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 for the first two seasons. Beginning with season three (1993\u201394), the show was produced by Nickelodeon's Games Animation. The episode \"Man's Best Friend\" was produced for season two, but the episode was shelved and debuted with the show's 2003 reboot. Another episode, \"Sammy and Me / The Last Temptation\", aired on MTV on October 20, 1996, almost a year after the original Nickelodeon run ended.\nReception.\n\"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\" received widespread critical acclaim. Matt Groening, creator of \"The Simpsons\", praised the show for its outrageousness and called it \"the only good cartoon on TV\" other than \"The Simpsons\"; he was later critical of Kricfalusi's firing. Terry Thoren, former CEO and president of Klasky Csupo, said that Kricfalusi \"tapped into an audience that was a lot hipper than anybody thought. He went where no man wanted to go before \u2013 the caca, booger humor\". Jonathan Valania of \"The Morning Call\" called it \"high voltage yuks and industrial-strength weirdness\", John Lyttle of \"The Independent\" described it as \"a gooey media meltdown, absolutely grotesque and instantly recognisable\" and did not consider it a children's cartoon.\nAs of 2024, the first season of the show holds a rare 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews from critics, though the remaining seasons have not been rated.\nThe show came to garner high ratings for Nickelodeon, having double the viewership of the other Nickelodeon cartoons for its first season and later averaging three times their viewership. Due to the first season's high ratings, Nickelodeon renewed the series for twenty additional episodes in November 1991, alongside the second season of \"Rugrats\" and the second and third season of \"Doug\". The show for a time was the most popular cable TV show, with several airings being the most-watched scripted cable TV show in 1993 in the United States. The show quickly developed a cult following in college campuses, and was included in the launch of Nickelodeon's SNICK, a late-night block for shows that appeal to both children and adults.\nLegacy and influence.\nThe immediate influence of the show was the spawning of two \"clones\". Kricfalusi's previous employer Hanna-Barbera produced \"2 Stupid Dogs\", to which Kricfalusi contributed jokes. Walt Disney Television Animation produced \"The Shnookums &amp; Meat Funny Cartoon Show\" to mimic the show's success. The Disney series failed to gain any recognition and remained obscure. \nHowever, \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\" had a wider influence on the future of animation. Mike Judge credits the success of \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" reruns on MTV for the network's willingness to commission \"Beavis and Butt-Head\". Writer Larry Brody credits \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" for leading a new golden age of animation, as other networks followed Nickelodeon and invested in new cartoons, opening the way for more adult-oriented satirical shows like \"Beavis and Butt-Head\".\nDavid Feiss, an animation director on the first season of the show, went on to create Cartoon Network's \"Cow and Chicken\" and \"I Am Weasel\". John Kricfalusi became a teacher of sorts for Fred Seibert, and was the first person Seibert called while looking for new talent for the project \"What A Cartoon!\". Writer/animator Allan Neuwirth writes that \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" \"broke the mold\" and started several trends in TV animation, chiefly the revival of credits at the beginning of each episode, the use of grotesque close-ups, and a shift in cartoon color palettes to richer, more harmonious colors.\nA direct influence can be seen in the series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" with the physically extreme drawings that contrast with the characters' usual appearance, the \"grotesque close-ups\". Series veteran Vincent Waller currently serves as a showrunner on \"SpongeBob\".\nThe characters became a cultural touchstone in the mid-1990s, and were featured in works such as the films \"Clueless\" (1995), \"The Cable Guy\", and \"Jack\" (both 1996). \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" placed 31st in TV Guide's list of \"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\" in 2002. The cover story of the October 2001 issue of \"Wizard\", a magazine for comic book fans, listed the 100 Greatest Toons ever as selected by their readers, with \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" ranked at number 12. Other entertainment journals similarly hold \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" as one of the best cartoons of the '90s and cartoons for adults.\nRevivals.\nSpike TV spinoff.\nIn 2003, a reboot of the series helmed by John Kricfalusi, titled \"Ren &amp; Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"\", was launched on a late night programming block on Spike TV and was rated TV-MA. The new series is more adult-oriented than the original, and features an explicitly homosexual relationship between the main characters, strong profanity, graphic violence and nudity.\nBilly West declined to participate in \"Adult Party Cartoon\", feeling it would affect his career. Eric Bauza subsequently replaced West as the voice of Stimpy in the series, while Kricfalusi reprised his roles as both Ren and Mr. Horse. The series premiered with the banned Nickelodeon episode \"Man's Best Friend\", before debuting new episodes thereafter. Much like the original series, Kricfalusi showed apparent disregard for meeting production deadlines, with only three out of the ordered nine episodes being completed on time. After the first three episodes aired, Spike's entire animation block was removed from its programming schedule. However, three more episodes, already in production and completed by the time \"Adult Party Cartoon\" was canceled, were subsequently released three years later in 2006 on the \"Ren &amp; Stimpy: The Lost Episodes\" DVD.\nCanceled Nickelodeon-related projects.\nIn February 2016, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that characters from \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" were scheduled to appear in a scrapped \"Nicktoons\" feature-length film. Three months later, \"Variety\" reported that Nickelodeon was in negotiations with Kricfalusi about another revival of the characters. Bob Camp and William Wray revealed in an April 2016 panel discussion that Kricfalusi was developing a new \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" short that would be shown in theaters with the , but stated that they were \"not invited to that party\" and would not be involved with the short's production. However, Kricfalusi later denied making such a cartoon on Twitter. Despite this, an animatic of the short that was originally made as a promotion for \"\" before being cancelled was released as a bonus feature on the \"Cans Without Labels\" DVD in May 2019.\nComedy Central reboot.\nOn August 5, 2020, it was announced that a new \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" reboot has been greenlit by Comedy Central, along with \"Daria\" and \"Beavis and Butt-Head\". Though a new creative staff has been employed, Billy West was expected to return along with a few of the original series' writers. Due to the sexual abuse allegations surrounding him, it has been confirmed that Kricfalusi will not be involved in the production of the new reboot, nor will he receive any compensation from it. Originally set to be produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio, production on the reboot has been moved to Awesome Inc in October 2021, while Snipple Animation announced their involvement in September 2022. According to West, development was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, contrary to earlier rumors that the project had been canceled. Paramount Global (at the time operating as ViacomCBS), the parent company of Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, has not responded to requests for a comment about the status of the show, though West reiterated that it was still in production. On September 14, 2021, West confirmed that he was reprising his roles as Ren and Stimpy.\nOther returning crew members from the original series include Bob Jaques, Chris Sauv\u00e9 and former Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 alumni Robyn Byrd, who previously advocated to get the reboot canceled.\nHome media.\nVHS, LaserDisc and UMD.\nSony Wonder initially distributed collections of episodes of \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\" on VHS, which were not grouped by air dates or season. For instance, \"The Classics Volume 1\" VHS was released in 1993 and included three episodes from Season 1 (\"Space Madness\", \"Untamed World\" and \"Stimpy's Invention\"), as well as the short segment \"Breakfast Tips\" and a \"Log\" commercial. Other Nickelodeon compilation tapes, including two themed after the \"SNICK\" programming block, were also released containing individual \"Ren and Stimpy\" cartoons.\nPerhaps because of the show's adult following, it was also granted a LaserDisc set (the only ever LaserDisc release from Sony Wonder, and one of the only few LaserDiscs of a Nickelodeon original series), \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show -- The Essential Collection: Classics I &amp; II\", was released in 1995. This included all the episodes previously released on VHS from the Classics I and Classics II volumes, as well as the shorts included on said VHS releases.\nEventually, the rights for Nickelodeon's programming on home video transferred from Sony to Paramount Home Video. Paramount only released one video of \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\", \"Have Yourself a Stinky Little Christmas\", which was a re-release of a Sony video from 1993.\nIn 2005, Paramount released \"The First Ten Cartoons\" on UMD, only for playback on Sony's PSP portable video game system. Presumably due to poor sales of UMD movies and shows, no further episodes were released on the format.\nDVD.\nUnited States.\nTime Life released several episodes of \"The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\" in a \"Best of\" set in September 2003. This set is now out of print. On October 12, 2004, Paramount Home Entertainment released the first two complete seasons in a three-disc box set; although the cover art and press materials said the episodes were \"uncut\", a handful of episodes were edited, due to the use of Spike TV masters where Spike TV would cut some scenes from episodes to make room for longer commercial breaks. One of the episodes from the second season, \"Sv\u00ebn H\u00f6ek\", did have footage reinserted from a work-in-progress VHS tape, but with an editing machine timecode visible on-screen; the scene was later restored by fans. Three other episodes (\"Powdered Toast Man\", \"Dog Show\", and \"Big House Blues\") contain extra footage that was not originally broadcast on Nickelodeon. The DVD set even includes the banned episode \"Man's Best Friend\" as a bonus feature. A set for \"Seasons Three and a Half-ish\", containing all of season three and the first half of season four up to \"It's a Dog's Life/Egg Y\u00f6lkeo\", followed on June 28, 2005. \"Season Five and Some More of Four\" completed the DVD release of the Nickelodeon series on September 20. Like the previous DVDs, some scenes were removed in these releases.\nA two-disc set dubbed \"The Lost Episodes\" was released on July 17, 2006, featuring both the aired and unaired episodes from \"Ren &amp; Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"\".\nParamount released \"The Almost Complete Series\" 9-disc set that combines the individual season discs into a single package, on February 6, 2018, and was re-released on January 11, 2022.\nEurope.\nThe original series was released entirely as a 9-disc set in Germany on October 4, 2013. After people said that two episodes on the second disc were not completely uncensored, Turbine Classics offered to send everybody proof of purchase of an uncensored disc. The set comprises a mix of the known US airings and the German TV airings which included some exclusive scenes of various episodes. Since the set is the first to include all scenes ever broadcast worldwide, it is considered the first truly uncensored DVD release of the series.\nOther media.\nVideo games.\nSeven action games based directly on the television series were released between 1992 and 1995.\nAside from these dedicated titles, Ren, Stimpy, and other characters from the series make appearances in the Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker, \"Nicktoons Racing\", ', \"Nicktoons MLB\", ', \"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl\", \"\", and \"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2\". A \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" game by Acclaim Entertainment was planned for the Atari Lynx but never released.\nComic books.\nMarvel Comics optioned the rights to produce comic books based on Nickelodeon properties in 1992. The initial plan was to have an anthology comic featuring several Nicktoons properties. Marvel produced 44 issues of the ongoing series, along with several specials under the \"Marvel Absurd\" imprint. Most of these were written by comic scribe Dan Slott.\nOne \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" special #3, \"Masters of Time and Space\", was set up as a \"Choose Your Adventure\" and with a time travel plot, took Slott six months to plot out in his spare time. It was designed so that it was possible to choose a path that would eventually be 20 pages longer than the comic itself. Issue #6 of the series starred Spider-Man battling Powdered Toast Man.\nThe editors named the \"Letters to the Editor\" section \"Ask Dr. Stupid\", and at least one letter in every column would be a direct question for Dr. Stupid to answer. This comic series lasted from December 1992 \u2013 July 1996.\nIssues\nCancelled film adaptation.\nIn May 1993, Nickelodeon and 20th Century Fox signed a two-year production deal for the development and production of both animated and live-action feature-length films based on their new or existing properties; \"Ren &amp; Stimpy\" was mentioned as a possible property for development, alongside \"Rugrats\" and \"Doug\". However, the show's \"cynical and gross humor\" was a poor fit for a conventional, \"warm and fuzzy\" family film. After the deal expired with no films produced, Nickelodeon later started its own film studio after parent company Viacom purchased Paramount Pictures, which would distribute Nickelodeon's films instead of Fox.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "25913", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25913", "title": "R-Type", "text": "1987 video game\n is a 1987 horizontally scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Irem for arcades. The player controls the R-9 \"Arrowhead\" starship in its efforts to destroy the Bydo, a powerful alien race bent on wiping out all of mankind. The R-9 can acquire a glowing orb called a \"Force\", giving limited protection from enemy fire and providing additional firepower.\n\"R-Type\" was the first game to run on Irem's 16-bit M72 arcade system. The development team drew inspiration from \"Gradius\", \"Aliens\" and works by H.R. Giger. The music was composed by Masato Ishizaki, while character designs were by Akio Oyabu. The arcade version was distributed in North America by Nintendo, and was the last arcade title to be released by the company.\n\"R-Type\" was commercially successful and praised by critics for its graphics and addictive gameplay, but was criticized for its difficulty. It is commonly cited as one of the best shoot 'em up games, and one of the greatest video games of all time. Its success inspired several sequels and spin-off games, as well as home ports and releases for digital distribution services. A remake of the game was released as \"R-Type DX\" for the Game Boy Color in 2000. A 3D remake, \"R-Type Dimensions\", was released for the Xbox 360 in 2009; for the PlayStation 3 in 2014; for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2018; and for iOS in 2019.\nGameplay.\nThe game has a generally slower pace than similar shooting games of the time, and emphasizes enemy pattern memorization as much as player speed. It is composed of eight levels, with a boss enemy at the end of each. The player controls a small spacecraft and must navigate terrain and fight enemies using the various ship weapons. The player's spacecraft has, by default, a weak but rapid-firing main gun; and a more powerful gun called the Wave Cannon, which requires the player to hold their fire to build up power for the cannon.\nDuring the game, the player can obtain an auxiliary device called a Force. This resembles a glowing orange ball. The Force can be attached to the front or back of the player's spacecraft, or detached to fly freely. When attached, the Force provides one of three different powerful weapons, in addition to the main gun and the Wave Cannon.\nWhen detached, these weapons cannot be used, but the Force will instead resort to a secondary set of guns, which can be fired by the player even if the Force is at a distance from the spacecraft. The Force has a secondary use as a shield; it is completely indestructible and can block most things fired at it, as well as damage or destroy enemies on contact. Game designer Abiko mentioned the behavior of dung beetles as an inspiration for the Force.\nThe \"R-\" in the title stands for \"ray\", as in a ray of light, in reference to the many different types of rayed weapons that players use in the series.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment on the Commodore 64 version began when Activision's Electric Dreams Software subsidiary obtained the rights. David Jolliff was planning on to program the game with James Smart assisting in program help. The original version was shelved, and as a result of the settlement between the creators of \"Katakis\" and Activision, Manfred Trenz of Rainbow Arts had the right to do a port, which was made in six weeks.\nRelease and ports.\nHudson Soft developed a fairly accurate port of \"R-Type\" for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 console, although it suffered from a slightly lower resolution, reduced color palette, sprite flickering and slowdown. Due to the slightly reduced resolution, the playfield also scrolls slightly in the vertical axis whenever the player's ship approaches the top or bottom of the screen. The Japanese release was split across two game cards (HuCards), titled and , while the later North American release contained the entire game on a single card. The TurboGrafx-16 version of \"R-Type\" has a boss at the end of Stage 6, rather than a prolonged wave of enemies as in all other versions.\nThe Xbox Live Arcade game \"R-Type Dimensions\" was released on February 4, 2009, by Tozai Games. It is a port of the original \"R-Type\" and the sequel \"R-Type II\". It can be played either with the original 2D graphics or with new 3D graphics, and has added co-op gameplay functionality. A similar version for the PlayStation 3 was released in May 2014.\nThe TurboGrafx-16 version of \"R-Type\" was one of the first games confirmed for Nintendo's Virtual Console. The Japanese release for the Wii is split between two downloads, mirroring the original format of the game. The Japanese releases for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U use the North American version instead of the Japanese one, presenting the game as a single download; however, the game was removed from the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U stores on July 30, 2020.\nThe Master System version became available as well on the Virtual Console for Japan on May 19, 2009, North America on November 2, 2009, and Europe on September 25, 2009; however, due to licensing issues, this version was delisted on September 30, 2011, in North America and Europe and October 18, 2011, in Japan.\nIn 2010, DotEmu developed an iOS port of \"R-Type\", published by Electronic Arts, released also for Android in September 2011.\nTozai Games returned in 2018 and released an updated digital-only version of \"R-Type Dimensions\", now carrying the title \"R-Type Dimensions EX\", for Microsoft Windows (via Steam), PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. Strictly Limited Games released physical copies of the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch versions in February 2019, limited to 2,000 and 3,000 copies respectively. Collector's Edition variants were also issued which contained a hardcover artbook, dog tags, stickers and cards, once again limited to 1,000 on the PlayStation 4 and 2,000 on the Nintendo Switch.\nReception.\nArcade.\nIn Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed \"R-Type\" as the most successful table arcade cabinet of July 1987. It went on to be Japan's highest-grossing table arcade game of 1987. Later in 1988, it was the year's third highest-grossing arcade conversion kit and sixth highest-grossing overall arcade game of the year.\nThe original \"R-Type\" was well received by most critics. However, it was also infamous for its relentless difficulty. Clare Edgeley of \"Computer and Video Games\" selected \"R-Type\" as the \"game of the month\" in July 1987. The following month, \"Commodore User\" magazine gave it a highly positive review and noted that it drew large crowds queuing up at arcades.\nConsoles.\nAccording to \"Mega Guide\" in 1992, \"R-Type\" had sold \"squillions on hand-held\".\nA 1988 port to the Master System was immediately recognized as one of the best games available in the Sega library. A \"Mean Machines\" magazine review praised in particular the graphics and the high quality of the challenge offered by the game, awarding it an overall rating of 92%. In 1989, \"ACE\" listed it as one of the top five best games available for both the PC Engine and Master System.\nA 1995 article in \"Next Generation\" stated that the \"PC Engine [TurboGrafx-16] conversion of Irem's arcade smash \"R-Type\" is still regarded as the system's definitive contribution to the shoot 'em up genre.\" The following year they listed both it and the arcade original (but not any other ports of the game) at number 98 in their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", praising its art direction, graphics, design innovations, and huge bosses.\nIn a retrospective review, Allgame editor Shawn Sackenheim described the TurboGrafx-16 version of \"R-Type\" as \"(the) most accurate home conversion (of the arcade version) of the game\", furthermore stating that \"it's the shooter that started it all and it's still a thrill ride from beginning to end\".\nComputers.\nThe ZX Spectrum version of \"R-Type\" was awarded 9/10 in the January 1989 issue of \"Your Sinclair\" and was placed at number 6 in their official top 100. \"The Games Machine\" praised the \"incredible use of colour\" and that it \"blows away almost every other shoot'em up on the Spectrum\". \"Crash\" congratulated Electric Dreams for \"retaining the frenetic arcade feel and producing such a brilliant game\". \"Sinclair User\" praised the weapons system and difficulty curve, and \"C+VG\" called it \"an excellent shoot'em up that's both challenging and addictive. An absolute must for Spectrum blasting fanatics\".\nThe game was runner-up in the category of \"Best 8-Bit Coin-Op Conversion of the Year\" at the Golden Joystick Awards, behind \"Operation Wolf\".\nThe implementation of the music in the C64 version was well received, but this port received average reviews due to performance issues and glitches.\nLegacy.\nIrem has developed a number of sequels and related games, including \"R-Type II\" and \"Armed Police Unit Gallop\". Their \"XMultiply\", although not part of the series, has similar themes and gameplay, and was released around the same time as \"R-Type II\". However, before any of these games was \"Katakis\", a 1987 clone produced by Factor 5 for the Commodore 64 and the Amiga.\nIn 1991, Konami released \"Xexex\", a game heavily influenced by \"R-Type\" and \"XMultiply\". The game used similar weapons and concepts, such as the \"Flint\" being a combination of \"R-Type\" Force and \"X Multiply\" tentacle equipment.\nOther games similar to \"R-Type\" are \"Rezon\", released by Allumer in 1991, Aicom's \"Pulstar\" and \"Blazing Star\" (the latter published under Yumekobo) for the Neo Geo, and Technosoft's 1992 title \"Thunder Force IV\" for the Sega Genesis.\nOn April 1, 2019, Granzella announced the development of \"R-Type Final 2\", a sequel to \"R-Type Final\".\nChris Huelsbeck composed new title songs for the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions, which have remained as popular targets for game music remixers. The Amiga theme was composed by Huelsbeck, while the faster C64 theme was composed by Huelsbeck with Ramiro Vaca.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He held the rank of SS-. Many historians regard Heydrich as one of the most sinister figures within the Nazi regime. Adolf Hitler described him as \"the man with the iron heart.\"\nHeydrich was chief of the Reich Security Main Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD). He was also (Deputy Reich-Protector) of Bohemia and Moravia. He served as president of the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC, now known as Interpol) and chaired the January 1942 Wannsee Conference which formalised plans for the \"Final Solution to the Jewish question\"\u2014the deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe.\nHe was the founding head of the (Security Service, SD), an intelligence organisation charged with seeking out and neutralising resistance to the Nazi Party via arrests, deportations, and murders. He helped organise , a series of coordinated attacks against Jews throughout Nazi Germany and parts of Austria on 9\u201310 November 1938. The attacks were carried out by SA stormtroopers and civilians and presaged the Holocaust. Upon his arrival in Prague, Heydrich sought to eliminate opposition to the Nazi occupation by suppressing Czech culture and deporting and executing members of the Czech resistance. He was directly responsible for the , the special task forces that travelled in the wake of the German armies and murdered more than two million people by mass shooting and gassing including 1.3\u00a0million Jews.\nHeydrich was mortally wounded in Prague on 27 May 1942 as a result of Operation Anthropoid. He was ambushed by a team of Czech and Slovak soldiers who had been sent by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile to kill him; the team was trained by the British Special Operations Executive. Heydrich died from sepsis caused by his injuries on 4 June 1942. Nazi intelligence falsely linked the Czech and Slovak soldiers and resistance partisans to the villages of Lidice and Le\u017e\u00e1ky. Both villages were razed; the men and boys age 14 and above were shot and most of the women and children were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps.\nEarly life.\nReinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich was born in 1904 in Halle an der Saale to composer and opera singer Richard Bruno Heydrich and his wife, Elisabeth Anna Maria Amalia Heydrich (n\u00e9e Krantz). His father came from a Protestant family, but converted to Elisabeth's Roman Catholic faith upon marriage. Although he was not of Jewish descent, rumours that Richard Heydrich had Jewish ancestry stemmed from the fact that his stepfather Robert Gustav S\u00fcss appeared to have a Jewish-sounding surname.\nDuring his youth, Heydrich was an altar boy, attending evening prayers and Mass every week with his mother as part of the Catholic minority in Halle. Two of his forenames were musical references: \"Reinhard\" referred to the hero from his father's opera \"Amen\", and \"Tristan\" stems from Richard Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\". Heydrich's third name, \"Eugen\", was his late maternal grandfather's forename (Eugen Krantz had been the director of the Dresden Royal Conservatory).\nHeydrich's family held social standing and substantial financial means. Music was a part of Heydrich's everyday life; his father founded the Halle Conservatory of Music, Theatre, and Teaching and his mother taught piano there. As the oldest son, Reinhard was expected to inherit his father's music conservatory and was trained in music by his father, learning both the piano and violin when he was six years old. Heydrich developed a passion for the violin and carried that interest into adulthood; he impressed listeners with his musical talent.\nHis father was a German nationalist with loyalties to the Kaiser, who instilled patriotic ideas in his three children but was not affiliated with any political party until after World War I. The household was strict. Heydrich, initially a frail and sickly youth, was encouraged by his parents to exercise to build up his strength. He engaged his younger brother, Heinz, in mock fencing duels. He excelled in his schoolwork at the secular \"Reformgymnasium\", especially in the sciences. A talented athlete, he became an expert swimmer and fencer. He was shy, insecure, and was frequently bullied for his high-pitched voice and rumoured Jewish ancestry. These rumours increased after his maternal uncle Hans Krantz married a Hungarian Jew named Iza Jarmy. His family maintained cordial relations with the Jewish community; many Jewish students attended the Halle Conservatory, and its cellar was rented out to a Jewish salesman. Heydrich was friends with Abraham Lichtenstein, son of the cantor.\nIn 1918, World War I ended with Germany's defeat. In late February 1919, civil unrest\u2014including strikes and clashes between communist and anti-communist groups\u2014took place in Heydrich's home town of Halle. Under Defense Minister Gustav Noske's directives, paramilitary Freikorps units recaptured Halle. Heydrich, then 15 years old, joined the Freikorps Maercker's Volunteer Rifles. This was largely symbolic, as Heydrich was too young for military service. There is no evidence that he participated in the fighting, and when the skirmishes ended, he was part of the force assigned to protect private property. Heydrich began to form positive opinions about the \"V\u00f6lkisch\" movement and anti-communism, as well as a distaste for the Treaty of Versailles and the positioning of the German-Polish border. Heydrich stated he joined the \"Deutschv\u00f6lkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund\" (National German Protection and Shelter League), an antisemitic organisation. However, there is very little documentation of this, beyond a single postcard he received.\nAs a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles as well as Germany's large war debt, hyperinflation spread across Germany and many lost their life savings. Halle was not spared. By 1921, few townspeople there could afford a music education at Bruno Heydrich's conservatory. This led to a financial crisis for the Heydrich family.\nNaval career.\nIn 1922, Heydrich joined the German Navy (\"Reichsmarine\"), taking advantage of the security, structure, and pension it offered. He became a naval cadet at Kiel, Germany's primary naval base. Many of Heydrich's fellow cadets falsely regarded him as Jewish. To counteract these rumours, Heydrich told people he had joined several antisemitic and nationalist organisations, such as the \"Deutschv\u00f6lkischer Schutz und Trutzbund\". On 1 April 1924 he was promoted to senior midshipman (\"Oberf\u00e4hnrich zur See\") and sent to officer training at the Naval Academy M\u00fcrwik. In 1926 he advanced to the rank of ensign (\"Leutnant zur See\") and was assigned as a signals officer on the battleship SMS \"Schleswig-Holstein\", the flagship of Germany's North Sea Fleet. With the promotion came greater recognition. He received good evaluations from his superiors and had few problems with other crewmen. He was promoted on 1 July 1928 to the rank of first lieutenant.\nHeydrich became notorious for his numerous affairs. In December 1930 he attended a rowing-club ball and met Lina von Osten. They became romantically involved and soon got engaged. Lina was already a Nazi Party follower and antisemite; she had attended her first rally in 1929. Early in 1931 Heydrich was charged with \"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman\" for a breach of promise, having been engaged to marry another woman he had known for six months before the Lina von Osten engagement. Admiral Erich Raeder dismissed Heydrich from the navy in April. He received severance pay of 200 \"Reichsmarks\" () a month for the next two years. Heydrich married Lina in December 1931.\nCareer in the SS.\nOn 30 May 1931, Heydrich's discharge from the navy became legally binding, and either the following day or on 1 June he joined the Nazi Party in Hamburg. Six weeks later, on 14 July, he joined the SS. His party number was 544,916 and his SS number was 10,120. Those who joined the party after Hitler's seizure of power in January 1933 faced suspicions from the \"Alte K\u00e4mpfer\" (Old Fighters; the earliest party members) that they had joined for reasons of career advancement rather than a true commitment to Nazi ideology. Heydrich's date of enlistment in 1931 was early enough to quell suspicion that he had joined only to further his career, but was not early enough for him to be considered an Old Fighter.\nIn 1931, Heinrich Himmler began setting up a counterintelligence division of the SS. Acting on the advice of his associate Karl von Eberstein, who was Lina's friend and already close to Heydrich, Himmler agreed to interview Heydrich, but cancelled their appointment at the last minute. Lina ignored this message, packed Heydrich's suitcase, and sent him to Munich. Eberstein met Heydrich at the railway station and took him to see Himmler. Himmler asked Heydrich to convey his ideas for developing an SS intelligence service. Himmler was so impressed that he hired Heydrich immediately.\nAlthough the starting monthly salary of 180 \"Reichsmarks\" () was low, Heydrich decided to take the job because Lina's family supported the Nazi movement, and the quasi-military and revolutionary nature of the post appealed to him. At first he had to share an office and typewriter with a colleague, but by 1932 Heydrich was earning 290 \"Reichsmarks\" a month (), a salary he described as \"comfortable\". As his power and influence grew throughout the 1930s, his wealth grew commensurately; in 1935 he received a base salary of 8,400 \"Reichsmarks\" () and an allowance of 12,000 \"Reichsmarks\" () and by 1938 his income increased to 17,371 \"Reichsmarks\" (), annually. Heydrich later received a \"Totenkopfring\" from Himmler for his SS service.\nOn 1 August 1931, Heydrich began his job as chief of the new 'Ic Service' (intelligence service). He set up office at the Brown House, the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich. By October he had created a network of spies and informers for intelligence-gathering purposes and to obtain information to be used as blackmail to further political aims. Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards and stored at the Brown House. To mark the occasion of Heydrich's December wedding, Himmler promoted him to the rank of SS-\"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" (major).\nIn 1932, rumours were spread by Heydrich's enemies of his alleged Jewish ancestry. Wilhelm Canaris said he had obtained copies of documents proving Heydrich's Jewish ancestry. Nazi Gauleiter Rudolf Jordan claimed Heydrich was not a pure Aryan. Himmler reportedly said that Heydrich was \"an unhappy man, completely divided against himself, as often happened with those of mixed race\". Within the Nazi organisation such innuendo could be damning, even for the head of the Reich's counterintelligence service. Gregor Strasser passed the allegations on to the Nazi Party's racial expert, Achim Gercke, who investigated Heydrich's genealogy. Gercke reported that Heydrich was \"...\u00a0of German origin and free from any coloured and Jewish blood\". He insisted that the rumours were baseless. Even so, Heydrich privately engaged SD member Ernst Hoffmann to further investigate and dispel the rumours.\nGestapo and SD.\nIn mid-1932, Himmler appointed Heydrich chief of the renamed security service\u2014the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD). Heydrich's counterintelligence service grew into an effective machine of terror and intimidation. With Hitler striving for absolute power in Germany, Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states. They began with Bavaria. In 1933, Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the organisation using intimidation tactics. Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV, the political police.\nIn 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, and through a series of decrees became Germany's \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\" (leader and chancellor). The first concentration camps, which were originally intended to house political opponents, were established in early 1933. By year's end there were over fifty camps.\nHermann G\u00f6ring founded the Gestapo in 1933 as a Prussian police force. When G\u00f6ring transferred full authority over the Gestapo to Himmler in April 1934, it immediately became an instrument of terror under the SS's purview. Himmler named Heydrich to head the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Also in April, G\u00f6ring made Heydrich an advisor to the Prussian government with an appointment to the Prussian State Council. On 9 June 1934, Rudolf Hess declared the SD the official Nazi intelligence service.\nCrushing the SA.\nBeginning in April 1934, and at Hitler's request, Heydrich and Himmler began building a dossier on \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) leader Ernst R\u00f6hm in an effort to remove him as a rival for party leadership. At this point, the SS was still part of the SA, the early Nazi paramilitary organisation which now numbered over three million men. At Hitler's direction, Heydrich, Himmler, G\u00f6ring, and Viktor Lutze drew up lists of those who should be killed, starting with seven top SA officials and including many more. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. R\u00f6hm was shot without trial, along with the leadership of the SA. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives. Up to 200 people were killed in the action. Lutze was appointed SA's new head and it was converted into a sports and training organisation.\nWith the SA out of the way, Heydrich began building the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo had the authority to arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of \"Schutzhaft\"\u2014\"protective custody\", a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally as long as it was carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.\nAt the March 1936 parliamentary election, Heydrich was elected as a deputy to the \"Reichstag\" from electoral constituency 22 D\u00fcsseldorf East. He was reelected at the April 1938 election and held this seat until his death. \nHimmler began developing the notion of a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church in favour of the \"Gottgl\u00e4ubig\" movement. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he could no longer be a member, but came to consider the church's political power and influence a danger to the state.\nConsolidating the police forces.\nOn 17 June 1936, all police forces throughout Germany were united, following Hitler's appointment of Himmler as Chief of German Police. With this appointment by Hitler, Himmler and his \"de facto\" deputy, Heydrich, became two of the most powerful men in the internal administration of Germany. Himmler immediately reorganised the police into two groups: the \"Ordnungspolizei\" (Order Police; Orpo), consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police; and the \"Sicherheitspolizei\" (Security Police; SiPo), consisting of the \"Geheime Staatspolizei\" (Secret State Police; Gestapo) and \"Kriminalpolizei\" (Criminal Police; Kripo). At that point, Heydrich was head of the SiPo and SD. Heinrich M\u00fcller was the Gestapo's operations chief. Under the direction of \"Reichsminister\" Hans Frank, Heydrich published a strategy for the destruction of enemies of the German State.\nHeydrich was assigned to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of the Nazi regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of \"Der St\u00fcrmer\". For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the \"Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen\" or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).\nIn January 1937, Heydrich directed the SD to secretly begin collecting and analysing public opinion and report back its findings. He then had the Gestapo carry out house searches, arrests, and interrogations, thus in effect exercising control over public opinion. In February 1938 when the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg resisted Hitler's proposed merger with Germany, Heydrich intensified the pressure on Austria by organising Nazi demonstrations and distributing propaganda in Vienna emphasising the common Germanic blood of the two countries. In the \"Anschluss\" on 12 March, Hitler declared the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany.\nIn mid-1939, Heydrich created the Stiftung Nordhav Foundation to obtain real estate for the SS and Security Police to use as guest houses and vacation spots. The Wannsee Villa, which Stiftung Nordhav acquired in November 1940, was the site of the Wannsee Conference (20 January 1942). Heydrich was the lead speaker. At Wannsee, senior Nazi officials formalised plans to deport and exterminate all Jews in German-occupied territory and those countries not yet conquered. This action was to be coordinated among the representatives from the Nazi state agencies present at the meeting.\nOn 27 September 1939, the SD and SiPo\u2014made up of the Gestapo and the Criminal Police, or Kripo\u2014were folded into the new Reich Security Main Office or \"Reichssicherheitshauptamt\" (RSHA), which was placed under Heydrich's control. The title of \"Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD\" (Chief of Security Police and SD) or CSSD was conferred on Heydrich on 1 October. Heydrich became the president of the International Criminal Police Commission (later known as Interpol) on 24 August 1940, and its headquarters were transferred to Berlin. He was promoted to SS-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer und General der Polizei\" on 24 September 1941.\nRed Army purges.\nIn 1936, Heydrich learned that a top-ranking Soviet officer was plotting to overthrow Joseph Stalin. Sensing an opportunity to strike a blow at both the Soviet Army and Admiral Canaris of Germany's Abwehr, Heydrich decided that the Soviet officer should be \"unmasked\". He discussed the matter with Himmler and both in turn brought it to Hitler's attention. Hitler approved Heydrich's plan to act immediately. But the \"information\" Heydrich had received was actually misinformation planted by Stalin himself in an attempt to legitimise his planned purges of the Red Army's high command. Stalin ordered one of his best NKVD agents, General Nikolai Skoblin, to pass Heydrich false information suggesting that Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other Soviet generals were plotting against Stalin.\nHeydrich's SD forged documents and letters implicating Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders. The material was delivered to the NKVD. The Great Purge of the Red Army followed on Stalin's orders. While Heydrich believed they had deluded Stalin into executing or dismissing 35,000 of his officer corps, the importance of Heydrich's part is a matter of conjecture. Soviet military prosecutors did not use SD forged documents against the generals in their secret trial; they instead relied on false confessions extorted or beaten out of the defendants.\nNight-and-Fog decree.\nBy late 1940, German armies had invaded most of Western Europe. The following year, Heydrich's SD was given responsibility for carrying out the \"Nacht und Nebel\" (Night-and-Fog) decree. According to the decree, \"persons endangering German security\" were to be arrested in a maximally discreet way: \"under the cover of night and fog\". People disappeared without a trace with no one told of their whereabouts or fate. For each prisoner, the SD had to fill in a questionnaire that listed personal information, country of origin, and the details of their crimes against the Reich. This questionnaire was placed in an envelope inscribed with a seal reading \"Nacht und Nebel\" and submitted to the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA). In the WVHA \"Central Inmate File\", as in many camp files, these prisoners would be given a special \"covert prisoner\" code, as opposed to the code for POW, Felon, Jew, Gypsy, etc. The decree remained in effect after Heydrich's death. The exact number of people who vanished under it has never been positively established, but it is estimated to be 7,000.\nAnti-Polish policies.\nHeydrich created the \"Zentralstelle IIP Polen\" unit of the Gestapo to coordinate the ethnic cleansing of Poles in \"Operation Tannenberg\" and the \"Intelligenzaktion\", two codenames for extermination actions directed at the Polish people during the German occupation of Poland. Among the 100,000 people murdered in the \"Intelligenzaktion\" operations in 1939\u20131940, approximately 61,000 were members of the Polish intelligentsia: scholars, clergy, former officers, and others, whom the Germans identified as political targets in the \"Special Prosecution Book-Poland\", compiled before the war began in September 1939.\nDeputy Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia.\nOn 27 September 1941, Heydrich was appointed Deputy Reich Protector of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (the part of Czechoslovakia incorporated into the Reich on 15 March 1939) and assumed control of the territory. The Reich Protector, Konstantin von Neurath, remained the territory's titular head, but was sent on \"leave\" because Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich felt his \"soft approach\" to the Czechs had promoted anti-German sentiment and encouraged anti-German resistance via strikes and sabotage. Upon his appointment, Heydrich told his aides: \"We will Germanize the Czech vermin.\"\nHeydrich came to Prague to enforce policy, fight resistance to the Nazi regime, and keep up production quotas of Czech motors and arms that were \"extremely important to the German war effort\". He viewed the area as a bulwark of Germandom and condemned the Czech resistance's \"stabs in the back\". To realise his goals, Heydrich demanded racial classification of those who could and could not be Germanized. He explained, \"Making this Czech garbage into Germans must give way to methods based on racist thought.\"\nHeydrich started his rule by terrorising the population: he proclaimed martial law, and 142 people were executed within five days of his arrival in Prague. Their names appeared on posters throughout the occupied country. Most of them were the members of the resistance that had previously been captured and were awaiting trial.\nAccording to Heydrich's estimate, between 4,000 and 5,000 people were arrested and between 400 and 500 were executed by February 1942. Those who were not executed were sent to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, where only four per cent of Czech prisoners survived the war. Czech prime minister Alois Eli\u00e1\u0161 was among those arrested the first day. He was put on trial in Berlin and sentenced to death, but was kept alive as a hostage. He was later executed in retaliation for Heydrich's assassination.\nIn March 1942, further sweeps against Czech cultural and patriotic organisations, the military, and the intelligentsia resulted in the practical paralysis of the London-based Czech resistance. Almost all avenues by which Czechs could express the Czech culture in public were closed. Although small disorganised cells of survived, only the communist resistance was able to function in a coordinated manner (although it also suffered arrests). The terror also served to paralyse resistance in society, with public and widespread reprisals by the Nazis against any action resisting German rule. Heydrich's brutal policies during that time quickly earned him the nickname \"the Butcher of Prague\". The reprisals are referred to by Czechs as the \"Heydrichi\u00e1da\".\nAs Deputy Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Heydrich applied carrot-and-stick methods. Labor was reorganised on the basis of the German Labour Front. Heydrich used equipment confiscated from the Czech gymnastics organisation Sokol to organise events for workers. Food rations and free shoes were distributed, pensions were increased, and (for a time) free Saturdays were introduced. Unemployment insurance was established for the first time. The black market was suppressed. Those associated with it or the resistance movement were tortured or executed. Heydrich labelled them \"economic criminals\" and \"enemies of the people\", which helped gain him support. Conditions in Prague and the rest of the Czech lands were relatively peaceful under Heydrich, and industrial output increased. Still, those measures could not hide shortages and increasing inflation; reports of growing discontent multiplied.\nDespite public displays of goodwill towards the populace, privately Heydrich was very clear about his eventual goal: \"This entire area will one day be definitely German, and the Czechs have nothing to expect here.\" Eventually up to two-thirds of the populace were to be either removed to regions of Russia or exterminated after Nazi Germany won the war. Bohemia and Moravia faced annexation directly into the German Reich.\nThe Czech workforce was exploited as Nazi-conscripted labour. More than 100,000 workers were removed from \"unsuitable\" jobs and conscripted by the Ministry of Labour. By December 1941, Czechs could be called to work anywhere within the Reich. Between April and November 1942, 79,000 Czech workers were taken in this manner for work within Nazi Germany. Also, in February 1942, the work day was increased from eight to twelve hours.\nHeydrich was, for all intents and purposes, military dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His changes to the government's structure left President Emil H\u00e1cha and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone in a car with an open roof\u00a0\u2013 a show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his government's effectiveness.\nBy 3 October 1941, Czechoslovak military intelligence in London had made the decision to kill Heydrich.\nRole in the Holocaust.\nHistorians regard Heydrich as the most fearsome member of the Nazi elite. Hitler called him \"the man with the iron heart\". William L. Shirer described Heydrich as a \"long-nosed and icy-eyed individual of a diabolical cast\" and a \"genius of the Final Solution.\" He was one of the main architects of the Holocaust during the early war years, answering to and taking orders from only Hitler, G\u00f6ring, and Himmler in all matters pertaining to the deportation, imprisonment, and extermination of Jews.\nHeydrich was one of the organisers of \"Kristallnacht\", a pogrom against Jews throughout Germany on the night of 9\u201310 November 1938. Heydrich sent a telegram that night to various SD and Gestapo offices, helping to coordinate the pogrom with the SS, SD, Gestapo, uniformed police (Orpo), SA, Nazi party officials, and even the fire departments. In the telegram, Heydrich granted permission for arson and destruction of Jewish businesses and synagogues, and ordered the confiscation of all \"archival material\" from Jewish community centres and synagogues. The telegram ordered that \"as many Jews\u00a0\u2013 particularly affluent Jews\u00a0\u2013 are to be arrested in all districts as can be accommodated in existing detention facilities\u00a0... Immediately after the arrests have been carried out, the appropriate concentration camps should be contacted to place the Jews into camps as quickly as possible.\" Twenty thousand Jews were sent to concentration camps in the days immediately following; historians consider \"Kristallnacht\" the beginning of the Holocaust.\nWhen Hitler asked for a pretext for the invasion of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich M\u00fcller masterminded a false flag plan code-named Operation Himmler. It involved a fake attack on the German radio station at Gleiwitz on 31 August 1939. Heydrich masterminded the plan and toured the site, which was about from the Polish border. Wearing Polish uniforms, 150 German troops carried out several attacks along the border. Hitler used the ruse as an excuse to launch his invasion.\nOn Himmler's instructions, Heydrich formed the \"Einsatzgruppen\" (task forces) to travel in the wake of the German armies at the start of World War II. On 21 September 1939, Heydrich sent out a teleprinter message on the \"Jewish question in the occupied territory\" to the chiefs of all \"Einsatzgruppen\" with instructions to round up Jewish people for placement into ghettos, called for the formation of Judenr\u00e4te (Jewish councils), ordered a census, and promoted Aryanization plans for Jewish-owned businesses and farms, among other measures. The \"Einsatzgruppen\" units followed the army into Poland to implement the plans. Later, in the Soviet Union, they were charged with rounding up and murdering Jews via firing squad and gas vans. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the \"Einsatzgruppen\" and related auxiliary troops murdered more than two million people, including 1.3\u00a0million Jews. Heydrich ensured the safety of certain athletes, such as Paul Sommer, a Jewish German champion fencer he knew from his pre-SS days, and the Polish Olympic fencing team that competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n...\u00a0the planned total measures are to be kept strictly secret\u00a0... the first prerequisite for the final aim (\"Endziel\") is the concentration of the Jews from the countryside into the larger cities.\nHeydrich, September 1939\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBy order of the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS, residency without possession of an identification card is punishable by death.\nHeydrich, November 1939\nOn 29 November 1939, Heydrich issued a cable about the \"Evacuation of New Eastern Provinces\", detailing the deportation of people by railway to concentration camps, and giving guidance surrounding the December 1939 census, which would be the basis on which those deportations were performed. In May 1941 Heydrich drew up regulations with Quartermaster general Eduard Wagner for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which ensured that the \"Einsatzgruppen\" and army would co-operate in murdering Soviet Jews.\nOn 10 October 1941, Heydrich was the senior officer at a \"Final Solution\" meeting of the RSHA in Prague that discussed deporting 50,000 Jews from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to ghettos in Minsk and Riga. Given his position, Heydrich was instrumental in carrying out these plans since his Gestapo was ready to organise deportations in the West and his \"Einsatzgruppen\" were already conducting extensive killing operations in the East. The officers attending also discussed taking 5,000 Jews from Prague \"in the next few weeks\" and handing them over to the \"Einsatzgruppen\" commanders Arthur Nebe and Otto Rasch. Establishing ghettos in the Protectorate was also planned, resulting in the construction of the Theresienstadt Ghetto, where 33,000 people would eventually die. Tens of thousands more passed through the camp before being sent East to be murdered. In 1941 Himmler named Heydrich as \"responsible for implementing\" the forced movement of 60,000 Jews from Germany and Czechoslovakia to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Litzmannstadt) Ghetto in Poland.\nEarlier on 31 July 1941, Hermann G\u00f6ring gave written authorisation to Heydrich to ensure the co-operation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of a \"final solution to the Jewish question\" in territories under German control. On 20 January 1942, Heydrich chaired a meeting, now called the Wannsee Conference, to discuss the implementation of the plan.\nDeath.\nIn London, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile resolved to kill Heydrich. Jan Kubi\u0161 and Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk headed the team chosen for the mission, trained by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). On 28 December 1941 they parachuted into the Protectorate, where they lived in hiding, preparing for the mission.\nOn 27 May 1942, Heydrich planned to meet Hitler in Berlin. German documents suggest that Hitler intended to transfer him to German-occupied France where the French Resistance was gaining ground. To get from his home to the airport, Heydrich would have to pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merges with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction in the Prague suburb of Libe\u0148 was well suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. As Heydrich's car slowed, Gab\u010d\u00edk took aim with a Sten submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Heydrich ordered his driver, Klein, to halt and attempted to confront Gab\u010d\u00edk rather than speed away. Kubi\u0161, who had not been spotted by Heydrich or Klein, threw a converted anti-tank mine at the car as it stopped. It landed against the rear wheel. The explosion ripped through the right rear fender and wounded Heydrich with metal fragments and fibres from the upholstery causing serious damage to his left side: he suffered major injuries to his diaphragm, spleen, and one lung, as well as a broken rib. Kubi\u0161 received a minor shrapnel wound to his face. After Kubi\u0161 fled, Heydrich ordered Klein to chase Gab\u010d\u00edk on foot, but Gab\u010d\u00edk escaped after he shot and wounded Klein.\nA Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a delivery van. He was placed on his stomach in the back of the van and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. A splenectomy was performed and the chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided. Himmler ordered Karl Gebhardt to fly to Prague to assume care. Despite a fever, Heydrich's recovery appeared to progress well. Hitler's personal doctor Theodor Morell suggested the use of the new antibacterial drug sulfonamide, but Gebhardt thought that Heydrich would recover and declined the suggestion. Heydrich reconciled himself to his fate on 2 June, during a visit by Himmler, by reciting a quotation from one of his father's operas:\n&lt;poem lang=\"de\" style=\"float:left;\"&gt;Ja, die Welt ist nur ein Leierkasten,\nden unser Herrgott selber dreht.\nJeder mu\u00df nach dem Liede tanzen,\ndas gerade auf der Walze steht.&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;poem style=\"margin-left:2em; float:left;\"&gt;Yes, the world is just a barrel-organ\nwhich the Lord God turns Himself.\nWe all have to dance to the tune\nwhich is already on the drum.&lt;/poem&gt;\nOn 3 June, Heydrich fell into a coma; he died the following day. An autopsy concluded that he died of sepsis. Professors R. J. Defalque and A. J. Wright of the University of Alabama at Birmingham suggest that pulmonary embolism and/or brain ischemia may have been decisive factors. He was 38 years old.\nFuneral.\nAfter an elaborate funeral held in Prague on 7 June 1942, Heydrich's coffin was placed on a train to Berlin where a second ceremony was held in the new Reich Chancellery on 9 June. Himmler gave the eulogy. Hitler attended and placed Heydrich's decorations\u2014including the highest grade of the German Order, the Blood Order Medal, the Wound Badge in Gold, and the War Merit Cross 1st Class with Swords\u2014on his funeral pillow. Although Heydrich's death was employed for pro-Reich propaganda, Hitler privately blamed Heydrich for his own death through carelessness:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Since it is opportunity which makes not only the thief but also the assassin, such heroic gestures as driving in an open, unarmoured vehicle or walking about the streets unguarded are just damned stupidity, which serves the Fatherland not one whit. That a man as irreplaceable as Heydrich should expose himself to unnecessary danger, I can only condemn as stupid and idiotic.\nHeydrich was interred in Berlin's Invalidenfriedhof, a military cemetery. The exact burial spot is no longer public knowledge\u2014a temporary wooden marker that disappeared when the Red Army overran the city in 1945 was never replaced, so that Heydrich's grave could not become a rallying point for Neo-Nazis. Nevertheless, on 16 December 2019, the BBC reported that Heydrich's unmarked grave had been opened by unknown persons, without anything being taken. A photograph of Heydrich's burial shows the wreaths and mourners to be in section A, which abuts the north wall of the Invalidenfriedhof and Scharnhorststra\u00dfe, at the front of the cemetery. A recent biography of Heydrich also places the grave in Section A. Hitler planned for Heydrich to have a monumental tomb (designed by sculptor Arno Breker and architect Wilhelm Kreis) but, due to Germany's declining fortunes, it was never built.\nHeydrich's widow, Lina, won the right to a pension following a series of court cases against the West German government in 1956 and 1959. She was declared entitled to a substantial pension as her husband was a German general killed in action. The government had previously declined to pay due to Heydrich's role in the Holocaust. The couple had four children: Klaus, born in 1933, killed in a traffic accident in 1943; Heider, born in 1934; Silke, born in 1939; and Marte, born shortly after her father's death in 1942. Lina wrote a memoir, \"Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher\" (\"Living With a War Criminal\"), which was published in 1976. She remarried once and died in 1985.\nAftermath.\nHeydrich's assailants hid in safe houses and eventually took refuge in Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral, an Orthodox church in Prague. After a traitor in the Czech resistance betrayed their location, the church was surrounded by 800 members of the SS and Gestapo. Several Czechs were killed, and the remainder hid in the church's crypt. The Germans attempted to flush the men out with gunfire and tear gas, and by flooding the crypt. Eventually an entrance was made using explosives. Rather than surrender, the soldiers killed themselves. Supporters of the assassins who were killed in the wake of these events included the church's leader, Bishop Gorazd, who is now revered as a martyr of the Orthodox Church.\nInfuriated by Heydrich's death, Hitler ordered the arrest and execution of 10,000 randomly selected Czechs. But after consultations with Karl Hermann Frank, he altered his response. The Czech lands were an important industrial zone for the German military, and indiscriminate killing could reduce the region's productivity. Hitler ordered a quick investigation. Intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the villages of Lidice and Le\u017e\u00e1ky. A Gestapo report stated that Lidice, north-west of Prague, was suspected as the assailants' hiding place because several Czech army officers, then in England, had come from there; additionally, the Gestapo had found a resistance radio transmitter in Le\u017e\u00e1ky. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals. On 9 June, in the village of Lidice 172 boys and men between age 14 and 84 were shot. Thereafter, all adults in Le\u017e\u00e1ky were murdered on 24 June.\nAll but four of the women from Lidice were deported immediately to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp (four were pregnant\u00a0\u2013 they were subjected to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and the women were then sent to the concentration camp). Some children were chosen for Germanization, and 81 were murdered in gas vans at the Che\u0142mno extermination camp. Both towns were burned and Lidice's ruins were levelled. Overall, at least 1,300\u00a0Czechs, including 200 women, were killed in reprisal for Heydrich's assassination.\nHeydrich's replacements were Ernst Kaltenbrunner as the chief of RSHA, and Karl Hermann Frank (27\u201328 May 1942) and Kurt Daluege (28 May 1942\u00a0\u2013 14 October 1943) as the new Deputy Protector. After Heydrich's death, implementation of the policies formalised at the Wannsee conference he chaired was accelerated. The first three true death camps, designed for mass murder with no legal process or pretext, were built and operated at Treblinka, Sobib\u00f3r, and Be\u0142\u017cec. The project was named Operation Reinhard after Heydrich.\nService record.\nHeydrich's time in the SS was a mixture of rapid promotions, reserve commissions in the regular armed forces, and front-line combat service. During his 11 years with the SS Heydrich \"rose from the ranks\" and was appointed to every rank from private to full general. He was also a major in the Luftwaffe, flying nearly 100 combat missions until 22 July 1941, when his plane was hit by Soviet anti-aircraft fire. After this, Hitler personally ordered Heydrich to return to Berlin to resume his SS duties. His service record also gives him credit as a Navy Reserve Lieutenant, but in 1931 he was dismissed for conduct unbecoming an officer with loss of rank, and during World War II he had no contact with the Navy Reserve.\nHeydrich began training as a pilot in 1935, and undertook fighter pilot training at the flight school at Werneuchen in 1939. Himmler initially forbade Heydrich from flying combat missions, but later relented, allowing him to join \"Jagdgeschwader 77\" \"Herz As\" (Ace of Hearts) in Norway, where he was stationed from 15 April 1940 during Operation Weser\u00fcbung. He returned to Berlin on 14 May after his plane crashed at Stavanger the previous day. While in Norway, Heydrich also organised the arrests of political opponents and arranged for a contingent of 200 SiPo and SD men to be stationed in several major cities.\nOn 20 July 1941, without seeking authorisation from Himmler, Heydrich rejoined \"Jagdgeschwader 77\" during Operation Barbarossa, arriving at Yampil, Vinnytsia Oblast in a borrowed Bf 109. His aircraft was hit by Soviet flak in action near the Dniester on 22 July, and he had to land the plane in enemy territory. He avoided capture and returned to Berlin after being rescued by a patrol. It was his final combat mission.\nHeydrich received a number of Nazi and military awards. These included the German Order, Blood Order, Golden Party Badge, Luftwaffe Pilot's Badge, bronze and silver Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe for combat missions, and the Iron Cross First and Second Classes.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25915", "revid": "49777317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25915", "title": "Ra\u00eblism", "text": "UFO religion\nRa\u00eblism, also known as Ra\u00eblianism, is a UFO religion founded in 1970s France by Claude Vorilhon, now known as Ra\u00ebl. Scholars of religion classify Ra\u00eblism as a new religious movement. The group is formalised as the International Ra\u00eblian Movement (IRM) or Ra\u00eblian Church, a hierarchical organisation under Ra\u00ebl's leadership.\nRa\u00eblism teaches that an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim created humanity using their advanced technology. An atheistic religion, it holds that the Elohim have historically been mistaken for gods. It claims that throughout history the Elohim have created 40 Elohim/human hybrids who have served as prophets preparing humanity for news about their origins. Among them are The Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad, with Ra\u00ebl himself the 40th and final prophet. Ra\u00eblists believe that since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, humanity has entered an Age of Apocalypse in which it threatens itself with nuclear annihilation. Ra\u00eblism holds that humanity must find a way to harness new scientific and technological development for peaceful purposes, and that when this has been achieved the Elohim will return to Earth to share their technology with humanity and establish a utopia. To this end, Ra\u00eblians have sought to build an embassy for the Elohim that incorporates a landing pad for their spaceship. Ra\u00eblians engage in daily meditation, hope for physical immortality through human cloning, and promote a liberal ethical system with a strong emphasis on sexual experimentation.\nRa\u00ebl first published his claims to have been contacted by the Elohim in his 1974 book \"Le Livre Qui Dit La Verit\u00e9\" (The Book that Tells the Truth). He subsequently established an organisation devoted to promoting his ideas, MADECH, which in 1976 disbanded and was replaced by the Ra\u00eblian Church. Ra\u00ebl headed the new organisation, which was structured around a hierarchy of seven levels. Attracting more followers, the group obtained a country estate in France before relocating its operations to Quebec. In 1998, Ra\u00ebl established the Order of Angels, an internal all-female group whose members are largely sequestered from wider society and tasked with training themselves to become the Elohim's consorts. In 1997 Ra\u00ebl initiated Clonaid, an organisation engaged in research in human cloning directed by senior Ra\u00eblian Brigitte Boisselier. In 2002, the company claimed to have produced a human clone, a baby named Eve, bringing much critical scrutiny and media attention. The Movement has attracted further attention through its public protests endorsing causes such as women's and gay rights and against nuclear testing.\nThe International Ra\u00eblian Movement claims tens of thousands of members, the majority in Francophone areas of Western Europe and North America and parts of East Asia. Criticism of the philosophy has come from journalists, ex-Ra\u00eblians, and anti-cultists, while it has also been studied by scholars of religion.\nDefinition and classification.\nRa\u00eblism is classified as a new religious movement by scholars of religion. It has also been described as a UFO religion, a UFO movement, and an ETI (extra-terrestrial intelligence) religion. The organization that promotes Ra\u00eblianism is the International Ra\u00eblian Movement (IRM), which is also called the Ra\u00eblian Church. In France, where the religion originated, the government's Parliamentary Commission on Cults labels it as a \"secte\", a French term that is equivalent to the English word \"cult\". In 1997, a parliamentary inquiry commission issued a report through the Belgian Chamber of Representatives which likewise categorized the Belgian Ra\u00eblian Movement (\"Mouvement Ra\u00eblien Belge\") as a \"secte\".\nRa\u00eblism is among the largest UFO religions in existence, and in the mid-2000s, the scholar of religion Andreas Gr\u00fcnschlo\u00df called it \"one of the most consolidated UFO groups internationally active today\". In its beliefs, Ra\u00eblism differs from many other UFO-based philosophies, with the scholar of religion James R. Lewis terming it \"the most thoroughly secular of all the UFO religions\". Most other UFO religions, such as the Aetherius Society, Ashtar Command, and Heaven's Gate, use many of the beliefs of the late-19th-century religion Theosophy; Ra\u00eblism does not. Ra\u00eblists have also been characterized as having a \"belief in ufology\", but Ra\u00eblians often stress that they do not regard themselves as ufologists.\nRa\u00eblism is materialistic and rejects the existence of the supernatural, endorsing atheism and rejecting the idea that gods exist. The religion's founder, Ra\u00ebl, characterizes traditional religion as irrational and unscientific, presenting his alternative as a philosophy free from \"obscurantism and mysticism\". Ra\u00eblians call their belief system a \"scientific religion\", with the International Ra\u00eblian Movement using the motto \"Science is our religion; religion is our science\". The religion emphasizes the use of science to solve the world's problems, and practitioners regard Ra\u00ebl as a pioneer of science who will one day be regarded as a peer of Galileo and Copernicus. Many of its members call it an \"atheistic religion\", and compare it to Buddhism, some branches of which similarly do not promote belief in gods (especially Therav\u0101da Buddhism).\nAlong with science, the other main basis of Ra\u00ebl's ideas is the Bible. Noting the \"central role\" of the Bible in Ra\u00eblism, the scholar of religion Eugene V. Gallagher suggested that it was a \"thoroughly biblical and thoroughly Christian\" philosophy. Similarly, the sociologist of religion Susan J. Palmer characterised Ra\u00eblism as both fundamentalist and Abrahamic in its reliance on the Bible. Ra\u00ebl nevertheless criticised Christianity for what he believed was its role in perverting the Bible's message, presenting himself as an opponent of the Roman Catholic Church. Ra\u00eblism is not inclusive of other religions, with new members expected to formally renounce any previous religious affiliations.\nBeliefs.\nDuring the early 2000s, the scholar of religion George D. Chryssides said that Ra\u00eblism exhibits \"a coherent worldview\", but added that the movement remained in the \"very early developmental stage\". The religion is based on the teachings of Ra\u00ebl. Ra\u00ebl's claims are taken literally by practitioners of Ra\u00eblism, who regard his writings as scripture. From Palmer's extensive study of the philosophy and Ra\u00ebl himself, she thought that he genuinely believed his claims. The sociologist of religion Christopher Partridge noted that Ra\u00eblianism exhibits \"a \"strong\" physicalist belief system\".\nRa\u00eblism presents a form of the ancient astronauts theory which was well known at the time that the religion was formed. Several French authors, such as Jean Sendy, Serge Hutin, and Jacques Bergier, had already published books during the late 1960s and early 1970s stating that Earth was the outpost of an ancient extraterrestrial society. Swiss writer Erich von D\u00e4niken presented the same idea in his 1968 book \"Chariots of the Gods?\" Similar ideas had also been put forward in science fiction, such as the U.S. television series \"Star Trek\". Ra\u00eblians often deny the effect of von D\u00e4niken on the philosophy, instead believing that it derives entirely from Ra\u00ebl's revelations.\nThe Elohim.\nRa\u00eblism teaches that there exists an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim. Ra\u00ebl has said that the word \"Elohim\", which is used for God in the Old Testament, is actually a plural term which he translates as \"those who came from the sky\". Ra\u00ebl calls individual members of the Elohim \"Eloha\". He claims that the Elohim gave him the honorific name \"Ra\u00ebl\", a term deriving from \"Israel\", which he translates as \"the messenger of those who come from the sky\".\nIn his first book, \"Le Livre Qui Dit La Verit\u00e9\", published in 1974, Ra\u00ebl claimed that he initially encountered these alien beings on 13 December 1973, when he was 27 years old. He wrote that he was walking along the Puy de Lassolas volcanic crater in the Clermont-Ferrand mountains when one of their spaceships appeared and an Eloha emerged, who asked him to return the next day and bring a Bible. Ra\u00ebl did so, and over six days the Eloha explained to him the true meaning of its contents, revealing more about the Elohim's involvement in human history. In his 1976 book \"Les Extra-Terrestres M'ont Emmen\u00e9 sur Leur Plan\u00e8te\" (\"The Extraterrestrials Took Me to Their Planet\"), Ra\u00ebl added that he was contacted by the Elohim again on 7 October 1975, when they took him aboard their spaceship and transported him to their home planet. Here he was offered six biological robot women with which to have sex, saw the Elohim create his clone, and taught the techniques of sensual meditation. The scholar of religion James R. Lewis noted that Ra\u00ebl's account of encountering the Elohim was similar to those of the \"classic UFO contactees\" of the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe Elohim are described as physically smaller than humans, with pale green skin and almond-shaped eyes, and they divide into seven different races. Ra\u00eblians are forbidden from painting or sketching them. According to Ra\u00ebl, their planet is outside the Solar System but within the Milky Way. Ra\u00ebl states that there are 90,000 Elohim on their planet, and that they are all quasi-immortal, and that they do not wear clothes. All of them are permitted to engage in free love with one another, and sexual jealousy has been eliminated. All of them are regarded as feminine in manner; Ra\u00ebl states that \"the most feminine woman on Earth is only 10% as feminine as the Elohim.\". They are not allowed to procreate, and many of them undergo a sterilisation operation to ensure this. Ra\u00ebl also reports that the Elohim can communicate with humans because they understand all human languages.\nThe Elohim on Earth.\nRa\u00eblism teaches that around 25,000 years ago, the Elohim arrived at Earth, and then transformed it so that life could develop thereon. It states that the Elohim used their advanced technology to establish all life on the planet. Ra\u00ebl characterises humans as \"biological robots\" that have been created and programmed by the Elohim. Ra\u00eblism teaches that humanity is modelled physically on the Elohim; for practitioners, this is indicated by the passage at Genesis 1:26. Also representing his own interpretation of Genesis, Ra\u00ebl teaches that the Elohim scientist responsible for creating humanity was named Yahweh, and that the first two humans to be created were named Adam and Eve. Ra\u00eblians believe that there were originally seven human races, modelling the seven Elohim races, but that the purple, blue, and green races have died out. In believing that the human species was created by the Elohim, Ra\u00eblians reject Darwinian evolution, and espouse creationism and intelligent design; Ra\u00eblians term their beliefs \"scientific creationism\". Ra\u00eblians believe that the Elohim were also created by an earlier species, and they before them, \"ad infinitum\". They believe that the cosmos expands indefinitely, both in time and in space; infinity is an important concept for them.\nRa\u00eblians believe that accounts of gods in various mythologies around the world are misinterpretations of memories about the Elohim. The philosophy states that the sacred scriptures of many other religions describe the ongoing activities of the Elohim on Earth. For example, the tale of Adam and Eve's expulsion from the Garden of Eden, recounted in Genesis, is interpreted as representing humans' difficult transition from the Elohim's laboratories to life on Earth, where they had to become self-sufficient. The resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, as presented in the Gospels, is described as representing how the Elohim cloned Jesus to restore him to life after death. References to Satan are interpreted as referring to the chief of a group on the Elohim's planet who were opposed to genetic experiments on Earth, and who argued that all humans should be killed as a potential threat. According to the Ra\u00eblians, the Great Flood narrative recounts an attempt by the anti-human aliens to wipe-out all humans, but that some humans were rescued by an alien spacecraft which provided the basis for the story of Noah's Ark.\nVarious figures who established or inspired religions throughout human history, including Jesus, the Buddha, Muhammad, and Joseph Smith, are portrayed by the Ra\u00eblians as having been guided by the Elohim. These are characterised as being 39 prophets sent to humanity at various times. Each of them is believed to have revealed information to humanity that they could comprehend at the given time, and Ra\u00eblism, therefore, emphasises the idea of progressive truth. Ra\u00ebl claims that he is the fortieth and final prophet of the Elohim, sent because the human species is now sufficiently developed to understand the truth about the Elohim. He initially claimed that he was chosen for this role because he had a Roman Catholic mother and a Jewish father, and was thus \"an ideal link between two very important peoples in the history of the world\". He added that he was also selected because he lived in France, which the Elohim considered a more open-minded country than most others.\nRa\u00ebl subsequently stated that these prophets are themselves the result of a human mother breeding with an Eloha father, with the human mothers having been chosen for the purity of their genetic code, beamed onto an Elohim spacecraft, impregnated, and then returned to Earth with their memory of the event erased. In his 1979 book, \"Let's Welcome Our Fathers from Space\", Ra\u00ebl added that he was the biological son of the Eloha who he first encountered, Yahweh. He noted that Yahweh was also the father of Jesus, making the latter Ra\u00ebl's half-brother. In 2003, Ra\u00ebl publicly identified himself as Maitreya, the prophesied future bodhisattva of Mahayana Buddhism. He maintains that he continues to be in telepathic contact with the Elohim, hearing Yahweh's voice guiding him in making decisions that affect Ra\u00eblianism.\nThe religion also teaches that the Elohim continue to monitor every human individual on Earth, remotely, from their planet. This is done so that the Elohim can decide which individuals merit being offered the opportunity of eternal life. It argues that the Elohim continue to visit Earth, as evidenced by crop circles, which adherents regard as the landing spaces of the Elohim's spacecraft. Ra\u00eblians generally understand sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) as confirmation of their belief in the Elohim, although their opinion of Ufology is ambiguous. Ra\u00eblians also consider the appearance of \"angel hair\" as evidence of the Elohim's presence, stating that it has appeared at various Ra\u00eblian summer gatherings. They typically express scepticism regarding claims by alleged alien contactees other than Ra\u00ebl. Ra\u00eblians believe that they are all capable of linking telepathically with the Elohim, but that only Ra\u00ebl is permitted to meet with them physically or receive their revelations.\nThe Age of Apocalypse and the Elohim's Return.\nRa\u00eblism is a millenarian philosophy. Ra\u00ebl claims that since the U.S. military's use of the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, humans have been living in the \"Age of Apocalypse\" or \"Revelation\". Ra\u00eblian doctrine states that the human species must now choose whether to use science and technology to enhance life, or to use it to bring about nuclear annihilation. It claims that if humans successfully get through this present age, they will live in an era of advanced technology, in which society will be tolerant and sexually liberated. Ra\u00ebl claimed that he was destined to help lead the human species away from its path of destruction.\nAccording to Ra\u00ebl, beginning a peaceful age will cause the return of the Elohim to Earth. He added that those Elohim will bring with them the 39 immortal prophets who they had previously sent to guide humanity. Ra\u00ebl stated that humanity has to build an embassy for the Elohim prior to their arrival on Earth, and that it must include a landing pad for their spaceship. He stated that it needed to be located on internationally recognised neutral territory, so as not to indicate favour towards any one particular nation-state. Initially, Ra\u00ebl sought permission to build it in Israel, explaining this by reference to how the ancient Israelites were once in contact with the Elohim. He also stated that this embassy would constitute the \"Third Temple\" referred to in Jewish prophecy.\nReceiving little help for this venture from the Israeli government, Ra\u00ebl instead suggested that a neighbouring country might be suitable, proposing Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt as possible locations. None of the governments of these countries were favorable. Senior people of the Ra\u00eblian Movement suggested Hawaii as a possible alternative, and in 1998, Ra\u00ebl stated that he had received a new revelation from the Elohim, which stated that this location would be acceptable. Chryssides noted that, should the Elohim not arrive in 2035, the Ra\u00eblians will have to adapt to the new circumstance in which their eschatology remains unfulfilled. On 16 April 1987, the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" estimated the funding for the \"cosmic kibbutz\" at $1 million. In 1997\u20131998, the funding had risen to $7 million. In 2001, group members claimed that they had saved $9 million for the embassy, and in October 2001, the funding had reached $20 million.\nOnce on Earth, Ra\u00ebl claims, the Elohim will share their advanced technology and scientific understanding with humans, and will help to usher-in a utopia. Ra\u00ebl teaches that the Elohim's arrival will herald a new and improved political system on Earth. This will be a single world government that Ra\u00ebl terms a \"geniocracy\", or \"rule of geniuses\", and which he discusses in his fifth book, \"Geniocracy\". According to this system, only those few people who are at least fifty percent more intelligent than the average person will be permitted to rule. Ra\u00ebl's proposed geniocratic system bears similarities with the style of governance that Plato promoted in his work \"Republic\". Ra\u00eblians thus reject democracy, believing that it fails to ensure that society has the best leadership. Ra\u00ebl claims that this future society will have no war, and that crime will have been ended via genetic engineering. In this future, Ra\u00ebl states, humans will be able to travel beyond Earth, to colonise other planets. Ra\u00ebl claims that robots will assume menial tasks, allowing humans to devote their time to pleasurable pursuits. He also argued that there would be biological robots which would serve as sex-slaves, akin to those which Ra\u00ebl states that he encountered on his visit to the Elohim planet. A single world currency will be introduced, as a prelude to the total abolition of money, while a unified world calendar will also be adopted.\nCloning and survival after death.\nRa\u00eblians reject the existence of the ethereal soul that survives physical death, and instead argue that the only hope for immortality is through scientific means. The Ra\u00eblians claim that the Elohim will clone and thus recreate dead individuals, but only those particular individuals who they deem merit this recreation. In this, they believe in a \"conditional immortality\", with immortality for a minority and oblivion for the majority. The resurrection of Jesus, as recounted in the Gospels, is for instance explained as an example of Elohim cloning.\nRa\u00eblists advocate for the development of human cloning technology on Earth. Ra\u00eblians also believe that deceased individuals can be cloned so that they could be tried and punished for their crimes. After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, in which the attackers killed themselves, the Ra\u00eblists proposed that they could be resurrected through cloning to be tried for their actions. Due to its emphasis upon attaining immortality, Ra\u00eblism deplores suicide; after the Heaven's Gate group engaged in a mass suicide in 1997, the Ra\u00eblian Church was among the new religions that issued press releases condemning suicide.\nAs opposed to the scientific definition of reproductive cloning, which is simply the creation of a genetically identical living organism, Ra\u00eblians seek to both genetically clone individuals, rapidly accelerate growth of the clone to adulthood through a process like guided self-assembly of rapidly expanded cells or even nanotechnology. Ra\u00ebl told lawmakers that banning the development of human cloning was comparable to outlawing medical advances such as \"antibiotics, blood transfusions, and vaccines\".\nMorality, ethics, and gender roles.\nRa\u00eblism insists on a strict ethical code for its followers. Members are expected to take responsibility for their own actions, respect cultural and racial difference, promote non-violence, strive for world peace, and share wealth and resources. They are also encouraged to uphold democracy, in the belief that humanity will ultimately make a democratic choice to introduce geniocracy. The Ra\u00eblian opinion is that everything should be permitted so long as it harms no one and does not impede scientific and technological advance. Members are nevertheless advised against using recreational drugs or stimulants so as not to harm their health, although some practitioners have acknowledged that they use alcohol and cigarettes.\nJohn M. Bozeman characterized the religion's morality as \"progressive\", while Palmer referred to the group's \"liberal social values\", and Chryssides called Ra\u00eblist values \"worldly and hedonistic\". The scholar of religion Paul Oliver said that the philosophy's ethics are \"relativistic\" in that practitioners are encouraged to act in a manner that they feel appropriate to the context. Several scholars have also argued that it is a \"world-affirming\" religion, using the typology established by Roy Wallis.\nRa\u00ebl considered gender as an artificial construct and emphasized its fluidity. Ra\u00ebl avoided a macho persona and is instead often described by his followers as being \"gentle\" and \"feminine\". Palmer suggested that Ra\u00ebl regarded women as being superior to men because they were described as being more like the Elohim. In Ra\u00ebl's account, the inhabitants of the Elohim planet \"have 10 percent of masculinity and 90 percent of femininity\". Ra\u00ebl also proposed that if women were in positions of political power across the world, there would be no war. The Ra\u00eblians have participated with public protests for women's rights. At its June 2003 \"Joy of Being Woman\" demonstration, Ra\u00eblian women danced naked through the streets of Paris. Palmer described the Ra\u00eblians as feminists, although Ra\u00ebl criticized mainstream feminism, arguing that it \"copied the shortcomings of men\". Generally adopting the belief that the human body is malleable, Ra\u00eblism has a positive opinion of plastic surgery to improve physical appearance.\nRa\u00eblism teaches that the Elohim created humanity to feel sexual desire as a panacea for their violent impulses. It states that through the pursuit of sexual pleasure, new pathways between the neurons in the brain are forged, thus enhancing an individual's intelligence. Ra\u00eblism encourages its members to explore their sexuality; while Ra\u00ebl is often photographed with beautiful women and appears to be heterosexual, he encourages homosexual experimentation. Adopting an accepting attitude towards different forms of sexual orientation and expression, Ra\u00eblism teaches that differences in sexual orientation are rooted in the Elohim's primordial genetic programming and are something to be celebrated. Researching about the Ra\u00eblians of Quebec, Palmer found that many of them avoided categorizing themselves by using terms like \"heterosexual\", \"homosexual\", or \"bisexual\", finding those labels to be too limiting.\nThe Ra\u00eblians have stressed the need for respect and mutual consent in sexual behaviour. The group places a strong taboo on incest, rape, and sexual activities involving children. Anyone involved in the Movement who is found to have been involved in these latter activities is excommunicated, while Ra\u00ebl has recommended that paedophiles be castrated or placed in mental institutions. Those believed to have forced unwelcome sexual attention upon another person are excommunicated from the Movement for seven years\u2013 the amount of time Ra\u00eblians believe it takes for all of a person's biological cells to be regenerated.\nThe Ra\u00eblists reject both enforced monogamy and marriage, regarding these as institutions that have been enforced to enslave women and suppress sexual expression. The religion discourages its members from marrying. Members are also discouraged from contributing to global overpopulation; members are urged not to have more than two children, and ideally none at all. Ra\u00ebl states that should two individuals wish to procreate, their psychic control during the act of conception can affect any child resulting. The Ra\u00eblists also believe that once human cloning has been developed, biological reproduction will be obsolete. As well as endorsing the use of birth control and contraceptives, Ra\u00eblists endorse the use of abortion to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Ra\u00ebl has also argued that if a woman does not want a child who has been born then she should give it up to be raised by society.\nSome Swiss government authorities responded to Ra\u00eblians' opinions about Sensual Meditation with a fear that Ra\u00eblians are a threat to public morals for supporting liberalized sex education for children. They argue that such liberalized sex education that teaches children how to obtain sexual gratification would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.\nReligious symbol.\nThe symbol initially used to signify Ra\u00eblism was a six-pointed star with a swastika in the centre. Ra\u00ebl stated that this was the symbol he originally saw on the hull of the Elohim's spaceship. Ra\u00eblians regard this as a symbol of infinity. Practitioners also believe that this symbol helps facilitate their own telepathic contact with the Elohim.\nRa\u00eblists typically wear a medallion of the symbol around their neck.\nThe Ra\u00eblian use of the swastika, a symbol that had been prominently used by Germany's Nazi Party during the 1930s and 1940s, resulted in accusations from the Montreal anti-cult organization Info-Cult that the Ra\u00eblians promoted fascism and racism. Outside Info-Cult's office, Ra\u00eblians spoke against the act of discriminating against a religious minority. On 2 January 1992, a dozen people protested against the use of the swastika in the Ra\u00eblian logo in Miami's Eden Roc Hotel. The use of the swastika and other Ra\u00eblian practices has resulted in criticism from the group Hineni of Florida, an Orthodox Jewish organization.\nIn 1992, the Ra\u00eblian Movement altered their symbol, replacing the central swastika with a swirling shape. They explained that this was due to a request from the Elohim to change the symbol in order to help in negotiations with Israel for the building of the Extraterrestrial Embassy, although the country continued to deny their request. Ra\u00ebl also stated that the change was made to show respect to the victims of the Holocaust. The newly added swirling shape was explained as a depiction of a swirling galaxy. In 2005, the Israeli Ra\u00eblian Guide Kobi Drori stated that the Lebanese government was discussing proposals by the Ra\u00eblian movement to build their interplanetary embassy in Lebanon. However, one condition was that the Ra\u00eblians not display their logo on top of the building because it mixes a swastika and a Star of David. According to Drori, the Ra\u00eblians involved refused this offer, as they wished to keep the symbol as it was. From 1991 to 2007, the official Ra\u00eblian symbol in Europe and America did not have the original swastika, but Ra\u00ebl decided to make the original symbol, the Star of David intertwined with a swastika, the only official symbol of the Ra\u00eblian Movement worldwide.\nPractices.\nRa\u00eblism involves a series of monthly meetings, initiations, and meditation rituals. Where possible, Ra\u00eblians congregate with fellow practitioners on the third Sunday of the month. It is the group's policy that these events occur in rented rooms rather than property that the Ra\u00eblian Movement itself has purchased. At the monthly meetings in Montreal, Ra\u00ebl himself often appeared.\nThe main ritual in Ra\u00eblism is the \"transmission of the cellular plan\", in which a Ra\u00eblian Guide placed their hands upon another individual's head, through which the Guide is believed to receive the individual's cellular code and then telepathically transmit it to the Elohim. Doing so denotes the initiate's formal recognition of the Elohim as the creators of humanity. This is used as part of the \"baptism\", or initiation ceremony for new members joining the Movement. Those in the Movement who hold the rank of bishop and priest are permitted to conduct these initiation ceremonies. In some instances, when the necessary individuals are present, Ra\u00ebl touches the head of a Ra\u00eblian bishop, who in turn touches that of a Ra\u00eblian priest, who touches the head of the initiate to ensure the \"transmission\". These \"transmissions\" are permitted to take place on one of four days in the year that play a prominent role in the Ra\u00eblian calendar. The first examples took place in April 1976, when Ra\u00ebl carried out the \"transmission\" ceremonies of forty initiates on the Roc Plat.\nThe Ra\u00eblian calendar begins with the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Each year after this date is referred to as \"AH\" or \"apr\u00e8s Hiroshima\" (\"after Hiroshima\"). The Ra\u00eblians celebrate four religious festivals each year, two of which mark Ra\u00ebl's claimed encounters with the Elohim. These are the first Sunday in April, which is the date on which Ra\u00eblians believe the Elohim created the first humans; August 6th, which marks the day of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima in 1945; October 7th, which is the day in which Ra\u00ebl claims that he encountered the Elohim for the second time, in 1974; and December 13th, which is the day that Ra\u00ebl allegedly first encountered the Elohim in 1973.\nSensual meditation.\nA major practice in Ra\u00eblism is \"sensual meditation\", something that Ra\u00ebl outlined in his 1980 book \"La m\u00e9ditation sensuelle\".\nRa\u00eblians are encouraged to take part in this guided meditation or visualisation on a daily basis, with the intent of transmitting love and telepathic links to the Elohim and achieving harmony with infinity. In this, practitioners are often assisted in this meditation through listening to an instruction tape. Sensual meditation sessions also take place communally at the group's monthly meetings, during which the assembled adherents sit or lie on the floor in a dimly lit room. They are then guided through it by a Ra\u00eblian Guide speaking through a microphone; the meditation may be accompanied by New Age music.\nSensual meditation begins with a relaxation exercise known as \"harmonisation avec l'infini\" (\"harmonization with the infinite\"). One stage of this process is \"oxygenation\", which entails deep breathing. Practitioners are taught to relax and then envision themselves expanding their frame of reference until the self becomes only a tiny speck within the universe. They are then tasked with visualising the bones and organs of the body, and ultimately the atoms within the body itself. The guided meditation then encourages the meditators to imagine themselves being on the Elohim's planet and communicating telepathically with these aliens.\nPalmer found that Ra\u00eblians varyingly described a sense of physical well-being, psychic abilities, or sexual arousal during these meditations and interpreted these as evidence that they were in telepathic contact with the Elohim. The goal of sensual meditation is to achieve a \"cosmic orgasm\", which is characterised as the ultimate experience a person can have. Palmer quoted one senior Ra\u00eblian as describing the \"cosmic orgasm\" as \"the sensual experience of the unity between the self and the universe\".\nSeminars.\nThe Ra\u00eblian Church holds week-long summer seminars called \"Stages of Awakening\". These involve daily lectures by Ra\u00ebl, sensual meditation sessions, periods of fasting and feasting, testimonials, and various alternative therapies. Activities that have attracted press attention have included dressing in the clothes of the opposite gender as part of an exercise to play with the fluidity of gender expression, and observing one's own genitals and masturbating.\nRa\u00eblians use these seminars as an opportunity to form friendships or sexual relationships. Attendees wear white togas with name tags. In 1991, a French journalist attended a seminar, and taped couples having sexual intercourse in tents, something which was then much-publicized.\nFollowing these seminars, a second seminar, this time restricted to members of the Structure, takes place.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nClaude Vorilhon was born in Ambert, France, on 30 September 1946. He was the illegitimate son of a 15-year-old mother; his father had been a Sephardi Jew who was then in hiding from the Nazi authorities. Vorilhon later recounted being raised as an atheist by his grandmother and aunt, although for a time he attended a Roman Catholic boarding school. As a teenager, Vorilhon hitch-hiked to Paris, where he pursued a career as a singer, releasing singles under the name \"Claude Celler\". He then married a nurse, and had two children with her. In 1973, he founded the racing car magazine \"Auto Pop\", and also worked as a test-driver for such vehicles. In November of 1973, a new law was introduced in France which banned speeding on the highway, ending his work as a test driver. \"Auto Pop\" ceased publication in September 1974.\nThere had been a range of reported UFO sightings in the 1970s in France, and the ancient astronaut theory was \"very much in vogue\" in the country by the middle of that decade. In early 1974, Vorilhon announced that in December of 1973, he had been contacted by the Elohim while walking along the Puy Lassolas mountain. He began promoting these ideas in interviews on French television and radio. He began lecturing on his alleged experiences in Paris, where he attracted a group of followers, many of which were science-fiction fans or amateur ufologists. In December of 1974, an organisation based upon his ideas, called the Mouvement pour l'accueil des Elohims cr\u00e9ateurs de l'humanit\u00e9 (MADECH; \"Movement for the Welcoming of the Elohim, Creators of Humanity\"), was launched. Vorilhon began referring to himself as \"Ra\u00ebl\". A newsletter, called \"Apocalypse\", began publication in October of 1974. MADECH began raising money for the self-publication of Vorilhon's first book, which appeared as \"Le livre qui dit la verit\u00e9\" that year. Ra\u00eblians treat his first book with reverence, often referring to it simply as \"Le livre\" (\"the book\").\nSome members of MADECH wanted the organisation to take a broader interest in Ufology beyond Ra\u00ebl's own claims, and also desired to restrict his authority within the group. Amid an internal power struggle, Ra\u00ebl called an emergency meeting in April 1975. The feud continued, and in July of that year, he dismissed MADECH's executives, and replaced them with seven of his own supporters. Ra\u00ebl also announced that he had been contacted by the Elohim for a second time, and that on this occasion, they had taken him to visit their planet. He outlined these claims in his 1975 book \"Les Extra-Terrestres M'ont Emmen\u00e9 sur Leur Plan\u00e8te\". Opposition to Ra\u00ebl remained evident in MADECH, and in 1976, he disbanded the group, beginning the Ra\u00eblian Movement as a replacement in February 1976. It operated along a strict hierarchy, with Ra\u00ebl as its director, referred to as the \"Guide of Guides\". Unlike MADECH, it promoted a broader religious structure, including ritual practices. It continued publication of \"Apocalypse\" to spread its message.\nIn 1976, the Ra\u00eblians sent a mission to the Canadian province of Quebec, to attract converts in the Francophone region. The next year, a Quebecois branch of the Movement was established. Ra\u00ebl's first two books were then published in a single English edition, titled \"Space Aliens Took Me to Their Planet\" in 1978, and republished as \"The Message Given To Me By Extra-Terrestrials: They Took Me to their Planet\" in 1986, and in a new translation, as \"The Final Message\" in 1998. He expanded upon his ideas with several additional books: \"Accueiller Les Extra-Terrestes\" in 1979 (translated as \"Let's Welcome Our Fathers from Space\" in 1986), \"La M\u00e9ditation Sensuelle\" in 1980 (translated as \"Sensual Meditation\" in 1986), and \"Geniocracy\".\nLater development.\nIn 1980, the Ra\u00eblians sent a mission to Japan, followed by a mission to Africa in 1982, and then a mission to Australia in 1990. In the early 1980s, the Ra\u00eblian Movement bought a campground near Albi in southern France, which they named Eden. In 1984, Ra\u00ebl underwent a year's retreat in which he avoided public appearance. The following year, his first wife left both him and the movement; he subsequently began a relationship with a Japanese Ra\u00eblian, Lisa Sunagawa, for several years. During the mid-1990s, Ra\u00ebl returned to his hobby of motor racing, competing in rounds two and three of the 1995 Magna Enduro Racing Championship and the 1998 Motorola Cup in Miami before retiring from the sport in 2001. In 1992, a schism appeared in the religion as a group of about forty practitioners were expelled. They formed a rival, smaller group, the Apostles of the Last Days, espousing the belief that Ra\u00ebl had been the original spokesman of the Elohim but had been taken over by Satan.\nIn 1992, the Ra\u00eblian Movement bought 115 hectares near Valcourt in Quebec, naming this property Le Jardin du Proph\u00e8te (\"the Garden of the Prophet\"). It was here in 1997 that the organisation opened UFOLand, a museum about ufology. Its purpose was to raise money for the Elohim Embassy, but in 2001 it closed to the public, having proved financially unviable. It was also during 1997, a month after Ian Wilmut announced the birth of Dolly the Sheep, a successful clone, that Ra\u00ebl established the company Valiant Venture to explore the commercial applications of cloning. Through it came Clonaid, of which the Ra\u00eblian Bishop Brigitte Boisselier was co-founder, director, and spokesperson. The initiation of this group and its promotion of human cloning incited much debate among other religious figures, scientists, and ethicists. Ra\u00ebl and Boisselier both spoke before US President Bill Clinton's Congress hearing on human cloning in March 2001.\nAt the July 1998 training camp in the Jardins des Proph\u00e8tes, Ra\u00ebl announced that in December 1997 he had received another revelation from the Elohim, commanding him to form a new grouping within the Ra\u00eblian Movement, the Order of Ra\u00ebl's Angels. This was to be a secret society, open only to women who would become the consorts of the Elohim after their arrival on Earth. A newsletter, \"Plumes d'Anges\" (Angel Feathers), was issued containing information about the Order. Palmer noted that by emphasizing the unique qualities of women, this group challenged the established Ra\u00eblian doctrine that men and women are wholly equal and interchangeable.\nIn 2001, Ra\u00ebl toured Asia, giving seminars. That year he married for a second time, to a 16-year-old ballet student. Ra\u00eblism discourages marriage, and this instance was done for expediency, because he had been questioned by customs officials when traveling with her across borders. They subsequently divorced but remained a couple. In November 2002, a local man vandalised the group's Jardins des Proph\u00e8tes property, causing significant damage. Ra\u00ebl stated that this had been a preliminary test of \"The Abraham Project\", which is a joint operation between the Central Intelligence Agency and the French intelligence agencies to assassinate him via using schizophrenic people who are directed via mind-control.\nIn December 2002, Boisselier announced that Clonaid's work had resulted in the birth of a baby, named Eve, which she claimed was the world's first human clone. The child was not presented for scrutiny by scientists; the IRM's allegations regarding Baby Eve were never substantiated by the scientific community. Many commentators believed the announcement had been a hoax. In January 2003 the Ra\u00eblians declared that Eve's parents had hidden themselves to evade attention. Baby Eve's appearance gained the Ra\u00eblians much international press coverage, and also much ridicule. The group claimed this publicity generated around 5000 new members. Boisellier announced periodically that further clone infants had been born, in the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, although the press increasingly deemed these hoaxes and stopped attending Ra\u00eblian press conferences.\nIn January 2003, Ra\u00ebl announced Boisellier as his appointed successor, and also published \"The Maitreya\", in which he identified himself with the eponymous figure from Buddhist prophecy. In response to Ra\u00ebl's association with Clonaid, South Korean immigration authorities denied him entry to their country in 2003. The group then protested near South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare that ordered him to leave. Ra\u00ebl appeared alongside a group of women, \"Ra\u00ebl's Girls\", in the October 2004 issue of \"Playboy\". In 2005, two amateur documentary makers, Abdullah Hashem and Joseph McGowen, attended and filmed a Ra\u00eblian seminar in Las Vegas, claiming that they were making a student film. They then used the footage as the basis of a documentary, which they presented as an expos\u00e9 of the group. In 2009, the Church announced plans for a new UFOLand in Las Vegas.\nOrganization and structure.\nThe Ra\u00eblian Movement is a strictly hierarchical organization, in which there are two levels of membership. The majority of members are referred to simply as \"Ra\u00eblians\", whereas the members who are in the higher levels, which control the Movement, are referred to as \"the structure\".\nMember hierarchy.\nThe Structure is divided along a six-tiered system. Ra\u00ebl is at the top of the Ra\u00eblian Church, being referred to as the \"Guide of Guides\". Senior members of the Structure re-elect him to that position each seven years. Below Ra\u00ebl are the \"Bishop Guides\", then the \"Priest Guides\", then the \"Animators\", then the \"Assistant Animators\", and finally the \"Probationers\". Those who are characterized as \"Guides\" are expected to be exemplars for the rest of the movement, for instance by strictly adhering to the avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and recreational drugs. Race, gender, and sexual orientation are no barrier to rising through the ranks of the group's leadership structure. However, Palmer noted that by the mid-1990s, there were few women in leadership positions within the organisation.\nMembers of the Ra\u00eblian structure begin as level 0 \"trainees\" during annual seminars. The Raelian structure was said in 2007 to have about 2,300 members, 170 \"Ra\u00eblian guides\", and 41 bishops.\nThree Ra\u00eblian Bishops sit on a \"Council of the Wise\", which monitors heresy and arranges punishment for transgressors. When they seek to punish an individual, it is usually for a seven-year \"excommunication\". It lasts seven years because Ra\u00eblians believe that it takes this long for every cell in the human body to be replaced. In more severe cases, the council can oversee a \"demarking\", by which they cancel the transmission of the cellular code, believing that this revokes the individual's hope for immortality through cloning.\nMembers pay an annual membership fee to the Ra\u00eblian Movement. Full members of the Movement are encouraged to tithe 10% of their income to the organisation. This tithe is then divided up, with 3% going to the national branch and 7% to the International Movement's central administration. An additional, 1% may go to Ra\u00ebl himself. Tithing is however not enforced. In her research, Palmer found many practitioners who admitted to not paying the tithe. A 1991 survey of Ra\u00eblians found that a third of respondents did not pay, while in an interview, Ra\u00ebl suggested that over 60 percent do not. It is these tithes and membership fees, coupled with the sales of Ra\u00ebl's books, that represent the International Ra\u00eblian Movement's main income. This money is then saved toward the construction of the Elohim Embassy or spent on the production of flyers, books, videos, and other material that is used to disseminate the Ra\u00eblian message.\nThe group initially owned a country estate in Albi, France, before later obtaining one in Valcourt, Quebec.\nOrder of Angels.\nIn 1998, Ra\u00ebl established an internal all-female group, the Order of Ra\u00ebl's Angels, whose members are trained to become the consorts of the Elohim. He stated that these women would be the only humans permitted contact with the Elohim after the latter arrive on Earth. He further claimed that they will serve as the Elohim's liaisons with human politicians, scientists, and journalists. Ra\u00ebl stated that it was only women who could be Angels because men were not feminine enough for the extremely gentle, delicate, and sensitive Elohim. Trans women were permitted entry; Ra\u00ebl praised one transgender member for \"choosing to be a woman\".\nThe Angels are meant to cultivate their feminine and nurturing side. They are tasked with pursuing self-transformation, striving to please the Elohim and to resemble them more closely by cultivating discipline, serenity, harmony, purity, humility, charisma, and both internal and external beauty. The Angels are instructed to regularly pray to the Elohim and regularly meditate. They are encouraged to limit their meat consumption and to avoid carbohydrates and sugar so as to maintain their physical beauty. They have proved useful for the group's public relations and have also provided volunteers for its human cloning experiments. The Order has also engaged in the selling of human ova on the internet, launching a website to do so in 1999. Ra\u00ebl stated that this would help the Angels achieve financial independence.\nThe Order of Ra\u00ebl's Angels has a six-tiered structure, symmetrical with the six-tiered structure of the Ra\u00eblian Movement as a whole. Ra\u00ebl divides the Angels into three groups: the White, Pink, and Golden Ribbon Angels. White Angels wear white feathers on a necklace, can choose human lovers, and are tasked with operating in the world to attract more women into the Ra\u00eblian movement. Pink Angels wear a pink feather on a necklace and are considered by Ra\u00ebl to be the \"Chosen Ones\" who will become the consorts of the Elohim. They are expected to live a sequestered life, initially in the Jardins des Proph\u00e8tes community, and are expected to reserve their sexual activity for the extraterrestrials. The Gold Ribbon Angels are characterised by a gold cord worn around the neck. They are handpicked by Ra\u00ebl for their physical beauty, and are described as being the first humans who will approach the Elohim on the latter's arrival on Earth. The Pink and Gold Ribbon Angels are expected to abstain from sexual activity with most other humans but should receive instruction in alien lovemaking from Ra\u00ebl himself as well as engaging in sexual acts alone or with other Angels.\nThe Order was insulated from the rest of the religion, with the Angels' living quarters for instance being off-limits to non-Angels. Access to the Angels is strictly limited for both journalists and scholars. Gold Ribbon Angels have been demoted from this status as they have aged, on the explanation that as their physical beauty has deteriorated they are no longer suited to greeting the Elohim. These demoted individuals are then tasked with training younger replacements. Other individuals have been deprived of their status as Angels altogether, when they are perceived to have acted in contravention of the group's ethos.\nThe initiation rites include declaring an oath or making a contract in which one agrees to become defender of the Ra\u00eblian ideology and its founder Ra\u00ebl. A few days later, \"Time\" magazine wrote that French chemist Brigitte Boisselier was an Order of Angels member. Around this time, cult specialist Mike Kropveld termed the Order of Angels \"one of the most transparent movements\" he had witnessed, though he was alarmed by the women's promise to defend Ra\u00ebl's life with their own bodies.\nRa\u00ebl has instructed some women members to play a pro-sex feminist role in the Ra\u00eblian Church. \"Rael's Girls\" is another group of women in the religion which are against the suppression of feminine acts of pleasure, including sexual intercourse with men or women. Rael's Girls consists solely of women who work in the sex industry. The women of Rael's Girls say there is not any reason to repent for performing striptease or being a prostitute. This organization was established \"to support the choice of the women who are working in the sex industry\".\nOutreach and advocacy.\nThe International Ra\u00eblian Movement has established various projects through which to promote its ideology.\nIn 1997 it created Clonaid, a company devoted to human cloning. Clients can bank a sample of their DNA with the group, which offers to then produce a single clone of the individual after they die. Another Ra\u00eblian company, Ovulaid, seeks to provide ovaries for individuals and couples who cannot biologically produce their offspring. It expresses its intention to develop technologies that can create \"designer babies\" to the desired specification of their client. An additional project, Insuraclone, is designed to clone organs for an individual in the event of future organ failure, while Clonapet intended to clone people's pets after the latter died.\nThe Ra\u00eblians are known for their socio-political activism, specifically for women's rights, gay rights, opposition to racism, banning nuclear testing, and promoting genetically-modified foods. Throughout the history of Ra\u00eblism, members of the Ra\u00eblian Church have toured public settings advocating masturbation, condoms, and birth control. Through its activities, Palmer stated that the Ra\u00eblian Movement was involved in \"concocting, then carefully monitoring, a mild level of cultural conflict\" to generate publicity for the group, something coupled with \"blatant courtship of the media\". She compared these tactics to those of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan in the 1960s and 1970s. When media has adopted a mocking tone toward the religion, Ra\u00ebl has urged its followers to defend their beliefs, resulting in letter-writing campaigns and sometimes lawsuits.\nIn 1992, the IRM launched protests against the Montreal Catholic School Commission's decision to veto the addition of condom machines to the bathrooms of Roman Catholic high schools in Quebec. The Ra\u00eblians parked a \"condom-mobile\" outside Roman Catholic high schools in Quebec and Ontario from which they dispensed contraceptives to the pupils. In 1993, the Ra\u00eblians organized a conference on masturbation in Quebec, at which speeches were given by Ra\u00ebl and Betty Dodson. Advertising this cause, Ra\u00eblians handed out badges with \"Oui \u00e0 la masturbation (Yes to masturbation)\" on them at the Montreal Jazz Festival.\nIn 2000, the Ra\u00eblians launched NOPEDO, a group to combat paedophilia. In 2001, they publicly distributed leaflets in Italy and Switzerland protesting the existence of over a hundred child molesters among Roman Catholic clergy in France. Geneva's Episcopal vicar sued the Ra\u00eblian Church for libel but the judge dismissed the charges as the Ra\u00eblian accusation was deemed to only target convicted priests and not the Roman Catholic Church as a whole. In 2002, Ra\u00eblians held an anti-clerical parade in Montreal, where they gave high school students Christian crosses and invited the students to both burn them and sign letters of apostasy to the Roman Catholic Church. The Quebec Association of Bishops called this \"incitement to hatred\", and several school boards attempted to prevent their students from meeting Ra\u00eblians.\nThe movement supports genetically-modified foods. In 2003, naked members arranged themselves into the shape of the phrases \"J'aime OGM\" and \"I love GM\" in a Quebec field.\nIn 2006, about 30 Ra\u00eblians, some of them topless, took part in an anti-war demonstration in Seoul, South Korea. In 2003, Ra\u00eblians in white alien costumes bore signs bearing the message \"NO WAR ... ET wants Peace, too!\" to protest the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.\nIn 2009 it launched its \"Adopt a Clitoris\" project to raise money to create a hospital in Africa to reverse damage caused by female genital mutilation (FGM); it has also established Clitoraid, an organization whose mission is to oppose FGM. Another of the groups established by the Ra\u00eblian Church is ARAMIS (Active Raelian Association for Multiplicity In Sexuality), which is the Ra\u00eblian Association of Sexual Minorities and an LGBT rights group.\nSeveral Ra\u00eblian groups in the United States have organized annual protests, claiming that women should have the same legal right to go topless in public that men enjoy without fear of arrest for indecent exposure. Some people have called this a publicity stunt designed to recruit members. Go Topless Day is their annual event, with women protesting topless except for nipple pasties to avoid arrest. It is held near 26 August, the anniversary of Women's Equality Day.\nDemographics.\nEstablished in France, Ra\u00eblism initially spread in Francophone areas of Europe, Africa, and North America. As of the mid-1990s, membership clustered predominantly in France, Quebec, and Japan. Palmer noted that in Canada, Ra\u00eblism had faced difficulty spreading from Quebec and into the country's Anglophone provinces. In 1999, Bozeman said that the Movement had around 35,000 members, while in 2003 Chryssides said it had about 55,000 members worldwide. By the early 2010s, the group was claiming 60,000 members internationally, a number Palmer and Sentes thought was \"probably inflated\". In Britain, the sociologist Eileen Barker said that there were \"only a dozen or so\" committed members of the religion in 1989. By 2001, the sociologist David V. Barrett suggested that there were around 40 to 50 committed members in the country and around 500 sympathisers; two years later, Chryssides thought there were about 40 members and 200 sympathisers in Britain.\nAn internal survey of the group's members in 1988 found that there were almost double as many men as women in the Movement. Similarly, based on her attendance at Ra\u00eblian events in Quebec, Palmer noted that men usually outnumbered women. She observed that many of the men acted in an effeminate fashion, and were often attracted to other men. Palmer also observed several transgender people at the meetings, and found that a significant number of the women present worked as strippers. On these grounds, she suggested that Ra\u00eblism had a particular appeal for \"people who define themselves as sexually marginal\". Palmer also suggested that Ra\u00eblism had an appeal for \"committed atheists who are hopelessly secularized yet suffering from the existential angst of living in a world devoid of order and higher values\".\nConversion.\nRa\u00eblians engage in missionary activities to attract converts. Members buy Ra\u00ebl's books to sell on the street, hoping to recoup their original costs. They often encounter much resistance to their attempts to convert others; Ra\u00ebl explains that this is to be expected, for the Elohim told him that only 4% of humanity is intelligent enough to be receptive to the Ra\u00eblian message. Any Ra\u00eblian found trying to force someone to convert is banned from the organisation for seven years, the period which Ra\u00eblians believe it takes for every cell in the body to be replaced.\nSince 1979, new members of the Ra\u00eblian Movement have been expected to sign an \"Act of Apostasy\", and send a letter of apostasy to any religious organisation that they were previously involved with. They also sign a contract which permits a mortician to cut a piece of bone from their forehead after death, which they understand as the \"Third Eye\". This specimen will be stored in ice at a Swiss facility until the Elohim return, at which time it may be used to clone the deceased individual. This process is known as \"the lifting of the frontal bone\". In addition, people who join are expected to bequeath their assets to the local Ra\u00eblian group, although this is not obligatory.\nSome former Christian clergy-members have joined the Ra\u00eblians, sometimes being swiftly promoted to the level of Priest or Bishop due to the skills that are brought with them from their previous religious organisation. In 2004, for example, Ron Boston, a former bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, joined the Ra\u00eblian Movement, stating that doing so would allow him to embrace his homosexuality.\nReception.\nAccording to sociologist Susan J. Palmer, in society, Ra\u00eblism is \"universally mocked\", and even at conferences of scholars of religion, where individuals are accustomed to studying a diverse range of belief systems, attendees have treated Ra\u00eblian beliefs with \"incredulity or even mirth\". Non-members often regard Ra\u00ebl's claims as a deliberate forgery to fool his followers. An especially critical reception has come from ex-Ra\u00eblians and the anti-cult movement. Jean-Denis Saint-Cyr, a high-ranking member of the Ra\u00eblian movement, for example, accused Ra\u00ebl of plagiarizing the earlier writings of Sendy in creating his religion. Another prominent apostate, namely the Quebecois Erick Lamarche, who calls himself \"Exra\u00ebl\", quit while claiming that too much money was being donated to Ra\u00ebl and the senior members so that they could have luxurious lifestyles. Critics repeatedly drew comparisons between Ra\u00eblism and national-socialism, because of the former's promotion of a governance system wherein people are graded by their intelligence, its emphasis upon genetic engineering, and its use of the swastika.\nRa\u00eblism has undergone academic research from scholars of religion, especially from Palmer, who first encountered the religion in Montreal in 1987. She initially thought that she \"had never encountered an NRM that was so cooperative, that actually liked being studied\". Between 2002 and 2003, Palmer was blacklisted by the group; they banned her from their meetings and told her that she had lost the opportunity to meet the Elohim when they arrive. Palmer then drew upon both her interviews with active members and Ra\u00ebl's publications for her 2004 book on Ra\u00eblism: \"Aliens Adored\".\nPalmer stated that journalists that she had encountered were often \"fishing\" for \"bad things\" to say about the Ra\u00eblians. Many journalists sought to portray Ra\u00ebl as a danger to his followers, akin to David Koresh or Jim Jones, although Palmer thought this to be \"ludicrous\", stating that Ra\u00ebl was \"not prone to violence\". Journalists also sought to present him as someone who sexually exploited his female members, which again Palmer found no evidence for. Following statements that the Order of Ra\u00ebl's Angels would do anything for Ra\u00ebl, there was also press speculation that the group would engage in mass-suicide akin to that of the Order of the Solar Temple. Palmer argued that the Ra\u00eblians lacked the paranoid mentality and demonization of the outside world that had been common to new religious movements that had killed people.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOther"}
{"id": "25916", "revid": "42964511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25916", "title": "Romantic music", "text": "Music of the Romantic period\nRomantic music is a stylistic movement in Western Classical music associated with the period of the 19th century commonly referred to as the Romantic era (or Romantic period). It is closely related to the broader concept of Romanticism\u2014the intellectual, artistic, and literary movement that became prominent in Western culture from about 1798 until 1837.\nRomantic composers sought to create music that was individualistic, emotional, dramatic, and often programmatic; reflecting broader trends within the movements of Romantic literature, poetry, art, and philosophy. Romantic music was often ostensibly inspired by (or else sought to evoke) non-musical stimuli, such as nature, literature, poetry, super-natural elements, or the fine arts. It included features such as increased chromaticism and moved away from traditional forms.\nBackground.\nThe Romantic movement was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the 18th century in Europe and strengthened in reaction to the Industrial Revolution. In part, it was a revolt against social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, literature, and education, and was in turn influenced by developments in natural history.\nOne of the first significant applications of the term to music was in 1789, in the \"M\u00e9moires\" by the Frenchman Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try. It was E. T. A. Hoffmann who established the principles of musical romanticism, in a lengthy review of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony published in 1810, and an 1813 article on Beethoven's instrumental music. In the first of these essays Hoffmann traced the beginnings of musical Romanticism to the later works of Haydn and Mozart.\nIt was Hoffmann's fusion of ideas already associated with the term \"Romantic\", used in opposition to the restraint and formality of Classical models, that elevated music, and especially instrumental music, to a position of pre-eminence in Romanticism as the art most suited to the expression of emotions. It was also through the writings of Hoffmann and other German authors that German music was brought to the center of musical Romanticism.\nTraits.\nThe classical period often used short, even fragmentary, thematic material while the Romantic period tended to make greater use of longer, more fully defined and more emotionally evocative themes.\nCharacteristics often attributed to Romanticism:\nIn music, there is a relatively clear dividing line in musical structure and form following the death of Beethoven. Whether one counts Beethoven as a \"romantic\" composer or not, the breadth and power of his work gave rise to a feeling that the classical sonata form and, indeed, the structure of the symphony, sonata and string quartet had been exhausted.\nTrends of the 19th century.\nNon-musical influences.\nEvents and changes in society such as ideas, attitudes, discoveries, inventions, and historical events often affect music. For example, the Industrial Revolution was in full effect by the late 18th century and early 19th century. This event profoundly affected music: there were major improvements in the mechanical valves and keys that most woodwinds and brass instruments depend on. The new and innovative instruments could be played with greater ease and they were more reliable.\nAnother development that affected music was the rise of the middle class. Composers before this period lived under the patronage of the aristocracy. Many times their audience was small, composed mostly of the upper class and individuals who were knowledgeable about music. The Romantic composers, on the other hand, often wrote for public concerts and festivals, with large audiences of paying customers, who had not necessarily had any music lessons. Composers of the Romantic Era, like Elgar, showed the world that there should be \"no segregation of musical tastes\" and that the \"purpose was to write music that was to be heard\".\n\"The music composed by Romantic [composers]\" reflected \"the importance of the individual\" by being composed in ways that were often less restrictive and more often focused on the composer's skills as a person than prior means of writing music.\nNationalism.\nDuring the Romantic period, music often took on a much more nationalistic purpose. Composers composed with a distinct sound that represented their home country and traditions. For example, Jean Sibelius' \"Finlandia\" has been interpreted to represent the rising nation of Finland, which would someday gain independence from Russian control.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin was one of the first composers to incorporate nationalistic elements into his compositions. Joseph Machlis states, \"Poland's struggle for freedom from tsarist rule aroused the national poet in Poland.\u00a0... Examples of musical nationalism abound in the output of the Romantic era. The folk idiom is prominent in the Mazurkas of Chopin\". His mazurkas and polonaises are particularly notable for their use of nationalistic rhythms. Moreover, \"During World War II the Nazis forbade the playing of\u00a0... Chopin's Polonaises in Warsaw because of the powerful symbolism residing in these works\".\nOther composers, such as Bed\u0159ich Smetana, wrote pieces that musically described their homelands. In particular, Smetana's \"Vltava\" is a symphonic poem about the Moldau River in the modern-day Czech Republic, the second in a cycle of six nationalistic symphonic poems collectively titled \"M\u00e1 vlast\" (My Homeland). Smetana also composed eight nationalist operas, all of which remain in the repertory. They established him as the first Czech nationalist composer as well as the most important Czech opera composer of the generation who came to prominence in the 1860s.\nHistory.\nEarly Romantic.\nThe transition of Viennese classicism to Romanticism can be found in the work of Ludwig van Beethoven. Many typically romantic elements are encountered for the first time in his works. These works stand here in contrast to vocal music and are \"purely\" instrumental music. According to Hoffmann, the pure instrumental music of Viennese classical music, especially that of Beethoven, since it is free of material or program, is the embodiment of the romantic art idea. \nAnother of the most important representatives of late classicism and early romanticism is Franz Schubert. He introduced romantic features into German-language opera, with his chamber music works and later symphonies. In this field, his work is supplemented by the ballads of Carl Loewe. Carl Maria von Weber is important for the development of the German opera, especially with his popular Freisch\u00fctz. There are fantastic-horrious materials by Heinrich Marschner and cheerful opera by Albert Lortzing. Louis Spohr became known mainly for his instrumental music. Still largely attached to classical music is the work of Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Ferdinand Ries, and the Frenchman George Onslow.\nItaly experienced the heyday of the Belcanto opera in early Romanticism, associated with the names of Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Vincenzo Bellini. While Rossini's comic operas are primarily known today, often only through their rousing overtures, Donizetti and Bellini predominate tragic content. The most important Italian instrumental composer of this time was the legendary \"devil's violinist\" Niccol\u00f2 Paganini.\nIn France, light Op\u00e9ra comique developed. Its representatives are Fran\u00e7ois-Adrien Boieldieu, Daniel-Fran\u00e7ois-Esprit Auber, and Adolphe Adam, with Adam known for his ballets. The famous eccentric composer and harpist Robert Nicolas-Charles Bochsa wrote seven operas. The Grand op\u00e9ra came up with pompous stage sets, ballets and large choirs. Her first representative was Gaspare Spontini, her most important Giacomo Meyerbeer.\nOther European countries are represented. The Irishman John Field composed the first Nocturnes for piano. Friedrich Kuhlau worked in Denmark. The Swede Franz Berwald wrote four very idiosyncratic symphonies.\nHigh Romantic.\nThe high romanticism can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, the actual romantic music reaches its peak. The Polish composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin explored previously unknown depths of emotion in his character pieces and dances for piano. Robert Schumann, mentally immersed at the end of his life, represents in person as well as in music almost the prototype of the passionate romantic artist, shadowed by tragedy. His idiosyncratic piano pieces, chamber music works and symphonies should have a lasting influence on the following generation of musicians.\nFranz Liszt, who came from the German minority in Hungary, was on the one hand a swarmed piano virtuoso, but on the other hand also laid the foundation for the progressive \"New German School\" with his harmoniously bold symphonic poems. Also committed to program music was the technique of the id\u00e9e fixe (leitmotif) of the Frenchman Hector Berlioz, who also significantly expanded the orchestra. Felix Mendelssohn was again more oriented towards the classicist formal language and became a role model especially for Scandinavian composers such as the Dane Niels Wilhelm Gade.\nIn opera, the operas of Otto Nicolai and Friedrich von Flotow still dominated in Germany when Richard Wagner wrote his first romantic operas. The early works of Giuseppe Verdi were also still based on the Belcanto ideal of the older generation. In France, the Op\u00e9ra lyrique was developed by Ambroise Thomas and Charles Gounod. Russian music found its own language in the operas of Mikhail Glinka and Alexander Dargomyzhsky.\nThe second phase of high romanticism runs in parallel with the style of realism in literature and the visual arts. In the second half of his creation, Wagner now developed his leitmotif technique, with which he holds together the four-part ring of the Nibelungen, composed without arias; the orchestra is treated symphonically, the chromaticism reaches its extreme in \"Tristan und Isolde\". A whole crowd of disciples is under the influence of Wagner's progressive ideas, among them, for example, Peter Cornelius. \nAn opposition arose from numerous more conservative composers, to whom Johannes Brahms, who sought a logical continuation of classical music in symphony, chamber music and song, became a model of scale due to the depth of the sensation and a masterful composition technique. Among others, Robert Volkmann, Friedrich Kiel, Carl Reinecke, Max Bruch, Josef Gabriel Rheinberger, and Hermann Goetz are included in this party.\nSome important loners came on the scene, among whom Anton Bruckner particularly stands out. Although a Wagner supporter, his clear-form style differs significantly from that of that composer. For example, the block-based instrumentation of Bruckner's symphonies is derived from the registers of the organ. In the ideological struggle against Wagner's adversaries, he was portrayed by his followers as a counterpart of Brahms. Felix Draeseke, who originally wrote \"future music in classical form\" starting from Liszt, also stands between the parties in composition.\nVerdi also reached the way to a well-composed musical drama, in a different way than Wagner. His immense charisma made all other composers fade in Italy, including Amilcare Ponchielli and Arrigo Boito, who was also the librettist of his late operas Otello and Falstaff. In France, the light muse triumphed first in the form of the socio-critical operettas of Jacques Offenbach. Lyrical opera found its climax in the works of Jules Massenet, while in the Carmen by Georges Bizet, realism came for the first time. \nLouis Th\u00e9odore Gouvy built a stylistic bridge to German music. The operas, symphonies and chamber music works of the extremely versatile Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns were, as were the ballets of L\u00e9o Delibes, more tradition-oriented. New orchestra colors were found in the compositions of \u00c9douard Lalo and Emmanuel Chabrier. The Belgian-born C\u00e9sar Franck was accompanied by a revival of organ music, which was continued by Charles-Marie Widor, later Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire.\nA specific national romanticism had by now emerged in almost all European countries. The national Russian current started by Glinka was continued in Russia by the \"Group of Five\": Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and C\u00e9sar Cui. More western oriented were Anton Rubinstein and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, whose ballets and symphonies gained great popularity. Bed\u0159ich Smetana founded Czech national music with his operas and the Symphony poems oriented towards Liszt. \nThe symphonies, concerts and chamber music works of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k have Brahms as a model. In Poland, Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko was the leading opera composer, in Hungary Ferenc Erkel. Norway produced its best-known composers with Edvard Grieg, creator of lyrical piano works, songs and orchestral works such as the Peer-Gynt Suite; England's voice resonated with the Brahms-oriented Hubert Parry and symphonist, as well as the comic operas of Arthur Sullivan.\nLate Romantic.\nIn late Romanticism, also called post-Romanticism, the traditional forms and elements of music are further dissolved. An increasingly colorful orchestral palette, an ever-increasing range of musical means, the spread of tonality to its limits, exaggerated emotions and an increasingly individual tonal language of the individual composer are typical features; the music is led to the threshold of modernity.\nThus, the symphonies of Gustav Mahler reached previously unknown dimensions, partly give up the traditional four-sentence and often contain vocal proportions. \nBehind the monumental facade is the modern expressiveness of the Fin de si\u00e8cle. This psychological expressiveness is also contained in the songs of Hugo Wolf, miniature dramas for voice and piano. More committed to tradition, particularly oriented towards Bruckner, are the symphonies of Franz Schmidt and Richard Wetz. Max Reger resorted to Bach's polyphony in his numerous instrumental works, but developed it harmoniously extremely boldly. \nAmong the numerous composers of the Reger successor, Julius Weismann and Joseph Haas stand out. Among the outstanding late romantic sound creators is the idiosyncratic Hans Pfitzner. Although a traditionalist and decisive opponent of modern currents, quite a few of his works are close to the musical progress of the time. His successor include Walter Braunfels, who mainly emerged as an opera composer, and the symphonist Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler.\nThe opera stage was particularly suitable for increased emotions. The folk and fairy tale operas of Engelbert Humperdinck, Wilhelm Kienzl and Siegfried Wagner, the son of Richard Wagner, were still quite good. Eugen d'Albert and Max von Schillings irritated the nerves with a German variant of verism. \nErotic symbolism can be found in the stage works of Alexander von Zemlinsky and Franz Schreker. Richard Strauss went even further to the limits of tonality with \"Salome\" and \"Elektra\" before he took more traditional paths with \"Der Rosenkavalier\". In the style related to the works of Strauss, the compositions of Emil von Reznicek and Paul Graener are shown.\nIn Italy, opera still dominated the era. This is where verism developed, an exaggerated realism that could easily turn into the striking and melodramatic on the opera stage. Despite their extensive work, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, Francesco Cilea, and Umberto Giordano have only become known through one opera at a time. Only Giacomo Puccini's work has been completely preserved in the repertoire of the opera houses, although he was also often accused of sentimentality. \nDespite some veristic works, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari was mainly considered a revival of the Opera buffa. Ferruccio Busoni, a temporarily defender of modern classicity living in Germany, left behind a rather conventional, little played work. Thus, instrumental music found its place in Italian music again with Ottorino Respighi, who was influenced by Impressionism.\nThe term Impressionism comes from painting, and like there, it also developed in music in France. In the works of Claude Debussy, the structures dissolved into the finest nuances of rhythm, dynamics and timbre. This development was prepared in the work of Vincent d'Indy, Ernest Chausson and above all in the songs and chamber music of Gabriel Faur\u00e9. All subsequent French composers were more or less influenced by Impressionism. The most important among them was Maurice Ravel, a brilliant orchestral virtuoso. \nAlbert Roussel first processed exotic topics before he anticipated Neoclassical tendencies like Ravel. Gabriel Piern\u00e9, Paul Dukas, Charles Koechlin, and Florent Schmitt also dealt with symbolic and exotic-oriental substances. The loner Erik Satie was the creator of spun piano pieces and idol of the next generation. Nevertheless, Impressionism is often attributed to the epoch of modernity, if not seen as its own epoch.\nHubert Parry and the Irishman Charles Villiers Stanford initiated late Romanticism in England, which had its first important representative in Edward Elgar. While he revived the oratorio and wrote symphonies and concerts, Frederick Delius devoted himself to particularly small orchestral images with his own variant of Impressionism. \nEthel Smyth wrote mainly operas and chamber music in a style that reminded Brahms. Ralph Vaughan Williams, whose works were inspired by English folk songs and Renaissance music, became the most important symphonist of his country. Gustav Holst incorporated Greek mythology and Indian philosophy into his work. Very idiosyncratic composer personalities in the transition to modernity were also Havergal Brian and Frank Bridge.\nIn Russia, Alexander Glazunov decorated his traditional composition technique with a colorful orchestral palette. The mystic Alexander Scriabin dreamed of a synthesis of colors, sound and scents. Sergei Rachmaninov wrote melancholic-pathetic piano pieces and concertos full of intoxicating virtuosity, while the piano works of Nikolai Medtner are more lyrical.\nIn the Czech Republic, Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek, deeply rooted in the music of his Moravian homeland, found new areas of expression with the development of the language melody in his operas. The local sounds are also unmistakable in the music of Zden\u011bk Fibich, Josef Bohuslav Foerster, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nov\u00e1k, and Josef Suk. There is a slightly morbid exoticism and later classicist measure in the work of the Polish Karol Szymanowski.\nThe most important Danish composer is Carl Nielsen, known for symphonies and concerts. Even more dominant in his country is the position of the Finn Jean Sibelius, also a symphonist of melancholy expressiveness and clear line design. In Sweden, the works of Wilhelm Peterson-Berger, Wilhelm Stenhammar, and Hugo Alfv\u00e9n show a typical Nordic conservatism, and the Norwegian Christian Sinding also composed traditionally.\nSpanish music increased in popularity again after a long time, first in the piano works of Isaac Alb\u00e9niz and Enrique Granados, then in the operas, ballets and orchestral works of Manuel de Falla, influenced by Impressionism.\nThe first important representatives of the United States also appeared with Edward MacDowell and Amy Beach. The work of Charles Ives belonged only partly to late Romanticism - much of it was already radically modern and pointed far into the 20th century.\nSchools.\nNew German School.\nThe New German School was a loose collection of composers and critics informally led by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner who strove for pushing the limits of chromatic harmony and program music as opposed to absolute music which they believed had reached its limit under Ludwig van Beethoven.\nThis group also pushed for the development and innovation of the symphonic poem, thematic transformation in musical form, and radical changes in tonality and harmony.\nOther important members of this movement includes the critic Richard Pohl and composers Felix Draeseke, Julius Reubke, Karl Klindworth, William Mason, and Peter Cornelius.\nThe German Conservatives.\nThe conservatives were a broad group of musicians and critics who maintained the artistic legacy of Robert Schumann who adhered to composing and promoting absolute music.\nThey believed in continuing along the footsteps of Ludwig van Beethoven of composing the symphony genre in the classical mold, though they would implement their own musical language.\nThe most prominent members of this circle were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, and the Leipzig Conservatoire, which had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn.\nThe Mighty Five.\nThe Mighty Five were a group of Russian composers centered in Saint Petersburg who collaborated with each other from 1856 to 1870 to create a distinctly Russian national style of classical music. They were often at odds with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky who favored a more Western approach to classical composition.\nLed by Mily Balakirev the group's main members also consisted of C\u00e9sar Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin.\nThe Belyayev Circle.\nThe Belyayev circle was a society of Russian musicians who met in Saint Petersburg from 1885 and 1908 who sought to continue the development of the national Russian style of classical music following in the footsteps of the Mighty Five although they were far more tolerant of the Western compositional style of Tchaikovsky.\nThis group was founded by Russian music publisher philanthropist Mitrofan Belyayev. The two most important composers of this group were Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. Members also included Vladimir Stasov, Anatoly Lyadov, Alexander Ossovsky, Witold Maliszewski, Nikolai Tcherepnin, Nikolay Sokolov, and Alexander Winkler.\nTransition to Modernism.\nDuring the later half of the 19th Century, some prominent composers began exploring the limits of the traditional tonal system. Important examples include Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner and Bagatelle sans tonalit\u00e9 by Franz Liszt. This limit was finally reached during the Late Romantic period where progressive tonality is demonstrated in the works of composers such as Gustav Mahler, and the early works of Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern. With these developments, Romanticism finally began to break apart into several new parallel movements forming in response, bringing way to Modernism.\nSome notable movements to form in response to Romanticism's collapse include Expressionism with Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School being its main promoters and Primitivism with Igor Stravinsky being its most influential composer.\nGenres.\nSymphony.\nCarried to the highest degree by Ludwig van Beethoven, the symphony becomes the most prestigious form to which many composers devote themselves. The most conservative respect to the Beethovenian model includes composers such as Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and Johannes Brahms. Others show an imagination that makes them go beyond this framework, in form or in the spirit: the most daring of them being Hector Berlioz.\nFinally, some will also tell a story throughout their symphonies; like Franz Liszt, they will create the symphonic poem, a new musical genre, usually composed of a single movement and inspired by a theme, character or literary text. Since the symphonic poem is articulated around a leitmotiv (musical motif to identify a character, the hero for example), it is to be compared to music with a symphonic program.\nLied.\nThis musical genre appeared with the evolution from pianoforte to piano during the romantic period. The lied is vocal music most often accompanied by this instrument. The singing is taken from romantic poems and this style makes it possible to bring the voice as close to feelings as possible. One of the first and most famous lieder composers is Franz Schubert, with Erlk\u00f6nig, however, many other romantic composers have devoted themselves to the lied genre such as Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Duparc, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Gustav Mahler, and Richard Strauss.\nConcerto.\nIt is Beethoven who inaugurates the romantic concerto, with his five piano concertos (especially the fifth) and his violin concerto where many characteristics of classicism can still be recognized. His example is followed by many composers: the concerto rivals the symphony in the repertoire of major orchestral formations.\nFinally, the concerto will allow instrumentalist composers to reveal their virtuosity, such as Niccol\u00f2 Paganini on the violin, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Robert Schumann, and Franz Liszt on the piano.\nRhapsody.\nA rhapsody in music is a one-movement work that is episodic yet integrated, free-flowing in structure, featuring a range of highly contrasted moods, colour, and tonality. An air of spontaneous inspiration and a sense of improvisation make it freer in form than a set of variations.\nNocturne.\nThe nocturne is presented as a short-lived confidential piece, which the Irish composer John Field was one of the first to cultivate. Immersed in the climate of the night, an atmosphere privileged by romantics, it is often of ABA structure, with a very flexible and ornate melody, accompanied by a left hand with undulating arpeggios. The tempo is usually slow, and the central part is often more agitated.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin has set the most famous form of the nocturnes. He wrote 21, from 1827 to 1846. First published in series of three (opus 9 and 15), they are then grouped in pairs (opus 27, 32, 37, 48, 55, 62).\nBallet.\nThe Romantic ballet was developed throughout the 19th century, especially by composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in Russia and L\u00e9o Delibes in France.\nOpera.\nFrance.\nDuring the 19th century, romanticism took a hold of opera and it was Paris that became one of its main centers. Most romantic operas were composed by composers living in France, such as Luigi Cherubini, Gaspare Spontini, Fran\u00e7ois-Adrien Boieldieu, and Daniel-Fran\u00e7ois-Esprit Auber. The apogee of the style of great operas is marked by the works of Giacomo Meyerbeer. Hector Berlioz's Les Troyens was first ignored, Benvenuto Cellini is consputed during the premiere, while Charles Gounod's Faust is one of the most popular French operas of the mid-19th century.\nDuring the second part of the 19th century, Georges Bizet will revolutionize opera with Carmen: \"local color based on the use of Spanish songs and dances\" according to Nietzsche, it is \"a ray of Mediterranean light dissipating the fog of the Wagnerian ideal\". Interest in \"local color\" works is confirmed with Lakm\u00e9 by L\u00e9o Delibes, and Samson and Dalila by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. The most productive French composer of operas of the last part of the century was Jules Massenet composing works such as Manon, Werther, and Tha\u00efs.\nJacques Offenbach, who composed Les Contes d'Hoffmann, established himself as the master of French opera-comique of the 19th century, inventing a new genre, the French op\u00e9ra bouffe, which later was confused with the operetta.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, romanticism in France was gradually abandoned in favor of other currents such as Impressionism or symbolism, carried in particular by Claude Debussy's \"Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande\" (1902).\nGermany.\nCarl Maria von Weber, with Der Freisch\u00fctz (1821) creates the first German romantic opera; the first important opera being Beethoven's Fidelio (1805), the only operatic work of this composer.\nRichard Wagner, from the Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder, introduces the leitmotiv and the \"cyclical melody\" process. He revolutionizes opera by duration and instrumental power. His major work, Tetralogy is one of the summits of German opera. He creates the \"musical drama\" in which the orchestra now becomes the protagonist in the same way as the characters. In 1876, the Bayreuth Festival was created dedicated to the exclusive representation of Wagner's works.\nWagner's influence continues in virtually all operas, even in H\u00e4nsel und Gretel by Engelbert Humperdinck. The dominant figure is then Richard Strauss, who uses orchestration and vocal techniques similar to those of Wagner in \"Salome\" and \"Elektra\" while developing his own path. \"Der Rosenkavalier\" is the work of Strauss that had the most flamboyant success at the time.\nItaly.\nItalian romanticism begins with Gioachino Rossini who composed works such as The Barber of Seville and La Cenerentola. He created the \"bel canto\" style, a style adopted by his contemporaries Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti.\nHowever, the face of Italian opera is Giuseppe Verdi whose Nabucco's slave choir is a very important hymn to all of Italy. The trilogy formed by Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata are among his major works but he reaches the peak of his art with Otello and Falstaff at the end of his career. He has infuled his works with unparalleled dramatic vigour and rhythmic vitality.\nIn the second part of the 19th century, Giacomo Puccini, Verdi's undisputed successor, transcends realism into verism. La Boh\u00e8me, Tosca, Madame Butterfly, and Turandot are melodic operas loaded with emotion.\nOther countries.\nOther works of national inspiration:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Flow, gradient, constriction, and obstacles are four factors that are needed for a rapid to be created.\nPhysical factors.\nRapids are hydrological features between a \"run\" (a smoothly flowing part of a stream) and a \"cascade\". Rapids are characterized by the river becoming shallower with some rocks exposed above the flow surface. As flowing water splashes over and around the rocks, air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white color, forming what is called \"whitewater\". Rapids occur where the bed material is highly resistant to the erosive power of the stream in comparison with the bed downstream of the rapids. Very young streams flowing across solid rock may be rapids for much of their length. Rapids cause water aeration of the stream or river, resulting in better water quality.\nFor a rapid to form, a necessary condition is the presence of a gradient, which refers to the river or stream's downward slope. When a river has a larger gradient, the water flows downhill faster. Gradients are typically measured in feet per mile. This impacts the river's flow or discharge, which is measured as a volume of water per unit of time. The faster the water flows, the more likely a rapid will form.\nRapids typically form due to differential erosion in the sloping strata forming the streambed in presence of a gradient, the softer rocks erode away faster whereas the harder rocks persist resulting in an uneven streambed.\nThe safety of a section of river is measured by classes or levels, generally running from I to VI on basis of how navigable the rapids are. A Class 5 rapid may be categorized as Class 5.1-5.9. While Class I rapids are easy to navigate and require little maneuvering, Class VI rapids pose threat to life with little or no chance for rescue, often classified as 'U' for Unraftable. River rafting sports are carried out where many rapids are present in the course.\nConstriction refers to when rivers flow through narrower channels, thus increasing the velocity of the water. This may also lead to the creation of obstructions due to sediment transportation and erosion. Obstacles may occur by human activity, natural landslides and earthquakes, or accumulation of sediment or debris. The more prominent these four factors are present in a river, the more likely that river is to be a rapid river.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after physicist Ernest Rutherford. As a synthetic element, it is not found in nature and can only be made in a particle accelerator. It is radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 267Rf, has a half-life of about 48 minutes.\nIn the periodic table, it is a d-block element and the second of the fourth-row transition elements. It is in period 7 and is a group 4 element. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homolog to hafnium in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly. They compare well with the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.\nIn the 1960s, small amounts of rutherfordium were produced at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. Priority of discovery and hence the name of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as the official name of the element.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nRutherfordium was reportedly first detected in 1964 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (Soviet Union at the time). Researchers there bombarded a plutonium-242 target with neon-22 ions; a spontaneous fission activity with half-life 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0seconds was detected and assigned to 260104. Later work found no isotope of element 104 with this half-life, so that this assignment must be considered incorrect.\nIn 1966\u20131969, the experiment was repeated. This time, the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with ZrCl4. The team identified spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-hafnium properties.\nPu + Ne \u2192 264\u2212\"x\"104 \u2192 264\u2212\"x\"104Cl4\nThe researchers considered the results to support the 0.3\u00a0second half-life. Although it is now known that there is no isotope of element 104 with such a half-life, the chemistry does fit that of element 104, as chloride volatility is much greater in group 4 than in group 3 (or the actinides).\nIn 1969, researchers at University of California, Berkeley conclusively synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with carbon-12 ions and measured the alpha decay of 257104, correlated with the daughter decay of nobelium-253:\nCf + C \u2192 257104 + 4 \nThey were unable to confirm the 0.3-second half-life for 260104, and instead found a 10\u201330 millisecond half-life for this isotope, agreeing with the modern value of 21 milliseconds. In 1970, the American team chemically identified element 104 using the ion-exchange separation method, proving it to be a group 4 element and the heavier homologue of hafnium.\nThe American synthesis was independently confirmed in 1973 and secured the identification of rutherfordium as the parent by the observation of K-alpha X-rays in the elemental signature of the 257104 decay product, nobelium-253.\nNaming controversy.\nAs a consequence of the initial competing claims of discovery, an element naming controversy arose. Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name \"kurchatovium\" (Ku) in honor of Igor Kurchatov (1903\u20131960), former head of Soviet nuclear research. This name had been used in books of the Soviet Bloc as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed \"rutherfordium\" (Rf) for the new element to honor New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford, who is known as the \"father\" of nuclear physics. In 1992, the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element 104 in 1969, and that credit should be shared between the two groups. In particular, this involved the TWG performing a new retrospective reanalysis of the Russian work in the face of the later-discovered fact that there is no 0.3-second isotope of element 104: they reinterpreted the Dubna results as having been caused by a spontaneous fission branch of 259104.\nThe American group wrote a scathing response to the findings of the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians, considered the TWG's retrospective treatment of the Russian work based on unpublished documents to have been \"highly irregular\", noted that there was no proof that 259104 had a spontaneous fission branch at all (as of 2021 there still is not), and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that this was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery.\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted \"unnilquadium\" (Unq) as a temporary, systematic element name, derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested a set of names for elements 104 through 109, in which \"dubnium\" (Db) became element 104 and \"rutherfordium\" became element 106. This recommendation was criticized by the American scientists for several reasons. Firstly, their suggestions were scrambled: the names \"rutherfordium\" and \"hahnium\", originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were respectively reassigned to elements 106 and 108. Secondly, elements 104 and 105 were given names favored by JINR, despite earlier recognition of LBL as an equal co-discoverer for both of them. Thirdly and most importantly, IUPAC rejected the name \"seaborgium\" for element 106, having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person, even though the IUPAC had given the LBNL team the sole credit for its discovery. In 1997, IUPAC renamed elements 104 to 109, and gave elements 104 and 106 the Berkeley proposals \"rutherfordium\" and \"seaborgium\". The name \"dubnium\" was given to element 105 at the same time. The 1997 names were accepted by researchers and became the standard.\nIsotopes.\nRutherfordium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Seventeen different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 252 to 270 (with the exceptions of 264 and 269). Most of these decay predominantly through spontaneous fission, particularly isotopes with even neutron numbers, while some of the lighter isotopes with odd neutron numbers also have significant alpha decay branches. \nStability and half-lives.\nOut of isotopes whose half-lives are known, the lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives. The three lightest known isotopes have half-lives of under 50\u00a0\u03bcs, with the lightest reported isotope 252Rf having a half-life shorter than one microsecond. The isotopes 256Rf, 258Rf, 260Rf are more stable at around 10\u00a0ms; 255Rf, 257Rf, 259Rf, and 262Rf live between 1 and 5 seconds; and 261Rf, 265Rf, and 263Rf are more stable, at around 1.1, 1.5, and 10 minutes respectively. The most stable known isotope, 267Rf, is one of the heaviest, and has a half-life of about 48 minutes. Rutherfordium isotopes with an odd neutron number tend to have longer half-lives than their even\u2013even neighbors because the odd neutron provides additional hindrance against spontaneous fission.\nThe lightest isotopes were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been reported as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission. It seems likely that the same is true for 270Rf, a possible daughter of 270Db. These three isotopes remain unconfirmed.\nIn 1999, American scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Og. These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted seven alpha particles to form 265Rf nuclei, but their claim was retracted in 2001. This isotope was later discovered in 2010 as the final product in the decay chain of 285Fl.\nPredicted properties.\nVery few properties of rutherfordium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that rutherfordium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemistry-related properties have been measured, but properties of rutherfordium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.\nChemical.\nRutherfordium is the first transactinide element and the second member of the 6d series of transition metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of hafnium and very different from that of lead. Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium's basic properties will resemble those of other group 4 elements, below titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state. In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state. The standard reduction potential of the Rf4+/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than \u22121.7\u00a0V.\nInitial predictions of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves like the rest of the group 4 elements. Later it was shown in ab initio calculations with the high level of accuracy that the Rf atom has the ground state with the 6d2 7s2 valence configuration and the low-lying excited 6d1 7s2 7p1 state with the excitation energy of only 0.3\u20130.5 eV.\nIn an analogous manner to zirconium and hafnium, rutherfordium is projected to form a very stable, refractory oxide, RfO2. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX4, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX2. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.\nIn the aqueous phase, the Rf4+ ion hydrolyzes less than titanium(IV) and to a similar extent as zirconium and hafnium, thus resulting in the RfO2+ ion. Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions. The use of chloride and bromide ions produces the hexahalide complexes RfCl62- and RfBr62-. For the fluoride complexes, zirconium and hafnium tend to form hepta- and octa- complexes. Thus, for the larger rutherfordium ion, the complexes RfF62-, RfF73- and RfF84- are possible.\nPhysical and atomic.\n&lt;section begin=properties /&gt;\nRutherfordium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and have a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (\"c\"/\"a\"\u00a0=\u00a01.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a metal with density ~17\u00a0g/cm3. The atomic radius of rutherfordium is expected to be ~150\u00a0pm. Due to relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologs. When under high pressure (variously calculated as 72 or ~50 GPa), rutherfordium is expected to transition to body-centered cubic crystal structure; hafnium transforms to this structure at 71\u00b11\u00a0GPa, but has an intermediate \u03c9 structure that it transforms to at 38\u00b18\u00a0GPa that should be lacking for rutherfordium.&lt;section end=properties /&gt;\nExperimental chemistry.\nGas phase.\nEarly work on the study of the chemistry of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies, though the long-lived isotope 267Rf (produced in the decay chain of 291Lv, 287Fl, and 283Cn) may be advantageous for future experiments. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would be a 6d element in group 4 and should therefore form a volatile molecular tetrachloride, that would be tetrahedral in shape. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.\nA series of experiments confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as a typical member of group 4, forming a tetravalent chloride (RfCl4) and bromide (RfBr4) as well as an oxychloride (RfOCl2). A decreased volatility was observed for RfCl4 when potassium chloride is provided as the solid phase instead of gas, highly indicative of the formation of nonvolatile K2RfCl6 mixed salt.\nAqueous phase.\nRutherfordium is expected to have the electron configuration [Rn]5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.\nThe most conclusive aqueous chemistry studies of rutherfordium have been performed by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the isotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium, as well as the pseudo-group 4 element thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, in a manner similar to hafnium and zirconium.\n261mRf4+ + 6 Cl- \u2192 [261mRfCl6]2-\nVery similar results were observed in hydrofluoric acid solutions. Differences in the extraction curves were interpreted as a weaker affinity for fluoride ion and the formation of the hexafluororutherfordate ion, whereas hafnium and zirconium ions complex seven or eight fluoride ions at the concentrations used:\n261mRf4+ + 6 F- \u2192 [261mRfF6]2-\nExperiments performed in mixed sulfuric and nitric acid solutions shows that rutherfordium has a much weaker affinity towards forming sulfate complexes than hafnium. This result is in agreement with predictions, which expect rutherfordium complexes to be less stable than those of zirconium and hafnium because of a smaller ionic contribution to the bonding. This arises because rutherfordium has a larger ionic radius (76\u00a0pm) than zirconium (71\u00a0pm) and hafnium (72\u00a0pm), and also because of relativistic stabilisation of the 7s orbital and destabilisation and spin\u2013orbit splitting of the 6d orbitals.\nCoprecipitation experiments performed in 2021 studied rutherfordium's behaviour in basic solution containing ammonia or sodium hydroxide, using zirconium, hafnium, and thorium as comparisons. It was found that rutherfordium does not strongly coordinate with ammonia and instead coprecipitates out as a hydroxide, which is probably Rf(OH)4.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His contributions were instrumental in the development of Copernican heliocentrism in the decades following his death.\nRegiomontanus wrote under the Latinized name of \"Ioannes de Monteregio\" (or \"Monte Regio\"; \"Regio Monte\"); the toponym \"Regiomontanus\" was first used by Philipp Melanchthon in 1534. He is named after K\u00f6nigsberg in Lower Franconia, not the larger K\u00f6nigsberg (modern Kaliningrad) in Prussia.\nLife.\nAlthough little is known of Regiomontanus' early life, it is believed that at eleven years of age, he became a student at the University of Leipzig, Saxony. In 1451 he continued his studies at Alma Mater Rudolfina, the university in Vienna, in the Duchy of Austria, where he became a pupil and friend of Georg von Peuerbach. In 1452 he was awarded his bachelor's degree (\"baccalaureus\"), and he was awarded his master's degree (\"magister artium\") at the age of 21 in 1457. He lectured in optics and ancient literature.\nIn 1460 the papal legate Basilios Bessarion came to Vienna on a diplomatic mission. Being a humanist scholar with a great interest in the mathematical sciences, Bessarion sought out Peuerbach's company. George of Trebizond who was Bessarion's philosophical rival had recently produced a new Latin translation of Ptolemy's \"Almagest\" from the Greek, which Bessarion, correctly, regarded as inaccurate and badly translated, so he asked Peuerbach to produce a new one. Peuerbach's Greek was not good enough to do a translation but he knew the \"Almagest\" intimately so instead he started work on a modernised, improved abridgement of the work. Bessarion also invited Peuerbach to become part of his household and to accompany him back to Italy when his work in Vienna was finished. Peuerbach accepted the invitation on the condition that Regiomontanus could also accompany them. However Peuerbach fell ill in 1461 and died having completed only the first six books of his abridgement of the \"Almagest\". On his death bed Peuerbach made Regiomontanus promise to finish the book and publish it.\nIn 1461 Regiomontanus left Vienna with Bessarion and spent the next four years travelling around Northern Italy as a member of Bessarion's household, looking for and copying mathematical and astronomical manuscripts for Bessarion, who possessed the largest private library in Europe at the time. Regiomontanus also made the acquaintance of the leading Italian mathematicians of the age such as Giovanni Bianchini and Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli who had also been friends of Peuerbach during his prolonged stay in Italy more than twenty years earlier.\nIn 1467, he went to work for J\u00e1nos Vit\u00e9z, archbishop of Esztergom. There he calculated extensive astronomical tables and built astronomical instruments. Next he went to Buda, and the court of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, for whom he built an astrolabe, and where he collated Greek manuscripts for a handsome salary. The trigonometric tables that he created while living in Hungary, his \"Tabulae directionum profectionumque\" (printed posthum., 1490), were designed for astrology, including finding astrological houses. The \"Tabulae\" also contained several tangent tables.\nIn 1471 Regiomontanus moved to the Free City of Nuremberg, in Franconia, then one of the Empire's important seats of learning, publication, commerce and art, where he worked with the humanist and merchant Bernhard Walther. Here he founded the world's first scientific printing press, and in 1472 he published the first printed astronomical textbook, the \"Theoricae novae Planetarum\" of his teacher Georg von Peurbach.\nRegiomontanus and Bernhard Walther observed the comet of 1472. Regiomontanus tried to estimate its distance from Earth, using the angle of parallax. According to David A. Seargeant:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In agreement with the prevailing Aristotelian theory on comets as atmospheric phenomena, he estimated its distance to be at least 8,200 miles (13,120 km) and, from this, estimated the central condensation as 26, and the entire coma as 81 miles (41.6 and 129.6 km respectively) in diameter. These values, of course, fail by orders of magnitude, but he is to be commended for this attempt at determining the physical dimensions of the comet.\nThe 1472 comet was visible from Christmas Day 1471 to 1 March 1472 (Julian Calendar), a total of 59 days.\nIn 1475, Regiomontanus was called to Rome by Pope Sixtus IV on to work on the planned calendar reform. Sixtus promised substantial rewards, including the title of bishop of Regensburg, but it is unlikely that he was actually appointed to the role.\nOn his way to Rome, stopping in Venice, he commissioned the publication of his \"Calendarium\" with Erhard Ratdolt (printed in 1476). Regiomontanus reached Rome, but he died there after only a few months, in his 41st year, on 6 July 1476. According to a rumor repeated by Gassendi in his Regiomontanus biography, he was poisoned by relatives of George of Trebizond whom he had criticized in his writing; it is however considered more likely that he died from the plague.\nWork.\nDuring his time in Italy he completed Peuerbach's abridgement of \"Almagest\", \"Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei\". In 1464, he completed \"De triangulis omnimodis\" (\"On Triangles of All Kinds\"). \"De triangulis omnimodis\" was one of the first textbooks presenting the current state of trigonometry and included lists of questions for review of individual chapters. In it he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You who wish to study great and wonderful things, who wonder about the movement of the stars, must read these theorems about triangles. Knowing these ideas will open the door to all of astronomy and to certain geometric problems.\nIn 1465, he built a portable sundial for Pope Paul II.\nIn \"Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei\", he critiqued the translation of \"Almagest\" by George of Trebizond, pointing out inaccuracies. Later Nicolaus Copernicus would refer to this book as an influence on his own work.\nA prolific author, Regiomontanus was internationally famous in his lifetime. Despite having completed only a quarter of what he had intended to write, he left a substantial body of work. Nicolaus Copernicus' teacher, Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara, referred to Regiomontanus as having been his own teacher. There is speculation that Regiomontanus had arrived at a theory of heliocentrism before he died; a manuscript shows particular attention to the heliocentric theory of the Pythagorean Aristarchus, mention was also given to the motion of the earth in a letter to a friend.\nMuch of the material on spherical trigonometry in Regiomontanus' \"On Triangles\" was taken directly from the twelfth-century work of Jabir ibn Aflah otherwise known as Geber, as noted in the sixteenth century by Gerolamo Cardano.\nLegacy.\nSimon Stevin, in his book describing decimal representation of fractions (De Thiende), cites the trigonometric tables of Regiomontanus as suggestive of positional notation.\nRegiomontanus designed his own astrological house system, which became one of the most popular systems in Europe.\nIn 1561, Daniel Santbech compiled a collected edition of the works of Regiomontanus, \"De triangulis planis et sphaericis libri quinque\" (first published in 1533) and \"Compositio tabularum sinum recto\", as well as Santbech's own \"Problematum astronomicorum et geometricorum sectiones septem\".

{"id": "25932", "revid": "48348951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25932", "title": "Two-round system", "text": "Voting system\nThe two-round system (TRS or 2RS), sometimes called ballotage, top-two runoff, or two-round plurality, is a single-winner electoral system which aims to elect a member who has support of the majority of voters. The two-round system involves two rounds of choose-one voting, where the voter marks a single favorite candidate in each round. The two candidates with the most votes in the first round move on to a second election (a second round of voting). The two-round system is in the family of plurality voting systems that also includes single-round plurality (FPP). Like instant-runoff (ranked-choice) voting and first past the post, it elects one winner. \nThe two-round system first emerged in France and has since become the most common single-winner electoral system worldwide. Despite this, runoff-based rules like the two-round system and RCV have faced criticism from social choice theorists as a result of their susceptibility to center squeeze (a kind of spoiler effect favoring extremists) and the no-show paradox. This has led to the rise of electoral reform movements which seek to replace the two-round system with other systems like rated voting, particularly in France. \nAs well, TRS means voters sometimes have to gather to vote a second time, and sometimes the intervening period of time is rife with discord.\nIn the United States, the first round is often called a jungle or top-two primary. Georgia, Louisiana, California, and Washington use the two-round system for all non-presidential elections. Mississippi uses it for state offices. Most other states use a partisan primary system that is often described as behaving like a two-round system in practice, with primaries narrowing down the field to two frontrunners. (Alaska and Maine use the Instant-runoff voting system, a single-winner ranked-choice voting (RCV) system, which, unlike TRS, does not require voters to engage in multiple rounds of voting.)\nOrigins.\nThe French system of ballotage was first established as part of the reforms of the July Monarchy, with the term appearing in the Organic Decree of 2 February 1832 of the French government, which mandated a second-round election \"when none of the candidates obtains an absolute majority\". The rule has since gained substantial popularity in South America, Eastern Europe, and Africa, where it is now the dominant system.\nSome variants of the two-round system use slightly different rules for eliminating candidates before the second round, allowing more than two candidates to proceed to the second round in some cases. Under such systems, in the second round it is sufficient for a candidate to receive a plurality of votes (more votes than anyone else), not necessarily a majority, to be elected.\nExample.\n2002 French presidential election.\nIn the 2002 French presidential election, the two contenders described by the media as possible winners were Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin, who represented the largest two political parties in France at the time. However, 16 candidates were on the ballot, including Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement (5.33%) and Christiane Taubira (2.32%) from the Plural Left coalition of Jospin, who refused by excess of confidence to dissuade them.\nWith the left vote divided among a number of candidates, a third contender, Jean-Marie Le Pen, unexpectedly obtained slightly more than Jospin in the first round:\nThe other candidates received smaller percentages on the first round.\nBecause no candidate had obtained an absolute majority of the votes in the first round, the top two candidates went into the second round. Most supporters of the parties which did not get through to the second round (and Chirac's supporters) voted for Chirac, who won with a very large majority:\nDespite the controversy over Jospin's early elimination, polls showed Chirac was preferred to Jospin by a majority of voters and that Chirac was the majority-preferred candidate, meaning the election was not spoiled.\n2024 French legislative election.\nFrench legislative elections allow more than two candidates to advance to the second round, leading to many triangular elections, such as in the 2024 French legislative election. It is common for all but two candidates to withdraw from the second round (so they don't spoil the chances of another similar candidate) which makes the result similar to top-two two-round systems.\nVariants.\nTwo-party runoff vote.\nA two-party vote is used for elections to the Bhutanese National Assembly, where the first round selects two parties that are allowed to compete in the second round. Then, a second round is held using single-member districts with first-past-the-post.\nTop-two primaries.\nIn the United States, a two-round system called the jungle primary and used in Louisiana in place of traditional primary elections to choose each party's candidate. In this state, the first round is held on Election Day with runoffs occurring soon after.\nWashington adopted a two-round system in a 2008 referendum, called the nonpartisan blanket primary or top-two primary. California approved the system in 2010, which was first used for the 36th congressional district special election in February 2011. The first election (the primary) is held \"before\" the general election in November and the top two candidates enter the general election. The general election is always held, even if a candidate gets over 50%.\nGeorgia can have a second round after Election Day if the winner of the first round does not get more than 50%. However normal partisan primaries are used so it is rare to have more than 2 competitive candidates in the first round.\nExhaustive ballot.\nThe exhaustive ballot (EB) is similar to the two-round system, but involves more rounds of voting rather than just two. If no candidate receives an absolute majority in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. This continues until one candidate has an absolute majority. Because voters may have to cast votes several times, EB is not used in large-scale public elections. Instead it is used in smaller contests such as the election of the presiding officer of an assembly; one long-standing example of its use is in the United Kingdom, where local associations (LCAs) of the Conservative Party use EB to elect their prospective parliamentary candidates (PPCs). Exhaustive ballot is also used by FIFA and the International Olympic Committee to select hosts.\nContingent vote.\nThe \"contingent\" or \"supplementary\" vote is a variant of instant-runoff voting (IRV) that has been used in Queensland and is used in the United Kingdom to elect mayors. Like IRV, voters vote once and rank candidates. Unlike IRV, contingent voting election system involves only two rounds of counting at most. After the first round of counting all but the two candidates with most votes are eliminated, with their votes transferred. With only two candidates progressing on to the second round of counting, one candidate achieves a majority in the second round and wins. The contingent vote tends to elect the same candidate that the two-round system and instant-runoff voting system do.\nInstant-runoff voting.\nInstant-runoff voting (IRV), like the exhaustive ballot, involves multiple reiterative counts in which the candidate with fewest votes is eliminated each time. Whilst the exhaustive ballot and the two-round system both involve voters casting a separate vote in each round, under instant-runoff, voters vote only once. This is possible because, rather than voting for only a single candidate, the voter ranks all of the candidates in order of preference. These preferences are then used to transfer the votes of those whose first preference has been eliminated during the course of the count. Because the two-round system and the exhaustive ballot involve separate rounds of voting, voters can use the results of one round to decide how they will vote in the next, whereas this is not possible under IRV. Because it is necessary to vote only once, IRV is used for elections in many places. For such as Australian general and state elections (called \"preferential voting\"). In the United States, it is known as ranked-choice voting and is used in a growing number of states and localities.\nIn Ireland it is known as the single transferable vote (STV) and is used for presidential elections and parliamentary by-elections. STV as applied in multi-member districts is a proportional voting system, not a majoritarian one; and candidates need only achieve a quota (or the highest remaining fraction of a quota), to be elected. Multi-winner STV is used in Northern Ireland, Malta, the Australian senate and various other jurisdictions in Australia. STV is often used for municipal elections in lieu of more party-based forms of proportional representation.\nCompliance with voting method criteria.\nMost of the mathematical criteria by which voting methods are compared were formulated for voters with ordinal preferences. Some methods, like approval voting, request information than cannot be unambiguously inferred from a single set of ordinal preferences. The two-round system is such a method, because the voters are not forced to vote according to a single ordinal preference in both rounds.\nIf the voters determine their preferences before the election and always vote directly consistent to them, they will emulate the contingent vote and get the same results as if they were to use that method. Therefore, in that model of voting behavior, the two-round system passes all criteria that the contingent vote passes, and fails all criteria the contingent vote fails.\nSince the voters in the two-round system do not have to choose their second round votes while voting in the first round, they are able to adjust their votes as players in a game. More complex models consider voter behavior when the voters reach a game-theoretical equilibrium from which they have no incentive, as defined by their internal preferences, to further change their behavior. However, because these equilibria are complex, only partial results are known. With respect to the voters' internal preferences, the two-round system passes the majority criterion in this model, as a majority can always coordinate to elect their preferred candidate. Also, in the case of three candidates or less and a robust political equilibrium, the two-round system will pick the Condorcet winner whenever there is one, which is not the case in the contingent vote model.\nThe equilibrium mentioned above is a perfect-information equilibrium and so only strictly holds in idealized conditions where every voter knows every other voter's preference. Thus it provides an upper bound on what can be achieved with rational (self-interested) coordination or knowledge of others' preferences. Since the voters almost surely will not have perfect information, it may not apply to real elections. In that matter, it is similar to the perfect competition model sometimes used in economics. To the extent that real elections approach this upper bound, large elections would do so less so than small ones, because it is less likely that a large electorate has information about all the other voters than that a small electorate has.\nTactical voting and strategic nomination.\nThe two-round system is intended to reduce tactical voting. Under the single-winner plurality voting election system (also known as first past the post), Vote splitting can occur and the choice of just a minority of voters can be elected. Voters who favor less-popular candidates are encouraged to vote tactically, or \"compromise\", by voting for one of the two leading candidates, because a vote for any other candidate does not have as good a chance of affecting the result and also prevents the voter from indicating which of the two leading candidates they prefer. Under TRS if there are only three (viable) candidates, this is unnecessary: even if a voter's favorite candidate is eliminated in the first round, they will still have an opportunity to influence the result by voting for their second-favorite in the second round. However if there are more than three candidates, there is a reason for the voter to compromise and vote for a leading candidate in the first round, in order to avoid the chance that only candidates the voter dislikes advance to the second round and have chance to be elected.\nUnder the two-round system, voters sometimes engage in \"push over\". A voter doing so votes for an unpopular \"push over\" candidate in the first round to ensure that it is this weak candidate, rather than a stronger rival, whom survives to challenge their preferred candidate in the second round. This can backfire if it removes too many votes for their preferred candidate, or the weak candidate's campaign may be energized by being advanced to the second round.\nThe two-round system can be influenced by strategic nomination - this is where candidates and political factions influence the result of an election by nominating extra candidates or withdrawing a candidate who would otherwise have stood. TRS is vulnerable to strategic nomination for the same reasons that it is open to the voting tactic of compromising. This is because a candidate who knows they are unlikely to win can ensure that another candidate they support makes it to the second round by withdrawing from the race before the first round occurs, or by never choosing to stand in the first place. By reducing the size of its slate, a political faction can avoid the spoiler effect, whereby a party \"splits the vote\" of its supporters. A famous example of this spoiler effect occurred in the 2002 French presidential election, when so many left-wing candidates stood in the first round that all of them were eliminated, and two right-wing candidates advanced to the second round. Conversely, a popular faction may fund the campaign of multiple smaller opposing candidates, in order to split the opposition votes among them.\nThe intention of two-round system is that the winning candidate will have the support of a majority of the votes cast. Under the first past the post method, the candidate with most votes (a plurality or a majority) wins, even if they do not have a majority (more than half) of votes. The two-round system tries to overcome this problem by permitting only two candidates in the second round, so that one must receive a majority of votes counted.\nCritics argue that the majority obtained by the winner under the two-round system is an artificial one. Instant-runoff voting and the exhaustive ballot are two other voting methods that create a majority for one candidate by eliminating weaker candidates and then transferring votes based on back-up preferences. However, in cases where there are three or more strong candidates, the TRS will sometimes produce a majority for a different winner than the candidate elected by a majority produced under instant-runoff voting or the exhaustive ballot.\nAdvocates of Condorcet methods argue that a candidate can claim to have majority support only if they are the \"Condorcet winner\" \u2013 that is, the candidate whose vote tally is greater than that of every other candidate in a series of one-on-one comparisons. In the two-round system, in the last round, the winning candidate is only matched, one-on-one, with one of the other candidates. When a Condorcet winner exists, the candidate does not necessarily win a TRS election due to insufficient support in the first round.\nTwo-round system advocates counter that the voter's first preference is more important than lower preferences because that is where voters are putting the most effort of decision and that, unlike Condorcet methods, to win under the TRS requires a good showing among the full field of candidates in the first round and also a plurality in the final head-to-head competition. Condorcet methods can allow candidates to win who have minimal first-choice support and can win largely on the compromise appeal of being ranked second or third by more voters.\nImpact on factions and candidates.\nThe two-round system encourages candidates to appeal to a broad cross-section of voters. This is because, in order to win an absolute majority in the second round, it is necessary for a candidate to win the support of voters whose favorite candidate has been eliminated. Under the two-round system, between rounds of voting, eliminated candidates, and the factions who previously supported them, often issue recommendations to their supporters as to whom to vote for in the second round of the contest. This means that eliminated candidates are still able to influence the result of the election. This influence leads to political bargaining between the two remaining candidates and the parties and candidates who have been eliminated, sometimes resulting in the two successful candidates making policy concessions to the less successful ones. Because it encourages conciliation and negotiation in these ways, the two-round system is advocated, in various forms, by some supporters of deliberative democracy.\nThe two-round system is designed for single-seat constituencies. Therefore, like other single-seat methods, if used to elect a council or legislature it will not produce proportional representation (PR). This means that it is likely to lead to the representation of a small number of larger parties in an assembly, rather than a proliferation of small parties. In practice, the two-round system produces results very similar to those produced by the plurality method, and encourages a two-party system similar to those found in many countries that use plurality. Under a parliamentary system, it is more likely to produce single-party governments than are PR methods, which tend to produce coalition governments. While the two-round system is designed to ensure that each individual candidate elected is supported by a majority of voters in the constituency, it does not ensure majority rule on a national level when it comes to electing an assembly. As in other non-PR methods, the party or coalition that wins a majority of seats often will not have the support of a majority of voters across the nation.\nPolling.\nIn Australian politics, the two-party-preferred vote (TPP or 2PP) is the result of the final round of an election or opinion poll after preferences have been distributed to the highest two candidates, who in some cases can be independents. For the purposes of TPP, the Liberal/National Coalition is usually considered a single party, with Labor being the other major party. Typically the TPP is expressed as the percentages of votes attracted by each of the two major parties, e.g. \"Coalition 45%, Labor 55%\", where the values include both primary votes and preferences. The TPP is an indicator of how much swing has been attained/is required to change the result, taking into consideration later preferences.\nPractical implications.\nIn smaller elections, such as those in assemblies or private organizations, it is sometimes possible to conduct both rounds in quick succession. More commonly, however, large-scale public elections the two rounds of runoff voting are held on separate days, and so involve voters going to the polls twice and governments conducting two elections. As a result, one of the most common criticisms against the two-round system is that the cost and difficulty of casting a ballot is effectively doubled. However, the system may sometimes still be cheaper than holding a ranked-choice runoff (RCV), as the counting of votes in each round is simple. By contrast, ranked-choice runoff voting involves a longer and more complex count that often requires a centralized count, as it is impossible to tally or audit RCV results locally.\nThe two-round voting system also has the potential to cause political instability between the two rounds of voting.\nUsage.\nThe two-round system is the most common way used to elect heads of state (presidents) of countries worldwide, a total of 87 countries elect their heads of state directly with a two-round system as opposed to only 22 countries that used single-round plurality (first-past-the-post).\nHeads of state elected by TRS in direct popular elections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLegislative chambers exclusively elected by TRS in single-member districts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSub-national legislatures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLegislatures elected by TRS in multi-member districts (block voting).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSub-national legislatures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLegislatures partially elected by TRS (mixed systems).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther examples of use.\nTwo-round voting is used in French departmental elections. In Italy, it is used to elect mayors, but also to decide which party or coalition receives a majority bonus in city councils.\nHistorically it was used to elect the Reichstag in the German Empire between 1871 and 1918 and the Storting of Norway from 1905 to 1919, in New Zealand in the 1908 and 1911 elections, and in Israel to elect the Prime Minister in the 1996, 1999 and 2001 elections. El Salvador used a two-round system to elects its president until the 2024 presidential election; a constitutional reform in 2025 abolished the two-round system.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
