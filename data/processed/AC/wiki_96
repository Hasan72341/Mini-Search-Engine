It is one of many types of magnetic confinement fusion devices, and among the first to be invented. The name \"stellarator\" refers to stars because fusion mostly occurs in stars such as the Sun. It is one of the earliest human-designed fusion power devices.\nThe stellarator was invented by American scientist Lyman Spitzer in 1951. Much of its early development was carried out by Spitzer's team at what became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). Spitzer's Model A began operation in 1953 and demonstrated plasma confinement. Larger models followed, but demonstrated poor performance, losing plasma at rates far worse than theoretical predictions. By the early 1960s, attention turned to fundamental theory. By the mid-1960s, Spitzer was convinced that the stellarator was matching the Bohm diffusion rate, which suggested it would never be a practical fusion device.\nThe USSR's tokamak design augured a leap in performance. PPPL converted the Model C stellarator to the Symmetrical Tokamak (ST) to confirm or deny its results. ST surpassed them. Large-scale stellarator work in the US was replaced by tokamaks. Research continued in Germany and Japan, addressing many of the original problems, and began to approach the performance of early tokamaks.\nThe tokamak ultimately proved to have problems similar to the stellarators (for different reasons). Since the 1990s, stellarator interest rekindled. New techniques increased field quality and power, improving performance.\nHistory.\nPrevious work.\nIn 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford were the first to create fusion, using a particle accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. These experiments allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various reactions of fusion between nuclei. They determined that the tritium\u2013deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than any other fuel, peaking at about 100,000\u00a0electronvolts (100\u00a0keV).\n100\u00a0keV corresponds to a temperature of about one billion kelvin. Due to the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics, a bulk gas at a much lower temperature will still contain some particles at these energies. Because fusion reactions release so much energy, even a small number of such reactions can release enough energy to maintain the gas at the required temperature. In 1944, Enrico Fermi demonstrated that this would occur at a bulk temperature of about 50\u00a0million\u00a0Celsius, within the range of existing experimental systems. The key problem was confining the plasma; no material container could withstand those temperatures. However, plasmas are electrically conductive, subjecting them to electric and magnetic fields.\nIn a magnetic field, the plasma's electrons and nuclei circle the magnetic lines of force. One confinement approach is to place a tube of fuel inside the open core of a solenoid. A solenoid creates magnetic lines running down its center, and fuel would be held away from the walls by orbiting these lines of force. But such an arrangement does not confine the plasma along the length of the tube. The obvious solution is to bend the tube around into a torus (donut) shape, so that any one line forms a circle, and the particles can circle forever.\nHowever, for purely geometric reasons, the magnets ringing the torus are closer together on the inside curve, inside the \"donut hole\". Fermi noted that this would cause the electrons to drift away from the nuclei, eventually causing large voltages to develop. The resulting electric field would cause the plasma ring inside the torus to expand until it hit the reactor walls.\nStellarator.\nAfter World War II, researchers began considering ways to confine a plasma. George Paget Thomson of Imperial College London proposed a system now known as z-pinch, which runs a current through the plasma. Due to the Lorentz force, this current creates a magnetic field that pulls the plasma in on itself, keeping it away from the walls. This eliminates the need for external magnets, avoiding Fermi's problem. Various teams in the UK built a number of small experimental devices using this technique by the late 1940s.\nRonald Richter was a German scientist who emigrated to Argentina. His thermotron used electrical arcs and mechanical compression (sound waves) for heating and confinement. He convinced Juan Per\u00f3n to fund development of an experimental reactor. Known as the Huemul Project, this was completed in 1951. Richter convinced himself fusion had been achieved despite disagreements with other researchers. \nWhile preparing for a ski trip to Aspen, Spitzer received a telephone call from his father, who mentioned an article on Huemul in \"The New York Times\". Spitzer concluded it could not possibly work; the system could not provide enough energy. He then began considering alternatives. The stellarator concept came while riding a ski lift.\nHis approach was to modify the torus' geometric layout to address Fermi's concerns. By twisting one end of the torus compared to the other, forming a figure-8 layout instead of a circle, the magnetic lines moved closer and further from the torus' center. A particle orbiting these lines constantly moves in and out across the minor axis of the torus, drifting upward through half of one orbit and reversing in the other. The cancellation is not perfect, but it appeared this would sufficiently reduce net drift that the fuel would remain trapped long enough to reach the required temperatures.\nMatterhorn.\nA secret research lab at Princeton University carried on theoretical work on H-bombs after 1951. Spitzer was invited to join this program, given his previous research in interstellar plasmas.\nSpitzer then lost interest in bomb design, and turned his attention to fusion as a power source. Spitzer produced a series of reports outlining the conceptual basis for the stellarator, as well as potential problems. The series is notable for its depth; it included a detailed analysis of the mathematics of the plasma and stability along with heating the plasma and dealing with impurities.\nSpitzer began to lobby the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for funding. His plan involved three stages, each relying on the success of the prior stage over the course of a decade:\nAround the same time, Jim Tuck had been introduced to the pinch concept while working at Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University. He eventually ended up at Los Alamos, where he acquainted the other researchers with the concept. When he heard Spitzer was promoting the stellarator, he travelled to Washington to propose building a pinch device. He considered Spitzer's plans \"incredibly ambitious\". Nevertheless, Spitzer was funded with $50,000, while Tuck received nothing.\nSpitzer, an avid mountain climber, proposed the name \"Project Matterhorn\" because he felt that \"the work at hand seemed difficult, like the ascent of a mountain\". Two sections were initially set up, S Section working on the stellarator under Spitzer, and B Section working on bomb design under Wheeler. Spitzer set up the top-secret S Section in a former rabbit hutch.\nThe other labs then began agitating for their own funding. Tuck managed to arrange some funding for his Perhapsatron through some discretionary budgets at LANL, but other teams at LANL, Berkeley and Oak Ridge (ORNL) also sought funds. The AEC eventually organized Project Sherwood, a new department for these projects.\nEarly devices.\nSpitzer invited James Van Allen to join the group and set up an experimental program. Allen suggested starting with a \"tabletop\" device. This led to the Model A design, which began construction in 1952. It was made from 5\u00a0cm pyrex tubes about 350\u00a0cm in total length, and magnets capable of about 1,000\u00a0gauss. The machine began operation in early 1953 and clearly demonstrated improved confinement over the simple torus.\nThis led to Model B, whose magnets were not well mounted and tended to move when powered to 50,000\u00a0gauss. A second design failed for the same reason, but this machine demonstrated several-hundred-kilovolt X-rays that suggested good confinement. \nNext came the B-1, which used ohmic heating to reach around 100,000 degrees. This machine demonstrated that impurities in the plasma emiitted large x-rays that cooled the plasma. In 1956, B-1 was rebuilt with an ultra-high vacuum system to reduce impurities, but found that even at smaller quantities they were still problematic. Another effect was that during the heating process, the particles would remain confined for only a few tenths of a millisecond, while once the field was turned off, any remaining particles were confined for as long as 10 milliseconds. This appeared to be due to \"cooperative effects\" within the plasma.\nB-2 was similar to B-1, but used pulsed power to allow it to reach higher magnetic energy and included a second heating system known as magnetic pumping. This machine was modified to add an ultra-high vacuum system. Unfortunately, B-2 demonstrated little heating from the magnetic pumping, given its longer required confinement times. It was displayed at the Atoms for Peace show. However, heating system modifications increased the coupling, demonstrating temperatures within the heating section as high as , around 12 million K.\nB-64 was completed in 1955, essentially a larger B-1, but powered by pulses that produced up to 15,000\u00a0gauss. This machine included a divertor, which removed impurities from the plasma, greatly reducing the x-ray cooling effect. B-64 included straight sections in the curved ends which gave it a squared-off appearance. This appearance led to its nickname, \"figure-8, squared\", \"8 squared\", or \"64\". In 1956 the machine was re-assembled without the twist in the tubes, allowing the particles to travel without rotation.\nB-65, completed in 1957, was built using the \"racetrack\" layout, following the observation that adding helical coils to the curved portions of the device produced a field that introduced the rotation purely through the resulting magnetic fields. This had the added advantage that the magnetic field included \"shear\", which was known to improve stability. \nB-3, also completed in 1957, was an enlarged B-2 with ultra-high vacuum and pulsed confinement up to 50,000\u00a0gauss and projected confinement times as long as 0.01 second. \nThe last B-series was the B-66, completed in 1958, essentially a combination of the racetrack layout with the larger size and energy of the B-3.\nUnfortunately, these larger machines demonstrated \"pump out\". This effect caused plasma drift rates higher than classical theory suggested and much higher than the Bohm rates. B-3's drift rate was a full three times that of the worst-case Bohm predictions, and failed to maintain confinement for more than a few tens of microseconds.\nModel C.\nAs early as 1954, design of Model C was taking shape. It emerged as a large racetrack with multiple heating sources and a divertor, essentially a larger B-66. Construction began in 1958 and was completed in 1961. It could be adjusted to allow a plasma minor axis between and was in length. The toroidal field coils normally operated at 35,000\u00a0gauss.\nBy the time Model C began operations, it was understood that it would not produce large-scale fusion. Ion transport across the magnetic field lines was much higher than classical theory suggested. Greatly increased magnetic fields did little to address this, and confinement times did not improve. Attention turned to theoretical understanding of the plasma. In 1961, Melvin B. Gottlieb took over Matterhorn from Spitzer, and the project was renamed the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL).\nContinual experimentation slowly improved the machine, and confinement times eventually increased to match that of Bohm predictions. Over time, new versions of the heating systems increased the temperatures. Notable was the 1964 addition of a small particle accelerator to accelerate fuel ions to high enough energy to cross the magnetic fields, depositing energy within the reactor when they collided with ions already inside. This neutral beam injection method is nearly universal on magnetic confinement fusion machines.\nModel C spent most of its history involved in studies of ion transport. Through continual tuning of the magnetic system and the addition of the new heating methods, in 1969, Model C eventually reached electron temperatures of 400\u00a0eV, 4.6 million K.\nOther approaches.\nStellarator designs proliferated, adopting a simplified magnetic layout. Model C used separate confinement and helical coils. Other researchers, notably in Germany, noted that the same overall magnetic field configuration could be achieved with a much simpler arrangement. This led to the torsatron or heliotron layout.\nIn these designs, the primary field is produced by a single helical magnet, similar to one of the helical windings of the \"classical\" stellarator. Only a single, much larger magnet is needed. To produce the net field, a second set of coils running poloidally around the outside of the helical magnet produces a vertical field that mixes with the helical one. The result is a much simpler layout, as the poloidal magnets are generally much smaller and leave ample room between them to reach the interior.\nThe total field could be produced through independent magnets shaped like the local field. This results in complex magnets arranged like the toroidal coils of the original layout. The advantage of this design is that the magnets are entirely independent; if one is damaged it can be individually replaced without affecting the rest of the system. Additionally, the overall field can be rearranged layout by replacing the elements and became common.\nTokamak surge.\nIn 1968, scientists in the Soviet Union released the results of their tokamak machine experiments, notably T-3. The results were so unexpected that scepticism was widespread. To address this, the Soviets invited experts from the United Kingdom to test the machines. Their tests used a laser system developed for the ZETA reactor to verify the Soviet claims of electron temperatures of 1,000\u00a0eV. What followed was a \"veritable stampede\" of tokamak construction worldwide.\nAt first US labs ignored the news; Spitzer dismissed it as experimental error. However, as more results surfaced, especially the UK reports, Princeton defended the stellarator while other groups were clamoring for funds to build tokamaks. In July 1969 Gottlieb had a change of heart, offering to convert the Model C to a tokamak layout. In December it was shut down and reopened in May as the Symmetric Tokamak (ST).\nThe ST immediately matched the performance of the Soviet machines, besting Model C's results by over tenfold. Thereafter, PPPL was the primary developer of the tokamak approach in the US, introducing a series of machines to test various designs. The Princeton Large Torus of 1975 quickly achieved several performance metrics required for a commercial machine, and it was widely believed the critical threshold of breakeven would be reached in the early 1980s based on larger machines and more powerful heating systems.\nTokamaks are a type of pinch machine, differing from earlier designs primarily in the amount of current in the plasma: above a certain threshold known as the \"safety factor\", or \"q\", the plasma is much more stable. ZETA ran at a \"q\" around &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443, while experiments on tokamaks demonstrated it needs to be at least 1. Machines following this rule showed dramatically improved performance. However, by the mid-1980s fusion power remained out of reach; as the amount of current in the new machines began to increase, new instabilities in the plasma appeared. These could be addressed, but only by greatly increasing the power of the magnetic fields, requiring superconducting magnets and huge confinement volumes. The cost of such a machine was such that the involved parties banded together to begin the ITER project.\nStellarator returns.\nAs the tokamak approach faltered, interest in stellarators reemerged. This coincided with the development of advanced computer aided planning tools that allowed the construction of complex magnets that were previously known but considered too difficult to design and build.\nNew materials and construction methods increased the quality and power of the magnetic fields, improving performance. New devices built to test these concepts include Wendelstein 7-X i(W7-X) n Germany, the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) in the US, and the Large Helical Device in Japan. W7X and LHD use superconducting magnetic coils.\nThe lack of an internal current eliminates some of the tokomak's instabilities, allowed the stellarator to be more stable given similar operating conditions. Since it lacks the confinement provided by the current found in a tokamak, the stellarator requires more powerful magnets to reach any given confinement. The stellarator is an inherently steady-state machine, which has several engineering advantages.\nIn 2023 PPPL built an experimental device using mainly commercial components at a cost of $640,000. Its core is a glass vacuum chamber surrounded by a 3D-printed nylon shell that anchors 9,920 permanent magnets. Sixteen electromagnets wrap the shell.\n2000-.\nTransport losses.\nThe goal of magnetic confinement devices is to minimise energy transport across a magnetic field. Toroidal devices are relatively successful because the magnetic properties seen by the particles are averaged as they travel around the torus. The strength of the field seen by a particle, however, generally varies, so that some particles will be trapped by the mirror effect. These particles will not be able to average the magnetic properties so effectively, which increases energy transport. In most stellarators, these changes in field strength are greater than in tokamaks, which is a major reason that transport tends to be higher.\nUniversity of Wisconsin electrical engineering Professor David Anderson and research assistant John Canik proved in 2007 that the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) can overcome this major barrier in plasma research. The HSX is the first stellarator to use a quasi-symmetric magnetic field. The team designed and built the HSX, reporting that quasi-symmetry reduced energy transport.\nW7-X was designed to be close to omnigeneity (a property of the magnetic field such that the mean radial drift is zero), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for quasi-symmetry. W7-X experiments revealed turbulence-induced anomalous diffusion. Its optimized magnetic field showed effective control of bootstrap current and reduced neoclassical energy transport, enabling high-temperature plasma conditions and record fusion values along with longer impurity confinement times during turbulence-suppressed phases. These findings highlight the success of magnetic field optimization in stellarators.\nDivertor.\nAt W7-X, the island divertor stabilized detached plasma scenarios and reduced heat fluxes on divertor targets. This design created multiple adjacent counter-streaming flow regions that reduce flow speed parallel to magnetic field lines, leading to substantial heat flux mitigation. Radiative power exhaust by impurity seeding was demonstrated in island divertor configurations, resulting in stable plasma operation and reduced divertor heat loads. The edge magnetic structure in quasi--omnigenous and helically symmetric stellarators such as W7-X and HSX, impacts particle fueling and exhaust. The magnetic island chain can be used to control plasma fueling from recycling source and active gas injection.\nMUSE.\nThe MUSE device at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory uses primarily commercial parts such as 10000 permanent magnets to build a research stellarator. The magnets are embedded in a 3D printed nylon matrix. It adopted the magnetic surface charge method. Peak internal stress was found to be less than 7\u00a0MPa. It is the first quasi--axisymmetric experiment.\nPrivate sector.\nPrivate sector stellarator projects began emerging in 2018. Participants include Renaissance Fusion, Proxima Fusion, Type One, and Thea Energy.\nProxima Fusion is a Munich-based spin-off from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, which steered the W7-X experiment. In February 2025, it announced plans to build a test magnet from high-temperature superconductors in 2027 and a demo unit in 2031.\nType One is seeking $200 million in investment to add to $82 million raised in 2024. Its Infinity One system is intended to validate its design, with construction beginning in 2026. Infinity Two is intended to produce net power. That machine is designed to cover 14 meters and generate 800 MWt, resulting in 350 MWe.\nPPPL spinout Thea Energy plans to shape its fields with angled circular coils finetuned with flat magnets.\nConcepts.\nRequirements for fusion.\nHeating a gas increases the energy of the particles within it, so by heating a gas to hundreds of millions of degrees, the majority of the particles reach the energy required to fuse. \nAccording to the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution, some will reach the required energies at much lower average temperatures. Because the energy released by the fusion reaction is much greater than what it takes to start it, even a small number of reactions can heat surrounding fuel until it fuses. In 1944, Fermi calculated the D\u2013T reaction would be self-sustaining at about .\nMaterials heated beyond a few tens of thousand degrees ionize, producing plasma. According to the ideal gas law, like any hot gas, plasma has an internal pressure and thus wants to expand. For a fusion reactor, the challenge is to keep the plasma contained. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit the magnetic field lines, confining them to the area defined by the field.\nMagnetic confinement.\nA simple confinement system can be made by placing a tube inside the open core of a solenoid. The tube can be evacuated and then filled with gas and heated until it becomes a plasma. The plasma tries to expand outwards to the walls of the tube, and move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates magnetic field lines running down the center of the tube, and the plasma particles orbit these lines, preventing their motion towards the sides. However, this arrangement does not confine the plasma along the \"length\" of the tube, and the plasma can flow out the ends.\nOne solution is to bend the tube into a torus (a ring or donut) shape. Motion towards the sides remains constrained as before, and while the particles remain free to move along the lines, in this case, they circulate around the tube. But, as Fermi pointed out, when the solenoid is bent into a ring, the electrical windings would be closer together on the inside than the outside. This leads to an uneven field across the tube, and the fuel drifts out of the center. Since the electrons and ions drift in opposite directions, this leads to a charge separation and electrostatic forces that eventually overwhelm the magnetic force. Some additional force needs to counteract this drift, providing long-term confinement.\nStellarator.\nSpitzer's key concept is that the drift could be canceled through the physical arrangement of the vacuum tube. In a torus, particles on the inside edge of the tube, where the field was stronger, would drift up, while those on the outside would drift down (or vice versa). However, if the particle were made to alternate between the inside and outside of the tube, the drifts would alternate between up and down and would cancel out. The cancellation is not perfect, leaving some net drift, but calculations suggested drift would be low enough to confine plasma long enough to heat it.\nInstead of a normal torus, Spitzer's device would essentially be cut in half to produce two half-tori. They would then be joined with two straight sections between the open ends. The key was that they were connected to alternate ends so that the right half of one was connected to the left of the other. The resulting design resembled a figure-8 when viewed from above. Because the straight tubes could not pass through each other, the design did not lie flat, the tori at either end had to be tilted. This meant the drift cancellation was further reduced.\nTo understand how the system works to counteract drift, consider the path of a single particle in the system starting in one of the straight sections. If that particle is perfectly centered in the tube, it will travel down the center into one of the half-tori, exit into the center of the next tube, and so on. This particle will loops through the entire torus without leaving the center. Now consider another particle traveling parallel to the first, but initially located near the inside wall of the tube. In this case, it enters the outside edge of the half-torus and begins to drift down. It exits that section and enters the second straight section, still on the outside edge of that tube. However, because the tubes are crossed, when it reaches the second half-torus it enters it on the inside edge and drifts back up.\nDrift has other causes as well. Although the ions and electrons in the plasma both circle the magnetic lines, they move in opposite directions, at high rotational speeds. This leads to the possibility of collisions between particles circling different lines of force as they travel through the reactor, which for purely geometric reasons, causes the fuel to slowly drift outward. This process eventually causes the fuel to either collide with the structure or cause a large charge separation between the ions and electrons. Spitzer introduced the concept of a divertor, a magnet placed around the tube that pulled off the very outer layer of the plasma. This would remove the ions before they drifted too far and hit the walls. It would also remove any heavier elements.\nUsing classical calculations, the rate of diffusion through collisions was low enough that it would be much lower than the drift due to uneven fields in a normal toroid. But studies of magnetically confined plasmas in 1949 demonstrated much higher losses and became known as Bohm diffusion. After considering this issue, Spitzer concluded that the anomalous rate seen by Bohm was due to instability in the plasma, which he believed could be addressed.\nAlternative designs.\nOne major concern is that the magnetic fields properly confine a particle only of a given mass traveling at a given speed. Particles traveling faster or slower will not circulate in the desired fashion. Particles with low speeds (low temperature) are not confined and can drift. Hot particles may hit the outside walls of the curved sections. To address these concerns, Spitzer introduced the concept of a \"divertor\" connected to one of the straight sections. This was essentially a mass spectrometer that would remove particles that were moving too fast or too slow.\nThe requirement that the two straight sections not intersect means that the rotational transform is typically around 135 degrees. This led to alternate designs that attempted to get the angle closer to 180. An early attempt was B-2, which placed the curved sections flat in relation to the ground, but at different heights. The straight sections had additional curves inserted, two sections of about 45 degrees, so they now formed extended S-shapes. This allowed them to route around each other while being remaining symmetrical in terms of angles.\nB-64 and B-65 eliminated the cross-over and flattened the device into an oval \"racetrack\". Particle rotation was introduced by placing a new set of magnetic coils on the half-torus on either end, the corkscrew windings. The field from these coils mixes with the confinement fields to produce a mixed field that rotates the lines of force through 180 degrees. This made the mechanical design of the reactor much simpler, but in practice, perfectly symmetrical mixed fields proved difficult to produce.\nStellarator designs generally use more complex magnets to produce a single shaped field, resembling a twisted ribbon. Design differences mostly concern magnet arrangements, which govern the resulting field. \nHeating.\nUnlike the z-pinch or tokamak, the stellarator has no induced electrical current within the plasma \u2013 at a macroscopic level, the plasma is neutral and unmoving, although the individual particles within it circulate. In pinch machines, the current is one of the primary heating methods. Stellarators have no such heating source.\nEarly stellarator designs used current-based initial heating. This consisted of a single set of windings from a transformer, with the plasma itself forming a secondary set. When energized with a pulse of current, the particles in the region heat and begin to move. This brings additional gas into the region to be heated in turn. This concept was referred to as ohmic heating because it relied on the resistance of the gas to create heat. As the temperature of the gas increases, plasma conductivity improves. This makes ohmic heating less effective, limiting temperatures to about 1 million kelvins.\nTo reach higher temperatures, Spitzer proposed a second heat source, the magnetic pumping system. This consisted of a radio-frequency source fed through a coil spread along the vacuum chamber. The frequency is similar to the natural frequency of the particles around the magnetic lines of force, the cyclotron frequency. Particles in the area gain energy, which causes them increase their orbital radius. Since other particles are orbiting their own lines nearby, at a macroscopic level, this change in energy appears as an increase in pressure. According to the ideal gas law, this results in an increase in temperature. As in ohmic heating, this process also becomes less efficient as the temperature increases. Ion-cyclotron resonance heating sets the frequency close to that of the ion circulation. \nInherent problems.\nIn the early 1970s, Tihiro Ohkawa at General Atomics showed that toroids with smaller aspect ratios and non-circular plasmas improve performance. The aspect ratio compares the device's overall radius to the vacuum tube's cross-sectional radius. An ideal reactor minimizes this ratio by reducing the central hole. Modern spherical tokamaks, such as the UK's MAST with a ratio of 1.3, achieve near-spherical shapes by elongating the tube vertically around a single metal post. Stellarators require complex magnets to shape the magnetic field, initially using stacked sets. Modern systems combine these, but still need significant space, resulting in larger inner radii and higher aspect ratios than tokamaks. For example, W7-X has a ratio of 10. New designs aim to lower this ratio, but as of 2023, they remained untested and far higher than tokamak levels. In 2025, simulations suggested a novel low-aspect-ratio design could reduce the ratio to 6, reducing size by 30%. \nProduction stellarators must shield magnets from 14.1 MeV neutrons using a 1\u20131.5 m thick breeding blanket containing lithium. This increases magnet distance from the plasma, requiring stronger fields than in designs where magnets line the vacuum chamber. To compensate, stellarators scale to large sizes, with separations growing from 10 cm to 1 m. Designs like ARIES-CS, with an 8 m radius and 4.6 aspect ratio, remain oversized. The complex magnets demand precise positioning, with tolerances as tight as 1.5 mm. \nThe National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX), a low-aspect-ratio design with a 4.4 ratio, was canceled in 2008 due to unachievable tolerances, as component sagging exceeded limits. In 2025, 3D-printed magnet supports reduced alignment errors by 20% in prototype tests. \nStellarators leak approximately 5% of alpha particles, stressing plasma-facing components.\nPlasma heating.\nPlasma can be heated in various ways:\nConfigurations.\nSeveral different configurations of stellarator exist, including:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29594", "revid": "50519162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29594", "title": "Stephen I of Hungary", "text": "King of Hungary from 1000/1001 to 1038; Catholic saint\nStephen I, also known as King Saint Stephen ( ; ; ; c. 975 \u2013 15 August 1038), was the last grand prince of the Hungarians between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first king of Hungary from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038. The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in, or after, 975, in Esztergom. He was given the pagan name Vajk at birth, but the date of his baptism is unknown. He was the only son of Grand Prince G\u00e9za and his wife, Sarolt, who was descended from a prominent family of \"gyulas\". Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of his family to become a devout Christian. He married Gisela of Bavaria, a scion of the imperial Ottonian dynasty.\nAfter succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, Kopp\u00e1ny, who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors. He defeated Kopp\u00e1ny with the assistance of foreign knights including Vecelin, Hont and P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny, and native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftains\u2014including the Black Hungarians and his uncle, Gyula the Younger\u2014he unified the Carpathian Basin. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.\nStephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries, leading the Church in Hungary to develop independently from the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire. He encouraged the spread of Christianity by meting out severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. His system of local administration was based on counties organized around fortresses and administered by royal officials. Hungary enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign and became a preferred route for pilgrims and merchants traveling between Western Europe, the Holy Land and Constantinople.\nStephen survived all of his children, dying on 15 August 1038, aged 62 or 63. He was buried in his new basilica, built in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and dedicated to the Holy Virgin. His death was followed by civil wars which lasted for decades. He was canonized by Pope Gregory VII, together with his son Emeric and Bishop Gerard of Csan\u00e1d, in 1083. Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and neighboring territories. In Hungary, his feast day (celebrated on 20 August) is also a public holiday commemorating the foundation of the state, known as State Foundation Day.\nEarly years (c. 975\u2013997).\nStephen's birth date is uncertain as it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents. Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years: 967, 969 and 975. The unanimous testimony of his three late 11th-century or early 12th-century hagiographies and other Hungarian sources, which state that Stephen was \"still an adolescent\" in 997, substantiate the reliability of the latest year (975). Stephen's \"Lesser Legend\" adds that he was born in Esztergom, which implies that he was born after 972 because his father, G\u00e9za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year. G\u00e9za promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force, but never ceased worshipping pagan gods. Both his son's \"Greater Legend\" and the nearly contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg described G\u00e9za as a cruel monarch, suggesting that he was a despot who mercilessly consolidated his authority over the rebellious Hungarian lords.\nHungarian chronicles agree that Stephen's mother was Sarolt, daughter of Gyula, a Hungarian chieftain with jurisdiction either in Transylvania or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros. Many historians\u2014including P\u00e1l Engel and Gyula Krist\u00f3\u2014propose that her father was identical with \"Gylas\", who had been baptized in Constantinople around 952 and \"remained faithful to Christianity\", according to Byzantine chronicler John Skylitzes. However, this identification is not unanimously accepted; historian Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy states that it was not Sarolt's father, but his younger brother, who was baptized in the Byzantine capital. In contrast with all Hungarian sources, the \"Polish-Hungarian Chronicle\" and later Polish sources state that Stephen's mother was Adelhaid, an otherwise unknown sister of Duke Mieszko I of Poland, but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians.\nStephen was born as Vajk, a name derived from the Turkic word \"baj\", meaning \"hero\", \"master\", \"prince\" or \"rich\". Stephen's \"Greater Legend\" narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop Adalbert of Prague, who stayed in G\u00e9za's court several times between 983 and 994. However, Saint Adalbert's nearly contemporaneous \"Legend\", written by Bruno of Querfurt, does not mention this event. Accordingly, the date of Stephen's baptism is unknown: Gy\u00f6rffy argues that he was baptized soon after birth, while Krist\u00f3 proposes that he only received baptism just before his father's death in 997.\nStephen's official hagiography, written by Bishop Hartvic and sanctioned by Pope Innocent III, narrates that he \"was fully instructed in the knowledge of the grammatical art\" in his childhood. This implies that he studied Latin, though some scepticism is warranted as few kings of this era were able to write. His two other late 11th-century hagiographies do not mention any grammatical studies, stating only that he \"was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince\". Krist\u00f3 says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen's physical training, including his participation in hunts and military actions. According to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from Italy, who later founded a monastery in Tata.\nAccording to Stephen's legends, Grand Prince G\u00e9za convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen \"ascended to the first stage of adolescence\", at the age of 14 or 15. G\u00e9za nominated Stephen as his successor and all those present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince. Gy\u00f6rffy writes, without identifying his source, that G\u00e9za appointed his son to rule the \"Nyitra ducate\" around that time. Slovak historians, including J\u00e1n Steinh\u00fcbel and J\u00e1n Luka\u010dka, accept Gy\u00f6rffy's view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra (now Nitra, Slovakia) from around 995.\nG\u00e9za arranged Stephen's marriage to Gisela, daughter of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, in or after 995. This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house, as Gisela was closely related to the Ottonian dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors. According to popular tradition preserved in the Scheyern Abbey in Bavaria, the ceremony took place at the Scheyern castle and was celebrated by Saint Adalbert. Gisela was accompanied to her new home by Bavarian knights, many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary, helping to strengthen Stephen's military position. According to Gy\u00f6rffy, Stephen and his wife \"presumably\" settled in Nyitra after their marriage.\nReign (997\u20131038).\nGrand Prince (997\u20131000).\nGrand Prince G\u00e9za died in 997. Stephen convoked an assembly at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince. Initially, he only controlled the northwestern regions of the Carpathian Basin; the rest of the territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains. Stephen's ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of primogeniture, which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son. On the other hand, it contradicted the traditional idea of seniority, according to which G\u00e9za should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, which was Kopp\u00e1ny at that time. Kopp\u00e1ny, who held the title Duke of Somogy, had for many years administered the regions of Transdanubia south of Lake Balaton.\nKopp\u00e1ny proposed to G\u00e9za's widow, Sarolt, in accordance with the pagan custom of levirate marriage. He also announced his claim to the throne. Although it is not impossible that Kopp\u00e1ny had already been baptized, in 972, most of his supporters were pagans, opponents of the Christianity represented by Stephen and his predominantly German retinue. A charter of 1002 for the Pannonhalma Archabbey writes of a war between \"the Germans and the Hungarians\" when referring to the armed conflicts between Stephen and Kopp\u00e1ny. Even so, Gy\u00f6rffy says that \"Oszlar\" (\"Alan\"), \"Beseny\u0151\" (\"Pecheneg\"), \"K\u00e9r\" and other place names, referring to ethnic groups or Hungarian tribes in Transdanubia around the supposed borders of Kopp\u00e1ny's duchy, suggest that significant auxiliary units and groups of Hungarian warriors\u2014who had been settled there by Grand Prince G\u00e9za\u2014fought in Stephen's army.\nKrist\u00f3 states that the entire conflict between Stephen and Kopp\u00e1ny was only a feud between two members of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, with no effect on other Hungarian tribal leaders. Kopp\u00e1ny and his troops invaded the northern regions of Transdanubia, took many of Stephen's forts and plundered his lands. Stephen, who, according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", \"was for the first time girded with his sword\", placed the brothers Hont and P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny at the head of his own guard and nominated Vecelin to lead the royal army. The last was a German knight who had come to Hungary in the reign of G\u00e9za. Hont and P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny were, according to Simon of K\u00e9za's \"Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum\" and the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", \"knights of Swabian origin\" who settled in Hungary either under G\u00e9za or in the first years of Stephen's reign. On the other hand, Luka\u010dka and other Slovak historians say that Hont and P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny were \"Slovak\" noblemen who had joined Stephen during his rule in Nyitra.\nKopp\u00e1ny was besieging Veszpr\u00e9m when he was informed of the arrival of Stephen's army. In the ensuing battle, Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies. Kopp\u00e1ny was killed on the battlefield. His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the gates of the forts of Esztergom, Gy\u0151r, Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (Alba Iulia, Romania) and Veszpr\u00e9m in order to threaten all of those who were conspiring against the young monarch.\nStephen occupied Kopp\u00e1ny's duchy and granted large estates to his own partisans. He also prescribed that Kopp\u00e1ny's former subjects were to pay tithes to the Pannonhalma Archabbey, according to the deed of the foundation of this monastery which has been preserved in a manuscript containing interpolations. The same document declares that \"there were no other bishoprics and monasteries in Hungary\" at that time. On the other hand, the nearly contemporary Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg stated that Stephen \"established bishoprics in his kingdom\" before being crowned king. If the latter report is valid, the dioceses of Veszpr\u00e9m and Gy\u0151r are the most probable candidates, according to historian G\u00e1bor Thoroczkay.\nCoronation (1000\u20131001).\nBy ordering the display of one part of Kopp\u00e1ny's quartered corpse in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, the seat of his maternal uncle, Gyula the Younger, Stephen asserted his claim to rule all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.\nThietmar of Merseburg writes that Stephen received the crown \"with the favour and urging\" of Emperor Otto III (r. 996\u20131002), implying that Stephen accepted the Emperor's suzerainty before his coronation. On the other hand, all of Stephen's legends emphasize that he received his crown from Pope Sylvester II (r. 999\u20131003). Krist\u00f3 and other historians point out that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close allies, which implies that both reports are valid: Stephen \"received the crown and consecration\" from the Pope, but not without the Emperor's consent. Around 75 years after the coronation, Pope Gregory VII (r. 1075\u20131085), who claimed suzerainty over Hungary, declared that Stephen had \"offered and devotedly surrendered\" Hungary \"to Saint Peter\" (that is, to the Holy See). In a contrasting report, Stephen's \"Greater Legend\" states that the King offered Hungary to the Virgin Mary. Modern historians\u2014including P\u00e1l Engel, and Mikl\u00f3s Moln\u00e1r\u2014write that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty. For instance, none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors, which would have been the case if he had been their vassal. Furthermore, Stephen declared in the preamble to his \"First Book of Laws\" that he governed his realm \"by the will of God\".\nThe exact date of Stephen's coronation is unknown. According to later Hungarian tradition, he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001. Details of Stephen's coronation preserved in his \"Greater Legend\" suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings. Accordingly, Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony. Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones.\nBesides his crown, Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty. For instance, his first coins bear the inscription LANCEA REGIS (\"the king's spear\") and depict an arm holding a spear with flag. According to the contemporaneous Ad\u00e9mar de Chabannes, a spear had been given to Stephen's father by Emperor Otto III as a token of G\u00e9za's right to \"enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country\". Stephen is styled in various ways\u2014\"Ungarorum rex\" (\"king of the Hungarians\"), \"Pannoniorum rex\" (\"king of the Pannonians\") or \"Hungarie rex\" (\"king of Hungary\")\u2014in his charters.\nConsolidation (1001\u2013c. 1009).\nAlthough Stephen's power did not rely on his coronation, the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm \"by the Grace of God\". All his legends testify that he established an archbishopric with its see in Esztergom shortly after his coronation. This act ensured that the Church in Hungary became independent of the prelates of the Holy Roman Empire. The earliest reference to an archbishop of Esztergom, named Dominic, has been preserved in the deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey from 1002. According to historian G\u00e1bor Thoroczkay, Stephen also established the Diocese of Kalocsa in 1001. Stephen invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom. Associates of the late Adalbert of Prague, including Radla and Astrik, arrived in Hungary in the first years of his reign. The presence of an unnamed \"Archbishop of the Hungarians\" at the synod of 1007 of Frankfurt and the consecration of an altar in Bamberg in 1012 by Archbishop Astrik show that Stephen's prelates maintained a good relationship with the clergy of the Holy Roman Empire.\nThe transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his \"First Book of Laws\" from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death. His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If someone has such a hardened heart\u2014God forbid it to any Christian\u2014that he does not want to confess his faults according to the counsel of a priest, he shall lie without any divine service and alms like an infidel. If his relatives and neighbors fail to summon the priest, and therefore he should die unconfessed, prayers and alms should be offered, but his relatives shall wash away their negligence by fasting in accordance with the judgement of the priests. Those who die a sudden death shall be buried with all ecclesiastical honor; for divine judgment is hidden from us and unknown.\u2014\u200a\nMany Hungarian lords refused to accept Stephen's suzerainty even after his coronation. The new King first turned against his own uncle, Gyula the Younger, whose realm \"was most wide and rich\", according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\". Stephen invaded Transylvania and seized Gyula and his family around 1002 or in 1003. The contemporary \"Annals of Hildesheim\" adds that Stephen converted his uncle's \"country to the Christian faith by force\" after its conquest. Accordingly, historians date the establishment of the Diocese of Transylvania to this period. If the identification, proposed by Krist\u00f3, Gy\u00f6rffy and other Hungarian historians, of Gyula with one Prokui\u2014who was Stephen's uncle according to Thietmar of Merseburg\u2014is valid, Gyula later escaped from captivity and fled to Boles\u0142aw I the Brave, Duke of Poland (r. 992\u20131025).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Duke Boleslav the Brave's] territory included a certain burg, located near the border with the Hungarians. Its guardian was lord Prokui, an uncle of the Hungarian king. Both in the past and more recently, Prokui had been driven from his lands by the king and his wife had been taken captive. When he was unable to free her, his nephew arranged for her unconditional release, even though he was Prokui's enemy. I have never heard of anyone who showed such restraint towards a defeated foe. Because of this, God repeatedly granted him victory, not only in the burg mentioned above, but in others as well.\u2014\u200a\nAbout a hundred years later, the chronicler Gallus Anonymus also made mention of armed conflicts between Stephen and Boleslav, stating that the latter \"defeated the Hungarians in battle and made himself master of all their lands as far as the Danube\". Gy\u00f6rffy says that the chronicler's report refers to the occupation of the valley of the river Morava\u2014a tributary of the Danube\u2014by the Poles in the 1010s. On the other hand, the \"Polish-Hungarian Chronicle\" states that the Polish duke occupied large territories north of the Danube and east of the Morava as far as Esztergom in the early 11th century. According to Steinh\u00fcbel, the latter source proves that a significant part of the lands that now form Slovakia were under Polish rule between 1002 and 1030. In contrast with the Slovak historian, Gy\u00f6rffy writes that this late chronicle \"in which one absurdity follows another\" contradicts all facts known from 11th-century sources.\nThe \"Illuminated Chronicle\" narrates that Stephen \"led his army against Kean, Duke of the Bulgarians and Slavs whose lands are by their natural position most strongly fortified\" following the occupation of Gyula's country. According to a number of historians, including Zolt\u00e1n Lenkey and Gyula Krist\u00f3, Kean was the head of a small state located in the southern parts of Transylvania and Stephen occupied his country around 1003. Other historians, including Gy\u00f6rffy, say that the chronicle's report preserved the memory of Stephen's campaign against Bulgaria in the late 1010s.\nLikewise, the identification of the \"Black Hungarians\"\u2014who were mentioned by Bruno of Querfurt and Ad\u00e9mar de Chabannes among the opponents of Stephen's proselytizing policy\u2014is uncertain. Gy\u00f6rffy locates their lands to the east of the river Tisza; while Thoroczkay says they live in the southern parts of Transdanubia. Bruno of Querfurt's report of the Black Hungarians' conversion by force suggests that Stephen conquered their lands at the latest in 1009 when \"the first mission of Saint Peter\"\u2014a papal legate, Cardinal Azo\u2014arrived in Hungary. The latter attended the meeting in Gy\u0151r where the royal charter determining the borders of the newly established Bishopric of P\u00e9cs was issued on 23 August 1009.\nThe Diocese of Eger was also set up around 1009. According to Thoroczkay, \"it is very probable\" that the bishopric's establishment was connected with the conversion of the Kabars\u2014an ethnic group of Khazar origin\u2014 and their chieftain. The head of the Kabars\u2014who was either Samuel Aba or his father\u2014 married Stephen's unnamed younger sister on this occasion. The Aba clan was the most powerful among the native families who joined Stephen and supported him in his efforts to establish a Christian monarchy. The reports by Anonymus, Simon of K\u00e9za and other Hungarian chroniclers of the B\u00e1r-Kal\u00e1n, Cs\u00e1k and other 13th-century noble families descending from Hungarian chieftains suggest that other native families were also involved in the process.\nStephen set up a territory-based administrative system, establishing counties. Each county, headed by a royal official known as a count or \"isp\u00e1n\", was an administrative unit organized around a royal fortress. Most fortresses were earthworks in this period, but the castles at Esztergom, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and Veszpr\u00e9m were built of stone. Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization. The settlements developing around them, where markets were held on each Sunday, were important local economic centers.\nWars with Poland and Bulgaria (c. 1009\u20131018).\nStephen's brother-in-law, Henry II, became King of Germany in 1002 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1013. Their friendly relationship ensured that the western borders of Hungary experienced a period of peace in the first decades of the 11th\u00a0century. Even when Henry II's discontented brother, Bruno, sought refuge in Hungary in 1004, Stephen preserved the peace with Germany and negotiated a settlement between his two brothers-in-law. Around 1009, he gave his younger sister in marriage to Otto Orseolo, Doge of Venice (r. 1008\u20131026), a close ally of the Byzantine Emperor, Basil II (r. 976\u20131025), which suggests that Hungary's relationship with the Byzantine Empire was also peaceful. On the other hand, the alliance between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire brought her into a war with Poland lasting from around 1014 until 1018. The Poles occupied the Hungarian posts along the river Morava. Gy\u00f6rffy and Krist\u00f3 write that a Pecheneg incursion into Transylvania, the memory of which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, also took place in this period, because the Pechenegs were close allies of the Polish duke's brother-in-law, Grand Prince Sviatopolk I of Kiev (r. 1015\u20131019).\nPoland and the Holy Roman Empire concluded the Peace of Bautzen in January 1018. Later in the same year, 500 Hungarian horsemen accompanied Boleslav of Poland to Kyiv, suggesting that Hungary had been included in the peace treaty. The historian Ferenc Makk says that the Peace of Bautzen obliged Boleslav to hand over all the territories he had occupied in the Morava valley to Stephen. According to Leodvin, the first known Bishop of Bihar (r. c. 1050 \u2013 c. 1060), Stephen allied with the Byzantines and led a military expedition to assist them against \"barbarians\" in the Balkan Peninsula. The Byzantine and Hungarian troops jointly took \"Cesaries\" which Gy\u00f6rffy identifies as the present-day town of Ohrid. Leodvin's report suggests that Stephen joined the Byzantines in the war ending with their conquest of Bulgaria in 1018. However, the exact date of his expedition is uncertain. Gy\u00f6rffy argues that it was only in the last year of the war that Stephen led his troops against the Bulgarians.\nDomestic policies (1018\u20131024).\nBishop Leodvin wrote that Stephen collected relics of a number of saints in \"Cesaries\" during his campaign in the Balkans, including Saint George and Saint Nicholas. He donated them to his new triple-naved basilica dedicated to the Holy Virgin in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, where he also set up a cathedral chapter and his new capital. His decision was influenced by the opening, in 1018 or 1019, of a new pilgrimage route that bypassed his old capital, Esztergom. The new route connected Western Europe and the Holy Land through Hungary. Stephen often met the pilgrims, contributing to the spread of his fame throughout Europe. Abbot Odilo of Cluny, for example, wrote in a letter to Stephen that \"those who have returned from the shrine of our Lord\" testify to the king's passion \"towards the honour of our divine religion\". Stephen also established four hostels for pilgrims in Constantinople, Jerusalem, Ravenna and Rome.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Almost] all those from Italy and Gaul who wished to go to the Sepulchre of the Lord at Jerusalem abandoned the usual route, which was by sea, making their way through the country of King Stephen. He made the road safe for everyone, welcomed as brothers all he saw and gave them enormous gifts. This action led many people, nobles and commoners, to go to Jerusalem.\u2014\u200a\nIn addition to pilgrims, merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe. Stephen's legends refer to 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary, but were attacked by Hungarian border guards. The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to demonstrate his determination to preserve internal peace. Regular minting of coinage began in Hungary in the 1020s. His silver dinars bearing the inscriptions STEPHANUS REX (\"King Stephen\") and REGIA CIVITAS (\"royal city\") were popular in contemporary Europe, as demonstrated by counterfeited copies unearthed in Sweden.\nStephen convinced some pilgrims and merchants to settle in Hungary. Gerard, a Benedictine monk who arrived in Hungary from the Republic of Venice between 1020 and 1026, initially planned to continue his journey to the Holy Land, but decided to stay in the country after his meeting with the king. Stephen also established a number of Benedictine monasteries\u2014including the abbeys at P\u00e9csv\u00e1rad, Zalav\u00e1r and Bakonyb\u00e9l\u2014in this period.\nThe \"Long Life of Saint Gerard\" mentions Stephen's conflict with Ajtony, a chieftain in the region of the river Maros. Many historians date their clash to the end of the 1020s, although Gy\u00f6rffy and other scholars put it at least a decade earlier. The conflict arose when Ajtony, who \"had taken his power from the Greeks\", according to Saint Gerard's legend, levied tax on the salt transported to Stephen on the river. The king sent a large army led by Csan\u00e1d against Ajtony, who was killed in battle. His lands were transformed into a Hungarian county and the king set up a new bishopric at Csan\u00e1d (Cenad, Romania), Ajtony's former capital, which was renamed after the commander of the royal army. According to the \"Annales Posonienses\", the Venetian Gerard was consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese in 1030.\nConflicts with the Holy Roman Empire (1024\u20131031).\nStephen's brother-in-law, Emperor Henry, died on 13 July 1024. He was succeeded by a distant relative, Conrad II (r. 1024\u20131039), who adopted an offensive foreign policy. Conrad II expelled Doge Otto Orseolo\u2014the husband of Stephen's sister\u2014from Venice in 1026. He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, Henry, as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son Emeric had a strong claim to the Duchy of Bavaria through his mother. Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop Werner of Strasbourg, to Constantinople. In the autumn of 1027, the bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country. Conrad II's biographer Wipo of Burgundy narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries.\nEmperor Conrad personally led his armies to Hungary in June 1030 and plundered the lands west of the River R\u00e1ba. However, according to the \"Annals of Niederalteich\", the emperor, suffering from consequences of the scorched earth tactics used by the Hungarian army, returned to Germany \"without an army and without achieving anything, because the army was threatened by starvation and was captured by the Hungarians at Vienna\". Peace was restored after Conrad had ceded the lands between the rivers Lajta and Fischa to Hungary in the summer of 1031.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At this same time, dissensions arose between the Pannonian nation and the Bavarians, through the fault of the Bavarians. And, as a result, King [Stephen] of Hungary made many incursions and raids in the realm of the Norici (that is, of the Bavarians). Disturbed on this account Emperor Conrad came upon the Hungarians with a great army. But King [Stephen], whose forces were entirely insufficient to meet the Emperor, relied solely on the guardianship of the Lord, which he sought with prayers and fasts proclaimed through his whole realm. Since the Emperor was not able to enter a kingdom so fortified with rivers and forests, he returned, after he had sufficiently avenged his injury with lootings and burnings on the borders of the kingdom; and it was his wish at a more opportune time to complete the things he had begun. His son, King Henry, however, still a young boy entrusted to the care of Eigilbert, bishop of Freising, received a legation of King [Stephen] which asked for peace; and solely with the counsel of the princes of the realm, and without his father's knowledge, he granted the favor of reconciliation.\u2014\u200a\nLast years (1031\u20131038).\nStephen's biographer, Hartvic, narrates that the King, whose children died one by one in infancy, \"restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son\", Emeric. However, Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031. After the death of his son, the elderly King could never \"fully regain his former health\", according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\". Krist\u00f3 writes that the picture, which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, of the king keeping the vigils and washing the feet of paupers, is connected with Stephen's last years, following the death of his son.\nEmeric's death jeopardized his father's achievements in establishing a Christian state, because Stephen's cousin, Vazul\u2014who had the strongest claim to succeed him\u2014was suspected of an inclination towards paganism. According to the \"Annals of Altaich\" Stephen disregarded his cousin's claim and nominated his sister's son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo, as his heir. The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded, and his three sons, Levente, Andrew and B\u00e9la, were expelled from Hungary. Stephen's legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king's life by members of his court. According to Krist\u00f3, the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act. That Vazul's ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the \"Illuminated Chronicle\".\nIn the view of some historians, provisions in Stephen's \"Second Book of Laws\" on the \"conspiracy against the king and the kingdom\" imply that the book was promulgated after Vazul's unsuccessful plot against Stephen. However, this view has not been universally accepted. Gy\u00f6rffy states that the law book was issued, not after 1031, but around 1009. Likewise, the authenticity of the decree on tithes is debated: according to Gy\u00f6rffy, it was issued during Stephen's reign, but Berend, Laszlovszky and Szak\u00e1cs argue that it \"might be a later addition\".\nStephen died on 15 August 1038. He was buried in the basilica of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. His reign was followed by a long period of civil wars, pagan uprisings and foreign invasions. The instability ended in 1077 when Ladislaus, a grandson of Vazul, ascended the throne.\nFamily.\nStephen married Gisela, a daughter of Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria, who was a nephew of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. Gisela's mother was Gisela of Burgundy, a member of the Welf dynasty. Born around 985, Gisela was younger than her husband, whom she survived. She left Hungary in 1045 and died as Abbess of the Niedernburg Abbey in Passau in Bavaria around 1060.\nAlthough the \"Illuminated Chronicle\" states that Stephen \"begot many sons\", only two of them, Otto and Emeric, are known by name. Otto, who was named after Otto III, seems to have been born before 1002. He died as a child.\nEmeric, who received the name of his maternal uncle, Emperor Henry II, was born around 1007. His \"Legend\" from the early 12th century describes him as a saintly prince who preserved his chastity even during his marriage. According to Gy\u00f6rffy, Emeric's wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. His premature death led to the series of conflicts leading to Vazul's blinding and civil wars.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Be obedient to me, my son. You are a child, descendant of rich parents, living among soft pillows, who has been caressed and brought up in all kinds of comforts; you have had a part neither in the troubles of the campaigns nor in the various attacks of the pagans in which almost my whole life has been worn away.\u2014\u200a\nThe following family tree presents Stephen's ancestors and his relatives who are mentioned in the article.\n\"*A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady.\"\"**Gy\u00f6rffy writes that she may have been a member of the Bulgarian Cometopuli dynasty.\"\"***Samuel Aba might have been the son of Stephen's sister instead of her husband.\"\nLegacy.\nFounder of Hungary.\nStephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary. His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state that ensured that the Hungarians survived in the Carpathian Basin, in contrast to the Huns, Avars and other peoples who had previously controlled the same territory. As Bryan Cartledge emphasizes, Stephen also gave his kingdom \"forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule\".\nHis successors, including those descended from Vazul, were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen's achievements. Although Vazul's son, Andrew I of Hungary, secured the throne due to a pagan uprising, he prohibited pagan rites and declared that his subjects should \"live in all things according to the law which King St. Stephen had taught them\", according to the 14th-century \"Illuminated Chronicle\". In medieval Hungary, communities that claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own \"liberties\" often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen. An example is a 1347 letter from the people of T\u00e1p telling the king about their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey and stating that the taxes levied upon them by the abbot contradicted \"the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen\".\nSainthood.\nStephen's cult emerged after the long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of his immediate successors. However, there is no evidence that Stephen became an object of veneration before his canonization. For instance, the first member of the royal family to be named after him, Stephen II, was born in the early 12th century.\nStephen's canonization was initiated by Vazul's grandson, King Ladislaus I of Hungary, who had consolidated his authority by capturing and imprisoning his cousin, Solomon. According to Bishop Hartvic, the canonization was \"decreed by apostolic letter, by order of the Roman see\", suggesting that the ceremony was permitted by Pope Gregory VII. The ceremony started at Stephen's tomb, where on 15 August 1083 masses of believers began three days of fasting and praying. Legend tells that Stephen's coffin could not be opened until King Ladislaus held Solomon in captivity at Visegr\u00e1d. The opening of Stephen's tomb was followed by the occurrence of healing miracles, according to Stephen's legends. Historian Krist\u00f3 attributes the healings either to mass psychosis or deception. Stephen's legends also say that his \"balsam-scented\" remains were elevated from the coffin, which was filled with \"rose-colored water\", on 20 August. On the same day, Stephen's son, Emeric, and the bishop of Csan\u00e1d, Gerard, were also canonized.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Having completed the office of Vespers the third day, everyone expected the favors of divine mercy through the merit of the blessed man; suddenly with Christ visiting his masses, the signs of miracles poured forth from heaven throughout the whole of the holy house. Their multitude, which that night were too many to count, brings to mind the answer from the Gospel which the Savior of the world confided to John, who asked through messengers whether he was the one who was to come: \"the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the lepers are cleansed\", the crippled are set straight, the paralyzed are cured...\u2014\u200a\nStephen's first legend, the so-called \"Greater Legend\", was written between 1077 and 1083. It provided an idealized portrait of the king, one who dedicated himself and his kingdom to the Virgin Mary. However, Stephen's \"Lesser Legend\"\u2014composed around 1100, under King Coloman\u2014emphasized Stephen's severity. A third legend, also composed during King Coloman's reign by Bishop Hartvic, was based on the two existing legends. Sanctioned in 1201 by Pope Innocent III, Hartvic's work served as Stephen's official legend. G\u00e1bor Klaniczay wrote that Stephen's legends \"opened a new chapter in the legends of holy rulers as a genre\", suggesting that a monarch can achieve sainthood through actively using his royal powers. Stephen was the first triumphant \"miles Christi\" (\"Christ's soldier\") among the canonized monarchs. He was also a \"confessor king\", one who had not suffered martyrdom, whose cult was sanctioned, in contrast with earlier holy monarchs.\nStephen's cult spread beyond the borders of Hungary. Initially, he was primarily venerated in Scheyern and Bamberg, in Bavaria, but his relics were also taken to Aachen, Cologne, Montecassino and Namur. Upon the liberation of Buda from the Ottoman Turks, Pope Innocent XI expanded King Saint Stephen's cult to the entire Catholic Church in 1686, and declared 2 September his feast day. As the feast of Saint Joachim was moved, in 1969, from 16 August, the day immediately following the day of Stephen's death, Stephen's feast was moved to that date. Stephen is venerated as the patron saint of Hungary, and regarded as the protector of kings, masons, stonecutters, stonemasons and bricklayers, and also of children suffering from severe illnesses. His canonization was recognized by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople in 2000. In the calendar of the Hungarian Catholic Church, Stephen's feast is observed on 20 August, the day on which his relics were translated. In addition, a separate feast day (30 May) is dedicated to his \"Holy Dexter\".\nHoly Dexter.\nStephen's intact dexter, or right hand (), became the subject of a cult. A cleric named Mercurius stole it, but it was discovered on 30 May 1084 in Bihar County. The theft of sacred relics, or \"furta sacra\", had by that time become a popular topic of saints' biographies. Bishop Hartvic described the discovery of Stephen's right hand in accordance with this tradition, referring to adventures and visions. An abbey erected in Bihar County (now S\u00e2niob, Romania) was named after and dedicated to the veneration of the Holy Dexter.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Why is it, brothers, that his other limbs having become disjointed and, his flesh having been reduced to dust, wholly separated, only the right hand, its skin and sinews adhering to the bones, preserved the beauty of wholeness? I surmise that the inscrutability of divine judgement sought to proclaim by the extraordinary nature of this fact nothing less than that the work of love and alms surpasses the measure of all other virtues.\u00a0... The right hand of the blessed man was deservedly exempt from putrefaction, because always reflourishing from the flower of kindness it was never empty from giving gifts to nourish the poor.\u2014\u200a\nThe Holy Dexter was kept for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey, except during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242, when it was transferred to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). The relic was then taken to Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r around 1420. Following the Ottoman occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid-16th\u00a0century, it was guarded in many places, including Bosnia, Ragusa and Vienna. It was returned to Hungary in 1771, when Queen Maria Theresa donated it to the cloister of the Sisters of Loreto in Buda. It was kept in Buda Castle's St. Sigismund Chapel between around 1900 and 1944, in a cave near Salzburg in 1944 and 1945, and again by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda, between 1945 and 1950. Finally, since 1950, the Holy Dexter has been in St. Stephen's Basilica in Budapest. An annual procession celebrating the relic was instituted in 1938, and continued until 1950, when the procession was forbidden by the Communist government. It was resumed in 1988.\n\"Admonitions\".\nAccording to Stephen's \"Greater Legend\", the king \"himself compiled a book for his son on moral education\". This work, now known as \"Admonitions\" or \"De institutione morum\", was preserved in manuscripts written in the Late Middle Ages. Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or a cleric, most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th\u00a0century.\nThe \"Admonitions\" argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith. Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong. One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the \"pillars of his rule\", meaning the prelates, aristocrats, \"isp\u00e1ns\" and warriors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My dearest son, if you desire to honor the royal crown, I advise, I counsel, I urge you above all things to maintain the Catholic and Apostolic faith with such diligence and care that you may be an example for all those placed under you by God, and that all the clergy may rightly call you a man of true Christian profession. Failing to do this, you may be sure that you will not be called a Christian or a son of the Church. Indeed, in the royal palace, after the faith itself, the Church holds second place, first constituted and spread through the whole world by His members, the apostles and holy fathers, And though she always produced fresh offspring, nevertheless in certain places she is regarded as ancient. However, dearest son, even now in our kingdom the Church is proclaimed as young and newly planted; and for that reason she needs more prudent and trustworthy guardians lest a benefit which the divine mercy bestowed on us undeservedly should be destroyed and annihilated through your idleness, indolence or neglect.\u2014\u200a\nIn arts.\nKing St Stephen has been a popular theme in Hungarian poetry since the end of the 13th century. The earliest poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians. Secular poetry, especially poems written for his feast day, followed a similar pattern, emphasizing Stephen's role as the first king of Hungary. Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989.\nA popular hymn, still sung in the churches, was first recorded in the late 18th century. It hails King St. Stephen as \"radiant star of Hungarians\". Ludwig van Beethoven composed his \"King Stephen Overture\" for the inauguration of the Hungarian theatre in Pest in 1812. According to musician James M. Keller, \"[t]he descending unisons that open the \"King Stephen Overture\" would seem to prefigure the opening of the \"Ninth Symphony\"; ... [a]nd then a later theme, introduced by flutes and clarinets, seems almost to be a variation ... of the famous \"Ode 'To Joy\"' melody of the Ninth Symphony's finale\". Hungarian composer Ferenc Erkel named his last complete opera from 1885, \"Istv\u00e1n kir\u00e1ly\" (\"King Stephen\"), after him. In 1938, Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly wrote a choral piece titled \"\u00c9nek Szent Istv\u00e1n Kir\u00e1lyhoz\" (\"Hymn to King Stephen\"). In 1983, Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi and J\u00e1nos Br\u00f3dy composed a rock opera\u2014\"Istv\u00e1n, a kir\u00e1ly\" (\"Stephen, the King\")\u2014about the early years of his reign. Seventeen years later, in 2000, Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi composed a sequel called \"Veled, Uram!\" (\"You, Sir\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Through this harbour passed all the goods to or from Rome, but all the cargo was carried by small and light ships directed to Olbia (some 50km north), where bigger ships would have trafficked with Ostia. Traffic was supposedly intense, Sardinia bearing the \"sobriquet\" \"the granary of Rome\".\nIn the immediate surroundings, it is supposed there was a temple in honour of Feronia, an Etruscan deity, goddess of the waters; this would prove the presence of Etruscans in this area at the time of Nuragici people. A similar cult of Feronia is reported on the Italian mainland at least in two places: in Fiano Romano (near Rome), and in Terracina, some 120km south of Rome.\nIt is one of the main tourist destinations of Sardinia, has a long beach (more than 15km of white sand) and a system of rivers of biological importance. A part of this territory is going to be formally protected in the near future with the creation of a nature park (\"Parco Fluviale\")."}
{"id": "29603", "revid": "3174456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29603", "title": "Scott Joplin", "text": "American composer and pianist (1868\u20131917)\nScott Joplin (November 24, 1868 \u2013 April 1, 1917) was an American composer and pianist. Dubbed the \"King of Ragtime\", he composed more than 40 ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet (original version of \"The Ragtime Dance\", 1899/1902), and two operas. One of his first and most popular pieces, the \"Maple Leaf Rag\", became the genre's first and most influential hit, later being recognized as the quintessential rag. Joplin considered ragtime to be a form of classical music meant to be played in concert halls and largely disdained the performance of ragtime as honky tonk music most common in saloons.\nJoplin grew up in a musical family of railway laborers in Texarkana, Texas. During the late 1880s, he traveled the American South as a musician. He went to Chicago for the World's Fair of 1893, which helped make ragtime a national craze by 1897. Joplin moved to Sedalia, Missouri, in 1894 and worked as a piano teacher. He began publishing music in 1895, and his \"Maple Leaf Rag\" in 1899 brought him fame and a steady income. In 1901, Joplin moved to St. Louis and two years later scored his first opera, \"A Guest of Honor\". It was confiscated\u2014along with his belongings\u2014for non-payment of bills and is now considered lost. In 1907, Joplin moved to New York City to (unsuccessfully) find a producer for a new opera. In 1916, Joplin descended into dementia from neurosyphilis. His 1917 death marks the end of the ragtime era.\nJoplin's music was rediscovered and returned to popularity in the early 1970s with the release of a million-selling album recorded by Joshua Rifkin. This was followed by the Academy Award\u2013winning 1973 film \"The Sting\", which featured several of Joplin's compositions. \"Treemonisha\", his second opera, was produced in 1972; and, in 1976, Joplin was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nJoplin was the second of six children born to Giles Joplin, a former slave from North Carolina, and Florence Givens, a freeborn African-American woman from Kentucky. His birth date was accepted by early biographers Rudi Blesh and James Haskins as November 24, 1868, although later biographer Edward A. Berlin showed this was most likely incorrect. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted he was born between the summer of 1867 and January 1868. There is disagreement over his exact place of birth in Texas, with Blesh identifying Texarkana, and Berlin showing the earliest record of Joplin being the June 1870 census which locates him as a two-year-old in Linden (about 40 miles from Texarkana).\nBy 1880, the Joplins had moved to Texarkana, Arkansas, where Giles worked as a railroad laborer and Florence as a cleaner. As Joplin's father had played the violin for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo, Joplin was given a rudimentary musical education by his family, and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned.\nAt some point in the early 1880s, Giles Joplin left the family for another woman and Florence struggled to support her children through domestic work. Biographer Susan Curtis speculates that Florence's support of her son's musical education was a critical factor behind her separation from Giles, who wanted the boy to pursue practical employment that would supplement the family income.\nAt 16, Joplin performed in a vocal quartet with three other boys in and around Texarkana, also playing piano. He also taught guitar and mandolin. According to a family friend, the young Joplin was serious and ambitious in studying music and playing the piano after school. While a few local teachers aided him, he received most of his musical education from Julius Weiss, a German-born American Jewish music professor who had immigrated to Texas in the late 1860s and was employed as music tutor by a prominent local business family. Weiss, as described by \"San Diego Jewish World\" writer Eric George Tauber, \"was no stranger to [receiving] race hatred ... As a Jew in Germany, he was often slapped and called a 'Christ-killer'\". Weiss had studied music at a German university and was listed in town records as a professor of music. Impressed by Joplin's talent, and realizing the Joplin family's dire straits, Weiss taught him free of charge. While tutoring Joplin from the ages of 11 to 16, Weiss introduced him to folk and classical music, including opera. Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an \"art as well as an entertainment\" and helped Florence acquire a used piano. According to Joplin's widow Lottie, Joplin never forgot Weiss. In his later years, after achieving fame as a composer, Joplin sent his former teacher \"gifts of money when he was old and ill\" until Weiss died.\nLife in the Southern states and Chicago.\nIn the late 1880s, having performed at various local events as a teenager, Joplin gave up his job as a railroad laborer and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician. Little is known about his movements at this time, although he is recorded in Texarkana in July 1891 as a member of the Texarkana Minstrels, who were raising money for a monument to Jefferson Davis, president of the former Confederate States of America. However, Joplin soon learned that there were few opportunities for black pianists. Churches and brothels were among the few options for steady work. Joplin played pre-ragtime \"jig-piano\" in various red-light districts throughout the mid-South, and some claim he was in Sedalia and St. Louis, Missouri, during this time.\nIn 1893, while in Chicago for the World's Fair, Joplin formed a band in which he played cornet and also arranged the band's music. Although the World's Fair minimized the involvement of African Americans, black performers still came to the saloons, caf\u00e9s, and brothels that lined the fair. The exposition was attended by 27 million visitors and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life, including ragtime. Although specific information is sparse, numerous sources have credited the Chicago World's Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime. Joplin found that his music, as well as that of other black performers, was popular with visitors. By 1897, ragtime had become a national craze in U.S. cities and was described by the \"St. Louis Dispatch\" as \"a veritable call of the wild, which mightily stirred the pulses of city-bred people\".\nLife in Missouri.\nIn 1894, Joplin arrived in Sedalia, Missouri. At first, Joplin stayed with the family of Arthur Marshall, a 13-year-old boy who later became one of Joplin's students and a ragtime composer in his own right. There is no record of Joplin having a residence in the town until 1904, as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician.\nThere is little precise evidence known about Joplin's activities at this time, although he performed as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia, the Black 400 Club and the Maple Leaf Club. He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own six-piece dance orchestra. A tour with his own singing group, the Texas Medley Quartet, gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions, and it is known that he went to Syracuse, New York, and Texas. Three businessmen from Syracuse (M. L. Mantell and the Leiter brothers) published Joplin's first two works, the songs \"Please Say You Will\" and \"A Picture of Her Face\", in 1895. Joplin's visit to Temple, Texas, enabled him to have three pieces published there in 1896, including the \"Great Crush Collision March\", which commemorated a planned train crash on the Missouri\u2013Kansas\u2013Texas Railroad on September 15 that he may have witnessed. The march was described by one of Joplin's biographers as a \"special ... early essay in ragtime\". While in Sedalia, Joplin taught piano to students who included future ragtime composers Arthur Marshall, Brun Campbell and Scott Hayden. Joplin enrolled at the George R. Smith College, where he apparently studied \"advanced harmony and composition\". The college's records were destroyed in a fire in 1925, and biographer Edward A. Berlin notes that it was unlikely that a small college for African-Americans would be able to provide such a course.\nAlthough there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" was published, Joplin was not far behind. He completed his first published rag, \"Original Rags\" in 1897, the same year that the first ragtime work appeared in print, the \"Mississippi Rag\" by William Krell. The \"Maple Leaf Rag\" was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in 1899; Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around 1898. The exact circumstances that led to the publication of the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" are unknown and a number of versions of the event contradict each other. After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers, Joplin signed a contract on August 10, 1899, with John Stillwell Stark, a retailer of musical instruments who became his most important publisher. The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a 1% royalty on all sales of the rag, with a minimum sales price of 25 cents. With the inscription \"To the Maple Leaf Club\" prominently visible along the top of at least some editions, it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club, although there is no direct evidence to prove the link, and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time.\nThere have been many claims about the sales of the \"Maple Leaf Rag\", one being that Joplin was the first musician to sell 1 million copies of a piece of instrumental music. Joplin's first biographer, Rudi Blesh, wrote that during its first six months the piece sold 75,000 copies and became \"the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America\". However, research by Joplin's later biographer Edward A. Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case; the initial print-run of 400 took one year to sell, and, under the terms of Joplin's contract with a 1% royalty, would have given Joplin an income of $4 (or approximately $\u00a0at current prices). Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses. In 1909, estimated sales would have given him an income of $600 annually (approximately $16,968\u00a0in current prices).\nThe \"Maple Leaf Rag\" did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers, especially in the development of classic ragtime. After the publication of the \"Maple Leaf Rag\", Joplin was soon being described as \"King of rag time writers\", not least by himself on the covers of his own work, such as \"The Easy Winners\" and \"Elite Syncopations\".\nDuring his time in St. Louis, Joplin collaborated with Scott Hayden in the composition of four rags. It was in St. Louis that Joplin produced some of his best-known works, including \"The Entertainer\", \"March Majestic\", and the short theatrical work \"The Ragtime Dance\". In 1901, Joplin married his first wife Belle Jones (1875\u20131903) a sister-in-law of Scott Hayden. By 1903, the Joplins had moved to a 13-room house, renting some of the rooms to lodgers, who included pianist-composers Arthur Marshall and Scott Hayden. Joplin did not work as a pianist in the saloons in St Louis, which was usually a major source of income for musicians, as he was \"probably outclassed by the competition\" and was, according to Stark's son, \"a mediocre pianist\". Biographer Berlin speculated that by 1903 Joplin was already showing early signs of syphilis, which reduced his coordination and \"pianistic skills\". In 1903, Joplin's only child\u2014a daughter\u2014died. After returning to Arkansas, Joplin and his first wife drifted apart, ending their marriage.\nIn June 1904, Joplin married Freddie Alexander of Little Rock, Arkansas, the young woman to whom he had dedicated \"The Chrysanthemum\". She died on September 10, 1904, of complications resulting from a cold, ten weeks after their wedding. \"Bethena\", Joplin's first work copyrighted after Freddie's death, was described by one biographer as \"an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtime waltzes\".\nDuring this time, Joplin created an opera company of 30 people and produced his first opera \"A Guest of Honor\" for a national tour. It is not certain how many productions were staged, or even whether this was an all-black show or a racially mixed production. During the tour, either in Springfield, Illinois, or Pittsburg, Kansas, someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts. Joplin could not meet the company's payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house. It is believed that the score for \"A Guest of Honor\" was lost and perhaps destroyed because of non-payment of the company's boarding house bill.\nLater years and death.\nIn 1907, Joplin moved to New York City, which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera. After his move to New York, Joplin met Lottie Stokes, whom he married in 1909. In 1911, unable to find a publisher, Joplin undertook the financial burden of publishing \"Treemonisha\" himself in piano-vocal format. In 1915, as a last-ditch effort to see it performed, he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall in Harlem. Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment, it was \"a miserable failure\" to a public not ready for \"crude\" black musical forms\u2014so different from the European grand opera of that time. The audience, including potential backers, was indifferent and walked out. Scott writes that \"after a disastrous single performance...Joplin suffered a breakdown. He was bankrupt, discouraged, and worn out.\" He concludes that few American artists of his generation faced such obstacles: \"\"Treemonisha\" went unnoticed and unreviewed, largely because Joplin had abandoned commercial music in favor of art music, a field closed to African Americans.\" It was not until the 1970s that the opera received a full theatrical staging.\nIn 1914, Joplin and Lottie self-published his \"Magnetic Rag\" as the Scott Joplin Music Company, which he had formed the previous December. Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due to syphilis and was \"consciously racing against time\". In her sleeve notes on the 1992 Deutsche Grammophon release of \"Treemonisha\", she notes that he \"plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera, day and night, with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts, page by page, as each page of the full score was completed.\"\nBy 1916, Joplin had developed tertiary syphilis, but more specifically it was likely neurosyphilis. On February 2, 1917, he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital, a mental institution. The \"King of Ragtime\" died there on April 1 of syphilitic dementia at the age of 48 and was buried in a pauper's grave that remained unmarked for 57 years. His grave, located at St. Michael's Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in 1974, the year \"The Sting\", which showcased his music, won Best Picture at the Oscars.\nWorks.\nThe combination of classical music, the musical atmosphere present around Texarkana (including work songs, gospel hymns, spirituals and dance music), and Joplin's natural ability have been cited as contributing to the invention of ragtime: a new style that blended African-American musical styles with European forms and melodies and first became celebrated in the 1890s .\nWhen Joplin was learning the piano, serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs \"cranked out by the tune-smiths of Tin Pan Alley\". As a composer, Joplin refined ragtime, elevating it above the low and unrefined form played by the \"wandering honky-tonk pianists ... playing mere dance music\" of popular imagination. This new art form, the classic rag, combined Afro-American folk music's syncopation and 19th-century European romanticism, with its harmonic schemes and its march-like tempos. In the words of one critic: \"Ragtime was basically...an Afro-American version of the polka, or its analog, the Sousa-style march.\" With this as a foundation, Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them\u2014without improvisation. Joplin wrote his rags as \"classical\" music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its \"cheap bordello\" origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as \"more tuneful, contrapuntal, infectious, and harmonically colorful than any others of his era\".\nSome speculate that Joplin's achievements were influenced by his classically trained German music teacher Julius Weiss, who may have brought a polka rhythmic sensibility from the old country to the 11-year old Joplin. As Curtis put it, \"The educated German could open up the door to a world of learning and music of which young Joplin was largely unaware.\"\nJoplin's first and most significant hit, the \"Maple Leaf Rag\", was described as the archetype of the classic rag and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least 12 years after its initial publication, thanks to its rhythmic patterns, melody lines, and harmony, though with the exception of Joseph Lamb and James Scott, they generally failed to enlarge upon it. Joplin used the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" as inspiration for subsequent works, such as \"The Cascades\" in 1903, \"Leola\" in 1905, \"Gladiolus Rag\" in 1907, and \"Sugar Cane Rag\" in 1908. While he used similar harmonic and melodic patterns, the later compositions were not simple copies but were distinctly new works, which used dissonance, chromatic sections and the blues third.\n\"Treemonisha\".\nThe opera's setting is a former slave community in an isolated forest near Joplin's childhood town Texarkana in September 1884. The plot centers on an 18-year-old woman Treemonisha who is taught to read by a white woman and then leads her community against the influence of conjurers who prey on ignorance and superstition. Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps' nest when her friend Remus rescues her. The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader.\nJoplin wrote both the score and the libretto for the opera, which largely follows the form of European opera with many conventional arias, ensembles and choruses. In addition, the themes of superstition and mysticism evident in \"Treemonisha\" are common in the operatic tradition, and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composer Richard Wagner (of which Joplin was aware). A sacred tree that Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from in \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", and the retelling of the heroine's origins echos aspects of the opera \"Siegfried\". In addition, African-American folk tales also influence the story\u2014the wasp nest incident is similar to the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch.\n\"Treemonisha\" is not a ragtime opera\u2014because Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly, using them to convey \"racial character\" and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the 19th century. The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late 19th century, re-created by a \"skilled and sensitive participant\".\nBerlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin's own life. He notes that Lottie Joplin (the composer's third wife) saw a connection between the character Treemonisha's wish to lead her people out of ignorance and a similar desire in the composer. In addition, it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie, Joplin's second wife, because the date of the opera's setting was likely to have been the month of her birth.\nAt the time of the opera's publication in 1911, the \"American Musician and Art Journal\" praised it as \"an entirely new form of operatic art\". Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history, with its heroine \"a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes, notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement\". Curtis's conclusion is similar: \"In the end, \"Treemonisha\" offered a celebration of literacy, learning, hard work, and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race.\" Berlin describes it as a \"fine opera, certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States\", but later states that Joplin's own libretto showed the composer \"was not a competent dramatist\", with the book not up to the quality of the music.\nAs Rick Benjamin, the founder and director of the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra, found out, Joplin succeeded in performing \"Treemonisha\" for paying audiences in Bayonne, New Jersey, in 1913.\nPerformance skills.\nJoplin's skills as a pianist were described in glowing terms by a Sedalia newspaper in 1898, and fellow ragtime composers Arthur Marshall and Joe Jordan both said that he played the instrument well. However, the son of publisher John Stark stated that Joplin was a rather mediocre pianist and that he composed on paper, rather than at the piano. Artie Matthews recalled the \"delight\" the St. Louis players took in outplaying Joplin.\nWhile Joplin never made an audio recording, his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls for use in mechanical player pianos. All seven were made in 1916. Of these, the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of editing to correct the performance to strict rhythm and add embellishments, probably by the staff musicians at Connorized. Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin reached St. Louis, he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers, tremors, and an inability to speak clearly\u2014all symptoms of the syphilis that killed him in 1917. Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of \"Maple Leaf Rag\" on the UniRecord label from June 1916 as \"shocking...disorganized and completely distressing to hear\". While there is disagreement among piano-roll experts as to how much of this is due to the relatively primitive recording and production techniques of the time, Berlin notes that the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" roll was likely to be the truest record of Joplin's playing at the time. The roll, however, may not reflect his abilities earlier in life.\nLegacy.\nJoplin and his fellow ragtime composers rejuvenated American popular music, fostering an appreciation for African American music among European Americans by creating exhilarating and liberating dance tunes. \"Its syncopation and rhythmic drive gave it a vitality and freshness attractive to young urban audiences indifferent to Victorian proprieties...Joplin's ragtime expressed the intensity and energy of a modern urban America.\"\nJoshua Rifkin, a leading Joplin recording artist, wrote, \"A pervasive sense of lyricism infuses his work, and even at his most high-spirited, he cannot repress a hint of melancholy or adversity...He had little in common with the fast and flashy school of ragtime that grew up after him.\" Joplin historian Bill Ryerson adds that \"In the hands of authentic practitioners like Joplin, ragtime was a disciplined form capable of astonishing variety and subtlety...Joplin did for the rag what Chopin did for the mazurka. His style ranged from tones of torment to stunning serenades that incorporated the bolero and the tango.\" Biographer Susan Curtis wrote that Joplin's music had helped to \"revolutionise American music and culture\" by removing Victorian restraint.\nComposer and actor Max Morath found it striking that the vast majority of Joplin's work did not enjoy the popularity of the \"Maple Leaf Rag\", because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation, they remained obscure and unheralded during his life. According to music historian Ian Whitcomb, Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Joplin] opined that \"Maple Leaf Rag\" would make him \"King of Ragtime Composers\" but he also knew that he would not be a pop hero in his own lifetime. \"When I'm dead twenty-five years, people are going to recognize me\", he told a friend.\nJust over thirty years later he was recognized, and later historian Rudi Blesh wrote a large book about ragtime, which he dedicated to the memory of Joplin.\nAlthough he was penniless and disappointed at the end of his life, Joplin set the standard for ragtime compositions and played a key role in the development of ragtime music. While ragtime's popularity faded around then, New Orleans jazz, stride, and novelty piano subsequently adopted many of its traits. And as a pioneer composer and performer, he helped pave the way for young black artists to reach American audiences of all races. After his death, jazz historian Floyd Levin noted: \"Those few who realized his greatness bowed their heads in sorrow. This was the passing of the king of all ragtime writers, the man who gave America a genuine native music.\"\nRevival.\nRecordings of Joplin compositions were released by Tommy Dorsey in 1936, Jelly Roll Morton in 1939, and J. Russel Robinson in 1947. \"Maple Leaf Rag\" was the Joplin piece found most often on 78 rpm records.\nIn the 1960s, a small-scale reawakening of interest in classical ragtime was underway among some American music scholars, such as Trebor Tichenor, William Bolcom, William Albright, and Rudi Blesh. Audiophile Records released a two-record set, \"The Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin, The Greatest of Ragtime Composers\", performed by Knocky Parker, in 1970.\nIn 1968, Bolcom and Albright interested Joshua Rifkin, a young musicologist, in the body of Joplin's work. Together, they hosted an occasional ragtime-and-early-jazz evening on WBAI radio. In November 1970, Rifkin released a recording called \"\" on the classical label Nonesuch. It sold 100,000 copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch's first million-selling record. The \"Billboard\" Best-Selling Classical LPs chart for September 28, 1974, has the record at number 5, with the follow-up \"Volume 2\" at number 4, and a combined set of both volumes at number 3. Separately, both volumes had been on the chart for 64 weeks. In the top seven spots on that chart, six of the entries were recordings of Joplin's work, three of which were Rifkin's. Record stores found themselves for the first time putting ragtime in the classical music section. The album was nominated in 1971 for two Grammy Award categories: Best Album Notes and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra). Rifkin was also under consideration for a third Grammy for a recording not related to Joplin, but at the ceremony on March 14, 1972, Rifkin did not win in any category. He did a tour in 1974, which included appearances on BBC Television and a sell-out concert at London's Royal Festival Hall. In 1979, Alan Rich wrote in the magazine \"New York\" that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin's music on disc, Nonesuch Records \"created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival\".\nIn January 1971, Harold C. Schonberg, music critic at \"The New York Times\", having just heard the Rifkin album, wrote a featured Sunday edition article titled \"Scholars, Get Busy on Scott Joplin!\" Schonberg's call to action has been described as the catalyst for classical music scholars, the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life, to conclude that Joplin was a genius. Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library published a two-volume set of Joplin works in June 1971, titled \"The Collected Works of Scott Joplin\", stimulating a wider interest in the performance of Joplin's music.\nIn mid-February 1973 under the direction of Gunther Schuller, the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble recorded an album of Joplin's rags taken from the period collection \"Standard High-Class Rags\" titled \"Joplin: The Red Back Book\". The album won a Grammy Award as Best Chamber Music Performance in that year and became \"Billboard\" magazine's Top Classical Album of 1974. The group subsequently recorded two more albums for Golden Crest Records: \"More Scott Joplin Rags\" in 1974 and \"The Road From Rags To Jazz\" in 1975.\nIn 1973, film producer George Roy Hill contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately, asking both men to write the score for a film project he was working on: \"The Sting\". Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments. Instead, Hill found Marvin Hamlisch available and brought him into the project as composer. Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin's music for \"The Sting\", for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation on April 2, 1974. His version of \"The Entertainer\" reached number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the American Top 40 music chart on May 18, 1974, prompting \"The New York Times\" to write, \"The whole nation has begun to take notice.\" Because of the film and its score, Joplin's work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world, becoming (in the words of music magazine \"Record World\") the \"classical phenomenon of the decade\". Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin's style and his band adaptations from Schuller's style. Schuller said Hamlisch \"got the Oscar for music he didn't write (since it is by Joplin) and arrangements he didn't write, and 'editions' he didn't make. A lot of people were upset by that, but that's show biz!\"\nOn October 22, 1971, excerpts from \"Treemonisha\" were presented in concert form at Lincoln Center, with musical performances by Bolcom, Rifkin and Mary Lou Williams supporting a group of singers. Finally, on January 28, 1972, T.J. Anderson's orchestration of \"Treemonisha\" was staged for two consecutive nights, sponsored by the Afro-American Music Workshop of Morehouse College in Atlanta, with singers accompanied by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert Shaw, and choreography by Katherine Dunham. Schonberg remarked in February 1972 that the \"Scott Joplin Renaissance\" was in full swing and still growing. In May 1975, \"Treemonisha\" was staged in a full opera production by the Houston Grand Opera. The company toured briefly, then settled into an eight-week run in New York on Broadway at the Palace Theatre in October and November. This appearance was directed by Gunther Schuller, and soprano Carmen Balthrop alternated with Kathleen Battle as the title character. An \"original Broadway cast\" recording was produced. Because of the lack of national exposure given to the brief Morehouse College staging of the opera in 1972, many Joplin scholars wrote that the Houston Grand Opera's 1975 show was the first full production.\n1974 saw the Birmingham Royal Ballet under director Kenneth MacMillan create \"Elite Syncopations\", a ballet based on tunes by Joplin and other composers of the era. That year also brought the premiere by the Los Angeles Ballet of \"Red Back Book\", choreographed by John Clifford to Joplin rags from the collection of the same name, including both solo piano performances and arrangements for full orchestra.\nCopyright attorney Alvin Deutsch worked with Vera Brodsky Lawrence to make sure the Joplin estate owned the rights to his work. Deutsch negotiated with New York Public Library to get Treemonisha copyright and got the Joplin estate $60,000 in the 1970s when someone infringed on that copyright. Their work helped to mount the show \"Treemonisha\" via Dramatic Publishing.\nMuseum.\nThe home Joplin rented in St. Louis from 1900 to 1903 was recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and was saved from destruction by the local African American community. In 1983, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources made it the first state historic site in Missouri dedicated to African American heritage. At first it focused entirely on Joplin and ragtime music, ignoring the urban milieu which shaped his musical compositions. A newer heritage project has expanded coverage to include the more complex social history of black urban migration and the transformation of a multi-ethnic neighborhood to the contemporary community. Part of this diverse narrative now includes coverage of uncomfortable topics of racial oppression, poverty, sanitation, prostitution, and sexually transmitted diseases.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "29605", "revid": "42778291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29605", "title": "Syncopation", "text": "Off-beat rhythm\n&lt;score sound=\"1\" override_midi=\"3 over 2.mid\"&gt;\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\new voice \\relative c' {\n \\clef percussion\n \\numericTimeSignature\n \\time 6/8\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n \\new voice \\relative c' {\n \u00bb&lt;/score&gt; Vertical hemiola (the ratio 3:2)\nIn music, syncopation is a variety of rhythms played together to make a piece of music, making part or all of a tune or piece of music off-beat. More simply, syncopation is \"a disturbance or interruption of the regular flow of rhythm\": a \"placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn't normally occur\". It is the correlation of at least two sets of time intervals.\nSyncopation is used in many musical styles, such as electronic dance music. According to music producer Rick Snoman, \u201cAll dance music makes use of syncopation, and it\u2019s often a vital element that helps tie the whole track together\u201d.\nSyncopation can also occur when a strong harmony is simultaneous with a weak beat, for instance, when a 7th-chord is played on the second beat of a measure or a dominant chord is played at the fourth beat of a measure. The latter occurs frequently in tonal cadences for 18th- and early-19th-century music and is the usual conclusion of any section.\nA hemiola (the equivalent Latin term is sesquialtera) can also be considered as one straight measure in three with one long chord and one short chord and a syncope in the measure thereafter, with one short chord and one long chord. Usually, the last chord in a hemiola is a (bi-)dominant, and as such a strong harmony on a weak beat, hence a syncope.\nTypes of syncopation.\nTechnically, \"syncopation occurs when a temporary displacement of the regular metrical accent occurs, causing the emphasis to shift from a strong accent to a weak accent\". \"Syncopation is very simply, a deliberate disruption of the two- or three-beat stress pattern, most often by stressing an off-beat, or a note that is not on the beat.\"\nSuspension.\nFor the following example, there are two points of syncopation where the third beats are sustained from the second beats. In the same way, the first beat of the second bar is sustained from the fourth beat of the first bar.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThough syncopation may be very complex, dense or complex-looking rhythms often contain no syncopation. The following rhythm, though dense, stresses the regular downbeats, 1 and 4 (in ):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHowever, whether it is a placed rest or an accented note, any point in a piece of music that changes the listener's sense of the downbeat is a point of syncopation because it shifts where the strong and weak accents are built.\nOff-beat syncopation.\nThe stress can shift by less than a whole beat, so it occurs on an offbeat, as in the following example, where the stress in the first bar is shifted back by an eighth note (or quaver):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNote how in the sound bite, the piano's notes do not happen at the same time as the drum beat that simply keeps a regular rhythm. In contrast, a standard-rhythm piece would have the notes occur \"on\" the beat:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlaying a note ever so slightly before, or after, a beat is another form of syncopation because this produces an unexpected accent:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIt can be helpful to think of a rhythm in eighth notes and count it as \"1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and\". In general, emphasizing the \"and\" would be considered the off-beat (syncopated), whereas having the emphasis on the numbers is on-beat.\nAnticipated bass.\nAnticipated bass is a bass tone that comes syncopated shortly before the downbeat, which is used in Son montuno Cuban dance music. Timing can vary, but it usually occurs on the 2+ and the 4 of the time, thus anticipating the third and first beats. This pattern is known commonly as the Afro-Cuban bass tumbao.\nTransformation.\nRichard Middleton suggests adding the concept of transformation to Narmour's prosodic rules which create rhythmic successions in order to explain or generate syncopations. \"The syncopated pattern is heard 'with reference to', 'in light of', as a remapping of, its partner.\" He gives examples of various types of syncopation: Latin, backbeat, and before-the-beat. First however, one may listen to the audio example of stress on the \"strong\" beats, where expected: \nLatin equivalent of simple.\nIn the example below, for the first two measures an unsyncopated rhythm is shown in the first measure. The third measure has a syncopated rhythm in which the first and fourth beat are provided as expected, but the accent occurs unexpectedly in between the second and third beats, creating a familiar \"Latin rhythm\" known as tresillo.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBackbeat transformation of simple.\nThe accent may be shifted from the first to the second beat in duple meter (and the third to fourth in quadruple), creating the backbeat rhythm:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDifferent crowds will \"clap along\" at concerts either on 1 and 3 or on 2 and 4, as above.\n\"Satisfaction\" example.\nThe phrasing of the Rolling Stones' song \"Satisfaction\" is a good example of syncopation. It is derived here from its theoretic unsyncopated form, a repeated trochee (\u00af\u00a0\u02d8\u00a0\u00af\u00a0\u02d8). A backbeat transformation is applied to \"I\" and \"can't\", and then a before-the-beat transformation is applied to \"can't\" and \"no\".\n 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;\n Repeated trochee: \u00af \u02d8 \u00af \u02d8\n I can't get no \u2013 o\n Backbeat trans.: \u00af \u02d8 \u00af \u02d8\n I can't get no \u2013 o\n Before-the-beat: \u00af \u02d8 \u00af \u02d8\n I can't get no \u2013 o\nThis demonstrates how each syncopated pattern may be heard as a remapping, \"with reference to\" or \"in light of\", an unsyncopated pattern.\nHistory.\nSyncopation has been an important element of European musical composition since at least the Middle Ages. Many Italian and French compositions of the music of the 14th-century Trecento use syncopation, as in of the following madrigal by Giovanni da Firenze. (See also hocket.)\nThe refrain \"Deo Gratias\" from the 15th-century anonymous English \"Agincourt Carol\" is also characterised by lively syncopation:\nAccording to the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"[t]he 15th-century carol repertory is one of the most substantial monuments of English medieval music... The early carols are rhythmically straightforward, in modern time; later the basic rhythm is in , with many cross-rhythms... as in the famous Agincourt carol 'Deo gratias Anglia'. As in other music of the period, the emphasis is not on harmony, but on melody and rhythm.\"\nComposers of the musical High Renaissance Venetian School, such as Giovanni Gabrieli (1557\u20131612), exploited syncopation for both their secular madrigals and instrumental pieces and also in their choral sacred works, such as the motet \"Domine, Dominus noster\":\nDenis Arnold says: \"the syncopations of this passage are of a kind which is almost a Gabrieli fingerprint, and they are typical of a general liveliness of rhythm common to Venetian music\". The composer Igor Stravinsky, no stranger to syncopation himself, spoke of \"those marvellous rhythmic inventions\" that feature in Gabrieli's music.\nJ. S. Bach and George Handel used syncopated rhythms as an inherent part of their compositions. One of the best-known examples of syncopation in music from the Baroque era was the \"Hornpipe\" from Handel's \"Water Music\" (1733).\nChristopher Hogwood (2005, p.\u00a037) describes the Hornpipe as \u201cpossibly the most memorable movement in the collection, combining instrumental brilliance and rhythmic vitality\u2026 Woven amongst the running quavers are the insistent off-beat syncopations that symbolise confidence for Handel.\u201d Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 features striking deviations from the established rhythmic norm in its first and third movements. According to Malcolm Boyd, each ritornello section of the first movement, \"is clinched with an \"Epilog\" of syncopated antiphony\":\nBoyd also hears the coda to the third movement as \"remarkable... for the way the rhythm of the initial phrase of the fugue subject is expressed... with the accent thrown on to the second of the two minims (now staccato)\":\nHaydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert used syncopation to create variety especially in their symphonies. The beginning movement of Beethoven's \"Eroica\" Symphony No. 3 exemplifies powerfully the uses of syncopation in a piece in triple time. After producing a pattern of three beats to a bar at the outset, Beethoven disrupts it through syncopation in a number of ways:\n(1) By displacing the rhythmic emphasis to a weak part of the beat, as in the first violin part in bars 7\u20139:\nRichard Taruskin describes here how \"the first violins, entering immediately after the C sharp, are made palpably to totter for two bars\".\n(2) By placing accents on normally weak beats, as in bars 25\u201326 and 28\u201335:\nThis \"long sequence of syncopated sforzandi\" recurs later during the development section of this movement, in a passage that Antony Hopkins describes as \"a rhythmic pattern that rides roughshod over the properties of a normal three-in-a bar\".\n(3) By inserting silences (rests) at points where a listener might expect strong beats, in the words of George Grove, \"nine bars of discords given fortissimo on the weak beats of the bar\":\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

In the sense of the \"art of the general\", which included several subsets of skills including military tactics, siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in Eastern Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. From then until the 20th century, the word \"strategy\" came to denote \"a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills\" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact.\nStrategy is important because the resources available to achieve goals are usually limited. Strategy generally involves setting goals and priorities, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. It involves activities such as strategic planning and strategic thinking.\nHenry Mintzberg from McGill University defined strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions to contrast with a view of strategy as planning. while Max McKeown (2011) argues that \"strategy is about shaping the future\" and is the human attempt to get to \"desirable ends with available means\". Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as \"a system of finding, formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if followed faithfully.\"\nMilitary theory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Subordinating the political point of view to the military would be absurd, for it is policy that has created war...Policy is the guiding intelligence, and war only the instrument, not vice-versa.\u2014\u200a\nIn military theory, strategy is \"the utilization during both peace and war, of all of the nation's forces, through large scale, long-range planning and development, to ensure security and victory\" (\"Random House Dictionary\").\nThe father of Western modern strategic study, Carl von Clausewitz, defined military strategy as \"the employment of battles to gain the end of war.\" B. H. Liddell Hart's definition put less emphasis on battles, defining strategy as \"the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy\". Hence, both gave the pre-eminence to political aims over military goals. U.S. Naval War College instructor Andrew Wilson defined strategy as the \"process by which political purpose is translated into military action.\" Lawrence Freedman defined strategy as the \"art of creating power.\"\nEastern military philosophy dates back much further, with examples such as \"The Art of War\" by Sun Tzu dated around 500 B.C.\nCounterterrorism Strategy.\nBecause counterterrorism involves the synchronized efforts of numerous competing bureaucratic entities, national governments frequently create overarching counterterrorism strategies at the national level. A national counterterrorism strategy is a government's plan to use the instruments of national power to neutralize terrorists, their organizations, and their networks in order to render them incapable of using violence to instill fear and to coerce the government or its citizens to react in accordance with the terrorists' goals. The United States has had several such strategies in the past, including the \"United States National Strategy for Counterterrorism\" (2018); the Obama-era \"National Strategy for Counterterrorism\" (2011); and the \"National Strategy for Combatting Terrorism\" (2003). There have also been a number of ancillary or supporting plans, such as the 2014 \"Strategy to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\", and the 2016 \"Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States\". Similarly, the United Kingdom's counterterrorism strategy, CONTEST, seeks \"to reduce the risk to the UK and its citizens and interests overseas from terrorism so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.\"\nManagement theory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment.\u2014\u200a\nModern business strategy emerged as a field of study and practice in the 1960s; prior to that time, the words \"strategy\" and \"competition\" rarely appeared in the most prominent management literature.\nAlfred Chandler wrote in 1962 that: \"Strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals.\" Michael Porter defined strategy in 1980 as the \"...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals\" and the \"...combination of the \"ends\" (goals) for which the firm is striving and the \"means\" (policies) by which it is seeking to get there.\"\nDefinition.\nHenry Mintzberg described five definitions of strategy in 1998:\nComplexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.\nStrategic Problem.\nIn 1998, Crouch defined the strategic problem as maintaining flexible relationships that can range from intense competition to harmonious cooperation among different players in a dynamic market. While Crouch was open to the idea of cooperation between players, his approach still emphasized that strategy is shaped by market conditions and organizational structure. This view aligns with the definitions of strategy proposed by Porter and Mintzberg.\nIn contrast, Burnett regards strategy as a plan formulated through methodology in which the strategic problem encompasses six tasks: goal formulation, environmental analysis, strategy formulation, strategy evaluation, strategy implementation, and strategy control.\nThe literature identifies two main sources for defining a strategic problem. The first is related to environmental factors, and the second focuses on the organizational context (Mukherji and Hurtado, 2001). These two sources summarize three dimensions originally proposed by Ansoff and Hayes (1981). According to them, a strategic problem arises from analysis of internal and external issues, the processes to solve them, and the variables involved.\nIn Terra and Passador's view, organizations and the systems around them are tightly connected, so they rely on each other to survive. This means a strategy should balance being proactive and reactive. This involves recognizing the organization\u2019s impact on the environment and acting to minimize harm while adapting to new demands. The strategy should also align internal and external aspects of the organization and include all related entities. This helps build a complex socio-economic system where the organization is part of a sustainable ecosystem.\nComplexity theory.\nComplexity science, as articulated by R. D. Stacey, represents a conceptual framework capable of harmonizing emergent and deliberate strategies. Within complexity approaches the term \"strategy\" is intricately linked to action. Complexity theorists view programs merely as predetermined sequences effective in highly ordered and less chaotic environments. Conversely, strategy emerges from a simultaneous examination of determined conditions (order) and uncertainties (disorder) that drive action. Complexity theory posits that strategy involves execution, encompasses control and emergence, scrutinizes both internal and external organizational aspects, and can take the form of maneuvers or any other act or process.\nThe works of Stacey stand as pioneering efforts in applying complexity principles to the field of strategy. This author applied self-organization and chaos principles to describe strategy, organizational change dynamics, and learning. Their propositions advocate for strategy approached through choices and the evolutionary process of competitive selection. In this context, corrections of anomalies occur through actions involving negative feedback, while innovation and continuous change stem from actions guided by positive feedback.\nDynamically, complexity in strategic management can be elucidated through the model of \"Symbiotic Dynamics\" by Terra and Passador. This model conceives the social organization of production as an interplay between two distinct systems existing in a symbiotic relationship while interconnected with the external environment. The organization's social network acts as a self-referential entity controlling the organization's life, while its technical structure resembles a purposeful \"machine\" supplying the social system by processing resources. These intertwined structures exchange disturbances and residues while interacting with the external world through their openness. Essentially, as the organization produces itself, it also hetero-produces, surviving through energy and resource flows across its subsystems.\nThis dynamic has strategic implications, governing organizational dynamics through a set of attraction basins establishing operational and regenerative capabilities. Hence, one of the primary roles of strategists is to identify \"human attractors\" and assess their impacts on organizational dynamics. According to the theory of Symbiotic Dynamics, both leaders and the technical system can act as attractors, directly influencing organizational dynamics and responses to external disruptions. Terra and Passador further assert that while producing, organizations contribute to environmental entropy, potentially leading to abrupt ruptures and collapses within their subsystems, even within the organizations themselves. Given this issue, the authors conclude that organizations intervening to maintain the environment's stability within suitable parameters for survival tend to exhibit greater longevity.\nThe theory of Symbiotic Dynamics posits that organizations must acknowledge their impact on the external environment (markets, society, and the environment) and act systematically to reduce their degradation while adapting to the demands arising from these interactions. To achieve this, organizations need to incorporate all interconnected systems into their decision-making processes, enabling the envisioning of complex socio-economic systems where they integrate in a stable and sustainable manner. This blend of proactivity and reactivity is fundamental to ensuring the survival of the organization itself.\nComponents.\nProfessor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure he called a \"kernel\". The kernel has three parts: 1) A \"diagnosis\" that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A \"guiding policy\" for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent \"actions\" designed to carry out the guiding policy.\nPresident Kennedy illustrated these three elements of strategy in his Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962:\nRumelt wrote in 2011 that three important aspects of strategy include \"premeditation, the anticipation of others' behavior, and the purposeful design of coordinated actions.\" He described strategy as solving a design problem, with trade-offs among various elements that must be arranged, adjusted and coordinated, rather than a plan or choice.\nFormulation and implementation.\nStrategy typically involves two major processes: \"formulation\" and \"implementation\". \"Formulation\" involves analyzing the environment or situation, making a diagnosis, and developing guiding policies. It includes such activities as strategic planning and strategic thinking. \"Implementation\" refers to the action plans taken to achieve the goals established by the guiding policy.\nBruce Henderson wrote in 1981 that: \"Strategy depends upon the ability to foresee future consequences of present initiatives.\" He wrote that the basic requirements for strategy development include, among other factors: 1) extensive knowledge about the environment, market and competitors;\n2) ability to examine this knowledge as an interactive dynamic system; and\n3) the imagination and logic to choose between specific alternatives. Henderson wrote that strategy was valuable because of: \"finite resources, uncertainty about an adversary's capability and intentions; the irreversible commitment of resources; necessity of coordinating action over time and distance; uncertainty about control of the initiative; and the nature of adversaries' mutual perceptions of each other.\"\nGame theory.\nIn game theory, a player's strategy is any of the options that the player would choose in a specific setting. Any optimal outcomes they receive depend not only on their actions but also, the actions of other players.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; The dictionary definition of \"strategy\" at Wiktionary"}

He was one of four terrorist hijackers of United Airlines Flight 93 as part of the 11 September attacks. Despite his name, he was not related to the brothers Hamza al-Ghamdi or Ahmed al-Ghamdi who were part of the team that hijacked United Airlines Flight 175.\nBorn in Saudi Arabia, al-Ghamdi left his home to fight in Chechnya after dropping out of college, but was reported to have diverted to Afghanistan to train in an al-Qaeda camp. It was reported he was chosen by Osama bin Laden to participate in terrorist attacks in the United States and arrived in the U.S. in June 2001. During his stay in the U.S., he quietly settled in Florida, planning out how the attacks would commence and training on flight simulators.\nOn 11 September 2001, he boarded United 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which was diverted toward Washington D.C. under the control of lead hijacker and trained pilot Ziad Jarrah so that Jarrah could crash the plane into the U.S. Capitol as part of the coordinated attacks. The plane instead crashed into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after the passengers attempted to retake control of the plane in an uprising.\nEarly life and education.\nSaeed al-Ghamdi was from the al-Bahah Province of Saudi Arabia, and shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Ahmed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Haznawi, although he was not related to either al-Ghamdi. He may have been in contact with the two al-Ghamdis and al-Haznawi as early as 1999. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers. al-Ghamdi spent time in al Qasim province, Saudi Arabia where he transferred to college but soon dropped out and ceased contact with his family. While there he probably associated with the radical Saudi cleric named Sulayman al-Alwan as several other future hijackers had.\nAl-Ghamdi later headed to Chechnya to participate in the conflict against the Russians. At this time, Chechen fighters were turning away additional foreigners, many of whom ended up in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan to train and await entry to Chechnya. Saeed ended up at the Al Farouq training camp, where he met Ahmed al-Nami, and the brothers Wail and Waleed al-Shehri. The four reportedly pledged themselves to Jihad in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail Al-Shehri\u2014who had dubbed himself \"Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi\" after one of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's companions.\nSaeed Al-Ghamdi was known to Tawfiq bin Attash who is thought to have convinced him to become a martyr. Al-Ghamdi was at that time working as a security guard at Kandahar airport along with Waleed al-Shehri.\nSome time late in 2000, al-Ghamdi traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Majed Moqed, Wail al-Shehri, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi, and Ahmed al-Nami.\nOn 13 November 2000, another Saeed al-Ghamdi tried to obtain a visa to enter the United States, but was declined. Although the 9/11 Commission makes mention of him, there is no evidence he was associated with the hijackers.\nIn March 2001, al-Ghamdi was filmed in a farewell video that was later aired on al-Jazeera. In the video, many future 9/11 hijackers swear to become martyrs, although no details of the plot are revealed. al-Ghamdi referred to America as \"the enemy\", and is seen studying maps and flight manuals.\nIn the United States.\nOn 12 June 2001, Saeed al-Ghamdi applied for and received a second two-year US B-1/B-2 (tourist/business) visa in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. His application was submitted by a local travel agency and processed through Visa Express, a controversial US visa program in Saudi Arabia which was discontinued the following year.\nArriving in the U.S. on 27 June 2001, with Fayez Banihammad, Saeed shared an apartment with Ahmed al-Nami in Delray Beach, Florida. Oddly, he listed the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, as his permanent address on his driver's license. He was one of 9 hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001.\nAccording to al-Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda's documentary \"Top Secret: The Road to September 11\", three weeks prior to the attacks, Saeed is believed to have used the name 'Abdul Rahman' to send a message to Ramzi bin al-Shibh (who was posing as a girlfriend) online, in which he wrote\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first semester commences in three weeks. Two high schools and two universities. ... This summer will surely be hot ...19 certificates for private education and four exams. Regards to the professor. Goodbye.\u2014\u200a\nOn 7 September, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark International Airport aboard Spirit Airlines.\nAttacks.\nOn the morning of 11 September 2001, al-Ghamdi boarded United Airlines Flight 93 without incident. Due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day, and were told to be on the alert. Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well.\nAt least two of the cell phone calls made by passengers indicate that the hijackers were wearing red bandanas. The calls also indicated that one had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside.\nThe flight transcript suggests that three hijackers were in the cockpit. Ziad Jarrah was identified as the pilot and is heard calling the other hijacker \"Saeed\", indicating that al-Ghamdi, who also trained in flight simulators, was helping Jarrah with the controls.\nPassengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. A passenger uprising resulted in the plane crashing into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing everyone aboard.\nMistaken identity allegations.\nOn 23 September 2001, before the FBI had released the pictures of the hijackers, the BBC and \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that a Saudi Airlines pilot named Saeed al-Ghamdi was furious that a name on the hijacker's list released by the FBI matched his own. CNN also showed a picture of the \"living\" al-Ghamdi as the hijacker. The man claimed CNN likely got his picture from a Flight Safety flying school in Florida he attended. \"Der Spiegel\" later investigated the claims of \"living\" hijackers by the BBC and discovered them to be cases of mistaken identity.\nIn June 2005 the Saudi government released a list (see al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) of 36 wanted (and alive) terrorists, one of whom was Salih Saeed Al Batih al-Ghamdi. 9/11 conspiracy theorists quickly confused him with the hijacker Saeed al-Ghamdi.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "29612", "revid": "1071745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29612", "title": "Syncretism", "text": "Combination of beliefs and traditions\nSyncretism () is the combining or merging of various distinct beliefs or schools of thought. Syncretism is when certain elements, features and components of a religion are incorporated and absorbed into another religion or faith. It directs some sort of difference in both religions. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. While syncretism in art and culture is sometimes likened to eclecticism, in the realm of religion, it specifically denotes a more integrated merging of beliefs into a unified system, distinct from eclecticism, which implies a selective adoption of elements from different traditions without necessarily blending them into a new, cohesive belief system.\nEtymology.\nThe English word is first attested in the early 17th century. It is from Modern Latin , drawing on the (), supposedly meaning \"Cretan federation\". However, this is a spurious etymology derived from the naive idea in Plutarch's 1st-century AD essay on \"Fraternal Love (Peri Philadelphias)\" in his collection \"Moralia\". He cites the example of the Cretans, who compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. \"And that is their so-called \"Syncretism\" [Union of Cretans].\" A more likely etymology is from \"sun-\" (\"with\") plus \"kerannumi\" (\"mix\") and its related noun, \"krasis\" (\"mixture\").\nReligious syncretism.\nReligious syncretism is the blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions. This can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in a culture, or when a culture is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or (especially) practices.\nReligions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so-labelled systems often frown on applying the label, especially adherents who belong to \"revealed\" religious systems, such as the Abrahamic religions, or any system that exhibits an exclusivist approach. Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth. By this reasoning, adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true. Indeed, critics of a syncretistic trend may use the word or its variants as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system pervert the original faith. Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. Keith Ferdinando notes that the term \"syncretism\" is an elusive one, and can refer to substitution or modification of the central elements of a religion by beliefs or practices introduced from elsewhere. The consequence under such a definition, according to Ferdinando, can lead to a fatal \"compromise\" of the original religion's \"integrity\".\nIn modern secular society, religious innovators sometimes construct new faiths or key tenets syncretically, with the added benefit or aim of reducing inter-religious discord. Such chapters often have a side-effect of arousing jealousy and suspicion among authorities and ardent adherents of the pre-existing religion. Such religions tend to inherently appeal to an inclusive, diverse audience. Sometimes the state itself sponsored such new movements, such as the Living Church founded in Soviet Russia and the German Evangelical Church in Nazi Germany, chiefly to stem all outside influences.\nCriticism of the term.\nV\u00e9ronique Altglas argues that the use of the term \"syncretism\" is an effort to make some religious practices and religions seem less legitimate, pure, or well-established. She argues that the term \"syncretism\" presupposes that the religions that syncretism combines were \"pure\" and unchanging before being combined. In reality, she believes, religions are all inherently syncretic to some degree because they combine many elements from different people's spiritualities and religions and different cultures. The term \"syncretism\" can serve the ends of ethnocentrism and purism in some cases in this view.\nCultures and societies.\nAccording to some authors, \"Syncretism is often used to describe the product of the large-scale imposition of one alien culture, religion, or body of practices over another that is already present.\" Others such as Jerry H. Bentley, however, have argued that syncretism has also helped to create cultural compromise. It provides an opportunity to bring beliefs, values, and customs from one cultural tradition into contact with, and to engage different cultural traditions. Such a migration of ideas is generally successful only when there is a resonance between both traditions. While, as Bentley has argued, there are numerous cases where expansive traditions have won popular support in foreign lands, this is not always so.\nDin-i Ilahi.\nIn the 16th century, the Mughal emperor Akbar proposed a new religion called the Din-i Ilahi (\"Divine Faith\"). Sources disagree with respect to whether it was one of many Sufi orders or merged some of the elements of the various religions of his empire. Din-i Ilahi drew elements primarily from Islam and Hinduism but also from Christianity, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism. More resembling a personality cult than a religion, it had no sacred scriptures, no priestly hierarchy, and fewer than 20 disciples, all hand-picked by Akbar himself. It is also accepted that the policy of \"sulh-i-kul\", which formed the essence of the D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b, was adopted by Akbar as a part of general imperial administrative policy. \"Sulh-i-kul\" means \"universal peace\".\nEnlightenment.\nThe syncretic deism of Matthew Tindal undermined Christianity's claim to uniqueness. The modern, rational, non-pejorative connotations of syncretism arguably date from Denis Diderot's articles \"Eclecticisme\" and \"Syncr\u00e9tistes, H\u00e9notiques, ou Conciliateurs\". Diderot portrayed syncretism as the concordance of eclectic sources. Scientific or legalistic approaches of subjecting all claims to critical thinking prompted at this time much literature in Europe and the Americas studying non-European religions such as Edward Moor's \"The Hindu Pantheon\" of 1810, much of which was almost evangelistically appreciative by embracing spirituality and creating the space and tolerance in particular disestablishment of religion (or its stronger form, official secularisation as in France) whereby believers of spiritualism, agnosticism, atheists and in many cases more innovative or pre-Abrahimic based religions could promote and spread their belief system, whether in the family or beyond.\nExamples.\nOvert syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or previous tradition, but the \"other\" cult may survive or infiltrate without authorized \"syncresis\". For example, some conversos developed a sort of cult for martyr-victims of the Spanish Inquisition, thus incorporating elements of Catholicism while resisting it.\nThe Kushite kings who ruled Upper Egypt for approximately a century and the whole of Egypt for approximately 57 years, from 721 to 664 BCE, constituting the Twenty-fifth Dynasty in Manetho's \"Aegyptiaca\", developed a syncretic worship identifying their own god Dedun with the Egyptian Osiris. They maintained that worship even after they had been driven out of Egypt. A temple dedicated to this syncretic god, built by the Kushite ruler Atlanersa, was unearthed at Jebel Barkal.\nSyncretism was common during the Hellenistic period, with rulers regularly identifying local deities in various parts of their domains with the relevant god or goddess of the Greek Pantheon as a means of increasing the cohesion of their kingdom. This practice was accepted in most locations but vehemently rejected by the Jews, who considered the identification of Yahweh with the Greek Zeus as the worst of blasphemy.\nThe Roman Empire continued the practice, first by the identification of traditional Roman deities with Greek ones, producing a single Greco-Roman pantheon, and then identifying members of that pantheon with the local deities of various Roman provinces. \nIslam and Christianity, having largely displaced indigenous African religions, are often adapted to African cultural contexts and belief systems. African people often combine the practice of their traditional beliefs with the practice of Abrahamic religions. \nSome religious movements have embraced overt syncretism, such as the case of melding Shint\u014d beliefs into Buddhism or the amalgamation of Germanic and Celtic pagan views into Christianity during its spread into Gaul, Ireland, Britain, Germany and Scandinavia. In later times, Christian missionaries in North America identified Manitou, the spiritual and fundamental life force in the traditional beliefs of the Algonquian groups, with the God of Christianity. Similar identifications were made by missionaries at other locations in the Americas and Africa who encountered a local belief in a Supreme God or Supreme Spirit of some kind. \nIndian influences are seen in the practice of Shi'i Islam in Trinidad. Others have strongly rejected it as devaluing and compromising precious and genuine distinctions; examples include post-Exile Second Temple Judaism, Islam, and most of Protestant Christianity.\nSyncretism tends to facilitate coexistence and unity between otherwise different cultures and world views (intercultural competence), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic realms. Conversely, the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of \"piety\" and \"orthodoxy\", may help to generate, bolster or authenticate a sense of uncompromised cultural unity in a well-defined minority or majority.\nAll major religious conversions of populations have had elements from prior religious traditions incorporated into legends or doctrine that endure with the newly converted laity.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Modifications and Additions to a Reactor Facility (MARF) plant located at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory's Kesselring Site in Ballston Spa, New York. It consisted of an experimental reactor core installed in a modified S5W reactor plant.\nDesign and operation.\nInstead of the movable hafnium-based control rods used in all of the other United States Naval reactors, reactivity in the S7G core was controlled by stationary gadolinium-clad tubes partially filled with water. Water could be pumped from the portion of the tube inside the core up to a reservoir above the core, or allowed to flow back down into the tube. A higher water level in the tube slowed more neutrons in the core, causing more neutron capture by the gadolinium tube cladding rather than by the uranium fuel, thus lowering the power level.\nThe system was configured with the pump running continually to keep the water level low; on loss of electrical power, all of the water would flow back into the tube, shutting down the reactor. As with all small pressurized water reactors, the design also had the advantage of negative feedback: an increase in reactor power caused the water to expand, leading to reduced thermalization of neutrons and lowering absorption by the fuel, therefore lowering the power. Thus, changes in the average coolant temperature, notably from the steam demand of engine throttles, naturally maintains reactor power without intervention from a reactor operator.\nThe S7G reactor was never used on a ship.

English is included in this group. An example is \"Sam ate apples.\"\nSVO is the second-most common order by number of known languages, after SOV.

(\"The dog bit Andy\" and \"Andy bit the dog\" mean two completely different things, while, in case of \"Bit Andy the dog\", it may be difficult to determine whether it is a complete sentence or a fragment, with \"Andy the dog\" the object and an omitted/implied subject.) \nThe situation is more complex in languages that have no strict order of V and O imposed by their grammar. e.g. Russian, Finnish, Ukrainian, or Hungarian. Here, the ordering is rather governed by emphasis. \nRussian allows the use of subject, verb, and object in any order and \"shuffles\" parts to bring up a slightly different contextual meaning each time. E.g. \"\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0433\u043e\" (loves she him) may be used to point out \"she acts this way because she LOVES him\", or \"\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\" (him she loves) is used in the context \"if you pay attention, you'll see that HE is the one she truly loves\", or \"\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430\" (him loves she) may appear along the lines \"I agree that cat is a disaster, but since my wife adores it and I adore her...\". Regardless of order, it is clear that \"\u0435\u0433\u043e\" is the object because it is in the accusative case. \nIn Polish, SVO order is basic in an affirmative sentence, and a different order is used to either emphasize some part of it or to adapt it to a broader context logic. For example, (I won't buy you \"a bicycle\"), (I've been waiting \"since five\").\nIn Turkish, it is normal to use SOV, but SVO may be used sometimes to emphasize the verb. For example, \"John terk etti Mary'yi\" (Lit. \"John/left/Mary\": John left Mary) is the answer to the question \"What did John do with Mary?\" instead of the regular [SOV] sentence \"John Mary'yi terk etti\" (Lit. \"John/Mary/left\").\nGerman, Dutch, and Kashmiri display the order subject-verb-object in some, especially main clauses, but really are verb-second languages, not SVO languages in the sense of a word order type. They have SOV in subordinate clauses, as given in Example 1 below. Example 2 shows the effect of verb second order: the first element in the clause that comes before the V need not be the subject. In Kashmiri, the word order in embedded clauses is conditioned by the category of the subordinating conjunction, as in Example 3. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf the embedded clause is introduced by the transparent conjunction \"zyi\" the SOV order changes to SVO. \"mye ees phyikyir (zyi) tsi maa dyikh temyis ciThy\".\nEnglish developed from such a reordering language and still bears traces of this word order, for example in locative inversion (\"In the garden sat a cat.\") and some clauses beginning with negative expressions: \"only\" (\"Only then do we find X.\"), \"not only\" (\"Not only did he storm away but also slammed the door.\"), \"under no circumstances\" (\"under no circumstances are the students allowed to use a mobile phone\"), \"never\" (\"Never have I done that.\"), \"on no account\" and the like. In such cases, \"do\"-support is sometimes required, depending on the construction.\nSVO order is permitted in Ho, although the predominant clausal constituent order of the language is SOV. For example: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies in the northern part of the country, in the Skopje Valley along the Vardar River, and is the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country. As of the 2021 census, the city had a population of 526,502. Skopje covers and includes both urban and rural areas, bordered by several municipalities and close to the borders of Kosovo and Serbia.\nThe area of Skopje has been continuously inhabited since at least the Chalcolithic period. The city \u2014 known as \"Scupi\" at the time \u2014 was founded in the late 1st century during the rule of Domitian, and abandoned in 518 after an earthquake destroyed the city. It was rebuilt under Justinian I. It became a significant settlement under the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Empire (when it served briefly as a capital), and later under the Ottoman Empire, which ruled the city for over five centuries. In 1912, following the Balkan Wars, Skopje was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia. It became part of Yugoslavia after World War I and, following World War II, became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of its constituent republics. In 1963, a major earthquake devastated the city, after which it was largely rebuilt with international assistance. Skopje became the capital of independent North Macedonia in 1991.\nThe city has a diverse population, with ethnic Macedonians forming a majority and Albanians a significant minority, alongside Roma, Turks, Serbs, and others. It is also religiously diverse, with Orthodox Christianity and Islam being the most widely practised faiths. Skopje is the site of major educational and cultural institutions, including the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the National Theatre.\nSkopje is the country's centre of government and business and produces a significant share of the national GDP. Its economy is based on industry, trade, services, and finance. The city has undergone major transformations in recent decades, notably through the controversial Skopje 2014 project, which aimed to reshape the city centre with neoclassical buildings and monuments.\nName.\nThe city is attested for the first name in \"Geography\" by Ptolemy c.\u2009AD 150 as one of the cities of Roman Dardania. Ptolemy describes the city in Latin as and ancient Greek as . The toponym likely belongs to a group of similar Illyrian toponyms which have been transmitted to Slavic languages in the same way as the modern Macedonian toponym \"Skopje\": and in Bosnia, in Dalmatia (Croatia).\n', the name of the city in Albanian, developed directly from Roman-era ' in agreement with the Albanian phonological development, the basis of evidence of an earlier Albanian settlement in the area. ' is the definite form of ' in Albanian. \"Skopje\", the name of the city during the Middle Ages, is the local Slavic (Macedonian) rendition of \"Scupi\". The Ottoman Turkish rendition of the city's name is () and it was adapted in Western languages in \"Uskub\" or \"Uskup\", and these two appellations were used in the Western world until 1912. Some Western sources also cite \"Scopia\" and \"Skopia\". is the name of the city in Aromanian.\nWhen Vardar Macedonia was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1912, the city officially became () and many languages adopted this name. To reflect local pronunciation, the city's name was eventually spelled as () after the Second World War, when standard Macedonian became the official language of the new Socialist Republic of Macedonia.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nSkopje is in the north of the country, in the centre of the Balkan peninsula, and approximately halfway between Belgrade and Athens. The city was built in the Skopje Valley, oriented on a west\u2013east axis, along the course of the Vardar river, which flows into the Aegean Sea in Greece. The valley is approximately wide and it is limited by several mountain ranges to the north and south. These ranges limit the urban expansion of Skopje, which spreads along the Vardar and the Serava, a small river which comes from the north. In its administrative boundaries, the City of Skopje stretches for more than , but it is only wide.\nSkopje is approximately 245 m above sea level and covers 571.46\u00a0km2. The urbanised area only covers 337\u00a0km2, with a density of 65 inhabitants per hectare. Skopje, in its administrative limits, encompasses many villages and other settlements, including Dra\u010devo, Gorno Nerezi and Bardovci. According to the 2021 census, the City of Skopje had 526,502 inhabitants.\nThe City of Skopje reaches the Kosovo border to the north-east. Clockwise, it is also bordered by the municipalities of \u010cu\u010der-Sandevo, Lipkovo, Ara\u010dinovo, Ilinden, Studeni\u010dani, Sopi\u0161te, \u017delino and Jegunovce.\nHydrography.\nThe Vardar river, which flows through Skopje, is at approximately from its source near Gostivar. In Skopje, its average discharge is 51 m3/s, with a wide amplitude depending on seasons, between 99.6 m3/s in May and 18.7 m3/s in July. The water temperature is between 4.6\u00a0\u00b0C in January and 18.1\u00a0\u00b0C in July.\nSeveral rivers meet the Vardar within the city boundaries. The largest is the Treska, which is long. It crosses the Matka Canyon before reaching the Vardar on the western extremity of the City of Skopje. The Lepenac, coming from Kosovo, flows into the Vardar on the north-western end of the urban area. The Serava, also coming from the north, had flowed through the Old Bazaar until the 1960s when it was diverted towards the west because its waters were very polluted. Originally, it met the Vardar close to the seat of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Nowadays, it flows into the Vardar near the ruins of Scupi. Markova Reka, which originates in Mount Vodno, meets the Vardar at the eastern extremity of the city. These three rivers are less than long.\nThe City of Skopje incorporates two artificial lakes, on the Treska. Lake Matka is the result of the construction of a dam in Matka Canyon in the 1930s, and the Treska Lake was dug for leisure purposes in 1978. Three small natural lakes can be found near Smilkovci, on the north-eastern edge of the urban area.\nThe river Vardar historically caused many floods, such as in 1962, when its outflow reached 1110 m3/s\u22121. Several works have been carried out since Byzantine times to limit the risks, and since the construction of the Kozjak dam on the Treska in 1994, the flood risk is close to zero.\nThe subsoil contains a large water table which is alimented by the Vardar and functions as an underground river. Under the table lies an aquifer contained in marl. The water table is 4 to 12 m under the ground and 4 to 144 m deep. Several wells collect its waters but most of the drinking water used in Skopje comes from a karstic spring in Ra\u0161\u010de, west of the city.\nGeology.\nThe Skopje valley is bordered on the west by the \u0160ar Mountains, on the South by the Jakupica range, on the east by hills belonging to the Osogovo range, and on the north by the Skopska Crna Gora. Mount Vodno, the highest point inside the city limits, is 1066 m high and is part of the Jakupica range.\nAlthough Skopje is built on the foot of Mount Vodno, the urban area is mostly flat. It comprises several minor hills, generally covered with woods and parks, such as Gazi Baba hill (325 m), Zaj\u010dev Rid (327 m), the foothills of Mount Vodno (the smallest are between 350 and 400 m high) and the promontory on which Skopje Fortress is built.\nThe Skopje valley is near a seismic fault between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates and experiences regular seismic activity. This activity in enhanced by the porous structure of the subsoil. Large earthquakes occurred in Skopje in 518, 1555 and 1963.\nThe Skopje valley belongs to the Vardar geotectonic region, the subsoil of which is formed of Neogene and Quaternary deposits. The substratum is made of Pliocene deposits including sandstone, marl, and various conglomerates. It is covered by a first layer of Quaternary sands and silt, which is between 70 and 90 m deep. The layer is topped by a much smaller layer of clay, sand, silt, and gravel, carried by the Vardar river. It is between 1.5 and 5.2 m deep.\nIn some areas, the subsoil is karstic. It led to the formation of canyons, such as the Matka Canyon, which is surrounded by ten caves. They are between 20 and 176 m deep.\nClimate.\nSkopje has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa\") with a mean annual temperature of . Precipitation is relatively low due to the pronounced rain shadow of the Accursed Mountains to the north-west, being significantly less than what is received on the Adriatic Sea coast at the same latitude. The summers are long, hot and relatively dry with low humidity.\nWinters are short, relatively cold and wet. Snowfall is common in the winter period, but heavy snow accumulation is rare and the snow cover lasts only for a few hours or a few days if heavy. In summer, temperatures are usually above and sometimes above . In spring and autumn, the temperatures range from . In winter, the day temperatures are roughly in the range from , but at nights they often fall below and sometimes below . Typically, temperatures throughout one year range from \u221213\u00a0\u00b0C to 39\u00a0\u00b0C.\nEnvironment.\nThe City of Skopje encompasses various natural environments, having diverse fauna and flora. However, it is threatened by the intensification of agriculture and urban extension. The largest protected area within the city limits is Mount Vodno, which is a popular leisure destination. A cable car connects its peak to the downtown, and many pedestrian paths run through its woods. Other large natural spots include the Matka Canyon.\nThe city itself comprises several parks and gardens amounting to 4,361 hectares. Amongst these are the City Park, built by the Ottoman Turks at the beginning of the 20th century; \u017dena Borec Park, in front of the Parliament; the university arboretum; and the Gazi Baba forest. Many streets and boulevards are planted with trees.\nSteel processing\u2014a crucial activity for the local economy\u2014is responsible for soil pollution with heavy metals such as lead, zinc and cadmium, and air pollution with nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide. Vehicle traffic and district heating plants are also responsible for air pollution.\nWater treatment plants are being built, but much of the polluted water is still being discharged untreated into the Vardar. Waste is disposed of in the open-air municipal landfill site, north of the city. Every day, it receives 1,500 m3 of domestic waste and 400 m3 of industrial waste. Health levels are better in Skopje than in the rest of North Macedonia, and no link has been found between the low environmental quality and the health of the residents.\nUrbanism.\nUrban morphology.\nThe urban morphology of Skopje was deeply impacted by the 1963 earthquake, which destroyed 80% of the city, and by its subsequent reconstruction. For instance, neighbourhoods were rebuilt in such a way that the demographic density remains low to limit the impact of potential future earthquakes.\nReconstruction following the 1963 earthquake was mainly conducted by the Polish architect Adolf Ciborowski, who had already planned the reconstruction of Warsaw after World War II. Ciborowski divided the city into blocks dedicated to specific activities. The banks of the Vardar river became natural areas and parks, areas between the main boulevards were built with high-rise housing and shopping centres, and the suburbs were left to individual housing and industry. Reconstruction had to be quick to relocate families and to relaunch the local economy. To stimulate economic development, the number of thoroughfares was increased, and future urban extension was anticipated.\nThe south bank of the Vardar River generally comprises high-rise tower blocks, including the vast Karpo\u0161 neighbourhood which was built in the 1970s west of the city centre. Towards the east, the new municipality of Aerodrom was planned in the 1980s to house 80,000 inhabitants on the site of the old airport. Between Karpo\u0161 and Aerodrom lies the city centre, rebuilt according to plans by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. The centre is surrounded by a row of long buildings suggesting a wall ().\nOn the north bank, where the most ancient parts of the city lie, the Old Bazaar was restored and its surroundings were rebuilt with low-rise buildings, so as not to spoil views of the Skopje Fortress. Several institutions, including the university and the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, were also relocated to the north bank to reduce borders between the ethnic communities. The north bank is mostly inhabited by Muslim Albanians, Turks, and Roma, whereas Christian ethnic Macedonians predominantly reside on the south bank.\nThe earthquake left the city with few historical monuments, apart from the Ottoman-era Old Bazaar, and the reconstruction, conducted between the 1960s and 1980s, turned Skopje into a modernist city. At the end of the 2000s, the city centre experienced profound changes. A highly controversial urban project, Skopje 2014, was adopted by the municipal authorities to give the city a more monumental and historical aspect, and thus to transform it into a proper national capital. Several neoclassical buildings destroyed in the 1963 earthquake were rebuilt, including the national theatre, and the streets and squares were refurbished. Many other elements were also built, including fountains, statues, hotels, government buildings and bridges. The project has been criticised because of its cost and its historicist aesthetics. The large Albanian minority felt it was not represented in the new monuments, and launched side projects, including a new square over the boulevard that separates the city centre from the Old Bazaar.\nUrban sociology.\nSkopje is an ethnically diverse city, and its urban sociology primarily depends on ethnic and religious affiliation. Macedonians form 66% of the city population, whilst Albanians and Roma account respectively for 20% and 6%. Each ethnic group generally self-segregates itself to certain areas of the city. Macedonians live south of the Vardar in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, whilst Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are considered more traditional, whereas the south side evokes modernity to Macedonians.\nThe northern areas are the poorest; this is especially true for Topaana, in \u010cair municipality, and for \u0160uto Orizari municipality, which are the two main Roma neighbourhoods. They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to the electric grid nor water supply, which are passed from one generation to another. Topaana, close to the Old Bazaar, is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood in the beginning of the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. \u0160uto Orizari, on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with Romani as its local official language. It was developed after the 1963 earthquake to accommodate Roma who had lost their homes.\nThe population density varies greatly from one area to another. So does the size of the living area per person. The city average was at per person as of 2002[ [update]], but at in Centar on the south bank, and only in \u010cair on the north bank. In \u0160uto Orizari, the average was at .\nLocalities and villages.\nOutside of the urban area, the City of Skopje encompasses many small settlements. Some of them are becoming outer suburbs, such as \u010cento, on the road to Belgrade, which has more than 23,000 inhabitants, and Dra\u010devo, which has almost 20,000 inhabitants. Other large settlements are north of the city, such as Radi\u0161ani, with 9,000 inhabitants, whereas smaller villages can be found on Mount Vodno or in Saraj municipality, which is the most rural of the ten municipalities that form the City of Skopje.\nSome localities outside the city limits are also becoming outer suburbs, particularly in Ilinden and Petrovec municipality. They benefit from the presence of major roads, railways, and the airport, Skopje International, in Petrovec.\nPollution.\nAir pollution is a serious problem in Skopje, especially in winter. Concentrations of certain types of particulate matter (PM2 and PM10) are regularly over twelve times the WHO-recommended maximum levels. In winter, smoke regularly obscures vision and can lead to problems for motorists. Together with Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia has the most polluted urban areas in Europe.\nSkopje's high levels of pollution are caused by a combination of smoke from houses, emissions from the industry, public and private transport, and a general lack of interest in caring for the environment. Central heating is often not affordable, and so households often burn firewood, as well as used car tyres, plastic waste, petroleum, and other possibly flammable waste, which emits toxic chemicals harmful to the population, especially to children and the elderly.\nThe city's smog has reduced its air quality and affected the health of many of its citizens, with the average lifespan in Skopje being reduced by between two to three years due to this pollution.\nAn application called \"AirCare\" () has been launched by local eco-activist Gorjan Jovanovski to help citizens track pollution levels. It uses a traffic light system, with purple for heavily polluted air, red for high levels detected, amber for moderate levels detected, and green for when the air is safe to inhale. The application relies on both government and volunteer sensors to track hourly air pollution. Unfortunately, government sensors are frequently inoperable and malfunctioning, causing the need for more low-cost, but less accurate, volunteer sensors to be put up by citizens. Faults on government sensors are especially frequent when the pollution is measured is extremely high, according to the AQILHC (Air Quality Index Levels of Health Concern).\nSkopje topped the ranks in December 2017 as one of the most polluted cities in the world. In 2017, as part of the city's efforts to reduce pollution, a CityTree was installed, and promoted by German ambassador Christine Althauser.\nOn 29 November 2019, a march, organised by the Skopje Smog Alarm activist community, attracted thousands of people who opposed the government's lack of action in dealing with the city's pollution, which has worsened since 2017, contributing to around 1300 deaths annually.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTimeline of Skopje &lt;br&gt;\n \u00a0Dardanian Kingdom, 230\u201328 BC\n\u00a0Roman Empire, 28 BC\u2013395 \n\u00a0Byzantine Empire, 395\u2013836\n\u00a0First Bulgarian Empire, 836\u20131004\n\u00a0Byzantine Empire, 1004\u20131093\n\u00a0Grand Principality of Serbia, 1093\u20131097\n\u00a0Byzantine Empire, 1098\u20131203\n\u00a0Second Bulgarian Empire, 1203\u20131246\n\u00a0Empire of Nicaea, 1246\u20131255\n\u00a0Second Bulgarian Empire, 1255\u20131256\n\u00a0Empire of Nicaea, 1256\u20131261\n\u00a0Byzantine Empire, 1261\u20131282\n Kingdom of Serbia, 1282\u20131346\n Serbian Empire, 1346\u20131371\n District of Brankovi\u0107, 1371\u20131392\n Ottoman Empire, 1392\u20131912\n Kingdom of Serbia 1912\u20131915\n Tsardom of Bulgaria 1915\u20131918\n Kingdom of Yugoslavia 1918\u20131941\n Tsardom of Bulgaria 1941\u20131944\n Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (Democratic Federal Macedonia) 1944\u20131946\n Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Socialist Republic of Macedonia) 1946\u20131992\n North Macedonia 1992\u2013present\nOrigins.\nThe rocky promontory on which Skopje Fortress stands was the first site to be settled in Skopje. The earliest vestiges of human inhabitance found on this site date from the Chalcolithic (4th millennium BC).\nAlthough the Chalcolithic settlement must have been of some significance, it declined during the Bronze Age. Archaeological research suggests that the settlement always belonged to the same culture, which progressively evolved due to contacts with Balkan and Danube cultures, and later with the Aegean. The locality eventually disappeared during the Iron Age when Scupi emerged on Zaj\u010dev Rid hill, some west of the fortress promontory. At the centre of the Balkan peninsula and on the road between the Danube and Aegean Sea, it was a prosperous locality, although its history is not well known.\nDuring the Iron Age, the area of Skopje was inhabited by the Dardani. Illyrian tribes lived in most of the area west of Skopje and Thracian groups (Maedi) to the east, whilst Paeonians lived to the south of Skopje. The Dardanians had remained independent after the Roman conquest of Macedon, and it seems most likely that Dardania lost its independence in 28 BC.\nRoman Scupi.\nRoman expansion east brought Scupi under Roman rule as a colony of legionaries, mainly veterans of the Legio VII Claudia during the reign of Emperor Domitian (AD 81\u201396). However, several legions from the Roman province of Macedonia of Crassus' army may already have been stationed there around 29\u201328 BC before the official imperial command was instituted. The first mention of the city was made at that period by Livy, who died in AD 17. Scupi first served as a military base to maintain peace in the region and was officially named \", \" being the name of the emperor's dynasty. Shortly afterwards it became part of the province of Moesia during Augustus's rule. After the division of the province by Domitian in AD 86, Scupi was elevated to colonial status and became a seat of government within the new province of Moesia Superior. The district called Dardania (within Moesia Superior) was formed into a special province by Emperor Diocletian, with the capital at Naissus.\nThe city's population was very diverse. Engravings on tombstones suggest that only a minority of the population came from Italia, whilst many veterans were from Dalmatia, southern Gaul and Syria. Because of the ethnic diversity of the population, Latin maintained itself as the main language in the city at the expense of Greek, which was spoken in most of the Moesian and Macedonian cities. During the following centuries, Scupi experienced prosperity. The period from the end of the 3rd century to the end of the 4th century was particularly flourishing. The first church was founded under the reign of Emperor Constantine the Great and Scupi became the seat of a diocese. In 395, following the division of the Roman Empire into two, Scupi became part of the Eastern Roman Empire.\nAn ancient funeral inscription of the Illyrian tribe Albanoi was found in Scupi. And another inscription was found that reads \"Dardanus\".\nIn its zenith, Scupi covered 40 hectares and was closed by a wide wall. It had many monuments, including four necropoles, a theatre, thermae, and a large Christian basilica.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn 518, Scupi was destroyed by a violent earthquake, possibly the most devastating the town had ever experienced. At that time, the region was threatened by Barbarian invasions, and the city inhabitants had already fled to the forests and mountains before the disaster occurred. The city was eventually rebuilt by Justinian I. During his reign, many Byzantine towns were relocated on hills and other easily defendable places to face invasions. It was thus transferred to another site: the promontory on which Skopje Fortress stands. Despite this, Scupi was sacked by Slavs at the end of the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under Slavic rule in 595. The Slavic tribe which sacked Scupi was probably the Berziti, who had invaded the entire Vardar Valley. However, the Slavs did not settle permanently in the region, which had been already plundered and depopulated, but continued south to the Mediterranean coast. After the Slavic invasion it was deserted for some time and is not mentioned during the following centuries. It is possible that in the late 7th or the early 8th century the Byzantines again settled at this strategic location. Along with the rest of the Upper Vardar valley it became part of the expanding Bulgarian Empire in the 830s.\nStarting from the end of the 10th century Skopje experienced a period of wars and political troubles. It served as the Bulgarian capital from 972 to 992, and Tsar Samuel ruled it from 976 until 1004, when its governor surrendered it to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Bulgar Slayer in 1004 in exchange for the titles of \"patrikios\" and \"strategos\". It became a centre of a new Byzantine province called Bulgaria. Later Skopje was briefly seized twice by Slavic insurgents who wanted to restore the Bulgarian state, at first in 1040 under Peter Delyan's command, and in 1072 under the orders of Georgi Voyteh. In 1081, Skopje was captured by Norman troops led by Robert Guiscard and the city remained in their hands until 1088. Skopje was subsequently conquered by the Serbian Grand Prince Vukan in 1093, and again by the Normans four years later. However, because of epidemics and food shortage, Normans quickly surrendered to the Byzantines.\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries, Bulgarians and Serbs took advantage of Byzantine decline to create large kingdoms stretching from the Danube to the Aegean Sea. Kaloyan brought Skopje back into the re-established Second Bulgarian Empire in 1203 until his nephew Strez declared autonomy along the Upper Vardar with Serbian aid only five years later. In 1209, Strez switched allegiances and recognised Boril of Bulgaria with whom he led a successful joint campaign against Serbia's first internationally recognised King Stefan Nemanji\u0107. From 1214 to 1230, Skopje was a part of the Byzantine successor state of Epirus before being recaptured by Ivan Asen II and held by Bulgaria until 1246 when the Upper Vardar valley was incorporated once more into another Byzantine rump state \u2013 the Empire of Nicaea. Byzantine conquest was briefly reversed in 1255 by the regents of the young Michael Asen I of Bulgaria. Meanwhile, in the parallel civil war for the Crown in Tarnovo, the Skopje boyar and grandson of Stefan Nemanja Constantine Tikh gained the upper hand and ruled until the Uprising of Ivaylo, Europe's only successful peasant revolt, led to his deposition from power.\nIn 1282, Skopje was captured by Serbian King Stefan Milutin. Under the political stability of the Nemanji\u0107 rule, the settlement spread outside the walls of the fortress, towards Gazi Baba hill. Churches, monasteries and markets were built and tradesmen from the Republic of Venice and Dubrovnik opened shops. The town greatly benefited from its location near European, Middle Eastern, and African markets. In the 14th century, Skopje became such an important city that King Stefan Du\u0161an made it the capital of the Serbian Empire. In 1346, he was crowned as Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks in Skopje. After his death the Serbian Empire collapsed into several principalities which were unable to defend themselves against the Ottoman Turks. Skopje was first inherited by the Lordship of Prilep and finally taken by Vuk Brankovi\u0107 in the wake of the Battle of Maritsa (1371) before becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in 1392.\nIn 1330, Serbian King Stefan De\u010danski mentioned Albanians as being in the district of Skopje and regularly going to the Fair of Saint George which convened near the city.\nOttoman period.\nThe Ottomans stayed in Skopje for over 520 years and the city's economic life greatly benefited from its position in the middle of Rumelia, the European province of the Ottomans. The Stone Bridge, \"one of the most imposing stone bridges to be found in Yugoslavia\", was built under the patronage of Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror between 1451 and 1469. The Ottomans drastically changed the appearance of the city. They organised the Old Bazaar, with its caravanserais, mosques and baths.\nIn the cadastral register of 1451\u201352, the Skopje neighbourhood ' (), is mentioned, being named after the medieval Albanian Gjini family. The neighbourhood displayed mixed Christian Albanian anthroponymy with cases of Slavicisation present (e.g. ; ' + Slavic suffix \"i\u0107\"). During this time period, a number of timariots of the city are recorded as bearing the name (meaning Albanian) alongside a Muslim name, i.e. \", , \". Another group bore Slavic Christian names, whilst also carrying bearing the surname /', i.e. ', ', ', ', etc. These individuals are noted as not having the Slavic appellatives ', ' or ', which were given by Ottoman authorities to new settlers of a given region, likely indicating they were locals. In the year 1451 or 1453 a neighbourhood was registered bearing an Aromanian name, . Amongst the 45 family heads of this neighbourhood, Christian Slavic and Albanian anthroponyms were recorded (, son of , \"Koljko Bibani\", ', son of ', etc.), whilst a sizeable number of individuals bearing mixed Slavic-Vlach anthroponyms are also registered, such as: ', son of Vllah (\"Iflak\"), ', son of ', ', , , etc.\nIn the mahallah in the year 1451 or 1453, a head of the family from the noble Albanian Muzaka family, who had converted to Islam, was re-registered amongst the Muslim heads of the family. In the other register of 1467/68, now in the Christian mahallah named , amongst the 29 heads of families with Slavic Christian anthroponyms, a number also carried Albanian anthroponyms. In the neighbourhood of , amongst the residents with Muslim names, the head of the family was registered only with the surname \"Zenebishi\", without mentioning his social position or his profession, indicating a higher social status. This may suggest a relation to Hasan Bey Zenebishi, a descendant of the Zenebishi family and the Soubashi of the Nahiyah of Kalkandelen. Individuals bearing Albanian anthroponyms, be they in conjunction with Islamic, Slavic or Christian ones, also appear in the neighbourhoods of \"Kasim Fakih\", \"Dursun Sara\u00e7\", \"Kujumxhi Mentesheli\", \"\u00c7erep, Jandro, Stanimir, Vllah Dan\u00e7u\" and \"Rela\". A number of Sipahis were also of Albanian origin, with these individuals holding timars in areas which had a Christian Albanian symbiosis with Slavic anthroponyms in the vicinity of Skopje. The defters noted that these were old sipahis, likely having been landowners. These individual Sipahis were closely related by descent and blood, and taking account kinship ties, even though they had heterogeneous, Christian, Slavic and Oriental names, they appear to have been Albanians. Some have names indicating their origin, such as \"Shimerd Vardarli\" from Skopje, making it likely these timariotes were locals.\nIn the 1467/68 and 1568/69 defter, Skopje had a majority Muslim population. The 1467/68 defter recorded 33 Muslim town quarters with 637 houses whereas the Christians had 11 quarters with 277 houses. In 1568/69 there were 57 Muslim quarters and only 9 Christian.\nAround 1529, the Christians of Skopje were mostly non-converted Slavs and Albanians, but also Ragusan and Armenian tradesmen. Mustafa Pasha Mosque, built in 1492, is reputed to be \"one of the most resplendent sacral Islamic buildings in the Balkans.\" In 1535 all churches were demolished by decree of the Ottoman governor. In 1555, the city was hit by another severe earthquake, collapsing much of the city. The Old Bazaar of Skopje, the columns of the Stone Bridge, and the murals in the upper parts of the Church of Saint Panteleimon, Gorno Nerezi were all severely damaged. Some modern sources estimate this earthquake to have been a Category XII (Extreme) on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale, although others believe this is an overestimate.\nIn 1623\u20131624, Pjeter Mazreku, a Roman Catholic prelate, reported the town was inhabited by \"Turks (Muslims), the majority of them being Albanians, the rest are of Asiatic origin\", Mazreku further wrote, \"there are also Jews, Serbs and some Greeks in the town\". In the Ottoman period, \"Turk\" was used within Christian writings as a name for a Muslim or for Islamised Albanians. Sources from the years of 1689\u20131690 considered the town of Shkupi (Skopje) during those periods as part of Albania.\nUntil the 17th century, Skopje experienced a long golden age. Around 1650, the number of inhabitants in Skopje was between 30,000 and 60,000, and the city contained more than 10,000 houses. It was then one of the only big cities on the territory of future Yugoslavia, together with Belgrade and Sarajevo. At that time, Dubrovnik, which was a busy harbour, did not even have 7,000 inhabitants. The city severely suffered from the Great Turkish War at the end of the 17th century and consequently experienced recession until the 19th century. In 1689, the Habsburgs seized Skopje which was already weakened by a cholera epidemic. The same day, general Silvio Piccolomini began the Skopje fire of 1689, attempting to end the epidemic. It is however possible that he wanted to avenge damages that the Ottomans caused in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Skopje burned for two days but the general himself perished of the plague and his leaderless army was routed. The Austrian presence in Macedonia motivated Slav uprisings. Nevertheless, the Austrians left the country within the year and the Hajduks, the leaders of the uprisings, had to follow them in their retreat north of the Balkans. Some were arrested by the Ottomans, such as Petar Karposh, who was impaled on Skopje's Stone Bridge.\nAfter the war, Skopje was in ruins. Most of the official buildings were restored or rebuilt, but the city experienced new plague and cholera epidemics and many inhabitants emigrated. Ottoman Empire as a whole entered into recession and political decline. Many rebellions and pillages occurred in Macedonia during the 18th century, either led by Ottoman outlaws, Janissaries or Hajduks. An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time Skopje only had around 10,000 inhabitants. It was surpassed by two other towns of present-day North Macedonia: Bitola (40,000) and \u0160tip (15\u201320,000).\nSkopje began to recover from decades of decline after 1850. At that time, the city experienced a slow but steady demographic growth, mainly due to the rural exodus of Slavic Macedonians. It was also fuelled by the exodus of Muslims from the Principalities of Serbia and Bulgaria, which were gaining autonomy and independence from the Empire at that time. During the Tanzimat reforms, nationalism arose in the Ottoman Empire and in 1870 a new Bulgarian Exarchate was established and its separate diocese was created, based on ethnic identity, rather than religious principles. The Slavic population of the bishopric of Skopje voted in 1874 overwhelmingly, by 91% in favour of joining the Exarchate and became part of the Bulgarian Millet. Economic growth was permitted by the construction of the Skopje-Salonica railway in 1873. The railway station was built south of the Vardar and this contributed to the relocation of economic activities on that side of the river, which had never been urbanised before. Because of the rural exodus, the share of Christians in the city population increased. Some of the newcomers became part of the local elite and helped to spread nationalist ideas. In 1877, Skopje was chosen as the capital city of the new Kosovo Vilayet, which encompassed present-day Kosovo, north-western Macedonia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.\nIn statistics gathered by Bulgarian ethnographer Vasil Kanchov in 1900, the City of Skopje was inhabited by 31,900 people, of whom 15,000 were Turks, 13,000 Christian Bulgarians, 1,920 Romani, 800 Jews, 450 Vlachs, 150 Christian Albanians, 50 Christian Greeks, 30 Circassians and 500 inhabitants of various other ethnicities. Kanchov wrote in the same year that many Albanians declared themselves as Turks. In Skopje, the population that declared itself Turkish \"was of Albanian blood\", but it \"had been Turkified after the Ottoman invasion, including Skanderbeg\", referring to Islamisation. Bulgarian literary historian Yordan Ivanov wrote in 1915 that Albanians, since they did not have their own alphabet, due to a lack of consolidated national consciousness and influenced by foreign propaganda, declared themselves as Turks, Greeks and Bulgarians, depending on which religion they belonged to. Albanians were losing their mother tongue in Skopje. German linguist Gustav Weigand described that Skopje's Muslim population of \"Turks\" or \"Ottomans\" during the late Ottoman period were mainly Albanians who spoke Turkish in public and Albanian at home. In 1905, the city had 32,000 inhabitants, making it the largest of the vilayet, although closely followed by Prizren with its 30,000 inhabitants. At the beginning of the 20th century, local economy was focused on dyeing, weaving, tanning, ironworks and wine and flour processing.\nSkopje was one of the five main centres of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation when it organised the 1903 Ilinden uprising. Its revolutionary network in the region led by Nikola Pushkarov was not well-developed and the lack of weapons was a serious problem. At the outbreak of the uprising, the rebel forces derailed a military train. On 3 and 5 August respectively, they attacked an Ottoman unit guarding the bridge on the Vardar River and fought a battle in the St. Jovan monastery. In the next few days, the band was pursued by numerous Bashibozuks and moved to Bulgaria.\nFollowing the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Ottoman Empire experienced democracy and several political parties were created. However, some of the policies implemented by the Young Turks, such as a tax rise and the interdiction of ethnic-based political parties, discontented minorities. Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter, they managed to seize most of Kosovo and took Skopje on 11 August. On 18 August, the insurgents signed the \u00dcsk\u00fcb agreement which provided for the creation of an autonomous Albanian province, and they were amnestied the day later.\nBalkan Wars to present day.\nFollowing an alliance contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Their goal was to definitively expel the Ottomans from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. Ottoman forces had left the city the day before. During the conflict, Chetniks, a Serb irregular force razed the Albanian quarter of Skopje and killed numerous Albanian inhabitants from the city. The Serbian annexation led to the exodus of 725 Muslim families which left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.\nIn 1915, during the First World War, Eastern and South Serbia were invaded by Bulgaria, which captured Skopje on 22 October 1915. Serbia, allied to the Triple Entente, was helped by France, Britain, Greece, and Italy, which formed the Macedonian front. Following a great Allied offensive in 1918, the Arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise d'Orient reached Skopje on 29 September and took the city by surprise. After the end of the World War, Vardar Macedonia became part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\" in 1929. A mostly foreign ethnic Serb ruling class gained control, imposing large-scale repression. The policies of de-Bulgarisation and assimilation were pursued. At that time part of the young locals, repressed by the Serbs, tried to find a separate way of ethnic Macedonian development. In 1931, in a move to formally decentralise the country, Skopje was named the capital of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Until the Second World War, Skopje experienced strong economic growth, and its population increased. The city had 41,066 inhabitants in 1921, 64,807 in 1931, and 80,000 in 1941. Although in an underdeveloped region, it attracted wealthy Serbs who opened businesses and contributed to the modernisation of the city. In 1941, Skopje had 45 factories.\nIn 1941, during the Second World War, Yugoslavia was invaded by Nazi Germany. Germans seized Skopje on 8 April and left it to their Bulgarian allies on 22 April 1941. To ensure the Bulgarisation of the society, authorities closed Serbian schools and churches, opening new schools and a higher education institute, the King Boris University. The 4,000 Jews of Skopje were all deported in 1943 to the Treblinka extermination camp where almost all of them were killed.\nSkopje was captured on 13 November 1944 by units of the Bulgarian People's Army (Bulgaria having switched sides in the war in September) aided by Yugoslav Partisans of the Macedonian National Liberation Army. Skopje became the capital city of the newly proclaimed Democratic Federal Macedonia as set up by the ASNOM on 2 August 1944 in the Bulgarian occupation zone in Yugoslavia.\nAfter World War II, Skopje greatly benefited from Socialist Yugoslav policies which encouraged industry and the development of Macedonian cultural institutions. Consequently, Skopje became home to a national library, a philharmonic orchestra, a university, and the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. However, its post-war development was altered by the 1963 earthquake which occurred on 26 July. Although relatively weak in magnitude, it caused enormous damage in the city and can be compared to the 1960 Agadir earthquake. The disaster killed 1,070 people, injuring 3,300 others. 16,000 people were buried alive in ruins and 70% of the population lost their home. Many educational facilities, factories and historical buildings were destroyed.\nAfter the earthquake, reconstruction was quick. It had a deep psychological impact on the population because neighbourhoods were split, and people were relocated to new houses and buildings they were not familiar with. Many Albanians, some from Kosovo participated in the reconstruction effort. Reconstruction was finished by 1980, even if many elements were never built because funds were exhausted. Skopje's cityscape was drastically changed, and the city became a true example of modernist architecture. Demographic growth was very important after 1963, and Skopje had 408,100 inhabitants in 1981. After 1963, rural youth migrated to Skopje and were involved in the reconstruction process resulting in a large growth of the urban Macedonian population. The Albanian population of Skopje also increased as people from the northern villages migrated to the city and others came from Kosovo either to provide manpower for reconstruction or fled the deteriorating political situation, especially during the 1990s. However, during the 1980s and the 1990s, the country experienced inflation and recession, and the local economy heavily suffered. The situation improved during the 2000s thanks to new investments. Many landmarks were restored and the \"Skopje 2014\" project renewed the appearance of the city centre.\nEmblems.\nThe Flag of Skopje is a red banner in proportions 1:2 with a gold-coloured coat of arms of the city positioned in the upper-left corner. It is either vertical or horizontal, but the vertical version was the first to be used.\nThe coat of arms of the city was adopted in the 1950s. It depicts the Stone Bridge with the Vardar river, the Kale Fortress and the snow-capped peaks of the \u0160ar mountains.\nAdministration.\nStatus.\nBeing the capital and largest city of North Macedonia, Skopje enjoys a particular status granted by law. The last revision of its status was made in 2004. Since then, the City of Skopje has been divided into 10 municipalities which all have a council and a mayor, like all of the country's municipalities. Municipalities only deal with matters specific of their territory, and the City of Skopje deals with matters that concern all of them, or that cannot be divided between two or more municipalities.\nThe City of Skopje is part of the Skopje Statistical Region, which has no political or administrative power.\nCity Council.\nThe City Council consists of 45 members who serve a four-year term. It primarily deals with budget, global orientations and relations between the city and the government. Several commissions exist to treat more specific topics, such as urbanism, finances, environment or local development. The President of the council is elected by the Council Members. Since 2021 the president has been Trajko Slaveski, member of VMRO-DPMNE.\nFollowing the 2021 local elections, the City Council is constituted as follows:\nMayor.\nThe Mayor of Skopje is elected every four years. The mayor represents the City of Skopje and can submit ideas to the council, manages the administrative bodies and their officials.\nMunicipalities.\nSkopje was first divided into administrative units in 1945, but the first municipalities were created in 1976. There were five municipalities: Centar, \u010cair, Karpo\u0161, Gazi Baba and Kisela Voda. After the 1991 independence of the country, power was centralised and municipalities lost much of their competences. A 1996 law restored them and created two new municipalities: \u01f4or\u010de Petrov and \u0160uto Orizari. After the insurgency between Albanian rebels and Macedonian forces in 2001, a new law was enacted in 2004 to incorporate the Saraj Municipality into the City of Skopje. Saraj is mostly populated by Albanians and, since then, Albanians represent more than 20% of the city population. Thus, Albanian became the second official language of the city administration, something which was one of the claims of the Albanian rebels. The same year, Aerodrom Municipality separated itself from Kisela Voda, and Butel Municipality from \u010cair.\nMunicipalities are administered by a council of 23 members elected every four years. They also have a mayor and several departments (education, culture, finances...). The mayor primarily deals with these departments.\nEconomy.\nEconomic weight.\nSkopje is a medium city at the European level. Being the capital and largest city of North Macedonia, Skopje concentrates a large share of the national economy. The Skopje Statistical Region, which encompasses the City of Skopje and some neighbouring municipalities, produces 45.5% of the Macedonian GDP. In 2009, the regional GDP per capita amounted to US$6,565, or 155% of the Macedonian GDP per capita. This figure is, however, smaller than the one of neighbouring Sofia (US$10,106), Sarajevo (US$10,048) or Belgrade (US$7,983), but higher than the one of Tirana (US$4,126).\nBecause there are no other large cities in the country, and because of political and economic centralisation, a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city. The dynamism of the city also encourages rural exodus, not only from North Macedonia, but also from Kosovo, Albania and Southern Serbia.\nFirms and activities.\nIn 2009, Skopje had 26,056 firms but only 145 of them had a large size. The large majority of them are either small (12,017) or very small (13,625). A large share of the firms deal with trading of goods (9,758), 3,839 are specialised in business and real estate, and 2,849 are manufacturers. Although few in number, large firms account for 51% of the local production outside finance.\nThe city industry is dominated by food processing, textile, printing and metal processing. In 2012, it accounted for 30% of the city's GDP. Most of the industrial areas are in Gazi Baba municipality, on the major routes and rail lines to Belgrade and Thessaloniki. Notably, the ArcelorMittal, Makstil steel plants and the Skopje Brewery are present there. Other zones are between Aerodrom and Kisela Voda, along the railway to Greece. These zones comprise Alkaloid Skopje (pharmaceuticals), Rade Kon\u010dar (electrical supplies), Imperial Tobacco, and Ohis (fertilisers). Two special economic zones also exist, around the airport and the Okta refinery. They have attracted several foreign companies, such as Johnson Controls, Johnson Matthey and Van Hool.\nAs the country's financial capital, Skopje is the seat of the Macedonian Stock Exchange, of the National Bank, and of most of the country's banking, insurance, and telecommunication companies, such as Makedonski Telekom, Komercijalna banka Skopje and Stopanska Banka. The services sector produces 60% of the city GDP.\nBesides many small traditional shops, Skopje has two large markets, the \"Zelen Pazar\" (green market) and the \"Bit Pazar\" (flea market). They are both considered local institutions. However, since the 1970s, retailing has largely been modernised and Skopje now has many supermarkets and shopping centres. The largest, Skopje City Mall, opened in 2012. It comprises 130 shops and a cinema, and employs 2,000 people.\nEmployment.\n51% of the Skopje active population is employed in small firms. 52% of the population work in the services sector, 34% in industry, and the remaining is mainly employed in administration.\nThe unemployment rate for the Skopje Statistical Region was at 27% in 2009, three points under the national rate (30%). The neighbouring Polog Region had a similar rate, but the less affected region was the South-West, with 22%. Unemployment in Skopje mainly affects men, who represent 56% of jobseekers, people between 25 and 44 years old (45% of jobseekers), and non-qualified people (43%). Unemployment also concerns Roma people, who represent 4.63% of the city population but affects 70% of the active population in the community.\nThe average net monthly wage in Skopje was at \u20ac400 in October 2010, which represented 120% of the national figure. The average wage in Skopje was then lower than in Sarajevo (\u20ac522), Sofia (\u20ac436), and in Belgrade (\u20ac440).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPopulation.\nAccording to the results of the 2021 census, the City of Skopje had 526,502 inhabitants. Skopje's employment area covers a large part of the country, including Veles, Kumanovo and Tetovo, and totalling more than one million inhabitants.\nSkopje contains roughly a quarter of North Macedonia's population. The second most populous municipality, Kumanovo, had 107,632 inhabitants in 2011, and an urban unit of 76,272 inhabitants in 2002.\nBefore the Austro-Turkish war and the 1689 Great Fire, Skopje was one of the biggest cities in the Balkans, with a population estimated between 30,000 and 60,000 inhabitants. After the fire set by the retreating Austrian forces, it experienced a long period of decline and only had 10,000 inhabitants in 1836. However, the population started to rise again after 1850 and reached 32,000 inhabitants in 1905. In the 20th century, Skopje was one of the fastest-growing cities in Yugoslavia, and it had 448,200 inhabitants in 1981. Since then, the demographic growth has continued at a steady rate.\nEthnic groups.\nEthnic groups in Greater Skopje consist of the following:\nSkopje, just like North Macedonia as a whole, is characterised by a large ethnic diversity. The city is in a region where Macedonians and Albanians meet, and it has had populations of Bulgarians, Romani, Turks, Jews, and Serbs through its history. Skopje was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century when large numbers of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2021 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in Skopje, with 309,107 inhabitants, or 58.71% of the population. Then came Albanians with 120,293 inhabitants (22.85%), Roma people with 18,498 (3.51%), Serbs (9,478 inhabitants), Turks (8,524), Bosniaks (7,365) and Aromanians (also known as \"Vlachs\", 2,778). 6,284 people did not belong to any of these groups.\nMacedonians form an overwhelming majority of the population in the municipalities of Aerodrom, Centar, Gor\u010de Petrov, Karpo\u0161 and Kisela Voda, which are all south of the Vardar. They also form a majority in Butel and Gazi Baba which are north of the river. Albanians form a majority in \u010cair which roughly corresponds to the Old Bazaar, and in Saraj. They form a large minority in Butel and Gazi Baba. Suto Orizari, on the northern edge of the city, is predominantly Roma. When an ethnic minority forms at least 20% of the population in a municipality, its language can become official on the local level. Thus, in \u010cair and Saraj schools and administration use Albanian, and Romani in \u0160uto Orizari. The latter is the only municipality in the world where Romani is an official language.\nRelations between the two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are sometimes difficult, as in the rest of the country. Each group tolerates the other but they tend to avoid each other and live in what can appear as two parallel worlds. Both Macedonians and Albanians view themselves each as the original population of Skopje and the other as newcomers. The Roma minority is on its side very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in the world with the largest Roma population.\nReligion.\nReligious affiliation is diverse: Macedonians, Serbs, and Aromanians are mainly Eastern Orthodox, with the majority affiliated to the Macedonian Orthodox Church; Turks are almost entirely Muslim; those of Albanian ethnicity are largely Muslim, although Skopje also has a sizeable Roman Catholic Albanian minority, into which Mother Teresa was born; the Roma (Gypsies) represent a mixture (in almost equal numbers) of Muslim and Orthodox religious heritage.\nAccording to the 2002 census, 68.5% of the population of Skopje belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church, whilst 28.6% belonged to Islam. The city also had Catholic (0.5%) and Protestant (0.04%) minorities. The Catholics are served by the Latin bishopric of Skopje, in which is also vested the Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Macedonia.\nUntil World War II, Skopje had a significant Jewish minority which mainly descended from Spanish Sephardis who had escaped the Inquisition. The community comprised 2,424 members in 1939 (representing about 3% of the city population), but most of them were deported and killed by Nazis. After the war, most of the survivors settled in Israel. Today the city has around 200 Jewish inhabitants (about 0.04% of the population).\nBecause of its 520-year Ottoman past, and the fact that many of its inhabitants today are Muslims, Skopje has more mosques than churches. Religious communities often complain about the lack of infrastructure and new places of worship are often built. Skopje is the seat of many Macedonian religious organisations, such as the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic Religious Union of Macedonia. It has an Orthodox cathedral and seminary, several madrasahs, a Roman Catholic cathedral and a synagogue.\nHealth.\nSkopje has several public and private hospitals and specialised medical institutions, such as the Filip II Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, two obstetric hospitals, a gerontology hospital, and institutes for respiratory and ocular diseases. In 2012, Skopje had a ratio of one physician per 251.6 inhabitants, a figure higher than the national ratio (one per 370.9). The ratio of medical specialists was also higher than in the rest of the country. However, the ratio of hospital beds, pharmacists and dentists was lower in Skopje. The population in Skopje enjoys better health standards than other Macedonians. In 2010, the mortality rate was at 8.6\u2030 in Skopje and 9.3\u2030 on the national level. The infant mortality rate was at 6.8\u2030 in Skopje and 7.6\u2030 in North Macedonia.\nEducation.\nSkopje's citizenry is generally more educated than the rest of the country. 16% of Skopjans have graduated from university in contrast to 10% for the rest of the country. The number of people with a complete lack of education or ones who received a partial education is lower in Skopje at 9% compared to the provincial average of 17%. 80% of Macedonian citizens who hold a PhD take up residence in Skopje.\nSkopje has 21 secondary schools; 5 of which serve as general high-school gymnasiums and 16 vocational schools. The city is also host to several higher education institutions, the most notable of which is Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, founded in 1949. The university has 23 departments, 10 research institutes and is attended by an average of 50,000 students. After the country's independence in 1991, several private universities were brought into existence. The largest private universities in Skopje are European University Skopje with 7 departments and FON University with 9 departments respectively.\nMedia.\nSkopje is the largest media centre in North Macedonia. Of the 818 newspapers surveyed in 2000 by the Ministry of Information, over 600 had their headquarters in Skopje. The daily , founded in 1996, with 60,000 runs per day is the most printed in the country. Also based in Skopje, Ve\u010der prints 50,000 copies and the state owns one-third of its capital. Nova Makedonija, reprinted 20,000 copies. Other major newspapers in Skopje, totally private, are Utrinski Vesnik (30,000 copies), Vest (25,000 copies), and Vreme (15,000 copies). Magazines Fokus (12,000 copies), Start (10,000 copies), and Denes (7,500 copies) also have their headquarters in Skopje.\nThe city is home of the studios of Macedonian Radio-Television (MRT), the country's public radio and television. Founded in 1966, it operates with three national broadcast channels, twenty-four hours a day. The most popular private television stations are Sitel, Kanal 5, Telma, Alfa TV, and AlsatM. MRT also operates radio stations with national coverage, the private station Skopje's Kanal 77 is the only one to have such a span. Radio Antenna 5 and Metropolis are two other major private stations that have their headquarters in Skopje.\nAlso, the city boasts big news agencies in the country, both public, such as the Media Information Agency, and private, such as the Makfax.\nSports.\nAs the capital and largest city of North Macedonia, Skopje has many major sporting facilities. The city has three large swimming pools, two of which feature Olympic pools. These pools are particularly relevant to coaching water polo teams. Skopje also boasts many football stadiums, like Ilinden in \u010cair and \u017delezarnica, which can accommodate between 4,000 and 4,500 spectators. The basketball court Kale can accommodate 2,200 people and the court of Jane Sandanski has a 6,000-seat capacity.\nThe largest stadium remains To\u0161e Proeski Arena. The stadium, built in 1947 and named until 2008, City Stadium Skopje experienced a total renovation, begun in 2009 to meet the standards of FIFA. Fully renovated the stadium contains 33,460 seats, and a health spa and fitness area. The Boris Trajkovski Sports Center is the largest sports complex in the country with 6,250 seats. It was opened in 2008 and named after former president Boris Trajkovski, who died in 2004. It includes rooms dedicated to handball, basketball, and volleyball, a bowling alley, a fitness area, and an ice hockey court. Its main hall, which regularly hosts concerts, holds around 10,000 people.\nFK Vardar and FK Rabotni\u010dki are the two most popular football teams in the city. Both play in the first division. Their games are held at To\u0161e Proeski Arena, like those of the national team. The city is also home to many smaller football clubs, such as: FK Makedonija \u01f4or\u010de Petrov, FK Gorno Lisi\u010de, FK Lokomotiva Skopje, FK Metalurg Skopje, FK Mad\u017eari Solidarnost and FK Skopje, who play in first, second or third national league. Another popular sport in North Macedonia is basketball, represented in particular by the teams MZT Skopje and Rabotni\u010dki. Handball is illustrated by RK Vardar PRO and RK Metalurg Skopje, also the women's team \u017dRK Metalurg and \u017dRK Vardar. The city co-hosted the 2008 European Women's Handball Championship together with Ohrid, and hosted the 2017 UEFA Super Cup, the match between Real Madrid and Manchester United.\nTransport.\nMain connections.\nSkopje is near three other capital cities, Pristina ( away), Tirana (291\u00a0km) and Sofia (245\u00a0km). Thessaloniki is south and Belgrade is north. Skopje is also at the crossroad of two Pan-European corridors: Corridor X, which runs between Austria and Greece, and Corridor VIII, which runs from the Adriatic in Albania to the Black Sea in Bulgaria. Corridor X links Skopje to Thessaloniki, Belgrade, and Western Europe, whilst Corridor VIII links it with Tirana and Sofia.\nCorridor X locally corresponds to the A1 motorway (E75), which is the longest motorway in North Macedonia. It also corresponds to the Tabanovce-Gevgelija railway. Corridor VIII, less developed, corresponds to the A2 motorway and the Ki\u010devo-Beljakovce railway. Skopje is not quite on the Corridor X and the A1 does not pass on the city territory. Thus the interchange between the A1, A2 and A4 motorways is some east, close to the airport. Although Skopje is geographically close to other major cities, movement of people and goods is not optimised, especially with Albania. This is mainly due to poor infrastructure. As a result, 61.8% of Skopjans have never been to Tirana, whilst only 6.7% have never been to Thessaloniki and 0% to Sofia. Furthermore, 26% of Thessalonians, 33% of Sofians and 37% of Tiranans have never been to Skopje.\nThe first motorways were built during the Yugoslav period, when Skopje was linked through the Brotherhood and Unity Highway to, what was then, the Yugoslav capital Belgrade to the North, and the Greek border to the South.\nRail and coach stations.\nThe main railway station in Skopje is serviced by the Belgrade-Thessaloniki and Skopje-Pristina international lines. After the completion of the Corridor VIII railway project, currently scheduled for 2030, the city will also be linked to Tirana and Sofia. Daily trains also link Skopje with other towns of North Macedonia, such as Kumanovo, Ki\u010devo, \u0160tip, Bitola or Veles.\nSkopje has several minor railway stations, but the city does not have its own railway network, and they are only serviced by intercity or international lines. On the railway linking the main station to Belgrade and Thessaloniki are Dra\u010devo and Dolno Lisi\u010de stations, and on the railway to Ki\u010devo are Skopje-North, \u01f4or\u010de Petrov and Saraj stations. Several other stations are freight-only.\nSkopje coach station opened in 2005 and is built right under the main railway station. It can host 450 coaches in a day. Coach connections reach more destinations than train connections, connecting Skopje to many domestic and foreign destinations including Istanbul, Sofia, Prague, Hamburg and Stockholm.\nPublic transport.\nSkopje has a bus network managed by the city and operated by three companies. The oldest and largest is JSP Skopje, a public company founded in 1948. JSP lost its monopoly on public transport in 1990 and two new companies, Sloboda Prevoz and Mak Ekspres, obtained several lines. However, most of the network is still in the hands of JSP which operates 67 lines out of 80. Only 24 lines are urban, the others serving localities around the city. Many of the JSP vehicles are red Yutong City Master double-decker buses built by Chinese bus manufacturer Yutong and designed to resemble the classic British AEC Routemaster.\nA tram network has long been planned in Skopje and the idea was first proposed in the 1980s. The project became real in 2006 when the mayor Trifun Kostovski asked for feasibility studies. His successor Koce Trajanovski launched a call for tenders in 2010 and the first line is scheduled for 2019.\nA new network for small buses started to operate in June 2014, not to replace but to decrease the number of big buses in the city centre.\nAirport.\nThe airport was built in 1928. The first commercial flights in Skopje were introduced in 1929 when the Yugoslav carrier Aeroput introduced a route linking the city with the capital, Belgrade. A year later the route was extended to Thessaloniki in Greece, and further extended to Greek capital Athens in 1933. In 1935 Aeroput linked Skopje with Bitola and Ni\u0161, and also operated a longer international route linking Vienna and Thessaloniki through Zagreb, Belgrade and Skopje. After the Second World War, Aeroput was replaced by JAT Yugoslav Airlines, which linked Skopje to a number of domestic and international destinations until the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.\nSkopje International Airport is in Petrovec, east of the city. Since 2008, it has been managed by the Turkish TAV Airports Holding and it can accommodate up to four million passengers per year. The annual traffic has constantly risen since 2008, reaching one million passengers in 2014.\nSkopje's airport has connections to several European cities, including Athens, Vienna, Bratislava, Z\u00fcrich, Brussels, Oslo, Istanbul, London and Rome. It also maintains a direct connection with Dubai and Doha, Qatar.\nCulture.\nCultural institutions.\nSkopje is home to the largest cultural institutions of the country, such as the National and University Library \"St. Kliment of Ohrid\", the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the National Theatre, the National Philharmonic Orchestra and the Macedonian Opera and Ballet. Amongst the local institutions are the Brothers Miladinov Library which has more than a million documents, the Cultural Information Centre which manages festivals, exhibitions and concerts, and the House of Culture Ko\u010do Racin which is dedicated to contemporary art and young talents.\nSkopje also has several foreign cultural centres, such as a , a British Council, an Alliance fran\u00e7aise, an American Corner.\nThe city has several theatres and concert halls. The Univerzalna Sala, seating 1,570, was built in 1966 and is used for concerts, fashion shows, and congresses. The Metropolis Arena, designed for large concerts, has 3,546 seats. Other large halls include the Macedonian Opera and Ballet (800 seats), the National Theatre (724), and the Drama Theatre (333). Other smaller venues exist, such as the Albanian Theatre and the Youth Theatre. A Turkish Theatre and a Philharmonic hall are under construction.\nMuseums.\nThe largest museum in Skopje is the Museum of the Republic of North Macedonia which details the history of the country. Its icons and lapidary collections are particularly rich. The Macedonian Archaeological Museum, opened in 2014, keeps archaeological finds in North Macedonia, dating from Prehistory to the Ottoman period. The National Gallery of Macedonia exhibits paintings dating from the 14th to the 20th century in two former hammams of the Old Bazaar. The Contemporary Art Museum was built after the 1963 earthquake thanks to international assistance. Its collections include Macedonian and foreign art, with works by Fernand L\u00e9ger, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Pablo Picasso, Hans Hartung, Victor Vasarely, Alexander Calder, Pierre Soulages, Alberto Burri and Christo.\nThe Skopje City Museum is inside the remains of the old railway station, destroyed by the 1963 earthquake. It is dedicated to local history, and it has four departments: archaeology, ethnology, history, and art history. The Memorial House of Mother Teresa was built in 2009 on the original site of the church in which the nun had been baptised. The Museum of the Macedonian Struggle is dedicated to the modern national history and the struggle of Macedonians for their independence. Nearby is the Holocaust Memorial Center for the Jews of Macedonia. The Macedonian Museum of Natural History showcases some 4,000 items whilst the 12-ha Skopje Zoo is home to 300 animals.\nArchitecture.\nAlthough Skopje has been destroyed many times throughout its history, it still has many historical landmarks which reflect the successive occupations of the city. Skopje has one of the biggest Ottoman urban complexes in Europe, with many Ottoman monuments still serving their original purpose. It was also a ground for modernist experiments in the 20th century, following the 1963 earthquake. At the beginning of the 21st century, it is again the subject of massive building campaigns, thanks to the Skopje 2014 project. Skopje is thus an environment where old, new, progressist, reactionary, eastern and western perspectives coexist.\nSkopje has some remains of Prehistorical architecture which can be seen on the Tumba Mad\u017eari Neolithic site. On the other side of the city lies the remains of the ancient Scupi, with ruins of a theatre, thermae and a basilica. The Skopje Aqueduct, between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown. It seems to have been built by the Byzantines or the Turks, but it was already out of use in the 16th century. It consists of 50 arches, worked in cloisonn\u00e9 masonry.\nSkopje Fortress was rebuilt several times before it was destroyed by the 1963 earthquake. Since then, it has been restored to its medieval appearance. It is the only medieval monument in Skopje, but several churches around the city illustrate the Vardar architectural school which flourished around 1300. Amongst these churches are the ones around Matka Canyon (St Nicholas, St Andrew and Matka churches). The church of Saint Panteleimon in Gorno Nerezi dates from the 12th century. Its expressive frescoes anticipate the Italian primitives.\nExamples of Ottoman architecture are in the Old Bazaar. Mosques in Skopje are usually simple in design, with a square base and a single dome and minaret. Their entrance is usually emphasised by a portico, as on Mustafa Pasha Mosque, dating from the 15th century. Some mosques show some originality in their appearance: Sultan Murad and Yahya Pasha mosques have lost their dome and have a pyramidal roof, whilst Isa Bey Mosque has a rectangular base, two domes and two side wings. The Alad\u017ea Mosque was originally covered with blue faience, but it disappeared in the 1689 Great Fire. However, some tiles are still visible on the adjoining t\u00fcrbe. Other Ottoman public monuments include the 16th-century clock tower, a bedesten, three caravanserais, two hammams and the Stone Bridge, first mentioned in 1469.\nThe oldest churches in the city centre, the Ascension and St Dimitri churches, were built in the 18th century, after the 1689 Great Fire. They were both renovated in the 19th century. The Church of the Ascension is particularly small as it is half-buried in order to not overlook neighbouring mosques. In the 19th century, several new churches were built, including the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, which is a large three-nave building designed by Andrey Damyanov.\nAfter 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, the city was drastically westernised. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and town houses such as the 1926 Risti\u1e31 Palace. The architecture of that time is very similar to the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the Neo-Moorish Arab House and the Neo-Byzantine railway station, both built in 1938. Modernism appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by Milan Zlokovi\u0107. However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of the city centre was partially planned by Japanese Kenzo Tange who designed the new railway station. Macedonian architects also took part in the reconstruction: Georgi Konstantinovski designed the City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Del\u010dev in 1975, whilst Janko Konstantinov designed the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974\u20131989). Slavko Brezovski designed the Church of St. Clement of Ohrid. These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by brutalism.\nThe reconstruction turned Skopje into a proper modernist city, with large blocks of flats, austere concrete buildings and scattered green spaces. The city centre was considered as a grey and unattractive place when local authorities unveiled the Skopje 2014 project in 2010. It made plans to erect a large number of statues, fountains, bridges, and museums at a cost of about \u20ac500\u00a0million.\nThe project has generated controversy: critics have described the new landmark buildings as signs of reactionary historicist aesthetics. Also, the government has been criticised for its cost and the original lack of representation of national minorities in the coverage of its set of statues and memorials. However, representations of minorities have since been included amongst the monuments. The scheme is accused of turning Skopje to a theme park, which is viewed as nationalistic kitsch, and has made Skopje an example to see how national identities are constructed and how this construction is mirrored in the urban space.\nFestivals.\nThe Skopje Jazz Festival has been held annually in October since 1981. It is part of the European Jazz Network and the European Forum of World Wide Festivals. The artists' profiles include fusion, acid jazz, Latin jazz, smooth jazz, and avant-garde jazz. Ray Charles, Tito Puente, Gotan Project, Al Di Meola, Youssou N'Dour, amongst others, have performed at the festival. Another music festival in Skopje is the Blues and Soul Festival. It is a relatively new event in the Macedonian cultural scene that occurs every summer in early July. Past guests include Larry Coryell, Mick Taylor &amp; the All-Stars Blues Band, Candy Dulfer &amp; Funky Stuff, Jo\u00e3o Bosco, the Temptations, Tolo Marton Trio, Blues Wire, and Phil Guy.\nThe Skopje Cultural Summer Festival is a cultural event that takes place in Skopje each year during the summer. The festival is a member of the International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA) and it includes musical concerts, operas, ballets, plays, art and photograph exhibitions, films, and multimedia projects that gather 2,000 participants from around the world each year including the St Petersburg Theatre, the Chamber Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre, Irina Arkhipova, Viktor Tretiakov, The Theatre of Shadows, Michel Dalberto, and David Burgess.\nMay Opera Evenings is a festival that has occurred annually in Skopje since 1972 and is dedicated to promoting opera amongst the general public. Over the years, it has evolved into a stage on which artists from some 50 countries have performed. There is one other major international theatre festival that takes place each year at the end of September, the Young Open Theater Festival (MOT), which was organised for the first time in May 1976 by the Youth Cultural Center \u2013 Skopje. More than 700 theatrical performances have been presented at this festival so far, most of them being alternative, experimental theatre groups engaging young writers and actors. The MOT International Theatre Festival is also a member of the International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts or IETM. Within the framework of the MOT Festival, the Macedonian National Center of the International Theater Institute (ITI) was established, and at the 25th ITI World Congress in Munich in 1993, it became a regular member of this theatre association.\nThe Skopje Film Festival is an annual event held in the city every March. Over 50 films are shown at this five-day festival, mostly from North Macedonia and Europe, but also including some non-commercial film productions from all over the world.\nNightlife.\nSkopje has a diverse nightlife. There is a large emphasis on casinos, many of which are associated with hotels. In 2010, the Colosseum club was named fifth on a list of the best clubs in South-eastern Europe. Armin van Buuren, Above and Beyond, The Shapeshifters are just some of the many musicians that have visited the club. Nighttime concerts in local, regional and global music are often held at the To\u0161e Proeski Arena and Boris Trajkovski Sports Center. For middle-aged people, places for having fun are also the \"kafeanas\" where traditional Macedonian food is served and traditional Macedonian music (\"Starogradska muzika\") is played, but music from all the Balkans, particularly Serbian folk music is also popular. Apart from the traditional Macedonian restaurants, there are restaurants featuring international cuisines. The Old Bazaar was a popular nightlife destination in the past. The national government has created a project to revive nightlife in the Old Bazaar. The closing time in shops, caf\u00e9s and restaurants was extended due to the high attendances recorded. In the bazaar's restaurants, along with the traditional Macedonian wine and food, dishes of the Ottoman cuisine are also served.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nSkopje is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29622", "revid": "4967956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29622", "title": "Speed metal", "text": "Subgenre of heavy metal music\nSpeed metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\" music.\nIt is usually considered less abrasive and more melodic than thrash metal. However, speed metal is usually faster and more aggressive than traditional heavy metal, also showing more inclination to virtuoso soloing and featuring short instrumental passages between couplets. Speed metal songs frequently make use of highly expressive vocals, but are usually less likely to employ \"harsh\" vocals than thrash metal songs.\nOrigins.\nNew wave of British heavy metal.\nOne of the key influences on the development of speed metal was the new wave of British heavy metal, or NWOBHM. This was a heavy metal movement that started in the late 1970s in Britain and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. NWOBHM bands toned down the blues influences of earlier acts, incorporated elements of punk, increased the tempo, and adopted a \"tougher\" sound, taking a harder approach to their music.\nIt was an era directed almost exclusively at heavy metal fans and is considered to be a major foundation stone for the extreme metal genres.\nThe NWOBHM came to dominate the heavy metal scene of the early-mid-1980s. It was musically characterised by fast upbeat tempo songs, power chords, fast guitar solos and melodic, soaring vocals. Groups such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Venom, Saxon and Mot\u00f6rhead as well as many lesser-known ones, became part of the canon that influenced American bands that formed in the early eighties.\nOther metal influences.\nMot\u00f6rhead is often credited as the first band to play speed metal in the mid-1970s. The Sweet released \"Sweet F.A.\" and \"Set Me Free\" in April 1974 which heavily influenced speed metal later in the decade. Some of speed metal's earlier influences include Black Sabbath's \"Children of the Grave\" and \"Symptom of the Universe\", Budgie's \"Breadfan\" and Queen's \"Stone Cold Crazy\" (the latter two were eventually covered by the thrash metal band Metallica), as well as certain Deep Purple songs such as \"Speed King\", \"Fireball\" and \"Highway Star\". The latter was called \"early speed metal\" by Robb Reiner of speed metal band Anvil.\nHistory.\nThe origin of the genre's name is the aptly named \"Speed King\" by Deep Purple. Recording on the song started in 1969 making it nearly a full decade ahead of the musical style being recognised. The song is not only very fast and technical but was also extremely loud creating noticeable distortion in the recording process. The title song for the band's next album, \"Fireball\", is a further refinement of the band's influence with drummer Ian Paice's use of the double bass drum. The way the double bass drum is played in \"Fireball\"\u2014uptempo \"four on the floor\"\u2014became a mainstay in many heavy, speed and thrash metal songs in the years that followed.\nSpeed metal eventually evolved into thrash metal. Although many tend to equate the two subgenres, others argue that there is a distinct difference between them. In his book \"\", Ian Christe states that \"...thrash metal relies more on long, wrenching rhythmic breaks, while speed metal... is a cleaner and more musically intricate subcategory, still loyal to the dueling melodies of classic metal.\" However, on the very next page, Christe calls speed metal a \"subset of thrash metal\" and argues that \"There was little intrinsic difference between speed metal and thrash metal. With the sudden boom of fast, raging bands, however, it sometimes helped to distinguish between the throbbing, rhythm-heavy thrash metal and something a bit cleaner and more melodic--dubbed speed metal.\"\nSome may argue that first-wave black metal bands such as Venom, Sodom, and Bathory were speed metal and that black metal evolved as an extreme form of speed metal. Speed metal also played a major role in formation of power metal, with Helloween's, one of the \"big four\" of power metal, first two albums being speed metal, or speed metal adjacent, in the case of \"\".\nEtymology.\nThe term speed metal originated during the 1980s to refer to what is now known as thrash metal. The speed metal genre as it is understood today was defined retrospectively in the 1990s.\nRegional differences.\nSpeed metal's sound varied between various regional scenes. European bands leaned towards the sound of bands like Venom and Mot\u00f6rhead. Japanese bands had a more melodic sound that resembled power metal. North American bands had a faster, more aggressive sound that would later influence the thrash metal movement.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He died in a fire aboard Air Canada Flight 797, grounded at the Greater Cincinnati Airport, at the age of 33.\nEarly life and musical development.\nRogers was born in Hamilton, Ontario, the eldest son of Nathan Allison Rogers and Valerie (n\u00e9e Bushell) Rogers, two Maritimers who had relocated to Ontario in search of work shortly after their marriage in July 1948. Although Rogers was raised in Binbrook, Ontario, he often spent summers visiting family in Guysborough County, Nova Scotia.\nIt was there that he became familiar with the way of life in the Maritimes, an influence which was to have a profound impact on his subsequent musical development. He was interested in music from an early age, reportedly beginning to sing shortly after learning to speak. He received his first guitar, a miniature hand-built by his uncle Lee Bushell, when he was five years of age. He was exposed to a variety of music influences, but among the most lasting were the country and western tunes his uncles would sing during family get-togethers. Throughout his childhood, he would practice his singing and playing along with his brother Garnet, six years his junior.\nWhile Rogers was attending Saltfleet High School, Stoney Creek, Ontario, he started to meet other young people interested in folk music, although at this time he was dabbling in rock and roll, singing and playing bass guitar in garage bands such as \"Stanley and the Living Stones\" and \"The Hobbits\". After high school, Rogers briefly attended both McMaster University and Trent University, where he performed in small venues with other student musicians, including Ian Tamblyn, Christopher Ward and fellow Hobbit Nigel Russell. Russell wrote the song \"White Collar Holler\", which Rogers sang frequently on stage.\nRogers signed with RCA Records in 1970 and recorded two singles: \"Here's to You Santa Claus\" in 1970, and \"The Fat Girl Rag\" in 1971. In 1973, Rogers recorded three singles for Polygram: \"Three Pennies\", \"Guysborough Train\", and \"Past Fifty.\"\nIn 1976, Rogers recorded his debut album, \"Fogarty's Cove\", released in 1977 on Barnswallow Records. The album's subject matter dealt almost entirely with life in maritime Canada, and was an immediate success. Rogers then formed Fogarty's Cove Music, and bought Barnswallow during the production of \"Turnaround\", allowing him to release his own albums. Posthumously, additional albums were released.\nSung in his rich baritone, Rogers' songs are often said to have a \"Celtic\" feel which is due, in part, to his frequent use of DADGAD guitar tuning. He regularly used his William 'Grit' Laskin-built 12-string guitar in his performances. His best-known songs include \"Northwest Passage\", \"Barrett's Privateers\", \"The Mary Ellen Carter\", \"Make and Break Harbour\", \"The Idiot\", \"Fogarty's Cove\", and \"White Squall\".\nDeath.\nRogers died alongside 22 other passengers most likely of smoke inhalation on June 2, 1983, while travelling on Air Canada Flight 797 (a McDonnell Douglas DC-9) after performing at the Kerrville Folk Festival. The airliner was flying from Dallas, Texas, to Toronto and Montreal when a fire from an unknown ignition source within the vanity or toilet shroud of the aft washroom forced it to make an emergency landing at the Greater Cincinnati Airport in northern Kentucky. There were initially no visible flames, and after attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, smoke filled the cabin. Upon landing, the plane's doors were opened, allowing the five crew and 18 of the 41 passengers to escape, but approximately 90 seconds into the evacuation the oxygen rushing in from outside caused a flash fire.\nSoon after his death, stories began to circulate about Rogers' final moments. Blogger Amber Frost claimed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Before most likely succumbing to smoke inhalation, he used his last moments to guide other passengers to safety with his booming voice. I've heard more than one Canuck proudly declare that for all Rogers' odes to Canada, he was never more Canadian than in his final words: \"Let me help you.\"\nThese accounts cannot be verified, as the National Transportation Safety Board ran a full investigation of the incident and interviewed every single survivor, and there is no firsthand account, official or unofficial, of such an occurrence. Stan Rogers most likely died before the doors were even opened, due to smoke inhalation from the fire. Regardless, the circumstances of Rogers' death still circulate as folklore. As his official biographer Christopher Gudgeon writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the funeral, it is said, a statue of the Virgin Mary began to vibrate. A lone eagle soared above the gravesite and landed on the casket just as it was about to be lowered. Since in truth there was no burial at all, it's clear that some of these rumors are the product of overactive imaginations. From the ashes of flight 797, a new figure emerged: Saint Stan. He was an extension of Rogers' Maritime Stan persona, only rougher and saltier still, with a heart of gold, a golden voice, and not a spot on him. Garnet calls it the 'Elvisization' of his brother. In death, we discovered Stan Rogers, bigger than ever.\nHis ashes were scattered off the north-eastern shore of Nova Scotia, Canada.\nLegacy.\nRogers' legacy includes his recordings, songbook, and plays for which he was commissioned to write music. His songs are still frequently covered by other musicians, including children's performer Raffi on his 1977 out-of-print album \"Adult Entertainment\", and are perennial favourites at Canadian campfires and song circles. Members of Rogers' band, including his brother Garnet Rogers, continue to be active performers and form a significant part of the fabric of contemporary Canadian folk music. Following his death, he was nominated for the 1984 Juno Awards in the category for Best Male Vocalist. That same year, he was posthumously awarded the Dipl\u00f4me d\u2019Honneur of the Canadian Conference of the Arts. In 1994, his posthumous live album \"Home in Halifax\" was likewise nominated for Best Roots and Traditional Album.\nHis widow, Ariel, continues to oversee his estate and legacy. His music and lyrics have been featured in numerous written publications and films. For instance, his lyrics have appeared in school poetry books, taking their place alongside acknowledged classics. His song \"Northwest Passage\" was featured in the last episode of the TV show \"Due South\", his songs \"Barrett's Privateers\" and \"Watching the Apples Grow\" having been previously featured. \"Barrett's Privateers\" has also been used extensively in promotion ads for Alexander Keith's ale. In the 2005 CTV made-for-TV movie on the life of Terry Fox, Rogers' \"Turnaround\" is the music over the closing shot. As the movie ends, Fox is depicted, alone, striding up a hill, while the lyric \"And yours was the open road. The bitter song / The heavy load that I'll never share, tho' the offer's still there / Every time you turn around,\" forges a link between these Canadian icons. Many of his songs on the albums \"Northwest Passage\" and \"From Fresh Water\" refer to events in Canadian history.\nAdrienne Clarkson, who, prior to serving as the Governor General of Canada from 1999 to 2005, had worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, highlighted Rogers' career in a 1989 television documentary called \"One Warm Line\" on CBC Television; she also quoted Rogers in her investitural address.\nWhen CBC's Peter Gzowski asked Canadians to pick an alternate national anthem, \"Northwest Passage\" was the overwhelming choice.\nThe Stan Rogers Folk Festival is held every year in Canso, Nova Scotia. In 1995, several artists performed two nights of concerts at Halifax's Rebecca Cohn Auditorium, which were released on album that year as \"Remembering Stan Rogers\", which peaked at number 36 on the \"RPM\" Country Albums chart.\nRogers is also a lasting fixture of the Canadian folk festival Summerfolk, held annually in Owen Sound, Ontario, where the main stage and amphitheater are dedicated as the \"Stan Rogers Memorial Canopy\". The festival is firmly fixed in tradition, with Rogers' song \"The Mary Ellen Carter\" being sung by all involved, including the audience and a medley of acts at the festival.\nAt The Canmore Folk Festival, Alberta's longest running folk music festival, performers take to the Stan Rogers Memorial Stage, which is the festival's main stage.\nStan's son, Nathan Rogers, is also an established Canadian folk artist with a voice and lyrical acumen similar to his father's. He has released two critically acclaimed solo albums and tours internationally as a solo act and in the trio Dry Bones.\nIn 1995, with permission from Estelle Rogers, Vancouver Celtic Rock band Three Row Barley released a live version of Barrett's Privateers on their album \"Overserved\".\nOn his 2006 album \"Writing In The Margins\", American folk musician John Gorka covered Rogers' song \"The Lockkeeper\". \"That's How Legends Are Made,\" a song from Gorka's 1990 album \"Land of The Bottom Line\", is also a tribute to Rogers.\nIn 2007, Rogers was recognized posthumously with a National Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards held in Toronto.\nIn 2020, Canadian Premier League soccer club HFX Wanderers FC's home kit featured a soundwave image taken from Rogers' \"Barrett's Privateers\", inspired in part by the song's adoption by Privateers 1882, a supporters group of the Wanderers.\nBand.\nWhile occasionally performing or recording solo, Rogers typically worked with other musicians. \nEarly in his career, he was accompanied live by guitarist Nigel Russell. \nIn 1973 his brother, Garnet Rogers, joined as principal sideman and co-arranger. For the next 10 years, they performed live as a trio, joined by a succession of bassists, including Jim Ogilvie, David Woodhead, David Alan Eadie and Jim Morison. \nThis live trio was occasionally augmented by other musicians, as at a string of shows recorded for the 1979 live album \"Between the Breaks ... Live!\", and a 1983 CBC radio broadcast (later released as \"Home in Halifax\"). \nHis studio albums typically featured the live trio augmented by a mix of studio musicians and special guests, with the exception of the 1983 album \"For the Family\", which featured the unaccompanied trio, who also self-produced the album.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The county seat of Sacramento County, it is located at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers in the Sacramento Valley. It is the fourth-most populous city in Northern California, sixth-most populous city in the state, and 35th-most populous city in the United States, with a population of 524,943 at the 2020 census. The Sacramento metropolitan area, with 2.46 million residents, is the 27th-largest metropolitan area in the country.\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish, the area was inhabited by the Nisenan, Maidu, and other indigenous peoples of California. In 1808, Spanish cavalryman Gabriel Moraga surveyed and named the \"R\u00edo del Sant\u00edsimo Sacramento\" (Most Holy Sacrament River), after the Blessed Sacrament. In 1839, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Mexican governor of Alta California, granted the responsibility of colonizing the Sacramento Valley to Swiss-born Mexican citizen John Augustus Sutter, who subsequently established Sutter's Fort and the settlement at the \"Rancho Nueva Helvetia.\" Following the American Conquest of California and the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento. In 1852, the city offered its county courthouse to the state of California to house the state legislature, resulting in the city becoming the permanent state capital in 1854 and ushering in the construction of a new state capitol building which was finished in 1874.\nSacramento is the seat of the California Legislature and the governor of California. It is a major center for the California healthcare industry, as the seat of Sutter Health, UC Davis Medical Center, and the UC Davis School of Medicine. In 2013, the Sacramento Convention and Visitors Bureau stated that the city receives 15.3 million visitors per year, and is home to the California Museum, Crocker Art Museum, California State Railroad Museum, California State Capitol Museum, the Sacramento Convention Center Complex, and Old Sacramento State Historic Park.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian period.\nNisenan (Southern Maidu), Modoc, and Plains Miwok American Indians have lived in the area for perhaps thousands of years. Until the settlers arrived who would eventually make Sacramento their home, these tribes left little evidence of their existence. Their diet was dominated by acorns taken from the plentiful oak trees in the region and by fruits, bulbs, seeds, and roots gathered throughout the year.\nSpanish period.\nIn 1808, the Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga encountered and named the Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento River. A Spanish writer with the Moraga expedition wrote:\nCanopies of oaks and cottonwoods, many festooned with grapevines, overhung both sides of the blue current. Birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths. The air was like champagne, and (\"the Spaniards)\" drank deep of it, drank in the beauty around them. \"\u00a1Es como el sagrado sacramento! (It's like the Blessed Sacrament.)\"\nThe valley and the river were then christened after the \"Most Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ,\" referring to the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist.\nMexican period.\nJohn Sutter Sr. first arrived in the area on August 13, 1839, at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers with a Mexican land grant of . The next year, he and his party established Sutter's Fort, a massive adobe structure with walls high and thick.\nRepresenting Mexico, Sutter Sr. called his colony New Helvetia, a Swiss-inspired name, and was the political authority and dispenser of justice in the new settlement. Soon, the colony began to grow as more and more pioneers headed west. Within just a few short years, Sutter Sr. had become a grand success, owning a orchard and a herd of 13,000 cattle. Fort Sutter became a regular stop for the increasing number of immigrants coming through the valley. In 1847, Sutter Sr. received 2,000 fruit trees, which started the agriculture industry in the Sacramento Valley. Later that year, Sutter Sr. hired James Marshall to build a sawmill so he could continue to expand his empire, but unbeknownst to many, Sutter Sr.'s \"empire\" had been built on thin margins of credit.\nAmerican period.\nIn 1848, when James W. Marshall discovered gold at Sutter's Mill in Coloma (some northeast of the fort), numerous gold-seekers came to the area, increasing the population. In August 1848, Sutter Sr.'s son, John Sutter Jr., arrived to assist his father in reducing his debt. The Sutters struggled to contain the effects of thousands of new gold miners and prospectors in the area, many of whom squatted on unwatched portions of the vast Sutter lands or stole various unattended Sutter properties or belongings. For Sutter, his employee's discovery of gold in the area turned out to be a bane.\nBy December 1848, John Sutter Jr., in association with Samuel Brannan, began laying out the City of Sacramento, south of his father's settlement of New Helvetia. This venture was undertaken against the wishes of Sutter Sr., but the father, being deeply in debt, was unable to stop it. For commercial reasons, the new city was named \"Sacramento City\" after the Sacramento River. Sutter Jr. and Brannan had United States Army Captain William H. Warner assigned to draft the official layout of the city, which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets (today's grid from C St. to Broadway and from Front St. to Alhambra Blvd.) Relations between Sutter and his son became embittered after Sacramento became an overnight commercial success. (Sutter's Fort, Mill, and the town of Sutterville, all founded by John Sutter Sr., eventually failed).\nResidents of Sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849, which was recognized by the state legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest incorporated city in California, incorporated on February 27, 1850.\nOn January 10, 1850, a flood occurred that devastated the city. The rushing waters uprooted homes and drowned livestock. The city was almost destroyed. Due to the efforts of Hardin Bigelow, Sacramento's first elected mayor, the construction of the city's first levee was completed in early 1852 (the city became known as \"The Levee City\"). However, a month after it was completed, it was breached during the first major storm of the season and the city flooded again. A new levee was built for $50,000, but it also broke, causing more flooding of the city. Between October and December 1850, Sacramento was hit with a cholera epidemic that killed 1,000 residents, including Mayor Bigelow and 17 of the city's 40 physicians. Up to 80 percent of the populace left town. On November 2, 1852, a fire known as the Great Conflagration burned more than 80 percent of the structures in the city. It is estimated that the total damage was around six million dollars. Within a month 761 structures were re-built, many of them in brick. In spite of all these hardships the new city's location just downstream from the Mother Lode in the Sierra Nevada proved irresistible, and it grew rapidly during the early 1850s, attracting a population of 10,000. The Great Flood of 1862 from December 1861 to January 1862 caused the worst flooding in Sacramento's history. In 1861, Governor Leland Stanford, who was inaugurated in early January 1862, traveled to his inauguration in a rowboat.\nThe California State Legislature, with the support of Governor John Bigler, moved to Sacramento in 1854. The capital of California under Spanish (and, subsequently, Mexican) rule had been Monterey, where, in 1849, the first Constitutional Convention and state elections were held. The convention decided San Jose would be the new state's capital. From California's statehood beginning September 9, 1850 through 1851, the legislature met in San Jose. It moved to Vallejo in 1852 and Benicia in 1853, before ending up in Sacramento in 1854. During the 1850s the city was consolidated with the County of Sacramento. In the Sacramento Constitutional Convention of 1879, Sacramento was named the permanent state capital.\nThe Classical Revival-style California State Capitol, similar to the national Capitol, was started in 1860 and completed in 1874. In 1861, the legislative session was moved to the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco for one session because of the massive flooding in Sacramento. From 1862 to 1868, part of the Leland Stanford Mansion was used for the governor's offices during Stanford's tenure as the Governor; and the legislature met in the Sacramento County Courthouse. The legislative chambers were first occupied in 1869, while construction continued around them.\nWith its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered. It was designated as the western terminus of the Pony Express. Later it became a terminus of the First transcontinental railroad, which began construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by \"The Big Four\"\u2014Mark Hopkins, Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington, and Leland Stanford. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers were key elements in the economic success of the city. Sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded through taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic Sacramento Rail Yards.\nFrom 1862 until the mid-1870s, Sacramento raised the level of its downtown by building reinforced brick walls on its downtown streets and filling the resulting street walls with dirt. The previous first floors of buildings became basements, with open space between the street and the building, previously the sidewalk, now at the basement level. Over the years, many of these underground spaces have been filled or destroyed by subsequent development. However, it is still possible to view portions of the \"Sacramento Underground\".\nModern era.\nThe city's current charter was adopted by voters in 1920. As a charter city, Sacramento is exempt from many laws and regulations passed by the state legislature. The city has expanded continuously over the years. The 1964 merger of the City of North Sacramento with Sacramento substantially increased its population, and large annexations of the Natomas area eventually led to significant population growth throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\nSacramento County (along with a portion of adjacent Placer County) is served by a customer-owned electric utility, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). Sacramento voters approved the creation of SMUD in 1923. In April 1946, after 12\u00a0years of litigation, a judge ordered Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to transfer the title of Sacramento's electric distribution system to SMUD. Today SMUD is the sixth-largest public electric utility in the U.S. and is a leader in innovative programs and services, including the development of clean fuel resources, such as solar power.\nThe year following the creation of SMUD, 1924, brought several events in Sacramento: Standard Oil executive Verne McGeorge established McGeorge School of Law, American department store Weinstock &amp; Lubin opened a new store at 12th and K street, the US$2\u00a0million Senator Hotel was opened, Sacramento's drinking water became filtered and treated drinking water, and Sacramento boxer Georgie Lee fought Francisco Guilledo, a Filipino professional boxer known as Pancho Villa, at L Street Auditorium on March 21.\nEarly in World War II, the Sacramento Assembly Center (also known as the Walerga Assembly Center) was established to house Japanese Americans forcibly \"evacuated\" from the West Coast under Executive Order 9066. The camp was one of fifteen temporary detention facilities where over 110,000 Japanese Americans, two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, were held while construction on the more permanent War Relocation Authority camps was completed. The assembly center was built on the site of a former migrant labor camp, and inmates began arriving from Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties on May 6, 1942. It closed after only 52 days, on June 26, and the population of 4,739 was transferred to the Tule Lake concentration camp. The site was then turned over to the Army Signal Corps and dedicated as Camp Kohler.\nAfter the war and the end of the incarceration program, returning Japanese Americans were often unable to find housing and so 234 families temporarily lived at the former assembly center. Camp Kohler was destroyed by a fire in December 1947, and the assembly center site is now part of the Foothill Farms-North Highlands subdivision.\nThe Sacramento-Yolo Port District was created in 1947, and the ground was broken on the Port of Sacramento in 1949.\nOn June 29, 1963, with 5,000 spectators waiting to welcome her, the Motor Vessel \"Taipei Victory\" arrived. The Nationalist Chinese flagship docked at the Port of Sacramento, being the first ocean-going vessel in Sacramento since the steamship \"Harpoon\" in 1934.\nIn 1967, Ronald Reagan became the last Governor of California to live permanently in the city. The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of several local military bases: McClellan Air Force Base, Mather Air Force Base, and Sacramento Army Depot. In 1980, there was another flood. Despite military base closures and the decline of agricultural food processing, Sacramento has continued to experience population growth in recent years. Primary sources of population growth are an influx of residents from the nearby San Francisco Bay Area, as well as immigration from Asia and Latin America.\nIn 1985, Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. In 1996, his death was attributed to the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski.\nAfter acquiring the majority stake in the Sacramento Kings, the team's new owner, Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9, with the help of the city, agreed to build a new arena in the downtown area. With a final estimated cost of $558.2\u00a0million, Sacramento's Golden 1 Center opened on September 30, 2016.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city covers . 97.81% of it is land, and 2.19% of it is water.\nDepth to groundwater is typically about . Much of the land to the west of the city (in Yolo County) is permanently reserved for a vast flood control basin (the Yolo Bypass), due to the city's historical vulnerability to floods. As a result, the contiguous urban area sprawls only west of downtown (as West Sacramento, California) but northeast and east, into the Sierra Nevada foothills, and to the south into valley farmland.\nThe city is at the confluence of the Sacramento River and the American River and has a deep-water port connected to the San Francisco Bay by a channel through the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta. It is the shipping and rail center for the Sacramento Valley.\nTrees.\nSacramento has long been known as the \"City of Trees\" owing to its abundant urban forest. The city has more trees per capita than any other city in the world. The first recorded use of the term was in 1855, and it was popular by the early 20th century. It was not always so: it was at first called the \"City of Plains\" because of the lack of trees, but soon afterward there were cottonwood trees planted, and eucalyptus varieties were imported to dry out swampland. Later, locust trees, and willows were planted along streets, then elms, then palm trees, then fruit trees in the late 1910s. It was the first US city to be designated a City of Trees by the Arbor Day Foundation in 1978.\nIn the early 21st century, the tree cover is well above that of the average tree cover of other major cities in the United States and the rest of the world, with the main species being the London plane. Other species are being introduced to increase diversity and to help cope with the effects of climate change on vegetation in the future. Treepedia, a project run by MIT using Google Maps' street-view data to calculate tree coverage in cities, ranked Sacramento the greenest city of 15 studied in the US, and third globally, after Vancouver and Singapore.\nA prominent water tower bore the slogan \"City of Trees\" until 2017 when it was repainted with the words \"America's Farm-to-Fork Capital\" (referring to the farm-to-fork movement, which promotes the consumption of locally-grown food). After 4,000 displeased citizens signed a petition protesting the change, officials agreed to include both slogans on the water tower.\nCityscape.\nCity neighborhoods.\nThe city used to group neighborhoods into four areas. As of 2011, the groupings were:\nOther neighborhoods in the city include Cal Expo, Capital Avenue, College/Glen, Creekside, Elder Creek, Erikson Industrial Park, Gateway Center, Gateway West, Glenwood Meadows, Hansen Park, Heritage Park, Johnson Business Park, Johnson Heights, Metro Center, Natomas Corporate Center, Natomas Creek, Natomas Crossing, Natomas Park, Newton Booth, Noralto, Northpointe, Norwood, Oak Knoll, Old North Sacramento, Parker Homes, Point West, Raley Industrial Park, Regency Park, Richardson Village, Richmond Grove, Sierra Oaks, Sports Complex, Strawberry Manor, Sundance Lake, Upper Land Park, Village 5, Village 7, Village 12, Village 14, Village Green, West Del Paso Heights, Westlake, Willowcreek, Wills Acres, Winn Park, and Youngs Heights.\nNotable areas.\nCapitol Mall.\nCapitol Mall connects West Sacramento and Downtown Sacramento. Some notable landmarks on this road include the Tower Bridge, Old Sacramento, and the California State Capitol Building. Capitol Mall is considered to be the business district of the city. Skyscrapers such as the Wells Fargo Center and U.S. Bank Tower, two of the tallest buildings in the city, are located on Capitol Mall and are home to several major companies. The street is also home to major festivals such as the annual Farm to Fork Festival.\nSacramento's historic Japantown once occupied much of today's Capitol Mall, spanning 4th street from K to P streets. The area suffered from the forced eviction of its Japanese residents during WW2 and never recovered, resulting in the remaining properties taken through eminent domain to create the grand promenade of today's Capitol Mall. The Nisei Memorial Hall at 4th and Q remains the last remaining property associated with Sacramento's former Japantown.\nDowntown Commons.\nOne of the newest districts in the city is Downtown Commons. Formerly home to the Downtown Plaza shopping mall, the district opened in 2016 along with Golden 1 Center. Downtown Commons, otherwise known as DOCO, is home to the Sawyer, a 16-story skyscraper with a 250-room hotel and 45 condominiums, a Macy's anchor store, an IMAX theater, and retail space with a variety of restaurants and shops.\nDowntown Sacramento.\nDowntown Sacramento is home to the SAFE Credit Union Convention Center and Theater, Sacramento City Hall, the Sacramento Public Library, and K Street, a historic street home to apartments, retail, and historical buildings. In addition, Downtown Sacramento is home to several hotels including the Citizen Hotel, housed in one of the first skyscrapers built in the city.\nEast Sacramento.\nEast Sacramento is a neighborhood in between Midtown and Sacramento State. This neighborhood is well known for being home to McKinley Park and Rose Garden and the Fabulous Forties, home to some of the most expensive, largest, and architecturally unique homes in the city. East Sacramento was home to Ronald Reagan during his term as Governor of California and this neighborhood was prominently featured in Greta Gerwig's film Lady Bird.\nHistoric Chinatown.\nThe Opium Wars of the 1840s and 1850s, along with the California gold rush, brought many Chinese people to California. Most arrived at San Francisco, which was then the largest city in California and known as \"Daai Fau\" (). Some eventually came to Sacramento, then the second-largest city in California and consequently called \"Yee Fow\" (). Today the city is known as \" () by mainland Chinese and as \" \"S\u0101g\u0101m\u00edhndouh\" and \"Sh\u0101ji\u0101mi\u01cendu\u00f3\" by Cantonese speakers and Taiwanese respectively.Sacramento's Chinatown was on \"I\" Street from Second to Sixth Streets, called the China Slough. At the time, this area of \"I\" Street was considered a health hazard because, lying within a levee zone, it was lower than other parts of the city, which were situated on higher land. Throughout Sacramento's Chinatown history, there were fires, acts of discrimination, and prejudicial legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act that was not repealed until 1943. The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who resented the Chinese working class. Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out. Newspapers such as The Sacramento Union wrote stories at the time that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away. While most of Sacramento's Chinatown has now been razed, a small Chinatown mall remains as well as a museum dedicated to the history of Sacramento's Chinatown.\nNewton Booth Historic District.\nThe Newton Booth Historic District, named for Newton Booth, is located on the southeast corner of Sacramento's original 1848 street grid.&lt;ref name=\"cityofsacramento.org-Historic-District-Plans/Newton-Booth\"&gt;\n&lt;/ref&gt;\nOld Sacramento.\nThe oldest part of the town besides Sutter's Fort is Old Sacramento, which consists of cobbled streets and many historic buildings, several from the 1850s and 1860s. Buildings have been preserved, restored, or reconstructed, and the district is now a substantial tourist attraction, with rides on steam-powered historic trains and horse-drawn carriages.\nLavender Heights.\nThe Lavender District, formally designated as Lavender Heights in 2015, is central to Sacramento\u2019s LGBTQ+ culture and community. It is home to the Gay &amp; Lesbian Community Center, five LGBTQ+ nightclubs such as Badlands and Faces, and numerous LGBTQ+-owned shops, galleries, and eateries.\nPoverty Ridge Historic District.\nThe Poverty Ridge Historic District is within Sacramento's original 1848 street grid and bounded to the west by 21st Street, to the north by S Street, to the east by 23rd Street, to the south by W Street and U.S. Route 50, and includes the block bounded by 20th Street, 21st Street, S Street, and T Street.\nThe Poverty Ridge Historic District was considered to be Sacramento's wealthiest\nneighborhood from 1868 to 1947.&lt;ref name=\"cityofsacramento.org-Historic-District-Plans/Poverty-Ridge\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nClimate.\nSacramento has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Csa\"), characterized by hot, long, dry summers and cool winters with a decent amount of rainfall. Most of the annual precipitation generally occurs from November to April, though there may be a day or two of light rainfall in May or October. The normal annual mean temperature is , with the monthly daily average temperature ranging from in December to in July. Summer heat is sometimes moderated by a sea breeze known as the \"delta breeze\" which comes through the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta from the San Francisco Bay, and temperatures cool down sharply at night.\nThe foggiest months are December and January. Tule fog can be extremely dense, lowering visibility to less than and making driving conditions extremely hazardous. Chilling tule fog events have been known to last for several consecutive days or weeks. During Tule fog events, temperatures do not exceed .\nSnowfall is rare in Sacramento, which is only above sea level. In the downtown area, only three significant snow accumulations have occurred since 1900, the last one being in 1976. During especially cold winter and spring storms, intense showers do occasionally produce a significant amount of hail, which can create hazardous driving conditions. Snowfall in the city often melts upon ground contact, with traceable amounts occurring in some years. Significant annual snow accumulations occur in the foothills east of the city, which had brief and traceable amounts of snowfall in January 2002, December 2009, and February 2011. The greatest snowfall ever recorded in Sacramento was on January 5, 1888.\nOn average, there are 76 days with a high of +, and 14 days with a high of +; On the other extreme, there are 8.5 days where the temperature remains below , and 15 freezing nights per year. Official temperature extremes range from on December 22, 1990, to on September 6, 2022; a station around east-southeast of the city dipped to on December 11, 1932.\nThe average annual precipitation is . On average, precipitation falls on 58 days each year in Sacramento, and nearly all of this falls during the winter months. As in much of California, precipitation is highly variable from year to year, ranging from as little as in 2013 to in 1983. Average January rainfall is , and measurable precipitation is rare during the summer months. In February 1992, Sacramento had 16 consecutive days of rain, resulting in an accumulation of for the period. On rare occasions, monsoonal moisture surges from the Desert Southwest can bring upper-level moisture to the Sacramento region, leading to increased summer cloudiness, humidity, and even light showers and thunderstorms. Monsoon clouds do occur, usually during late June through early September. Sacramento is the second most flood-susceptible city in the United States after New Orleans.\nSacramento has been noted as being the sunniest location on the planet for four months of the year, from June through September. It holds the distinction as the sunniest month, in terms of the percentage of possible sunshine, of anywhere in the world; July in Sacramento averages 14 hours and 12 minutes of sunshine per day, amounting to approximately 98% of possible sunshine.\nSince 2010, statewide droughts in California have further strained Sacramento's water security.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2002, the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University conducted for \"Time\" magazine named Sacramento \"America's Most Diverse City\". The U.S. Census Bureau also groups Sacramento with other U.S. cities having a \"high diversity\" rating of the diversity index. Moreover, Sacramento is one of the most well-integrated U.S. cities, having a relatively high level of ethnic and racial heterogeneity within its neighborhoods.\nChinese people are the largest Asian ethnic group in Sacramento, followed by Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, Hmong and Japanese. Sacramento has the largest Fijian American community, including Indo-Fijians.\n2020.\nThe 2020 United States census reported that Sacramento had a population of 524,943. The population density was . The racial makeup of Sacramento was 34.8% White, 13.2% African American, 1.4% Native American, 19.9% Asian, 1.6% Pacific Islander, 15.3% from other races, and 13.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 28.8% of the population.\nThe census reported that 96.7% of the population lived in households, 2.4% lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0.9% were institutionalized.\nThere were 192,560 households, out of which 30.7% included children under the age of 18, 37.9% were married-couple households, 8.9% were cohabiting couple households, 32.0% had a female householder with no partner present, and 21.2% had a male householder with no partner present. 29.5% of households were one person, and 10.3% were one person aged 65 or older.

The median age was 35.4years. For every 100 females, there were 95.2 males.\nThere were 202,231 housing units at an average density of , of which 192,560 (95.2%) were occupied. Of these, 49.2% were owner-occupied, and 50.8% were occupied by renters.\nIn 2023, the US Census Bureau estimated that the median household income was $83,753, and the per capita income was $42,300. About 10.3% of families and 14.4% of the population were below the poverty line.\n2010.\nThe 2010 United States census reported Sacramento had a population of 466,488. The population density was . \nThere were 138,165 Hispanic or Latino residents of any race (26.9%); 22.6% of the population was of Mexican heritage, 0.7% Puerto Rican, 0.5% Salvadoran, 0.2% Guatemalan, and 0.2% Nicaraguan. Non-Hispanic Whites were 34.5% of the population in 2010, down from 71.4% in 1970.\nThe census reported 458,174 people (98.2% of the population) lived in households, 4,268 (0.9%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 4,046 (0.9%) were institutionalized. Demographics were not affected by the end of the 2000s United States housing bubble and the 2008 financial crisis.\nThere were 174,624 households, out of which 57,870 (33.1%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 65,556 (37.5%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 27,640 (15.8%) had a female householder with no husband present, 10,534 (6.0%) had a male householder with no wife present.

The carpet is a generalization of the Cantor set to two dimensions; another such generalization is the Cantor dust.\nThe technique of subdividing a shape into smaller copies of itself, removing one or more copies, and continuing recursively can be extended to other shapes. For instance, subdividing an equilateral triangle into four equilateral triangles, removing the middle triangle, and recursing leads to the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. In three dimensions, a similar construction based on cubes is known as the Menger sponge.\nConstruction.\nThe construction of the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet begins with a square. The square is cut into 9 congruent subsquares in a 3-by-3 grid, and the central subsquare is removed. The same procedure is then applied recursively to the remaining 8 subsquares, \"ad infinitum\". It can be realised as the set of points in the unit square whose coordinates written in base three do not both have a digit '1' in the same position, using the infinitesimal number representation of formula_1.\nThe process of recursively removing squares is an example of a finite subdivision rule.\nProperties.\nThe area of the carpet is zero (in standard Lebesgue measure).\nProof: Denote as ai the area of iteration i. Then \"a\"\"i\" + 1 \n \"ai\". So \"ai\" \n ()\"i\", which tends to 0 as i goes to infinity.\nThe interior of the carpet is empty.\nProof: Suppose by contradiction that there is a point P in the interior of the carpet. Then there is a square centered at P which is entirely contained in the carpet. This square contains a smaller square whose coordinates are multiples of for some k. But, if this square has not been previously removed, it must have been holed in iteration \"k\" + 1, so it cannot be contained in the carpet \u2013 a contradiction.\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the carpet is formula_2.\nSierpi\u0144ski demonstrated that his carpet is a universal plane curve. That is: the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet is a compact subset of the plane with Lebesgue covering dimension 1, and every subset of the plane with these properties is homeomorphic to some subset of the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet.\nThis \"universality\" of the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet is not a true universal property in the sense of category theory: it does not uniquely characterize this space up to homeomorphism. For example, the disjoint union of a Sierpi\u0144ski carpet and a circle is also a universal plane curve. However, in 1958 Gordon Whyburn uniquely characterized the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet as follows: any curve that is locally connected and has no 'local cut-points' is homeomorphic to the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet. Here a local cut-point is a point p for which some connected neighborhood U of p has the property that \"U\" \u2212 {\"p\"} is not connected. So, for example, any point of the circle is a local cut point.\nIn the same paper Whyburn gave another characterization of the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet. Recall that a continuum is a nonempty connected compact metric space. Suppose X is a continuum embedded in the plane. Suppose its complement in the plane has countably many connected components \"C\"1, \"C\"2, \"C\"3, ... and suppose:\nThen X is homeomorphic to the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet.\nBrownian motion on the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet.\nThe topic of Brownian motion on the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet has attracted interest in recent years. Martin Barlow and Richard Bass have shown that a random walk on the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet diffuses at a slower rate than an unrestricted random walk in the plane. The latter reaches a mean distance proportional to after n steps, but the random walk on the discrete Sierpi\u0144ski carpet reaches only a mean distance proportional to for some \"\u03b2\" &gt; 2. They also showed that this random walk satisfies stronger large deviation inequalities (so called \"sub-Gaussian inequalities\") and that it satisfies the elliptic Harnack inequality without satisfying the parabolic one. The existence of such an example was an open problem for many years.\nWallis sieve.\nA variation of the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet, called the Wallis sieve, starts in the same way, by subdividing the unit square into nine smaller squares and removing the middle of them. At the next level of subdivision, it subdivides each of the squares into 25 smaller squares and removes the middle one, and it continues at the ith step by subdividing each square into (2\"i\" + 1)2 (the odd squares) smaller squares and removing the middle one. By the Wallis product, the area of the resulting set is , unlike the standard Sierpi\u0144ski carpet which has zero limiting area. Although the Wallis sieve has positive Lebesgue measure, no subset that is a Cartesian product of two sets of real numbers has this property, so its Jordan measure is zero.\nApplications.\nMobile phone and Wi-Fi fractal antennas have been produced in the form of a few iterations of the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet. Due to their self-similarity and scale invariance, they easily accommodate multiple frequencies. They are also easy to fabricate and smaller than conventional antennas of similar performance, thus being optimal for pocket-sized mobile phones.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets\u2014that is, it is a mathematically generated pattern reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpi\u0144ski.\nConstructions.\nThere are many different ways of constructing the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle.\nRemoving triangles.\nThe Sierpi\u0144ski triangle may be constructed from an equilateral triangle by repeated removal of triangular subsets:\nEach removed triangle (a \"trema\") is topologically an open set. This process of recursively removing triangles is an example of a finite subdivision rule.\nShrinking and duplication.\nThe same sequence of shapes, converging to the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, can alternatively be generated by the following steps:\nThis infinite process is not dependent upon the starting shape being a triangle\u2014it is just clearer that way. The first few steps starting, for example, from a square also tend towards a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. Michael Barnsley used an image of a fish to illustrate this in his paper \"V-variable fractals and superfractals.\"\nThe actual fractal is what would be obtained after an infinite number of iterations. More formally, one describes it in terms of functions on closed sets of points. If we let \"d\"A denote the dilation by a factor of about a point A, then the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle with corners A, B, and C is the fixed set of the transformation &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;.\nThis is an attractive fixed set, so that when the operation is applied to any other set repeatedly, the images converge on the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. This is what is happening with the triangle above, but any other set would suffice.\nChaos game.\nIf one takes a point and applies each of the transformations \"d\"A, \"d\"B, and \"d\"C to it randomly, the resulting points will be dense in the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, so the following algorithm will again generate arbitrarily close approximations to it:\nStart by labeling p1, p2 and p3 as the corners of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, and a random point v1. Set v\"n\"+1 = (v\"n\" + p\"rn\"), where \"rn\" is a random number 1, 2 or 3. Draw the points v1 to v\u221e. If the first point v1 was a point on the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, then all the points v\"n\" lie on the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. If the first point v1 to lie within the perimeter of the triangle is not a point on the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, none of the points v\"n\" will lie on the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, however they will converge on the triangle. If v1 is outside the triangle, the only way v\"n\" will land on the actual triangle, is if v\"n\" is on what would be part of the triangle, if the triangle was infinitely large.\nOr more simply:\nThis method is also called the chaos game, and is an example of an iterated function system. You can start from any point outside or inside the triangle, and it would eventually form the Sierpi\u0144ski Gasket with a few leftover points (if the starting point lies on the outline of the triangle, there are no leftover points). With pencil and paper, a brief outline is formed after placing approximately one hundred points, and detail begins to appear after a few hundred.\nArrowhead construction of Sierpi\u0144ski gasket.\nAnother construction for the Sierpi\u0144ski gasket shows that it can be constructed as a curve in the plane. It is formed by a process of repeated modification of simpler curves, analogous to the construction of the Koch snowflake:\nAt every iteration, this construction gives a continuous curve. In the limit, these approach a curve that traces out the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle by a single continuous directed (infinitely wiggly) path, which is called the Sierpi\u0144ski arrowhead. In fact, the aim of Sierpi\u0144ski's original article in 1915 was to show an example of a curve (a Cantorian curve), as the title of the article itself declares.\nCellular automata.\nThe Sierpi\u0144ski triangle also appears in certain cellular automata (such as Rule 90), including those relating to Conway's Game of Life. For instance, the Life-like cellular automaton B1/S12 when applied to a single cell will generate four approximations of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. A very long, one cell\u2013thick line in standard life will create two mirrored Sierpi\u0144ski triangles. The time-space diagram of a replicator pattern in a cellular automaton also often resembles a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, such as that of the common replicator in HighLife. The Sierpi\u0144ski triangle can also be found in the Ulam-Warburton automaton and the Hex-Ulam-Warburton automaton.\nPascal's triangle.\nIf one takes Pascal's triangle with formula_1 rows and colors the even numbers white, and the odd numbers black, the result is an approximation to the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. More precisely, the limit as n approaches infinity of this parity-colored formula_1-row Pascal triangle is the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle.\nAs the proportion of black numbers tends to zero with increasing \"n\", a corollary is that the proportion of odd binomial coefficients tends to zero as \"n\" tends to infinity.\nTowers of Hanoi.\nThe Towers of Hanoi puzzle involves moving disks of different sizes between three pegs, maintaining the property that no disk is ever placed on top of a smaller disk. The states of an n-disk puzzle, and the allowable moves from one state to another, form an undirected graph, the Hanoi graph, that can be represented geometrically as the intersection graph of the set of triangles remaining after the nth step in the construction of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. Thus, in the limit as n goes to infinity, this sequence of graphs can be interpreted as a discrete analogue of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle.\nProperties.\nFor objects of integer dimension formula_3, scaling a figure by a factor of 2 (that is, applying a homothetic transformation of ratio 2) produces formula_4 congruent copies that fit inside the enlarged figure: for instance, doubling a line segment (1-dimensional) yields 2 copies, a square (2-dimensional) yields 4, and a cube (3-dimensional) yields 8. \nFor the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, when the figure is scaled by a factor of 2, the enlarged version can be exactly partitioned into 3 scaled copies of itself, each of scale ratio formula_5. Therefore, the relationship formula_6 holds, and solving for formula_3 gives the Hausdorff dimension \nformula_8 \nAt each iterative stage of its construction, the area that remains equals formula_9 of that from the previous stage. Consequently, after formula_10 iterations, the total area is formula_11 of the original. In the limit as formula_12, the total area tends to zero (in the sense of Lebesgue measure). \nThe points of a Sierpi\u0144ski triangle have a simple characterization in barycentric coordinates. If a point has barycentric coordinates formula_13, expressed in binary numeral form, then the point lies in the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle if and only if formula_14 for all formula_15.\nGeneralization to other moduli.\nA generalization of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle can also be generated using Pascal's triangle if a different modulus formula_16 is used. Iteration formula_10 can be generated by taking a Pascal's triangle with formula_18 rows and coloring numbers by their value modulo formula_16. As formula_10 approaches infinity, a fractal is generated.\nThe same fractal can be achieved by dividing a triangle into a tessellation of formula_21 similar triangles and removing the triangles that are upside-down from the original, then iterating this step with each smaller triangle.\nConversely, the fractal can also be generated by beginning with a triangle and duplicating it and arranging formula_22 of the new figures in the same orientation into a larger similar triangle with the vertices of the previous figures touching, then iterating that step.\nAnalogues in higher dimensions.\nThe Sierpi\u0144ski tetrahedron or tetrix is the three-dimensional analogue of the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, formed by repeatedly shrinking a regular tetrahedron to one half its original height, putting together four copies of this tetrahedron with corners touching, and then repeating the process.\nA tetrix constructed from an initial tetrahedron of side-length formula_23 has the property that the total surface area remains constant with each iteration. The initial surface area of the (iteration-0) tetrahedron of side-length formula_23 is formula_25. The next iteration consists of four copies with side length formula_26, so the total area is formula_27 again. Subsequent iterations again quadruple the number of copies and halve the side length, preserving the overall area. Meanwhile, the volume of the construction is halved at every step and therefore approaches zero. The limit of this process has neither volume nor surface but, like the Sierpi\u0144ski gasket, is an intricately connected curve. Its Hausdorff dimension is formula_28; here \"log\" denotes the natural logarithm, the numerator is the logarithm of the number of copies of the shape formed from each copy of the previous iteration, and the denominator is the logarithm of the factor by which these copies are scaled down from the previous iteration. If all points are projected onto a plane that is parallel to two of the outer edges, they exactly fill a square of side length formula_29 without overlap.\nHistory.\nWac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski described the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle in 1915. However, similar patterns appear already as a common motif of 13th-century Cosmatesque inlay stonework.\nThe Apollonian gasket, named for Apollonius of Perga (3rd century BC), was first described by Gottfried Leibniz (17th century) and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpi\u0144ski triangle.\nEtymology.\nThe usage of the word \"gasket\" to refer to the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle refers to gaskets such as are found in motors, and which sometimes feature a series of holes of decreasing size, similar to the fractal; this usage was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot, who thought the fractal looked similar to \"the part that prevents leaks in motors\"."}

It has formed a part of the sovereign territory of Russia and its predecessor states since the lengthy conquest of Siberia, which began with the fall of the Khanate of Sibir in 1582 and concluded with the annexation of Chukotka in 1778. Siberia is vast and sparsely populated, covering an area of over \u2013 about three-quarters of Russia's total area, but home to roughly a quarter of Russia's population. Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, and Omsk are the largest cities in the area.\nBecause Siberia is a geographic and historic concept and not a political entity, there is no single precise definition of its territorial borders. Traditionally, Siberia spans the entire expanse of land from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, with the Ural River usually forming the southernmost portion of its western boundary, and includes most of the drainage basin of the Arctic Ocean. It is further defined as stretching from the territories within the Arctic Circle in the north to the northern borders of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China in the south, although the hills of north-central Kazakhstan are also commonly included. The Russian government divides the region into three federal districts (groupings of Russian federal subjects), of which only the central one is officially referred to as \"Siberian\"; the other two are the Ural and Far Eastern federal districts, named for the Ural and Russian Far East regions that correspond respectively to the western and eastern thirds of Siberia in the broader sense.\nSiberia is known for its long, harsh winters, with a January average of \u221225\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221213\u00a0\u00b0F). Although it is geographically located in Asia, Russian sovereignty and colonization since the 16th century has led to perceptions of the region as culturally and ethnically European. Over 85% of its population are of European descent, chiefly Russian (comprising the Siberian sub-ethnic group), and Eastern Slavic cultural influences predominate throughout the region. Nevertheless, there exist sizable ethnic minorities of Asian lineage, including various Turkic communities\u2014many of which, such as the Yakuts, Tuvans, Altai, and Khakas, are Indigenous\u2014along with the Mongolic Buryats, ethnic Koreans, and smaller groups of Samoyedic and Tungusic peoples (several of whom are classified as Indigenous small-numbered peoples by the Russian government), among many others.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the name is uncertain. In the Russian language, it was adopted as a toponym through contact with the Khanate of Sibir (\u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) since the 15th century. The Russian name \"Yugra\" was applied to the northern lands east of the Ural Mountains, which had been known of since the 11th century or earlier, while the name \"Siberia\" is first mentioned in Russian chronicles at the start of the 15th century in connection with the death of the khan Tokhtamysh in \"the Siberian land\".\nSome sources say that \"Siberia\" originates from the Siberian Tatar word for 'sleeping land' (\"Sib-ir\"), but this discourse does not correspond to the actual Siberian Tatar language. Mongolist Gy\u00f6rgy Kara posits that the toponym \"Siberia\" is derived from a Mongolic word \"sibir\", cognate with modern Buryat \"sheber\" 'dense forest'. A different hypothesis claims that the region was named after the Sibe people. Another account sees the name as the ancient tribal ethnonym of the Sihirtia or Sirtya (also \"Sypyr\" [s\u02b2\u0275p\u1d7br])), a hypothetical Paleo-Asiatic ethnic group assimilated by the Nenets.\nPolish historian Jan Chyliczkowski has proposed that the name derives from the Proto-Slavic word for 'north' (cf. Russian \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440 \"sever\"), as in Severia. Anatole Baikaloff has dismissed this explanation. He says that the neighboring Chinese, Turks, and Mongolians, who have similar names for the region, would not have known Russian. He suggests that the name might be a combination of two words with Turkic origin, \"su\" 'water' and \"bir\" 'wild land'.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nSiberia in Paleozoic times formed the continent of Siberia/Angaraland, which fused to Euramerica during the Late Carboniferous, as part of the formation of Pangea. The Siberian Traps were formed by one of the largest-known volcanic events of the last 251\u00a0million years of Earth's geological history. Their activity continued for a million years, and some scientists consider it a possible cause of the \"Great Dying\" about 250\u00a0million years ago, estimated to have killed 90% of species existing at the time.\nThe region has paleontological significance, as it contains bodies of prehistoric animals from the Pleistocene Epoch, preserved in ice or permafrost. Specimens of Goldfuss cave lion cubs, Yuka the mammoth and another woolly mammoth from Oymyakon, a woolly rhinoceros from the Kolyma, and bison and horses from Yukagir have been found. Remote Wrangel Island and the Taymyr Peninsula are believed to have been the last places on Earth to support woolly mammoths as isolated populations until their extinction around 2000 BC.\nAt least three species of humans lived in southern Siberia around 40,000 years ago: \"H. sapiens\", \"H. neanderthalensis\", and the Denisovans. In 2010, DNA evidence identified the last as a separate species. Late Paleolithic southern Siberians appear to be related to Paleolithic Europeans and the Paleolithic J\u014dmon people of Japan. DNA analysis has revealed that the oldest fossil known to carry the derived KITLG allele, which is responsible for blond hair in modern Europeans, is a 17,000 year old Ancient North Eurasian specimen from Siberia. Ancient North Eurasian populations genetically similar to Mal'ta\u2013Buret' culture and Afontova Gora were an important genetic contributor to Native Americans, Europeans, Ancient Central Asians, South Asians, and some East Asian groups (such as the Ainu people). Evidence from full genomic studies suggests that the first people in the Americas diverged from Ancient East Asians about 36,000 years ago and expanded northwards into Siberia, where they encountered and interacted with Ancient North Eurasians, giving rise to both Paleosiberian peoples and Ancient Native Americans, which later migrated towards the Beringian region, became isolated from other populations, and subsequently populated the Americas.\nEarly history.\nDuring past millennia, different groups of nomads \u2013 such as the Enets, the Nenets, the Huns, the Xiongnu, the Scythians, and the Yugur \u2013 inhabited various parts of Siberia. The Afanasievo and Tashtyk cultures of the Yenisey valley and Altay Mountains are associated with the Indo-European migrations across Eurasia. The proto-Mongol Khitan people, whose territory spanned a vast area, were also attested in the Ob region of western Siberia in the sixteenth century.\nIn the 13th century, during the period of the Mongol Empire, the Mongols conquered a large part of this area. With the breakup of the Golden Horde, the autonomous Khanate of Sibir was formed in the late-15th century. Turkic-speaking Yakut migrated north from the Lake Baikal region under pressure from the Mongol tribes from the 13th to 15th centuries. Siberia remained a sparsely populated area. Historian John F. Richards writes: \"it is doubtful that the total early modern Siberian population exceeded 300,000 persons\".\nEarly Russian exploration.\nThe first mention of Siberia in chronicles is recorded in 1032. The city-state of Novgorod established two trade routes to the Ob River, and laid claim to the lands the Russians called \"Yugra\". The Russians were attracted by its furs in particular. Novgorod launched military campaigns to extract tribute from the local population but often met resistance, such as two campaigns in 1187 and 1193 mentioned in chronicles that were defeated. After Novgorod was annexed by Moscow, the newly emerging centralized Russian state also laid claim to the region, with Ivan III of Russia sending expeditionary forces to Siberia in 1483 and 1499\u20131500. The Russians received tribute, but contact with the tribes ceased after they left.\nThe growing power of the Tsardom of Russia began to undermine the Siberian Khanate in the 16th century. First, groups of traders and Cossacks began to enter the area. The Russian army was directed to establish forts farther and farther east to protect new Russian settlers who migrated from Europe. Towns such as Mangazeya, Tara, Yeniseysk, and Tobolsk developed, the last becoming the \"de facto\" capital of Siberia from 1590. At this time, \"Sibir\" was the name of a fortress at Qashliq, near Tobolsk. Gerardus Mercator, in a map published in 1595, marks \"Sibier\" both as the name of a settlement and of the surrounding territory along a left tributary of the Ob. Other sources contend that the Sibe, an indigenous Tungusic people, offered fierce resistance to Russian expansion beyond the Urals. Some suggest that the term \"Siberia\" is a Russified version of their ethnonym.\nRussian Empire.\nBy the mid-17th century, Russia had established areas of control that extended to the Pacific Ocean. Some 230,000 Russians had settled in Siberia by 1709. Siberia became one of the destinations for sending internal exiles. Exile was the main Russian punitive practice with more than 800,000 people exiled during the 19th century.\nThe first great modern change in Siberia was the Trans-Siberian Railway, constructed during 1891\u20131916. It linked Siberia more closely to the rapidly industrialising Russia of Nicholas II. Around seven million Russians moved to Siberia from Europe between 1801 and 1914. Between 1859 and 1917, more than half a million people migrated to the Russian Far East. Siberia has extensive natural resources: during the 20th century, large-scale exploitation of these took place, and industrial towns cropped up throughout the region.\nAt 7:15\u00a0a.m. on 30 June 1908, the Tunguska event felled millions of trees near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River (Stony Tunguska River) in central Siberia. Most scientists believe this resulted from the air burst of a meteor or comet. Even though no crater has ever been found, the landscape in the (sparsely inhabited) area still bears the scars of this event.\nSoviet Union.\nIn the early decades of the Soviet Union (especially in the 1930s and 1940s), the government used the Gulag state agency to administer a system of penal labour camps, replacing the previous katorga system. According to semi-official Soviet estimates, which did not become public until after the fall of the Soviet government in 1991, from 1929 to 1953 more than 14\u00a0million people passed through these camps and prisons, many of them in Siberia. Another seven to eight million people were internally deported to remote areas of the Soviet Union (including entire nationalities or ethnicities in several cases).\nHalf a million (516,841) prisoners died in camps from 1941 to 1943 during World War II. At other periods, mortality was comparatively lower. The size, scope, and scale of the Gulag slave-labour camps remain subjects of much research and debate. Many Gulag camps operated in extremely remote areas of northeastern Siberia. The best-known clusters included \"Sevvostlag\" (\"the North-East Camps\") along the Kolyma and \"Norillag\" near Norilsk, where 69,000 prisoners lived in 1952. Major industrial cities of northern Siberia, such as Norilsk and Magadan, developed from camps built by prisoners and run by former prisoners.\nRussian Federation.\nAfter the Soviet collapse in 1991, Siberia faced severe economic decline during Russia's transition to a market economy, characterized by hyperinflation, industrial collapse, and resource privatization. While the idea of a Siberian Republic for more regional autonomy was discussed and a Siberian Agreement was formed in the 1990s, the region remained consolidated under Russian federal authority. Economic shifts led to increased resource-based specialization and a decline in the population, particularly in the Russian Arctic, as the previous focus on industrial settlements was largely abandoned. \nOn 2 December 2019, the 'Power of Siberia' gas pipeline started functioning. The project was started in 2014 to supply natural gas from Siberia to China.\nGeography.\nSiberia spans an area of , covering the vast majority of Russia's total territory and almost 9% of Earth's land surface (). It geographically falls in Asia but is culturally and politically considered European, since it is a part of Russia. Major geographical zones include the West Siberian Plain and the Central Siberian Plateau.\nEastern and central Sakha comprises numerous north\u2013south mountain ranges of various ages. These mountains rise to almost , but above a few hundred metres they are almost completely devoid of vegetation. The Verkhoyansk Range was extensively glaciated in the Pleistocene, but the climate was too dry for glaciation to extend to low elevations. At these low elevations are numerous valleys, many of them deep and covered with larch forest, except in the extreme north where the tundra dominates. Soils are mainly turbels (a type of gelisol). The active layer tends to be less than one metre deep, except near rivers.\nThe highest point is the active volcano Klyuchevskaya Sopka, on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Its peak reaches . The Ukok Plateau is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nMountain ranges.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGeomorphological regions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLakes and rivers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGeology.\nThe West Siberian Plain, consisting mostly of Cenozoic alluvial deposits, is somewhat flat. In the mid-Pleistocene, many deposits on this plain resulted from ice dams which produced a large glacial lake. This mid- to late-Pleistocene lake blocked the northward flow of the Ob and Yenisey rivers, resulting in a redirection southwest into the Caspian and Aral seas via the Turgai Valley. The area is very swampy, and soils are mostly peaty histosols and, in the treeless northern part, histels. In the south of the plain, where permafrost is largely absent, rich grasslands that are an extension of the Kazakh Steppe formed the original vegetation, most of which is no longer visible.\nThe Central Siberian Plateau is an ancient craton (sometimes named \"Angaraland\") that formed an independent continent before the Permian. It is exceptionally rich in minerals, containing large deposits of gold, diamonds, and ores of manganese, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, and molybdenum. Much of the area includes the Siberian Traps\u2014a large igneous province. A massive eruptive period approximately coincided with the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event; the volcanic event is one of the largest known volcanic eruptions in Earth's history. Only the extreme northwest was glaciated during the Quaternary but almost all is under exceptionally deep permafrost, and the only tree that can thrive, despite the warm summers, is the deciduous Siberian Larch (\"Larix sibirica\") with its very shallow roots. Outside the extreme northwest, the taiga is dominant, covering a significant fraction of the entirety of Siberia. Soils here are mainly turbels, giving way to spodosols where the active layer becomes thicker and the ice-content lower.\nThe Lena-Tunguska petroleum province includes the Central Siberian platform (some authors refer to it as the \"Eastern Siberian platform\"), bounded on the northeast and east by the late Carboniferous through Jurassic Verkhoyansk fold belt, on the northwest by the Paleozoic Taymr fold belt, and on the southeast, south and southwest by the Middle Silurian to Middle Devonian Baykalian fold belt. A regional geologic reconnaissance study begun in 1932 and followed by surface and subsurface mapping revealed the Markova-Angara Arch (anticline). This led to the discovery of the Markovo Oil Field in 1962 with the Markovo\u20131 well, which produced from the early Cambrian Osa Horizon bar-sandstone at a depth of . The Sredne-Botuobin Gas Field was discovered in 1970, producing from the Osa and the Proterozoic Parfenovo Horizon. The Yaraktin Oil Field was discovered in 1971, producing from the Vendian Yaraktin Horizon at depths of up to , which lies below Permian to lower Jurassic basalt traps.\nClimate.\nThe climate varies dramatically, but it typically has warm but short summers and long, brutally cold winters. On the north coast, north of the Arctic Circle, there is a very short (about one month long) summer.\nAlmost all the population lives in the south, along the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The climate in this southernmost part is humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa/Dfb\" or \"Dwa/Dwb\") with cold winters but fairly warm summers lasting at least four months. The annual average temperature is about . January averages about and July about , while daytime temperatures in summer typically exceed . With a reliable growing season, an abundance of sunshine and fertile chernozem soils, southern Siberia is acceptable for profitable agriculture, as was demonstrated in the early 20th century.\nMost of Siberia lies in a continental subarctic climate (Koppen \"Dfc\", \"Dwc\", or \"Dsc\"), with the annual average temperature about and an average for January of and an average for July of , although this varies considerably, with a July average about in the taiga\u2013tundra ecotone. \"Business Insider\" lists Verkhoyansk and Oymyakon, in the Sakha Republic, as being in competition for the title of the \"Pole of Cold:\" the coldest inhabited point in the Northern Hemisphere. Oymyakon recorded a temperature of on 6 February 1933. Verkhoyansk, further north and further inland, recorded a temperature of for three consecutive nights: 5, 6 and 7 February 1933. Each town also frequently reaches in the summer, giving them, and much of the rest of Russian Siberia, the world's greatest temperature variation between summer's highs and winter's lows, often well over between the seasons.\nSouthwesterly winds bring warm air from Central Asia and the Middle East. The climate in West Siberia (Omsk, or Novosibirsk) is several degrees warmer than in the East (Irkutsk, or Chita). But summer temperatures in other regions can reach . In general, Sakha is the coldest Siberian region, and the basin of the Yana has the lowest temperatures of all, with permafrost reaching . Nevertheless, Imperial Russian plans of settlement never viewed cold as an impediment. In the winter, southern Siberia sits near the center of the semi-permanent Siberian High, so winds are usually light in the winter.\nPrecipitation is generally low, exceeding only in Kamchatka, where moist winds flow from the Sea of Okhotsk onto high mountains\u00a0\u2013 producing the region's only major glaciers, though volcanic eruptions and low summer temperatures allow only limited forests to grow. Precipitation is high in most of Primorye in the extreme south, where monsoonal influences can produce quite heavy summer rainfall.\nGlobal warming.\nAccording to Vasily Kryuchkov, approximately 31,000 square kilometers of the Russian Arctic has been subjected to severe environmental disturbance. Researchers, including Sergei Kirpotin at Tomsk State University and Judith Marquand at Oxford University, warn that Western Siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming. The frozen peat bogs in this region may hold billions of tons of methane gas which may be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. In 2008 a research expedition for the American Geophysical Union detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the atmosphere above the Siberian Arctic, likely the result of methane clathrates being released through holes in a frozen \"lid\" of seabed permafrost around the outfall of the Lena and the area between the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea.\nSince 1988, experimentation at Pleistocene Park has proposed to restore the grasslands of prehistoric times by conducting research on the effects of large herbivores on permafrost, suggesting that animals, rather than climate, maintained the past ecosystem. The nature reserve park also conducts climatic research on the changes expected from the reintroduction of grazing animals or large herbivores, hypothesizing that a transition from tundra to grassland would lead to a net change in energy emission to absorption ratios.\nBorders and administrative division.\nThe term \"Siberia\" has both a long history and wide significance, and association. The understanding and association of \"Siberia\" have gradually changed during the ages. Historically, Siberia was defined as the whole part of Russia and North Kazakhstan to the east of Ural Mountains, including the Russian Far East. According to this definition, Siberia extended eastward from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific coast, and southward from the Arctic Ocean to the border of Central Asia and the national borders of both Mongolia and China.\nSoviet-era sources (\"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" and others) and modern Russian ones usually define Siberia as a region extending eastward from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between Pacific and Arctic drainage basins, and southward from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and the national borders of both Mongolia and China. By this definition, Siberia includes the federal subjects of the Siberian Federal District, and some of the Ural Federal District, as well as Sakha (Yakutia) Republic, which is a part of the Far Eastern Federal District. Geographically, this definition includes subdivisions of several other subjects of Urals and Far Eastern federal districts, but they are not included administratively. This definition excludes Sverdlovsk Oblast and Chelyabinsk Oblast, both of which are included in some wider definitions of Siberia.\nOther sources may use either a somewhat wider definition that states the Pacific coast, not the watershed, is the eastern boundary (thus including the whole Russian Far East), as well as all Northern Kazakhstan is its subregion in the south-west or a somewhat narrower one that limits Siberia to the Siberian Federal District (thus excluding all subjects of other districts). In Russian, 'Siberia' is commonly used as a substitute for the name of the federal district by those who live in the district itself, but less commonly used to denote the federal district by people residing outside of it. Due to the different interpretations of Siberia, starting from Tyumen, to Chita, the territory generally defined as 'Siberia', some people will define themselves as 'Siberian', while others not.\nA number of factors in recent years, including the fomenting of Siberian separatism, have made the definition of the territory of Siberia a potentially controversial subject. In the eastern extent of Siberia there are territories which are not clearly defined as either Siberia or the Far East, making the question of \"what is Siberia?\" one with no clear answer, and what is a \"Siberian\", one of self-identification.\nMajor cities.\nThe most populous city of Siberia, as well as the third most populous city of Russia, is Novosibirsk. Present-day Novosibirsk is an important business, science, manufacturing and cultural center of the Asian part of Russia. Omsk played an important role in the Russian Civil War serving as a provisional Russian capital, as well in the expansion into and governing of Central Asia. In addition to its cultural status, it has become a major oil-refining, education, transport and agriculture hub.\nOther historic cities of Siberia include Tobolsk (the first capital and the only kremlin in Siberia), Tomsk (formerly a wealthy merchant's town) and Irkutsk (former seat of Eastern Siberia's governor general, near lake Baikal). Other major cities include Barnaul, Kemerovo, Krasnoyarsk, Novokuznetsk, Tyumen. Wider definitions of geographic Siberia also include the cities of Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg in the Urals; Khabarovsk and Vladivostok in the Russian Far East; and even Petropavlovsk in Kazakhstan and Harbin in China.\nEconomy.\nNovosibirsk is the most important city for the Siberian economy; with an extra boost since 2000 when it was designated a regional center for the executive bureaucracy (Siberian Federal District). Russia's largest oil refinery is the Omsk Refinery.\nSiberia is extraordinarily rich in minerals, containing ores of almost all economically valuable metals. It has some of the world's largest deposits of nickel, gold, lead, coal, molybdenum, gypsum, diamonds, diopside, silver and zinc, as well as extensive unexploited resources of oil and natural gas. Around 70% of Russia's developed oil fields are in the Khanty-Mansiysk region. Russia contains about 40% of the world's known resources of nickel at the Norilsk deposit in Siberia. Norilsk Nickel is the world's largest nickel and palladium producer. \nSiberian agriculture is severely restricted by the short growing season of most of the region. However, in the southwest where soils consist of fertile black earths and the climate is a little more moderate, there is extensive cropping of wheat, barley, rye and potatoes, along with the grazing of large numbers of sheep and cattle. Elsewhere food production, owing to the poor fertility of the podzolic soils and the extremely short growing seasons, is restricted to the herding of reindeer in the tundra\u2014which has been practiced by natives for over 10,000 years. \nSiberia has the world's largest forests. Timber remains an important source of revenue, even though many forests in the east have been logged much more rapidly than they are able to recover. The Sea of Okhotsk is one of the two or three richest fisheries in the world owing to its cold currents and very large tidal ranges, and thus Siberia produces over 10% of the world's annual fish catch, although fishing has declined somewhat since the collapse of the USSR in 1991. \nReported in 2009, the development of renewable energy in Russia is held back by the lack of a conducive government policy framework, As of 2011[ [update]], Siberia offers special opportunities for off-grid renewable energy developments. Remote parts of Siberia are too costly to connect to central electricity and gas grids and have therefore historically been supplied with costly diesel, sometimes flown in by helicopter. In such cases renewable energy is often cheaper.\nSport.\nRussia's third most popular sport, bandy, is important in Siberia. In the 2015\u201316 Russian Bandy Super League season Yenisey from Krasnoyarsk became champions for the third year in a row by beating Baykal-Energiya from Irkutsk in the final. Two or three more teams (depending on the definition of Siberia) play in the Super League, the 2016\u201317 champions SKA-Neftyanik from Khabarovsk as well as Kuzbass from Kemerovo and Sibselmash from Novosibirsk. In 2007 Kemerovo got Russia's first indoor arena specifically built for bandy. Now Khabarovsk has the world's largest indoor arena specifically built for bandy, Arena Yerofey. It was venue for Division A of the 2018 World Championship. In time for the 2020 World Championship, an indoor arena will be ready for use in Irkutsk. That one will also have a speed skating oval. \nKrasnoyarsk is one of the centres of rugby in Russia, with 2 of the largest clubs in the country, STM Enisei and Krasny Yar, are both based in the city. The Yenisey Krasnoyarsk basketball team has played in the VTB United League since 2011\u201312. The 2019 Winter Universiade was hosted by Krasnoyarsk.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;According to the Russian Census of 2010, the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal Districts, together have a population of about 25.6\u00a0million. Tyumen and Kurgan Oblasts, which are geographically in Siberia but administratively part of the Urals Federal District, together have a population of about 4.3\u00a0million. Thus, the whole region of Siberia (in the broadest usage of the term) is home to approximately 30\u00a0million people. It has a population density of about three people per square kilometre.\nThe largest ethnic group in Siberia is Slavic-origin Russians, including their sub-ethnic group Siberians, and russified Ukrainians. Slavic and other Indo-European ethnicities make up the vast majority (over 85%) of the Siberian population. There are also other groups of indigenous Siberian and non-indigenous ethnic origin. A minority of the current population are descendants of Mongol or Turkic people (mainly Buryats, Yakuts, Tuvans, Altai and Khakas) or northern indigenous people. Slavic-origin Russians outnumber all of the indigenous peoples combined, except in the Republics of Tuva and Sakha.\nAccording to the 2002 census there are 500,000 Tatars in Siberia, but of these, 300,000 are Volga Tatars who also settled in Siberia during periods of colonization and are thus also non-indigenous Siberians, in contrast to the 200,000 Siberian Tatars which are indigenous to Siberia. Of the indigenous Siberians, the Mongol-speaking Buryats, numbering approximately 500,000, are the most numerous group in Siberia, and they are mainly concentrated in their homeland, the Buryat Republic. According to the 2010 census there were 478,085 indigenous Turkic-speaking Yakuts. Other ethnic groups indigenous to Siberia include Kets, Evenks, Chukchis, Koryaks, Yupiks, and Yukaghirs.\nAbout 70% of Siberia's people live in cities, mainly in apartments. Many people also live in rural areas, in simple, spacious, log houses. \nReligion.\nThere are a variety of beliefs throughout Siberia, including Orthodox Christianity, other denominations of Christianity, Tibetan Buddhism and Islam. The Siberian Federal District has an estimated 250,000 Muslims. An estimated 70,000 Jews live in Siberia, some in the Jewish Autonomous Region. The predominant religious group is the Russian Orthodox Church.\nTradition regards Siberia the archetypal home of shamanism, and polytheism is popular. These native sacred practices are considered by the tribes to be very ancient. There are records of Siberian tribal healing practices dating back to the 13th century. The vast territory of Siberia has many different local traditions of gods. These include: Ak Ana, Anapel, Bugady Musun, Kara Khan, Khaltesh-Anki, Kini'je, Ku'urkil, Nga, Nu'tenut, Num-Torum, Pon, Pugu, Todote, Toko'yoto, Tomam, Xaya Iccita and Zonget. Places with sacred areas include Olkhon, an island in Lake Baikal.\nTransport.\nMany cities in northern Siberia, such as Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, cannot be reached by road, as there are virtually none connecting from other major cities in Russia or Asia. Siberia can be reached through the Trans-Siberian Railway, which operates from Moscow in the west to Vladivostok in the east. Cities that are located far from the railway are reached by air or by the separate Baikal\u2013Amur Railway.\nCulture.\nStroganina is a raw fish dish of the indigenous people of northern Arctic Siberia made from raw, thin, long-sliced frozen fish. It is a popular dish with native Siberians. Siberia is known for its pelmeni dumpling, which in the winter are traditionally frozen and stored outdoors. There are various berry, nut and mushroom dishes making use of the riches of abundant nature.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike more common systems for transliterating Arabic, SATTS does not provide the reader with any more phonetic information than standard Arabic orthography does; that is, it provides the bare Arabic alphabetic spelling with no notation of short vowels, doubled consonants, etc. In other words, it is intended as a transliteration tool for Arabic linguists, and is of limited use to those who do not know Arabic.\nSATTS, a legacy of Morse and teleprinter systems (see \"Background,\" below), has historically been employed by military and communications elements of Western countries for handling Arabic text without the need for native fonts or special software. Although its use has decreased in recent years with the demise of Morse code and the obsolescence of the teleprinter, and with the increased availability of native-font software, it is still used for the quick and handy platform-independent recording and transmission of Arabic terms and text.\nFormat.\nSATTS employs all the Latin alphabetic letters except P, plus four punctuation marks, for a total of 29 symbols (all the letters of the Arabic alphabet, plus the glottal-stop symbol hamzah).\nTable of SATTS equivalents.\nIn some words, l\u0101m 'alif was sent as a single character \u2022\u2014\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2014 or LA as a single character. The symbol for the glottal stop hamzah (\u0621) is written following its seat, if it has one. It is omitted when it occurs with an initial 'alif. \nRIEIS \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 MAEDB? \u0645\u0623\u062f\u0628\u0629\nMSWEWL \u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644 BDE \u0628\u062f\u0621\nAHMD \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f ASLAM \u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\nSample text.\nThe chief deficiencies of SATTS are that it does not distinguish between h\u0101' (\u0647) and t\u0101' marb\u016b\u0163ah (\u0629), or between final y\u0101' (\u064a) and 'alif maks\u016brah (\u0649), and it cannot depict an 'alif maddah ( \u0622 ). SATTS also cannot distinguish between a final seated hamza and a final independent hamza, if the word ends in \"AE\", \"IE\", or \"WE\".\nBackground.\nThe Latin alphabetic letter employed for each Arabic letter in the SATTS system is its Morse-code equivalent. For example, Morse code for the Arabic letter \u0163\u0101' (\u0637) is \u2022 \u2022 \u2014 (dit-dit-dah). That same Morse code sequence represents the letter U in the Latin alphabet. Hence the SATTS equivalent for \u0163\u0101' is U.\nIn the Morse-code era, when Arabic language Morse signals were copied down by non-Arab code clerks, the text came out in SATTS. Text in SATTS was also automatically produced when teleprinters reproduced Arabic text, if the technician had failed to replace the printer's Latin-character pallet with an Arabic-character one."}
{"id": "29641", "revid": "19089174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29641", "title": "Sound change", "text": "Process of language change that affects pronunciation or sound system structure\nIn historical linguistics, a sound change is a change in the pronunciation of a language. A sound change can involve the replacement of one speech sound (or, more generally, one phonetic feature value) by a different one (called phonetic change) or a more general change to the speech sounds that exist (\"phonological change\"), such as the merger of two sounds or the creation of a new sound. A sound change can eliminate the affected sound, or a new sound can be added. Sound changes can be environmentally conditioned if the change occurs in only some sound environments, and not others.\nThe term \"sound change\" refers to diachronic changes, which occur in a language's sound system. On the other hand, \"alternation\" refers to changes that happen synchronically (within the language of an individual speaker, depending on the neighbouring sounds) and do not change the language's underlying system (for example, the \"-s\" in the English plural can be pronounced differently depending on the preceding sound, as in \"bet\"[s], \"bed\"[z], which is a form of alternation, rather than sound change). Since \"sound change\" can refer to the historical introduction of an alternation (such as postvocalic /k/ in the Tuscan dialect, which was once [k] as in \"di\" [k]\"arlo\" 'of Carlo' but is now [h] \"di\" [h]\"arlo\" and alternates with [k] in other positions: \"con\" [k]\"arlo\" 'with Carlo'), that label is inherently imprecise and must often be clarified as referring to either phonemic change or restructuring.\nResearch on sound change is usually conducted under the working assumption that it is \"regular\", which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors like the meaning of the words that are affected. Apparent exceptions to regular change can occur because of dialect borrowing, grammatical analogy, or other causes known and unknown, and some changes are described as \"sporadic\" and so they affect only one or a few particular words, without any apparent regularity.\nThe Neogrammarian linguists of the 19th century introduced the term sound law to refer to rules of regular change, perhaps in imitation of the laws of physics, and the term \"law\" is still used in referring to specific sound rules that are named after their authors like Grimm's law, Grassmann's law, Real-world sound laws often admit exceptions, but the expectation of their regularity or absence of exceptions is of great heuristic value by allowing historical linguists to define the notion of \"regular correspondence\" by the comparative method.\nEach sound change is limited in space and time and so it functions in a limited area (within certain dialects) and for a limited period of time. For those and other reasons, the term \"sound law\" has been criticized for implying a universality that is unrealistic for sound change.\nA sound change that affects the phonological system or the number or the distribution of its phonemes is a phonological change.\nPrinciples.\nThe following statements are used as heuristics in formulating sound changes as understood within the Neogrammarian model. However, for modern linguistics, they are not taken as inviolable rules but are seen as guidelines.\nSound change has no memory: Sound change does not discriminate between the sources of a sound. If a previous sound change causes X,Y &gt; Y (features X and Y merge as Y), a new one cannot affect only an original X.\nSound change ignores grammar: A sound change can have only phonological constraints, like X &gt; Z in unstressed syllables. For example, it cannot affect only adjectives. The only exception is that a sound change may recognise word boundaries, even when they are unindicated by prosodic clues. Also, sound changes may be regularized in inflectional paradigms (such as verbal inflection), when it is no longer phonological but morphological in nature.\nSound change is exceptionless: If a sound change can happen at a place, it will affect all sounds that meet the criteria for change. Apparent exceptions are possible because of analogy and other regularization processes, another sound change, or an unrecognized conditioning factor. That is the traditional view expressed by the Neogrammarians. In the past decades, however, this has been challenged by the theory of lexical diffusion, which argues that sound change need not necessarily affect all possible words. However, when a sound change is initiated, it often eventually expands to the whole lexicon. For example, the Spanish fronting of the Vulgar Latin [g] (voiced velar stop) before [i e \u025b] seems to have reached every possible word. By contrast, the voicing of word-initial Latin [k] to [g] occurred in \"colaphus\" &gt; \"golpe\" and \"cattus\" &gt; \"gato\" but not in \"canna\" &gt; \"ca\u00f1a\".\nSound change is inevitable: All languages vary from place to place and time to time, and neither writing nor media prevents that change.\nFormal notation.\nA statement of the form\nis to be read as \"Sound A changes into (or is replaced by, is reflected as, etc.) sound B\". Therefore, A belongs to an older stage of the language in question, and B belongs to a more recent stage. The symbol \"&gt;\" can be reversed, B &lt; A, which also means that the (more recent) B derives from the (older) A\":\nPOc. *t &gt; Rot. f\nmeans that \"Proto-Oceanic (POc.) *t is reflected as in Rotuman (Rot.)\".\nThe two sides of such a statement indicate only the start and the end of the change, but additional intermediate stages may have occurred. The example above is actually a compressed account of a \"sequence\" of changes: * first changed to (like the initial consonant of English \"thin\"), which has since yielded and can be represented more fully:\n t &gt; &gt; f\nUnless a change operates unconditionally (in all environments), the context in which it applies must be specified:\nA &gt; B /X__Y\n= \"A changes to B when it is preceded by X and followed by Y.\"\nFor example:\nIt. b &gt; v /[vowel]__[vowel], which can be simplified to just\nIt. b &gt; v /V__V (in which the V stands for any vowel)\n= \"Intervocalic [b] (inherited from Latin) became [v] in Italian\" (such as in \"caballum, d\u0113bet\" &gt; \"cavallo\" 'horse', \"deve\" 'owe (3rd pers. sing.)'\nHere is a second example:\nPIr. [\u2212cont][\u2212voi] &gt; [+cont] /__[C][+cont]\n= \"A preconsonantal voiceless non-continuant (voiceless stop) changed into corresponding a voiceless continuant (fricative) in Proto-Iranian (PIr.)\" when it was immediately followed by a continuant consonant (a resonant or a fricative): Proto-Indo-Iranian *\"pra\" 'forth' &gt; Avestan \"fra\"; *\"trayas\" \"three\" (masc. nom. pl.)&gt; Av. \"\u03b8ray\u014d\"; *\"\u010datw\u0101ras\" \"four\" (masc. nom. pl.) &gt; Av. \"\u010da\u03b8w\u0101r\u014d\"; *\"p\u015baws\" \"of a cow\" (nom. *\"pa\u015bu\") &gt; Av. \"f\u0161\u0101o\u0161\" (nom. \"pasu\"). The fricativization did not occur before stops and so *\"sapta\" \"seven\" &gt; Av. \"hapta\". (However, in the variety of Iranian that led to Old Persian, fricativization occurred in all clusters: Old Persian \"hafta\" \"seven\".)\nThe symbol \"#\" stands for a word boundary (initial or final) and so the notation \"/__#\" means \"word-finally\", and \"/#__\" means \"word-initially\":\nGk. [stop] &gt; \u2205 /__#\n= \"Word-final stops were deleted in Greek (\"Gk.\")\".\nThat can be simplified to\nGk. P &gt; \u2205 / __#\nin which P stands for any plosive.\nTerms for changes in pronunciation.\nIn historical linguistics, a number of traditional terms designate types of phonetic change, either by nature or result. A number of such types are often (or usually) sporadic, that is, more or less accidents that happen to a specific form. Others affect a whole phonological system. Sound changes that affect a whole phonological system are also classified according to how they affect the overall shape of the system; see \"phonological change\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for his chronicle of sacred history, as well as his biography of Saint Martin of Tours.\nLife.\nAlmost all that we know of Severus' life comes from a few allusions in his own writings, some passages in the letters of his friend Paulinus, bishop of Nola, and a short biography by the historian Gennadius of Massilia.\nBorn of noble parents in Aquitaine, Severus enjoyed excellent educational advantages. He was imbued with the culture of his time and of his country, a centre of Latin letters and learning. He studied jurisprudence in Burdigala (Modern Bordeaux) and was renowned as an eloquent lawyer; his knowledge of Roman law is reflected in parts of his writings. He married the daughter of a wealthy consular family, who died young, leaving him no children.\nAt this time Severus came under the powerful influence of Saint Martin, bishop of Tours, by whom he was led to devote his wealth to the Christian poor, and his own powers to a life of good works and the contemplative vision of God. This choice incurred his father's displeasure, but he was encouraged in his determination by his mother-in-law. To use the words of his friend Paulinus, he broke with his father, followed Christ, and set the teachings of the \"fishermen\" far above all his \"Tullian learning.\" His ordination as a priest is vouched for by Gennadius, but no details of his priestly activity have reached us. He is said to have been led away in his old age by Pelagianism, but to have repented and inflicted long-enduring penance on himself. His time was passed chiefly in the neighbourhood of Toulouse, and such literary efforts as he indulged in were made in the interests of Christianity.\nIn many respects no two men could be more unlike than Severus, the scholar and orator, well versed in the ways of the world, and Martin, the rough Pannonian bishop, champion of the monastic life, seer and worker of miracles. Yet the spirit of the rugged saint subdued that of the polished scholar, and the works of Severus are important because they reflect the ideas, influence and aspirations of Martin, the foremost ecclesiastic of Gaul.\nWorks.\n\"Chronicle\".\nThe chief work of Severus is the \"Chronicle\" (\"Chronica\", \"Chronicorum Libri duo\" or \"Historia sacra\", c. 403), a summary of sacred history from the beginning of the world to his own times, with the omission of the events recorded in the Gospels and the Acts, \"lest the form of his brief work should detract from the honour due to those events\". It is a source of primary importance for the history of Priscillianism and contains considerable information respecting the Arian controversy. The book was a textbook, and was used as such in the schools of Europe for about a century and a half after the \"editio princeps\" was published by Flacius Illyricus in 1556.\nSeverus nowhere clearly points to the class of readers for whom his book is designed. He disclaims the intention of making his work a substitute for the actual narrative contained in the Bible. \"Worldly historians\" had been used by him, he says, to make clear the dates and the connexion of events and for supplementing the sacred sources, and with the intent at once to instruct the unlearned and to \"convince\" the learned. Probably the \"unlearned\" are the mass of Christians and the learned are the cultivated Christians and pagans alike, to whom the rude language of the sacred texts, whether in Greek or Latin, would be distasteful. The literary structure of the narrative shows that Severus had in his mind principally readers on the same level of culture with himself. He was anxious to show that sacred history might be presented in a form which lovers of Sallust and Tacitus could appreciate and enjoy. The style is lucid, almost classical. In order that his work might fairly stand beside that of the old Latin writers, Severus ignored the allegorical approach to interpreting sacred history that had been favoured by both heretics and the orthodox of his age.\nAs an authority on the period prior to his own, Severus offers few guarantees and rarely corrects or supplements the historical record transmitted thanks to other sources. Jakob Bernays suggested that he based his narrative of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus on the account given by Tacitus in his \"Histories\", a portion of which has been lost. In his allusions to the Gentile rulers with whom the Jews came into contact from the time of the Maccabees onwards, Severus discloses some points which are not without importance.\nThe real interest of Severus' work lies, first, in the incidental glimpses it affords all through of the history of his own time; next and more particularly, in the information he has preserved concerning the struggle over the Priscillianist heresy, which disorganised and degraded the churches of Spain and Gaul, and particularly affected Aquitaine. The sympathies here betrayed by Severus are wholly those of St. Martin. The bishop had withstood Maximus, who ruled for some years a large part of the western portion of the empire, though he never conquered Italy. He had reproached him with attacking and overthrowing his predecessors on the throne, and for his dealings with the church. Severus loses no opportunity for laying stress on the crimes and follies of rulers, and on their cruelty, though he once declares that, cruel as rulers could be, priests could be crueller still. This last statement has reference to the bishops who had left Maximus no peace till he had stained his hands with the blood of Priscillian and his followers. Martin, too, had denounced the worldliness and greed of the Gaulish bishops and clergy. Accordingly, we find that Severus, in narrating the division of Canaan among the tribes, calls the special attention of ecclesiastics to the fact that no portion of the land was assigned to the tribe of Levi, lest they should be hindered in their service of God. \"Our clergy seem\", he says, \"not merely forgetful of the lesson, but ignorant of it, such a passion for possessions has in our days fastened like a pestilence on their souls.\" We here catch a glimpse of the circumstances which were winning over good men to monasticism in the West, though the evidence of an enthusiastic votary of the solitary life, such as Severus was, is probably not free from exaggeration. Severus also fully sympathised with the action of St. Martin touching Priscillianism. This mysterious Western offshoot of Gnosticism had no single feature about it which could soften the hostility of a character such as Martin's, but he resisted the introduction of secular punishment for evil doctrine, and withdrew from communion with those bishops in Gaul, a large majority, who invoked the aid of Maximus against their erring brethren. In this connection, the account given by Severus of the Council of Rimini in 359, where the question arose whether the bishops attending the assembly might lawfully receive money from the imperial treasury to recoup their travelling and other expenses, is notable. Severus evidently approved the action of the British and Gaulish bishops, who deemed it unbecoming that they should lie under pecuniary obligation to the emperor. His ideal of the church required that it should stand clear and above the state.\n\"Life of St. Martin\", dialogues, and letters.\nMore popular during the Middle Ages was Severus' \"Life of St. Martin\", as were also the dialogues and letters which relate to the same subject. These works did much to establish the great reputation which that wonder-working saint maintained throughout the Middle Ages. The book is not properly a biography, but a catalogue of miracles, told in all the simplicity of absolute belief. The power to work miraculous signs is assumed to be in direct proportion to holiness, and is by Severus valued merely as an evidence of holiness, which he is persuaded can only be attained through a life of isolation from the world. In the first of his Dialogues (fair models of Cicero), Severus puts into the mouth of an interlocutor (Posthumianus) a pleasing description of the life of coenobites and solitaries in the deserts bordering on Egypt. The main evidence of the virtue attained by them lies in the voluntary subjection to them of the savage beasts among which they lived. But Severus was no indiscriminating adherent of monasticism. The same dialogue shows him to be alive to its dangers and defects. The second dialogue is a large appendix to the Life of Martin, and really supplies more information of his life as bishop and of his views than the work which bears the title \"Vita S. Martini\". The two dialogues occasionally make interesting references to personages of the epoch. In Dial. 1, cc. 6, 7, we have a vivid picture of the controversies which raged at Alexandria over the works of Origen. The judgement of Severus himself is no doubt that which he puts in the mouth of his interlocutor Posthumianus: \"I am astonished that one and the same man could have so far differed from himself that in the approved portion of his works he has no equal since the apostles, while in that portion for which he is justly blamed it is proved that no man has committed more unseemly errors.\" Three Epistles on the death of Martin (ad Eusebium, ad Aurelium diaconum, ad Bassulam) complete the list of Severus' genuine works. Other letters (to his sister), on the love of God and the renunciation of the world, have not survived.\nSpurious attributions.\nBeside the above-mentioned three letters, seven others have been attributed to Severus. These are rejected as spurious by some critics, whilst the genuineness of the first two is admitted, rightly it would seem, by others. The \"World Chronicle\" of the so-called Sulpicius Severus has nothing to do with the subject of this biography; it was written in Spain in the sixth century.\nSources.\nThe text of the \"Chronicle\" rests on a single 11th century manuscript, one of the Palatine collection now in the Vatican; of the other works manuscripts are abundant, the best being one of the 6th century at Verona. Some spurious letters bear the name of Severus; also in a manuscript at Madrid is a work falsely professing to be an epitome of the \"Chronicle\" of Severus, and going down to 511. The chief editions of the complete works of Severus are those by De Prato (Verona, 1741) and by Halm (forming volume i. of the \"Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum Latinorum\", Vienna, 1866). There is a most admirable monograph on the \"Chronicle\" by J. Bernays (Berlin, 1861). See also Goelzer, Grammaticae in Sulp. Severum observationes (1884) (thesis).\nBibliography.\nSeverus' works are to be found in P.L. 20, 95-248; later edition by Karl Halm, \"Opera\", CSEL 1 (Vienna, 1866) (on Google Books)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The picture was filmed in Cinecolor. The film is historically important as the only color film in which Bela Lugosi has a starring role. Lionel Atwill was originally intended to appear in the film but he was too ill to work, so George Zucco replaced him in the cast. Christy Cabanne completed the film in early 1946, but it was not screened until 1947.\nPlot.\nThe film opens with the disclosure by morgue examiners that a beautiful woman has literally died of fright. The plot reveals how she reached the fatal stage of terror.\nThe woman is married to the son of a doctor, the proprietor of a private sanatorium, where she is under unwilling treatment. Both the son and the doctor indicate they want the marriage dissolved, but the woman refuses. Arriving at the scene is a mysterious personage, Prof. Leonide, identified as the doctor's cousin who had been a stage magician in Europe. He is accompanied by a threatening dwarf, Indigo.\nAfter it is apparent that the wife is terrified of the foreigners, it is disclosed that she is the former wife and stage partner of a Paris magician known as Ren\u00e9, who was believed to have been shot by the Nazis. Attempts to draw a confession that she had betrayed her magician husband and had collaborated with the Nazis led to the use of a device employing a death mask of the supposedly dead patriot, which literally frightens her to death.\nAlthough the young newspaperman hero and his sweetheart guess the answer to the story, they allow the diagnosis \"scared to death\" to stand.\nProduction.\nThe film was based on a one-act play which in turn was based on a 1933 murder case involving Dr. Alice Wynekoop.\nThe film was announced in March 1946 as \"Accent on Horror\". \"The Autopsy\" was another title that was considered.\nReviews.\nHistorian Gary Don Rhodes commented that although the film was in color, \"nothing manages to stave off the inevitable boredom.

He was the founder of modern functional analysis, and an original member of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics. His major work was the 1932 book, \"Th\u00e9orie des op\u00e9rations lin\u00e9aires\" (Theory of Linear Operations), the first monograph on the general theory of functional analysis.\nBorn in Krak\u00f3w to a family of Goral descent, Banach showed a keen interest in mathematics and engaged in solving mathematical problems during school recess. After completing his secondary education, he befriended Hugo Steinhaus, with whom he established the Polish Mathematical Society in 1919 and later published the scientific journal \"Studia Mathematica\". In 1920, he received an assistantship at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic, subsequently becoming a professor in 1922 and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning in 1924. Banach was also a co-founder of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics, a school of thought comprising some of the most renowned Polish mathematicians of the interwar period (1918\u20131939).\nSome of the notable mathematical concepts that bear Banach's name include Banach spaces, Banach algebras, Banach measures, the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox, the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, the Banach\u2013Steinhaus theorem, the Banach\u2013Mazur game, the Banach\u2013Alaoglu theorem, Banach-Saks property, and the Banach fixed-point theorem.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nStefan Banach was born on 30 March 1892 at St. Lazarus General Hospital in Krak\u00f3w, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, into a G\u00f3ral Roman Catholic family, and was subsequently baptised by his father. Banach's parents were Stefan Greczek and Katarzyna Banach, both natives of the Podhale region. Greczek was a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army stationed in Krak\u00f3w. Little is known about Banach's mother. According to his baptismal certificate, she was born in Bor\u00f3wna and worked as a domestic helper.\nUnusually, Stefan's surname was his mother's instead of his father's, though he received his father's given name, Stefan. Military regulations did not permit soldiers of Stefan Greczek's rank to marry; he was a private and as the mother was too poor to support the child, the couple decided that he should be reared by family and friends. Stefan spent the first few years of his life with his grandmother, but when she was taken ill, Greczek arranged for his son to be raised by Franciszka P\u0142owa and her niece Maria Puchalska in Krak\u00f3w. Young Stefan came to regard Franciszka as his foster mother and Maria as his older sister. In his early years Banach was tutored by Juliusz Mien, a French intellectual and friend of the P\u0142owa family, who had emigrated to Poland and supported himself with photography and translations of Polish literature into French. Mien taught Banach French and most likely encouraged him in his early mathematical pursuits.\nIn 1902, Banach, aged 10, enrolled in Krak\u00f3w's \"IV Gymnasium\" (also known as the \"Goetz Gymnasium\"). While the school specialized in the humanities, Banach and his best friend Witold Wi\u0142kosz (also a future mathematician) spent most of their time working on mathematics problems during breaks and after school. Later in life Banach credited Dr. Kamil Kraft, the mathematics and physics teacher at the school, with kindling his interests in mathematics. While Banach was a diligent student he did, on occasion, receive low grades (he failed Greek during his first semester at the school) and later spoke critically of the school's math teachers.\nAfter obtaining his \"matura\" (high school degree) at age 18 in 1910, Banach moved to Lw\u00f3w (today called Lviv) with the intention of studying at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic. He initially chose engineering as his field of study since at the time he was convinced that there was nothing new to discover in mathematics. At some point he also attended Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w on a part-time basis. As Banach had to earn money to support his studies it was not until 1914 that he finally, at age 22, passed his high school graduation exams.\nWhen World War I broke out, Banach was excused from military service due to his left-handedness and poor vision. When the Russian Army opened its offensive toward Lw\u00f3w, Banach left for Krak\u00f3w, where he spent the rest of the war. He made his living as a tutor at the local schools, worked in a bookstore and as a foreman of a road building crew. He attended some lectures at the Jagiellonian University at that time, including those of the famous Polish mathematicians Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba and Kazimierz \u017borawski, but little is known of that period of his life.\nDiscovery by Steinhaus.\nIn 1916, in Krak\u00f3w's \"Planty\" park, Banach encountered Professor Hugo Steinhaus, one of the renowned mathematicians of the time. According to Steinhaus, while he was strolling through the gardens he was surprised to overhear the term \"Lebesgue integral\" (Lebesgue integration was at the time still a fairly new idea in mathematics) and walked over to investigate. As a result, he met Banach, as well as Otto Nikodym. Steinhaus became fascinated with the self-taught young mathematician. The encounter resulted in a long-lasting collaboration and friendship. In fact, soon after the encounter Steinhaus invited Banach to solve some problems he had been working on but which had proven difficult. Banach solved them within a week and the two soon published their first joint work (\"On the Mean Convergence of Fourier Series\"). Steinhaus, Banach and Nikodym, along with several other Krak\u00f3w mathematicians (W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u015alebodzi\u0144ski, Leon Chwistek, Alfred Rosenblatt and W\u0142odzimierz Sto\u017cek) also established a mathematical society, which eventually became the Polish Mathematical Society. The society was officially founded on 2 April 1919. It was also through Steinhaus that Banach met his future wife, \u0141ucja Braus.\nInterbellum.\nSteinhaus introduced Banach to academic circles and substantially accelerated his career. After Poland regained independence in 1918, Banach was given an assistantship at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic. Steinhaus' backing also allowed him to receive a doctorate without actually graduating from a university. The doctoral thesis, accepted by King John II Casimir University of Lw\u00f3w in 1920 and published in 1922, included the basic ideas of functional analysis, which was soon to become an entirely new branch of mathematics. In his dissertation, written in 1920, he axiomatically defined what is today called a Banach space. The thesis was widely discussed in academic circles and allowed him in 1922 to become a professor at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic. Initially an assistant to Professor Antoni \u0141omnicki, in 1927, Banach received his own chair. In 1924 he was accepted as a member of the Polish Academy of Learning. At the same time, from 1922, Banach also headed the second Chair of Mathematics at University of Lw\u00f3w.\nYoung and talented, Banach gathered around him a large group of mathematicians. The group, meeting in the Scottish Caf\u00e9, soon gave birth to the \"Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics\". In 1929 the group began publishing its own journal, \"Studia Mathematica\", devoted primarily to Banach's field of study\u2014functional analysis. Around that time, Banach also began working on his best-known work, the first monograph on the general theory of linear-metric space. First published in Polish in 1931, the next year it was also translated into French and gained wider recognition in European academic circles. The book was also the first in a long series of mathematics monographs edited by Banach and his circle. On 17 June 1924, Banach became a correspondence member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts in Krak\u00f3w.\nWorld War II.\nAfter the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Lw\u00f3w came under the control of the Soviet Union for almost two years. Banach, from 1939 a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and on good terms with Soviet mathematicians, had to promise to learn Ukrainian to be allowed to keep his chair and continue his academic activities. In 1940 he was appointed by the Soviets as a member of the Lviv City Council. After the German takeover of Lw\u00f3w in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, all universities were closed and Banach, along with many colleagues and his son, was employed as a lice feeder at Professor Rudolf Weigl's Typhus Research Institute. Employment in Weigl's Institute provided many unemployed university professors and their associates protection from random arrest and deportation to Nazi concentration camps.\nAfter the Soviet Red Army recaptured Lviv in the Lvov\u2013Sandomierz Offensive of 1944, Banach returned to the university and helped re-establish it after the war years. However, because the Soviets were deporting Poles from annexed formerly Polish eastern territories, Banach began preparing to leave the city and settle in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, where he had been promised a chair at the Jagiellonian University. He was also considered a candidate for Minister of Education of Poland. In January 1945, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was permitted to stay in Lw\u00f3w. He died on 31 August 1945, aged 53. His funeral at the Lychakiv Cemetery (\"Cmentarz \u0141yczakowski\") was attended by hundreds of people. His chair at Lwow was subsequently taken up by Wladimir Lewicki.\nContributions.\nBanach's dissertation, completed in 1920 and published in 1922, formally axiomatized the concept of a complete normed vector space and laid the foundations for the area of functional analysis. In this work Banach called such spaces \"class E-spaces\", but in his 1932 book, \"Th\u00e9orie des op\u00e9rations lin\u00e9aires\", he changed terminology and referred to them as \"spaces of type B\", which most likely contributed to the subsequent eponymous naming of these spaces after him. The theory of what came to be known as Banach spaces had antecedents in the work of the Hungarian mathematician Frigyes Riesz (published in 1916) and contemporaneous contributions from Hans Hahn and Norbert Wiener. For a brief period in fact, complete normed linear spaces were referred to as \"Banach\u2013Wiener\" spaces in mathematical literature, based on terminology introduced by Wiener himself. However, because Wiener's work on the topic was limited, the established name became just \"Banach spaces\".\nLikewise, Banach's fixed point theorem, based on earlier methods developed by Charles \u00c9mile Picard, was included in his dissertation, and was later extended by his students (for example in the Banach\u2013Schauder theorem) and other mathematicians (in particular Brouwer and Poincar\u00e9 and Birkhoff). The theorem did not require linearity of the space, and applied to any complete Cauchy space (in particular to any complete metric space).\nThe Hahn\u2013Banach theorem is one of the fundamental theorems of functional analysis. Further theorems related to Banach are:\nRecognition.\nIn 1946, the Stefan Banach Prize (Polish: \"Nagroda im. Stefana Banacha\") was established by the Polish Mathematical Society. In 1992, the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences established a special Stefan Banach Medal for outstanding achievements in mathematical sciences. Since 2009, the International Stefan Banach Prize has been conferred by the Polish Mathematical Society to mathematicians for best doctoral dissertations in the mathematical sciences with the objective to \"promote and financially support the most promising young researchers\".\nStefan Banach is the patron of a number of schools and streets including in Warsaw, Lviv, \u015awidnica, Toru\u0144 and Jaros\u0142aw.\nIn 2001, a minor planet 16856 Banach, discovered by Paul Comba in 1997, was named after him.\nIn 2012, the National Bank of Poland celebrated the mathematician's achievements by issuing a series of commemorative coins designed by Robert Kotowicz (golden 200-zloty coin, silver 10-zloty coin and Nordic Gold 2-zloty coin).\nIn 2016, a commemorative bench featuring Banach and Otto Nikodym was unveiled in Krak\u00f3w's Planty Park on the 100th anniversary of the conversation the two mathematicians held when they first met Hugo Steinhaus, which proved instrumental in the development of his scientific career.\nIn 2019, Polish entomologist Marcin Kami\u0144ski named a newly discovered species of South African darkling beetle, \"Machleida banachi\", in honor of the mathematician Stefan Banach and his contributions to science.\nIn 2021, one of the episodes of Polish documentary TV series \"Geniusze i marzyciele\" (Geniuses and Dreamers) aired on TVP1 and TVP Dokument channels was devoted to Stefan Banach.\nIn 2022, Google Doodle commemorated the 100th anniversary of Banach receiving his title of professor.\nQuotes.\nStanislaw Ulam, another mathematician of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics, in his autobiography, quotes Banach as saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Good mathematicians see analogies between theorems or theories, the very best ones see analogies between analogies.\"\nHugo Steinhaus said of Banach:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Banach was my greatest scientific discovery.\"\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

SLRs became the dominant design for professional and consumer-level cameras throughout the late 20th century, offering interchangeable lenses, through-the-lens (TTL) metering, and precise framing. Originating in the 1930s and popularized in the 1960s and 70s, SLR technology played a crucial role in the evolution of modern photography. Although digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras succeeded film-based models, the rise of mirrorless cameras in the 2010s has led to a decline in SLR use and production. With twin lens reflex and rangefinder cameras, the viewed image could be significantly different from the final image. When the shutter button is pressed on most SLRs, the mirror flips out of the light path and allows light to pass through to the light receptor and the image to be captured.\nHistory.\nUntil the development of SLR, all cameras with viewfinders had two optical light paths: one through the lens to the film and another positioned above (TLR or \"twin-lens reflex\") or to the side (rangefinder). Because the viewfinder and the film lens cannot share the same optical path, the viewing lens is aimed to intersect with the film lens at a fixed point somewhere in front of the camera. This is not problematic for pictures taken at a middle or longer distance, but parallax causes framing errors in close-up shots. Moreover, it is not easy to focus the lens of a fast reflex camera when it is opened to wider apertures (such as in low light or while using low-speed film).\nMost SLR cameras permit upright and laterally correct viewing through use of a roof pentaprism situated in the optical path between the reflex mirror and viewfinder. Light, which comes both horizontally and vertically inverted after passing through the lens, is reflected upwards by the reflex mirror, into the pentaprism where it is reflected twice to correct the inversions caused by the lens, and align the image with the viewfinder. When the shutter is released, the mirror moves out of the light path, and the light shines directly onto the film (or in the case of a DSLR, the CCD or CMOS imaging sensor). Exceptions to the moving mirror system include the Canon Pellix and Sony SLT cameras, along with several special-purpose high-speed cameras (such as the Canon EOS-1N RS), whose mirror was a fixed beamsplitting pellicle.\nFocus can be adjusted manually by the photographer or automatically by an autofocus system. The viewfinder can include a matte focusing screen located just above the mirror system to diffuse the light. This permits accurate viewing, composing and focusing, especially useful with interchangeable lenses.\nUp until the 1990s, SLR was the most advanced photographic preview system available, but the recent development and refinement of digital imaging technology with an on-camera live LCD preview screen has overshadowed SLR's popularity. Nearly all inexpensive compact digital cameras now include an LCD preview screen allowing the photographer to see what the CCD is capturing. However, SLR is still popular in high-end and professional cameras because they are system cameras with interchangeable parts, allowing customization. They also have far less shutter lag, allowing photographs to be timed more precisely. Also the pixel resolution, contrast ratio, refresh rate, and color gamut of an LCD preview screen cannot compete with the clarity and shadow detail of a direct-viewed optical SLR viewfinder.\nLarge format SLR cameras were probably first marketed with the introduction of C.R. Smith's \"Monocular Duplex\" (U.S., 1884). SLRs for smaller exposure formats were launched in the 1920s by several camera makers. The first 35\u00a0mm SLR available to the mass market, Leica's PLOOT reflex housing along with a 200\u00a0mm f4.5 lens paired to a 35\u00a0mm rangefinder camera body, debuted in 1935. The Soviet \"\u0421\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\" (\u201cSport\u201d), also a 24\u00a0mm by 36\u00a0mm image size, was prototyped in 1934 and went to market in 1937. K. N\u00fcchterlein's Kine Exakta (Germany, 1936) was the first integrated 35\u00a0mm SLR to enter the market. Additional Exakta models, all with waist-level finders, were produced up to and during World War II. Another ancestor of the modern SLR camera was the Swiss-made Alpa, which was innovative, and influenced the later Japanese cameras. The first eye-level SLR viewfinder was patented in Hungary on August 23, 1943, by Jen\u0151 Dulovits, who then designed the first 35\u00a0mm camera with one, the Duflex, which used a system of mirrors to provide a laterally correct, upright image in the eye-level viewfinder. The Duflex, which went into serial production in 1948, was also the world's first SLR with an instant-return (a.k.a. autoreturn) mirror.\nThe first commercially-produced SLR that employed a roof pentaprism was the Italian Rectaflex A.1000, shown in full working condition at a Milan fair in April 1948 and produced from September the same year. It was thus on the market one year before the East German Zeiss Ikon VEB Contax S, announced on May 20, 1949, produced from September.\nThe Japanese adopted and further developed the SLR. In 1952, Asahi developed the Asahiflex and in 1954, the Asahiflex IIB. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax combined the fixed pentaprism and the right-hand thumb wind lever. Nikon, Canon and Yashica introduced their first SLRs in 1959 (the F, Canonflex, and Pentamatic, respectively).\nDigital SLRs.\nCanon, Nikon and Pentax have all developed digital SLR cameras (DSLRs) using the same lens mounts as on their respective film SLR cameras. Konica Minolta did the same, and after having bought Konica Minolta's camera division in 2006 Sony continued using the Minolta AF lens mount in their DSLRs, including cameras built around a semi-transparent fixed mirror. Samsung built DSLRs based on the Pentax lens mount. Olympus, on the other hand, chose to create a new digital-only Four Thirds System SLR standard, adopted later by Panasonic and Leica.\nContax released a DSLR model, the Contax N-Digital. This model was too late and too expensive to be competitive with other camera manufacturers. The Contax N-digital was the last Contax to use that maker's lens system, and the camera, while having impressive features such as a full-frame sensor, was expensive and lacked sufficient write-speed to the memory card for it to be seriously considered by some professional photographers.\nThe digital single-lens reflex camera largely replaced the film SLR design in convenience, sales and popularity at the start of the 21st century, before the single-lens reflex design in general was supplanted by the mirrorless camera.\nOptical components.\nA cross-section (\"or\" 'side-view') of the optical components of a typical SLR camera shows how the light passes through the lens assembly, is reflected by the mirror placed at a 45-degree angle, and is projected on the matte focusing screen. Via a condensing lens and internal reflections in the roof pentaprism the image appears in the eyepiece. When an image is taken, the mirror moves upwards from its resting position in the direction of the arrow, the focal plane shutter opens, and the image is projected onto the film or sensor in exactly the same manner as on the focusing screen.\nThis feature distinguishes SLRs from other cameras as the photographer sees the image composed exactly as it will be captured on the film or sensor.\nMost 35\u00a0mm SLRs use a roof pentaprism or penta-mirror to direct the light to the eyepiece, first used on the 1948 Duflex constructed by Jen\u0151 Dulovits and patented August 1943 (Hungary). With this camera also appeared the first instant-return mirror.\nThe first Japanese pentaprism SLR was the 1955 Miranda T, followed by the Asahi Pentax, Minolta SR-2, Zunow, Nikon F and the Yashica Pentamatic. Some SLRs offered removable pentaprisms with optional viewfinder capabilities, such as the waist-level finder, the interchangeable sports finders used on the Canon F1 and F1n; the Nikon F, F2, F3, F4 and F5; and the Pentax LX.\nAnother prism design was the porro prism system used in the Olympus Pen F, the Pen FT, the Pen FV half-frame 35\u00a0mm SLR cameras. This was later used on the Olympus EVOLT E-3x0 series, the Leica Digilux 3 and the Panasonic DMC-L1.\nA right-angle finder is available that slips onto the eyepiece of most SLRs and D-SLRs and allows viewing through a waist-level viewfinder. There is also a finder that provides EVF remote capability.\nShutter mechanisms.\nAlmost all contemporary SLRs use a focal-plane shutter located in front of the film plane, which prevents the light from reaching the film even if the lens is removed, except when the shutter is actually released during the exposure. There are various designs for focal plane shutters. Early focal-plane shutters designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening shutter curtain followed by a closing shutter curtain. During fast shutter speeds, the focal-plane shutter would form a 'slit' whereby the second shutter curtain was closely following the first opening shutter curtain to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the shutter slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as shutter speeds were increased. Initially these shutters were made from a cloth material (which was in later years often rubberised), but some manufacturers used other materials instead. Nippon K\u014dgaku (now Nikon Corporation), for example, used titanium foil shutters for several of their flagship SLR cameras, including the Nikon F, F2, and F3.\nOther focal-plane shutter designs, such as the Copal Square, travelled vertically\u00a0\u2014 the shorter travelling distance of 24 millimetres (as opposed to 36\u00a0mm horizontally) meant that minimum exposure and flash synchronisation times could be reduced. These shutters are usually manufactured from metal, and use the same moving-slit principle as horizontally travelling shutters. They differ, though, in usually being formed of several slats or blades, rather than single curtains as with horizontal designs, as there is rarely enough room above and below the frame for a one-piece shutter. Vertical shutters became very common in the 1980s (though Konica, Mamiya, and Copal first pioneered their use in the 1950s and 1960s, and are almost exclusively used for new cameras. Nikon used Copal-made vertical plane shutters in their Nikomat/Nikkormat -range, enabling x-sync speeds from &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204430 to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044125 while the only choice for focal plane shutters at that time was &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204460. Later, Nikon again pioneered the use of titanium for vertical shutters, using a special honeycomb pattern on the blades to reduce their weight and achieve world-record speeds in 1982 of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444000 second for non-sync shooting, and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044250 with x-sync. Nowadays most such shutters are manufactured from cheaper aluminium (though some high-end cameras use materials such as carbon-fibre and Kevlar).\nAnother shutter system is the leaf shutter, whereby the shutter is constructed of diaphragm-like blades and can be situated either between the lens or behind the lens. If the shutter is part of a lens assembly some other mechanism is required to ensure that no light reaches the film between exposures. An example of a behind-the-lens leaf shutter is found in the 35\u00a0mm SLRs produced by Kodak, with their Retina Reflex camera line; Topcon, with their Auto 100; and Kowa with their SE-R and SET-R reflexes. A primary example of a medium-format SLR with a between-the-lens leaf shutter system would be Hasselblad, with their 500C, 500\u00a0cm, 500 EL-M (a motorized Hasselblad) and other models (producing a 6\u00a0cm square negative). Hasselblads use an auxiliary shutter blind situated behind the lens mount and the mirror system to prevent the fogging of film. Other medium-format SLRs also using leaf shutters include the now discontinued Zenza-Bronica camera system lines such as the Bronica ETRs, the ETRs'i (both producing a 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.5\u00a0cm. image), the SQ and the SQ-AI (producing a 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06\u00a0cm image like the Hasselblad), and the Zenza-Bronica G system (6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0cm). Certain Mamiya medium-format SLRs, discontinued camera systems such as the Kowa 6 and a few other camera models also used between-the-lens leaf shutters in their lens systems. Thus, any time a photographer purchased one of these lenses, that lens included a leaf shutter in its lens mount. Because leaf shutters synchronized electronic flash at all shutter speeds especially at fast shutter speeds of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044500 of a second or faster, cameras using leaf shutters were more desirable to studio photographers who used sophisticated studio electronic flash systems. Some manufacturers of medium-format 120 film SLR cameras also made leaf-shutter lenses for their focal-plane-shutter models. Rollei made at least two such lenses for their Rolleiflex SL-66 medium format which was a focal-plane shutter SLR. Rollei later switched to a camera system of leaf-shutter design (e.g., the 6006 and 6008 reflexes) and their current medium-format SLRs are now all of the between-the-lens shutter design.\nFurther developments.\nSince the technology became widespread in the 1970s, SLRs have become the main photographic instrument used by dedicated amateur photographers and professionals. Some photographers of static subjects (such as architecture, landscape, and some commercial subjects), however, prefer view cameras because of the capability to control perspective. With a triple-extension bellows 4\" \u00d7 5\" camera such as the Linhof SuperTechnika V, the photographer can correct certain distortions such as \"keystoning\", where the image 'lines' converge (i.e., photographing a building by pointing a typical camera upward to include the top of the building). Perspective correction lenses are available in the 35\u00a0mm and medium formats to correct this distortion with film cameras, and it can also be corrected after the fact with photo software when using digital cameras. The photographer can also extend the bellows to its full length, tilt the front standard and perform photomacrography (commonly known as 'macro photography'), producing a sharp image with depth-of-field without stopping down the lens diaphragm.\nFilm formats.\nEarly SLRs were built for large format photography, but this film format has largely lost favor among professional photographers. SLR film-based cameras have been produced for most film formats as well as for digital formats. These film-based SLRs use the 35\u00a0mm format as, this film format offers a variety of emulsions and film sensitivity speeds, usable image quality and a good market cost. 35\u00a0mm film comes in a variety of exposure lengths: 20 exposure, 24 exposure and 36 exposure rolls. Medium format SLRs provide a higher-quality image with a negative that can be more easily retouched than the smaller 35\u00a0mm negative, when this capability is required.\nA small number of SLRs were built for APS such as the Canon IX series and the Nikon Pronea cameras. SLRs were also introduced for film formats as small as Kodak's 110, such as the Pentax Auto 110, which had interchangeable lenses.\nThe Narciss camera is an all-metal 16\u00a0mm subminiature single lens reflex camera made by Russian optic firm Krasnogorsky Mekhanichesky Zavod (KMZ) Narciss (Soviet Union; \u041d\u0430\u0440\u0446\u0438\u0441\u0441) between 1961 and 1965.\nCommon features.\nOther features found on many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (TTL) metering and sophisticated flash control referred to as \"dedicated electronic flash\". In a dedicated system, once the dedicated electronic flash is inserted into the camera's hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between camera and flash. The camera's synchronization speed is set, along with the aperture. Many camera models measure the light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the flash duration of the electronic flash. This is denoted TTL flash metering.\nSome electronic flash units can send out several short bursts of light to aid the autofocus system or for wireless communication with off-camera flash units. A pre-flash is often used to determine the amount of light that is reflected from the subject, which sets the duration of the main flash at time of exposure. Some cameras also employ automatic fill-flash, where the flash light and the available light are balanced. While these capabilities are not unique to the SLR, manufacturers included them early on in the top models, whereas the best rangefinder cameras adopted such features later.\nDesign considerations.\nMany of the advantages of SLR cameras derive from viewing and focusing the image through the attached lens. Most other types of cameras do not have this function; subjects are seen through a viewfinder that is near the lens, making the photographer's view different from that of the lens. SLR cameras provide photographers with precision; they provide a viewing image that will be exposed onto the negative exactly as it is seen through the lens. There is no parallax error, and exact focus can be confirmed by eye\u2014especially in macro photography and when photographing using long focus lenses. The depth of field may be seen by stopping down to the attached lens aperture, which is possible on most SLR cameras except for the least expensive models. Because of the SLR's versatility, most manufacturers have a vast range of lenses and accessories available for them.\nCompared to most fixed-lens compact cameras, the most commonly used and inexpensive SLR lenses offer a wider aperture range and larger maximum aperture (typically &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/1.4 to &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/1.8 for a 50\u00a0mm lens). This allows photographs to be taken in lower light conditions without flash, and allows a narrower depth of field, which is useful for blurring the background behind the subject, making the subject more prominent. \"Fast\" lenses are commonly used in theater photography, portrait photography, surveillance photography, and all other photography requiring a large maximum aperture.\nThe variety of lenses also allows for the camera to be used and adapted in many different situations. This provides the photographer with considerably more control (i.e., how the image is viewed and framed) than would be the case with a view camera. In addition, some SLR lenses are manufactured with extremely long focal lengths, allowing a photographer to be a considerable distance away from the subject and yet still expose a sharp, focused image. This is particularly useful if the subject includes dangerous animals (e.g., wildlife); the subject prefers anonymity to being photographed; or else, the photographer's presence is unwanted (e.g., celebrity photography or surveillance photography). Practically all SLR and DSLR camera bodies can also be attached to telescopes and microscopes via an adapter tube to further enhance their imaging capabilities.\nIn most cases, single-lens reflex cameras cannot be made as small or as light as other camera designs\u2014such as rangefinder cameras, autofocus compact cameras and digital cameras with electronic viewfinders (EVF)\u2014owing to the mirror box and pentaprism/pentamirror. The mirror box also prevents lenses with deeply recessed rear elements from being mounted close to the film or sensor unless the camera has a mirror lockup feature; this means that simple designs for wide angle lenses cannot be used. Instead, larger and more complex retrofocus designs are required.\nThe SLR mirror 'blacks-out' the viewfinder image during the exposure. In addition, the movement of the reflex mirror takes time, limiting the maximum shooting speed. The mirror system can also cause noise and vibration. Partially reflective (pellicle) fixed mirrors avoid these problems and have been used in a very few designs including the Canon Pellix and the Canon EOS-1N RS, but these designs introduce their own problems. These pellicle mirrors reduce the amount of light travelling to the film plane or sensor and also can distort the light passing through them, resulting in a less-sharp image. To avoid the noise and vibration, many professional cameras offer a mirror lock-up feature, however, this feature totally disables the SLR's automatic focusing ability. Electronic viewfinders have the potential to give the 'viewing-experience' of a DSLR (through-the-lens viewing) without many of the disadvantages. More recently, Sony have resurrected the pellicle mirror concept in their \"single-lens translucent\" (SLT) range of cameras.\nSLRs vary widely in their construction and typically have bodies made of plastic or magnesium. Most manufacturers do not cite durability specifications, but some report shutter life expectancies for professional models. For instance, the Canon EOS 1Ds MkII is rated for 200,000 shutter cycles and the Nikon D3 is rated for 300,000 with its exotic carbon fiber/kevlar shutter. Because many SLRs have interchangeable lenses, there is a tendency for dust, sand and dirt to get into the main body of the camera through the mirror box when the lens is removed, thus dirtying or even jamming the mirror movement mechanism or the shutter curtain mechanism itself. In addition, these particles can also jam or otherwise hinder the focusing feature of a lens if they enter into the focusing helicoid. The problem of sensor cleaning has been somewhat reduced in DSLRs as some cameras have a built-in sensor cleaning unit.\nThe price of SLRs in general also tends to be somewhat higher than that of other types of cameras, owing to their internal complexity. This is compounded by the expense of additional components, such as flashes or lenses. The initial investment in equipment can be prohibitive enough to keep some casual photographers away from SLRs, although the market for used SLRs has become larger particularly as photographers migrate to digital systems.\nFuture.\nThe digital single-lens reflex camera has largely replaced the film SLR for its convenience, sales, and popularity at the start of the 21st century. These cameras were the marketing favorite among advanced amateur and professional photographers through the first two decades of the 2000s. Around 2010, the mirrorless technology utilized in point and shoot cameras made the way to the interchangeable lens cameras and slowly replaced DSLR technology.\nAs of 2022, all the major camera brands (Except Pentax) ceased development and production of DSLRs and moved on to mirrorless systems. These systems offer multiple advantages to the photographer with regards to autofocus systems as well as the ability to update the lens technologies due to the reduced distance between the back of the lens and the sensor resulting from the removal of the mirror. \nFilm-based SLRs are still used by a niche market of enthusiasts and format lovers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29652", "revid": "10274643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29652", "title": "Senary", "text": "Base-6 numeral system\nA senary () numeral system (also known as base-6, heximal, or seximal) has six as its base. It has been adopted independently by a small number of cultures. Like the decimal base 10, the base is a semiprime, though it is unique as the product of the only two consecutive numbers that are both prime (2 and 3). As six is a superior highly composite number, many of the arguments made in favor of the duodecimal system also apply to the senary system.\nFormal definition.\nThe standard set of digits in the senary system is formula_1, with the linear order formula_2. Let formula_3 be the Kleene closure of formula_4, where formula_5 is the operation of string concatenation for formula_6. The senary number system for natural numbers formula_7 is the quotient set formula_8 equipped with a shortlex order, where the equivalence class formula_9 is formula_10. As formula_7 has a shortlex order, it is isomorphic to the natural numbers formula_12.\nMathematical properties.\nWhen expressed in senary, all prime numbers other than 2 and 3 have 1 or 5 as the final digit. In senary, the prime numbers are written:\n2, 3, 5, 11, 15, 21, 25, 31, 35, 45, 51, 101, 105, 111, 115, 125, 135, 141, 151, 155, 201, 211, 215, 225, 241, 245, 251, 255, 301, 305, 331, 335, 345, 351, 405, 411, 421, 431, 435, 445, 455, 501, 515, 521, 525, 531, 551, ... (sequence in the OEIS)\nThat is, for every prime number \"p\" greater than 3, one has the modular arithmetic relations that either \"p\" \u2261 1 or 5 (mod 6) (that is, 6 divides either \"p\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 or \"p\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a05); the final digit is a 1 or a 5. This is proved by contradiction.\nFor any integer \"n\":\nAdditionally, since the smallest four primes (2, 3, 5, 7) are either divisors or neighbors of 6, senary has simple divisibility tests for many numbers.\nFurthermore, all even perfect numbers besides 6 have 44 as the final two digits when expressed in senary, which is proven by the fact that every even perfect number is of the form 2\"p\" \u2013 1(2\"p\" \u2013 1), where 2\"p\" \u2212 1 is prime.\nSenary is also the largest number base \"r\" that has no totatives other than 1 and \"r\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, making its multiplication table highly regular for its size, minimizing the amount of effort required to memorize its table. This property maximizes the probability that the result of an integer multiplication will end in zero, given that neither of its factors do.\nIf a number is divisible by 2, then the final digit of that number, when expressed in senary, is 0, 2, or 4.\nIf a number is divisible by 3, then the final digit of that number in senary is 0 or 3.\nA number is divisible by 4 if its penultimate digit is odd and its final digit is 2, or its penultimate digit is even and its final digit is 0 or 4.\nA number is divisible by 5 if the sum of its senary digits is divisible by 5 (the equivalent of casting out nines in decimal).\nIf a number is divisible by 6, then the final digit of that number is 0.\nTo determine whether a number is divisible by 7, one can sum its alternate digits and subtract those sums; if the result is divisible by 7, the number is divisible by 7, similar to the \"11\" divisibility test in decimal.\nFractions.\nBecause six is the product of the first two prime numbers and is adjacent to the next two prime numbers, many senary fractions have simple representations. The table below shows fractional and positional representations in both decimal and senary, and has cells colored to indicate a certain level of complexity; &lt;mark style=\"color:black;background:lightgrey\"&gt;Light grey cells&lt;/mark&gt; indicate a rational number with a repeating cycle of length one or two, &lt;mark style=\"color:black;background:darkgrey\"&gt;dark grey cells&lt;/mark&gt; indicate a repeating cycle longer than two digits, and uncolored, white cells indicate no repeating cycle at all.\nFinger counting.\nEach regular human hand may be said to have six unambiguous positions; a fist, one finger extended, two, three, four, and then all five fingers extended.\nIf the right hand is used to represent a unit (0 to 5), and the left to represent the multiples of 6, then it becomes possible for one person to represent the values from zero to 55senary (35decimal) with their fingers, rather than the usual ten obtained in standard finger counting. e.g. if three fingers are extended on the left hand and four on the right, 34senary is represented. This is equivalent to 3 \u00d7 6 + 4, which is 22decimal.\nAdditionally, this method is the least abstract way to count using two hands that reflects the concept of positional notation, as the movement from one position to the next is done by switching from one hand to another. While most developed cultures count by fingers up to 5 in very similar ways, beyond 5 non-Western cultures deviate from Western methods, such as with Chinese number gestures. As senary finger counting also deviates only beyond 5, this counting method rivals the simplicity of traditional counting methods, a fact which may have implications for the teaching of positional notation to young students.\nWhich hand is used for the 'sixes' and which the units is down to preference on the part of the counter; however, when viewed from the counter's perspective, using the left hand as the most significant digit correlates with the written representation of the same senary number. Flipping the 'sixes' hand around to its backside may help to further disambiguate which hand represents the 'sixes' and which represents the units. The downside to senary counting, however, is that without prior agreement two parties would be unable to utilize this system, being unsure which hand represents sixes and which hand represents ones, whereas decimal-based counting (with numbers beyond 5 being expressed by an open palm and additional fingers) being essentially a unary system only requires the other party to count the number of extended fingers.\nIn NCAA basketball, the players' uniform numbers are restricted to be senary numbers of at most two digits, so that the referees can signal which player committed an infraction by using this finger-counting system.\nMore abstract finger counting systems, such as chisanbop or finger binary, allow counting to 99, 1023, or even higher depending on the method (though not necessarily senary in nature). The English monk and historian Bede, described in the first chapter of his work \"De temporum ratione\", (725), titled \"\"Tractatus de computo, vel loquela per gestum digitorum\",\" a system which allowed counting up to 9,999 on two hands.\nNatural languages.\nDespite the rarity of cultures that group large quantities by 6, a review of the development of numeral systems suggests a threshold of numerosity at 6 (possibly being conceptualized as \"whole\", \"fist\", or \"beyond five fingers\"), with 1\u20136 often being pure forms, and numerals thereafter being constructed or borrowed.\nThe Ndom language of Western New Guinea, Indonesia, is reported to have senary numerals. \"Mer\" means 6, \"mer an thef\" means 6 \u00d7 2 = 12, \"nif\" means 36, and \"nif thef\" means 36 \u00d7 2 = 72.\nAnother example from Papua New Guinea are the Yam languages. In these languages, counting is connected to ritualized yam-counting. These languages count from a base six, employing words for the powers of six; running up to 66 for some of the languages. One example is Komnzo with the following numerals: \"nibo\" (61), \"fta\" (62 [36]), \"taruba\" (63 [216]), \"damno\" (64 [1296]), \"w\u00e4r\u00e4m\u00e4k\u00e4\" (65 [7776]), \"wi\" (66 [46656]).\nSome Niger\u2013Congo languages have been reported to use a senary number system, usually in addition to another, such as decimal or vigesimal.\nProto-Uralic has also been suspected to have had senary numerals, with a numeral for 7 being borrowed later, though evidence for constructing larger numerals (8 and 9) subtractively from ten suggests that this may not be so.\nBase 36 as senary compression.\nFor some purposes, senary might be too small a base for convenience. This can be worked around by using its square, base 36 (hexatrigesimal), as then conversion is facilitated by simply making the following replacements:\nThus, the base-36 number WIKI36 is equal to the senary number 523032306. In decimal, it is 1,517,058.\nThe choice of 36 as a radix is convenient in that the digits can be represented using the Arabic numerals 0\u20139 and the Latin letters A\u2013Z; this choice is the basis of the base36 encoding scheme. The compression effect of 36 being the square of 6 causes a lot of patterns and representations to be shorter in base 36:\n = 0.046 = 0.436\n = 0.02136 = 0.2936\n = 0.16 = 0.736\n = 0.056 = 0.536"}

He is the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and a co-founder of the Ballmer Group, a philanthropic investment company.\nAs of May 2025, \"Bloomberg Billionaires Index\" estimated his personal wealth at around $151 billion, making him the eighth-richest person in the world, and the Forbes \"Real-Time Billionaires List\" ranked him as the ninth-richest person with a net worth of $118 billion.\nBallmer was hired by Bill Gates at Microsoft in 1980, and subsequently left the MBA program at Stanford University. He eventually became president in 1998, and replaced Gates as CEO on January 13, 2000. On February 4, 2014, Ballmer retired as CEO and was replaced by Satya Nadella; Ballmer remained on Microsoft's board of directors until August 19, 2014. Under Ballmer's leadership, a 14-year period, the company tripled sales and doubled profits, but lost its market dominance and missed out on 21st-century technology trends such as the ascendance of smartphones in the forms of iPhone and Android.\nPlayers and sportswriters generally consider Ballmer's ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers as an improvement over previous owner Donald Sterling, citing his willingness to acquire superstar players and finance the construction of Intuit Dome.\nEarly life and education.\nSteven Anthony Ballmer was born on March 24, 1956, in Detroit, Michigan, as the son of Beatrice Dworkin and Frederic Henry (Fritz Hans) Ballmer, a manager at the Ford Motor Company. Frederic (1923\u20132000) was from Zuchwil, Switzerland, and arrived in the United States in 1948. Ballmer's mother is Jewish. Through his mother, Ballmer is a second cousin of actress and comedian Gilda Radner. Ballmer grew up in the community of Farmington Hills, Michigan. Ballmer also lived in Brussels from 1964 to 1967, where he attended the International School of Brussels. \nIn 1973, he attended college prep and engineering classes at Lawrence Technological University. He graduated as valedictorian from Detroit Country Day School, a private college preparatory school in Beverly Hills, Michigan, with a score of 800 on the mathematical section of the SAT and was a National Merit Scholar.\nBallmer, the first in his family to graduate from college, attended Harvard University, where he was a manager for the Harvard Crimson football team and a member of the Fox Club, worked on \"The Harvard Crimson\" newspaper as well as the \"Harvard Advocate\", and lived down the hall from fellow sophomore Bill Gates. He scored highly in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, an exam sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America, scoring higher than Bill Gates. He graduated \"magna cum laude\" with a Bachelor of Arts in applied mathematics and economics in 1977.\nBallmer worked as an assistant product manager at Procter &amp; Gamble for two years, where he shared an office with Jeff Immelt, who later became CEO of General Electric. After briefly trying to write screenplays in Hollywood, he started attending the Stanford Graduate School of Business for his MBA (where Mukesh Ambani was his classmate), but dropped out in 1980 to join Microsoft.\nHistory with Microsoft.\nBallmer joined Microsoft on June 11, 1980, and became Microsoft's 30th employee and the first business manager hired by Gates.\nBallmer joined Microsoft with a salary of $50,000 plus 10 % of the profit he generated and no equity. However, Ballmer's profit-share started to balloon out of control as Microsoft grew. When Dave Marquardt suggested for Microsoft to reorganize as a corporation instead of a private partnership, he proposed that Ballmer own 8% of the company in exchange for cancelling the profit-sharing model. Paul Allen initially disagreed, but Gates and Allen reached an agreement when Gates agreed to fund an outsized majority of Ballmer's 8% stake. When Microsoft was incorporated in 1981, Ballmer owned 8% of the company. In 2003, Ballmer sold 39.3 million Microsoft shares for about $955 million, reducing his ownership to 4%. The same year, he replaced Microsoft's employee stock options program.\nIn his first 20 years at the company, Ballmer headed several Microsoft divisions, including operations, operating systems development, and sales and support. In February 1992, he became Executive Vice President for Sales and Support. Ballmer led Microsoft's development of the .NET Framework. Ballmer was promoted to President of Microsoft in July 1998, making him the \"de facto\" number two after Gates, then chairman and CEO.\nChief executive officer (2000\u20132014).\nOn January 13, 2000, Ballmer was officially named the chief executive officer; he would shed the title of president in February 2001. As CEO, Ballmer handled company finances and daily operations, but Gates remained chairman of the board and still retained control of the \"technological vision\" as chief software architect. Gates relinquished day-to-day activities when he stepped down as chief software architect in 2006, while staying on as chairman, and that gave Ballmer the autonomy needed to make major management changes at Microsoft.\nWhen Ballmer took over as CEO, the company was fighting an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the US government and 20 states, plus class-action lawsuits and complaints from rival companies. While it was said that Gates would have continued fighting the federal suit, Ballmer sought to settle these, saying: \"Being the object of a lawsuit, effectively, or a complaint from your government is a very awkward, uncomfortable position to be in. It just has all downside. People assume if the government brought a complaint that there's really a problem, and your ability to say we're a good, proper, moral place is tough. It's actually tough, even though you feel that way about yourselves.\"\nUpon becoming CEO, Ballmer required detailed business justification to approve new products, rather than allowing hundreds of products that sounded potentially interesting or trendy. In 2005, he recruited B. Kevin Turner from Walmart, who was the president and CEO of Sam's Club, to become Microsoft's chief operating officer. Turner was hired at Microsoft to lead the company's sales, marketing, and services group and to instill more process and discipline in the company's operations and salesforce.\nSince Bill Gates' retirement, Ballmer oversaw a \"dramatic shift away from the company's PC-first heritage\", replacing most major division heads in order to break down the \"talent-hoarding fiefdoms\"; in 2012, this led \"Businessweek\" to say that the company \"arguably [had] the best product lineup in its history\". Ballmer drove Microsoft's \"connected computing\" strategy with acquisitions such as Skype.\nUnder Ballmer's tenure as CEO, Microsoft's share price stagnated even as the company's annual revenue surged from $25\u00a0billion to $70\u00a0billion, while its net income increased 215% to $23\u00a0billion, and its gross profit of 75 cents on every dollar in sales was double that of Google or IBM. With the company's total annual profit growth of 16.4%, Ballmer's tenure at Microsoft surpassed the performances of other well-known CEOs such as General Electric's Jack Welch (11.2%) and IBM's Louis V. Gerstner Jr. (2%). These gains came from the existing Windows and Office franchises, with Ballmer maintaining their profitability, fending off threats from competitors such as Linux and other open-source operating systems and Google Docs. Ballmer also built half a dozen new businesses, such as the data centers division and the Xbox entertainment and devices division ($8.9\u00a0billion), and oversaw the acquisition of Skype. Ballmer also constructed the company's $20\u00a0billion Enterprise Business, consisting of new products and services such as Exchange, Windows Server, SQL Server, SharePoint, System Center, and Dynamics CRM, each of which initially faced an uphill battle for acceptance but have emerged as leading or dominant in each category. This diversified product mix helped to offset the company's reliance on PCs and mobile computing devices as the company entered the post-PC era; in reporting quarterly results during April 2013, while Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 had not managed to increase their market share above single digits, the company increased its profit 19% over the previous quarter in 2012, as the Microsoft Business Division (including Office 365) and Server and Tools division (cloud services) are each larger than the Windows division.\nBallmer attracted criticism for failing to capitalize on several new consumer technologies, forcing Microsoft to play catch-up in the areas of tablet computing, smartphones and music players with mixed results. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", under Ballmer's watch, \"In many cases, Microsoft latched onto technologies like smartphones, touchscreens, 'smart' cars and wristwatches that read sports scores aloud long before Apple or Google did. But it repeatedly killed promising projects if they threatened its cash cows [Windows and Office].\" Ballmer was even named one of the worst CEOs of 2013 by the BBC. As a result of these many criticisms, in May 2012, hedge fund manager David Einhorn called on Ballmer to step down as CEO of Microsoft. \"His continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock,\" Einhorn said in reference to Ballmer. In a May 2012 column in \"Forbes\" magazine, Adam Hartung described Ballmer as \"the worst CEO of a large publicly traded American company\", saying he had \"steered Microsoft out of some of the fastest growing and most lucrative tech markets (mobile music, headsets and tablets)\".\nIn 2009, and for the first time since Bill Gates resigned from day-to-day management at Microsoft, Ballmer delivered the opening keynote at CES.\nAs part of his plans to expand on hardware, on June 19, 2012, Ballmer revealed Microsoft's first ever computer device, a tablet called Microsoft Surface at an event held in Hollywood, Los Angeles. He followed this by announcing the company's purchase of Nokia's mobile phone division in September 2013, his last major acquisition for Microsoft as CEO.\nOn August 23, 2013, Microsoft announced that Ballmer would retire within the next 12 months. A special committee that included Bill Gates would decide on the next CEO.\nThere was a list of potential successors to Ballmer as Microsoft CEO, but all had departed the company: Jim Allchin, Brad Silverberg, Paul Maritz, Nathan Myhrvold, Greg Maffei, Pete Higgins, Jeff Raikes, J. Allard, Robbie Bach, Bill Veghte, Ray Ozzie, Bob Muglia and Steven Sinofsky. B. Kevin Turner, Microsoft's Chief Operating Officer (COO), was considered by some to be a \"de facto\" number two to Ballmer, with Turner having a strong grasp of business and operations but lacking technological vision. On February 4, 2014, Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer as CEO.\nPublic image.\nAlthough as a child he was so shy that he would hyperventilate before Hebrew school, Ballmer is known for his energetic and exuberant personality, which is meant to motivate employees and partners, shouting so much that he needed surgery on his vocal cords.\nBallmer's excited stage appearances at Microsoft events were widely circulated on the Internet as viral videos. One of his earliest known viral videos was a parody video, produced for Microsoft employees in 1986, promoting Windows 1.0 in the style of a Crazy Eddie commercial. Ballmer and Brian Valentine later repeated this in a spoof promotion of Windows XP.\nA widely circulated video was his entrance on stage at Microsoft's 25th anniversary event in September 2000, where Ballmer jumped across the stage and shouted, \"I love this company!\" Another viral video was captured at a Windows 2000 developers' conference, featuring a visibly perspiring Ballmer repeatedly chanting the word \"developers\".\nRelationship with Bill Gates.\nBallmer was Gates' best man at his wedding to Melinda French, and the two men described their relationship as a marriage. They were so close for years that another Microsoft executive described it as a mind meld. Combative debates\u2014a part of Microsoft's corporate culture\u2014that many observers believed were personal arguments occurred within the relationship; while Gates was glad in 2000 that Ballmer was willing to become CEO so he could focus on technology, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that there was tension surrounding the transition of authority. Things became so bitter that, on one occasion, Gates stormed out of a meeting after a shouting match in which Ballmer jumped to the defense of several colleagues, according to an individual present at the time. After the exchange, Ballmer seemed \"remorseful\", the person said. Once Gates leaves, \"I'm not going to need him for anything. That's the principle\", Ballmer said. \"Use him, yes, need him, no\".\nIn October 2014, a few months after Ballmer left his post at Microsoft, a \"Vanity Fair\" profile stated that Ballmer and Gates no longer talk to each other due to animosity over Ballmer's resignation. In a November 2016 interview, Ballmer said he and Gates have \"drifted apart\" ever since, saying that they always had a \"brotherly relationship\" beforehand. He said that his push into the hardware business, specifically smartphones, which Gates did not support, contributed to their relationship breakdown.\nRetirement.\nAfter saying in 2008 that he intended to remain CEO for another decade, Ballmer announced his retirement in 2013, after losing billions of dollars in acquisitions and on the Surface tablet. Microsoft's stock price rebounded on the news.\nBallmer says that he regretted the lack of focus on Windows Mobile in the early 2000s, leaving Microsoft a distant third in the smartphone market [in 2013]. Moreover, he attributed the success of the expensively-priced iPhones to carrier subsidies. He went on to say,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;People like to point to this quote where I said iPhones will never sell, because the price at $600 or $700 was too high. And there was a business model innovation by Apple to get it essentially built into the monthly cellphone bill. Ballmer called the acquisition of the mobile phone division of Nokia his \"toughest decision\" during his tenure.\nBallmer hosted his last company meeting in September 2013, and stepped down from the company's board of directors in August 2014.\nOn December 24, 2014, the \"Seattle Times\" reported that the IRS sued Ballmer, Craig Mundie, Jeff Raikes, Jim Allchin, Orlando Ayala and David Guenther in an effort to compel them to testify in Microsoft's corporate tax audit. The IRS had been looking into how Microsoft and other companies deal with transfer pricing.\nIn December 2023, \"CNN\" estimated that Ballmer was set to collect $1 billion in dividends from his ongoing ownership of Microsoft stock, after the company announced an increase in its dividend to $3 per share.\nOther positions.\nBallmer was a director of Accenture and a general partner of Accenture SCA from 2001 to 2006. Details about his remuneration in these positions remain undisclosed.\nOn competing companies and software.\nApple.\nIn 2007, Ballmer said, \"There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.\"\nSpeaking at a conference in NYC in 2009, Ballmer criticized Apple's pricing, saying, \"Now I think the tide has turned back the other direction (against Apple). The economy is helpful. Paying an extra $500 for a computer in this environment\u2014same piece of hardware\u2014paying $500 more to get a logo on it? I think that's a more challenging proposition for the average person than it used to be.\"\nOn September 25, 2014, Ballmer said he would bar the team from using Apple products such as iPads, and replace them with Microsoft products. It has been reported that he had previously also barred his family from using iPhones.\nIn 2015, when Apple had become the world's most valuable company, Ballmer called Microsoft's decision to invest in Apple to save it from bankruptcy in 1997 as the \"craziest thing we ever did\".\nIn 2016, Ballmer revisited his iPhone statements, saying, \"People like to point to this quote...but the reason I said that was [that] the price of $600\u2013$700 was too high\". He said he did not realize that Apple was going to have phone carriers build the cost into the customer's monthly bill.\nFree and open-source software.\nIn July 2000, Ballmer called the free software Linux kernel \"communism\" and further claimed that it infringed Microsoft's intellectual property. In June 2001 he called Linux a \"cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches\". Ballmer used the notion of \"viral\" licensing terms to express his concern over the fact that the GNU General Public License (GPL) employed by such software requires that all derivative software be under the GPL or a compatible license. In April 2003 he interrupted a skiing holiday in Switzerland to personally plead with the mayor of Munich not to switch to Linux. But he did not succeed with this and Munich switched to LiMux, despite his offering a 35% discount at his lobbying visit.\nIn March 2016, Ballmer changed his stance on Linux, saying that he supports his successor Satya Nadella's open source commitments. He maintained that his comments in 2001 were right at the time but that times have changed.\nGoogle.\nIn 2005, Microsoft sued Google for hiring one of its previous vice presidents, Kai-Fu Lee, claiming it was in violation of his one-year non-compete clause in his contract. Mark Lucovsky, who left for Google in 2004, alleged in a sworn affidavit to a Washington state court that Ballmer became enraged upon being told by Lucovsky that he was about to leave Microsoft for Google, picked up a chair, and threw it across his office, and that, referring to then Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt (who had previously worked for competitors Sun and Novell), Ballmer vowed to \"kill Google.\" Lucovsky reports:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At some point in the conversation Mr. Ballmer said: \"Just tell me it's not Google.\" I told him it was Google. At that point, Mr. Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room hitting a table in his office. Mr. Ballmer then said: \"Fucking Eric Schmidt is a fucking pussy. I'm going to fucking bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again. I'm going to fucking kill Google.\"\nBallmer then resumed attempting to persuade Lucovsky to stay at Microsoft. Ballmer has described Lucovsky's account of the incident as a \"gross exaggeration of what actually took place\".\nDuring the 2011 Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, he said: \"You don't need to be a computer scientist to use a Windows Phone and you do to use an Android phone\u00a0... It is hard for me to be excited about the Android phones.\"\nIn 2013, Ballmer said that Google was a \"monopoly\" that should be pressured from market competition authorities.\nSports.\nOn March 6, 2008, Seattle mayor Greg Nickels announced that a local ownership group involving Ballmer made a \"game-changing\" commitment to invest $150\u00a0million in cash toward a proposed $300\u00a0million renovation of KeyArena and were ready to purchase the Seattle SuperSonics from the Professional Basketball Club LLC in order to keep the team in Seattle. However, this initiative failed, and the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where they now play as the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nIn June 2012, Ballmer was an investor in Chris R. Hansen's proposal to build a new arena in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle and bring the SuperSonics back to Seattle. On January 9, 2013, Ballmer and Hansen led a group of investors in an attempt to purchase the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof family and relocate them to Seattle for an estimated $650\u00a0million. However, this attempt also fell through.\nFollowing the Donald Sterling scandal in May 2014, Ballmer was the highest bidder in an attempt to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers for a reported price of $2\u00a0billion, which was then the second-highest bid for a sports franchise in North American sports history (after the $2.15\u00a0billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012). After a California court confirmed the authority of Shelly Sterling to sell the team, it was announced on August 12, 2014, that Ballmer would become the Los Angeles Clippers owner.\nIn March 2020, Ballmer agreed to buy The Forum in Inglewood, California. The purchase would allow him to build Intuit Dome in the nearby area since plans for a new Clippers' arena were opposed by the former owners of The Forum.\nIn a survey conducted by \"The Athletic\" in December 2020, Ballmer was voted the best owner in basketball.\nIn September 2025, Pablo S. Torre reported on his podcast that Steve Ballmer and the Los Angeles Clippers used Aspiration as a means of paying Kawhi Leonard an extra $28 million, circumventing the NBA salary cap. John Karalis of the Boston Sports Journal later reported that Kawhi also received an additional $20 million in Aspiration company stock. Ballmer and the Clippers claimed innocence, declaring they were the victims of a fraud perpetrated by Aspiration co-founder Joe Sanberg. However, it was revealed that both Ballmer and Clippers co-owner Dennis Wong kept investing money into Aspiration and Golden State Opportunity Foundation (Sanberg's charity) after Aspiration's financial issues and fraud had publicly been exposed. Adam Silver announced the NBA hired Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz to investigate Torre's claims of salary cap circumvention. The NBA previously investigated Kawhi Leonard's free agency deal with the Clippers in 2019. The NBA determined there was no evidence the Clippers had given Kawhi benefits that violated NBA rules, but the case could be re-opened if new evidence surfaced. Additionally, Ballmer's Clippers were fined $250,000 in 2015 for circumventing the NBA salary cap, when they offered an unauthorized business opportunity during their pursuit of free agent DeAndre Jordan.\nWealth and taxes.\nIn 2021, ProPublica documented how Ballmer is using his ownership of various sports teams as a means to lower his federal income tax to as low as 12%, compared to around 35% for the athletes playing in the team. The report exposes how the Clippers were profitable before their acquisition by Ballmer, but then reported $700 million in losses for tax purposes in following years.\nIn 2023, ProPublica did another report, about Ballmer's usage of wash sales helped by Goldman Sachs, under the label \"Tax Advantaged Loss Harvesting\", resulting in tax savings of more than half a billion dollars over 5 years.\nAs of 5 March 2025, \"Bloomberg Billionaires Index\" estimated his personal wealth at around $136 billion, making him the tenth-richest person in the world, and the Forbes *Real-Time Billionaires List* ranked him as the twelfth-richest person with a net worth of $117.8 billion.\nPhilanthropy.\nOn November 12, 2014, it was announced that Ballmer and his wife Connie donated $50\u00a0million to the University of Oregon. Connie Ballmer is a University of Oregon alumna and previously was on the institution's board of trustees. The funds will go toward the university's $2\u00a0billion fundraising effort, and will focus on scholarships, public health research and advocacy, and external branding/communications. On November 13, 2014, it was announced that Ballmer would provide a gift, estimated at $60 million, to Harvard University's computer science department. The gift would allow the department to hire new faculty, and hopefully increase the national stature of the program. Ballmer previously donated $10 million to the same department in 1994, in a joint gift with Bill Gates.\nIn 2022, Ballmer donated $425 million to the University of Oregon to fund a new institute that addresses children's behavioral and mental health needs. It was named the Ballmer Institute for Children\u2019s Behavioral Health.\nBallmer is on the World Chairman's Council of the Jewish National Fund (JNF), signifying that he has donated at least $1 million to the JNF.\nBallmer Group.\nIn 2015, he and his wife co-founded Ballmer Group, a philanthropic investment company that aims to help children, particularly those in poor families, achieve economic mobility. The company has a presence in Washington state, Los Angeles County, and the Detroit metro area.\nUSAFacts.\nBallmer launched USAFacts in 2017, a not-for-profit organization whose goal is to enable people to understand US government revenue, spending and societal impact. He is reported to have contributed $10 million to fund teams of researchers who populated the website's database with official data.\nPersonal life.\nBallmer married Connie Snyder in 1990, and the couple have three sons, Sam Ballmer, Aaron Ballmer, and Peter Ballmer.\nThe Ballmers live primarily in Hunts Point, Washington. They own multiple homes in the Seattle area, and a total of 10 properties near Coupeville, Washington, as of 2024.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29657", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29657", "title": "Salamander", "text": "Order of amphibians\nSalamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by their lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults. All ten extant salamander families are grouped together under the order Urodela, the sole surviving order from the group Caudata. \"Urodela\" is a scientific Latin term based on the Ancient Greek : our\u00e0 d\u0113l\u0113 \"conspicuous tail\". \"Caudata\" is the Latin for \"tailed ones\", from : \"tail\".\nSalamander diversity is highest in eastern North America, especially in the Appalachian Mountains; most species are found in the Holarctic realm, with some species present in the Neotropical realm. Salamanders never have more than four toes on their front legs and five on their rear legs, but some species have fewer digits and others lack hind limbs. Their permeable skin usually makes them reliant on habitats in or near water or other cool, damp places. Some salamander species are fully aquatic throughout their lives, some take to the water intermittently, and others are entirely terrestrial as adults.\nThis group of amphibians is capable of regenerating lost limbs as well as other damaged parts of their bodies. Researchers hope to reverse engineer the regenerative processes for potential human medical applications, such as brain and spinal cord injury treatment or preventing harmful scarring during heart surgery recovery. The remarkable ability of salamanders to regenerate is not just limited to limbs but extends to vital organs such as the heart, jaw, and parts of the spinal cord, showing their uniqueness compared to different types of vertebrates. \u2064\u2064This ability is most remarkable for occurring without any type of scarring. \u2064\u2064This has made salamanders an invaluable model organism in scientific research aimed at understanding and achieving regenerative processes for medical advancements in human and animal biology.\nMembers of the family Salamandridae are mostly known as newts and lack the costal grooves along the sides of their bodies typical of other groups. The skin of some species contains the powerful poison tetrodotoxin; these salamanders tend to be slow-moving and have bright warning coloration to advertise their toxicity. Salamanders typically lay eggs in water and have aquatic larvae, but great variation occurs in their lifecycles. Some species in harsh environments reproduce while still in the larval state.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"salamander\" comes from Old French \"salamandre\" from Latin \"salamandra\" from Greek : salam\u00e1ndra, of uncertain, possibly, pre-Greek origin. The Greek word is used for the fire salamander.\nDescription.\nThe skin lacks scales and is moist and smooth to the touch, except in newts of the Salamandridae, which may have velvety or warty skin, wet to the touch. The skin may be drab or brightly colored, exhibiting various patterns of stripes, bars, spots, blotches, or dots. Male newts become dramatically colored during the breeding season. Cave species dwelling in darkness lack pigmentation and have a translucent pink or pearlescent appearance.\nSalamanders range in size from the minute salamanders, with a total length of , including the tail, to the Chinese giant salamander which reaches and weighs up to . All the largest species are found in the four families giant salamanders, sirens, Congo eels and Proteidae, which are all aquatic and obligate paedomorphs. Some of the largest terrestrial salamanders, which go through full metamorphosis, belong to the family of Pacific giant salamanders, and are much smaller. Most salamanders are between in length.\nTrunk, limbs and tail.\nAn adult salamander generally resembles a small lizard, having a basal tetrapod body form with a cylindrical trunk, four limbs, and a long tail. Except in the family Salamandridae, the head, body, and tail have a number of vertical depressions in the surface which run from the mid-dorsal region to the ventral area and are known as costal grooves. Their function seems to be to help keep the skin moist by channeling water over the surface of the body.\nSome aquatic species, such as sirens and amphiumas, have reduced or absent hind limbs, giving them an eel-like appearance, but in most species, the front and rear limbs are about the same length and project sideward, barely raising the trunk off the ground. The feet are broad with short digits, usually four on the front feet and five on the rear. Salamanders do not have claws, and the shape of the foot varies according to the animal's habitat. Climbing species have elongated, square-tipped toes, while rock-dwellers have larger feet with short, blunt toes. The tree-climbing salamander (\"Bolitoglossa\" sp.) has plate-like webbed feet which adhere to smooth surfaces by suction, while the rock-climbing \"Hydromantes\" species from California have feet with fleshy webs and short digits and use their tails as an extra limb. When ascending, the tail props up the rear of the body, while one hind foot moves forward and then swings to the other side to provide support as the other hind foot advances.\nIn larvae and aquatic salamanders, the tail is laterally flattened, has dorsal and ventral fins, and undulates from side to side to propel the animal through the water. In the families Ambystomatidae and Salamandridae, the male's tail, which is larger than that of the female, is used during the amplexus embrace to propel the mating couple to a secluded location. In terrestrial species, the tail moves to counterbalance the animal as it runs, while in the arboreal salamander and other tree-climbing species, it is prehensile. The tail is also used by certain plethodontid salamanders that can jump, to help launch themselves into the air. The tail is used in courtship and as a storage organ for proteins and lipids. It also functions as a defense against predation, when it may be lashed at the attacker or autotomised when grabbed. Unlike frogs, an adult salamander is able to regenerate limbs and its tail when these are lost.\nSkin.\nThe skin of salamanders, in common with other amphibians, is thin, permeable to water, serves as a respiratory membrane, and is well-supplied with glands. It has highly cornified outer layers, renewed periodically through a skin shedding process controlled by hormones from the pituitary and thyroid glands. During moulting, the skin initially breaks around the mouth, and the animal moves forward through the gap to shed the skin. When the front limbs have been worked clear, a series of body ripples pushes the skin toward the rear. The hind limbs are extracted and push the skin farther back, before it is eventually freed by friction as the salamander moves forward with the tail pressed against the ground. The animal often then eats the resulting sloughed skin.\nGlands in the skin discharge mucus which keeps the skin moist, an important factor in skin respiration and thermoregulation. The sticky layer helps protect against bacterial infections and molds, reduces friction when swimming, and makes the animal slippery and more difficult for predators to catch. Granular glands scattered on the upper surface, particularly the head, back, and tail, produce repellent or toxic secretions. Some salamander toxins are particularly potent. The rough-skinned newt (\"Taricha granulosa\") produces the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, the most toxic nonprotein substance known. Handling the newts does no harm, but ingestion of even a minute fragment of skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds, and mammals were all found to be susceptible.\nMature adults of some salamander species have \"nuptial\" glandular tissue in their cloacae, at the base of their tails, on their heads or under their chins. Some females release chemical substances, possibly from the ventral cloacal gland, to attract males, but males do not seem to use pheromones for this purpose. In some plethodonts, males have conspicuous mental glands on the chin which are pressed against the females' nostrils during the courtship ritual. They may function to speed up the mating process, reducing the risk of its being disrupted by a predator or rival male. The gland at the base of the tail in \"Plethodon cinereus\" is used to mark fecal pellets to proclaim territorial ownership.\nSenses.\nSmell.\nOlfaction in salamanders plays a role in territory maintenance, the recognition of predators, and courtship rituals, but is probably secondary to sight during prey selection and feeding. Salamanders have two types of sensory areas that respond to the chemistry of the environment. Olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity picks up airborne and aquatic odors, while adjoining vomeronasal organs detect nonvolatile chemical cues, such as tastes in the mouth. In plethodonts, the sensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organs extends to the nasolabial grooves, which stretch from the nostrils to the corners of the mouth. These extended areas seem to be associated with the identification of prey items, the recognition of conspecifics, and the identification of individuals.\nVision.\nThe eyes of most salamanders are adapted primarily for vision at night. In some permanently aquatic species, they are reduced in size and have a simplified retinal structure, and in cave dwellers such as the Georgia blind salamander, they are absent or covered with a layer of skin. In amphibious species, the eyes are a compromise and are nearsighted in air and farsighted in water. Fully terrestrial species such as the fire salamander have a flatter lens which can focus over a much wider range of distances.\nTo find their prey, salamanders use trichromatic color vision extending into the ultraviolet range, based on three photoreceptor types that are maximally sensitive around 450, 500, and 570\u00a0nm. The larvae, and the adults of some highly aquatic species, also have a lateral line organ, similar to that of fish, which can detect changes in water pressure.\nHearing.\nAll salamanders lack middle ear cavity, eardrum and eustachian tube, but have an opercularis system like frogs, and are still able to detect airborne sound. The opercularis system consists of two ossicles: the columella (equivalent to the stapes of higher vertebrates) which is fused to the skull, and the operculum. An opercularis muscle connects the latter to the pectoral girdle, and is kept under tension when the animal is alert. The system seems able to detect low-frequency vibrations (500\u2013600\u00a0Hz), which may be picked up from the ground by the fore limbs and transmitted to the inner ear. These may serve to warn the animal of an approaching predator.\nVocalization.\nSalamanders are usually considered to have no voice and do not use sound for communication in the way that frogs do. Before mating, they communicate by pheromone signaling; some species make quiet ticking, clicking, squeaks or popping noises, perhaps by the opening and closing of valves in the nose. Most salamanders lack vocal cords, but a larynx is present in the mudpuppy (\"Necturus\") and some other species, and the Pacific giant salamanders and a few others have a large larynx and bands known as plicae vocales. The California giant salamander can produce a bark or rattle, and a few species can squeak by contracting muscles in the throat. The arboreal salamander can squeak using a different mechanism; it retracts its eyes into its head, forcing air out of its mouth. The ensatina salamander occasionally makes a hissing sound, while the sirens sometimes produce quiet clicks, and can resort to faint shrieks if attacked. Similar clicking behaviour was observed in two European newts \"Lissotriton vulgaris\" and \"Ichthyosaura alpestris\" in their aquatic phase. Vocalization in salamanders has been little studied and the purpose of these sounds is presumed to be the startling of predators.\nRespiration.\nRespiration differs among the different species of salamanders, and can involve gills, lungs, skin, and the membranes of mouth and throat. Larval salamanders breathe primarily by means of gills, which are usually external and feathery in appearance. Water is drawn in through the mouth and flows out through the gill slits. Some neotenic species such as the mudpuppy (\"Necturus maculosus\") retain their gills throughout their lives, but most species lose them at metamorphosis. The embryos of some terrestrial lungless salamanders, such as \"Ensatina\", that undergo direct development, have large gills that lie close to the egg's surface.\nWhen present in adult salamanders, lungs vary greatly among different species in size and structure. In aquatic, cold-water species like the torrent salamanders (\"Rhyacotriton\"), the lungs are very small with smooth walls, while species living in warm water with little dissolved oxygen, such as the lesser siren (\"Siren intermedia\"), have large lungs with convoluted surfaces. In the lungless salamanders (family Plethodontidae and the clawed salamanders in the family of Asiatic salamanders), no lungs or gills are present, and gas exchange mostly takes place through the skin, known as cutaneous respiration, supplemented by the tissues lining the mouth. To facilitate this, these salamanders have a dense network of blood vessels just under the skin and in the mouth.\nIn the amphiumas, metamorphosis is incomplete, and they retain one pair of gill slits as adults, with fully functioning internal lungs. Some species that lack lungs respire through gills. In most cases, these are external gills, visible as tufts on either side of the head. Some terrestrial salamanders have lungs used in respiration, although these are simple and sac-like, unlike the more complex organs found in mammals. Many species, such as the olm, have both lungs and gills as adults.\nIn the \"Necturus\", external gills begin to form as a means of combating hypoxia in the egg as egg yolk is converted into metabolically active tissue. Molecular changes in the mudpuppy during post-embryonic development primarily due to the thyroid gland prevent the internalization of the external gills as seen in most salamanders that undergo metamorphosis. The external gills seen in salamanders differs greatly from that of amphibians with internalized gills. Unlike amphibians with internalized gills which typically rely on the changing of pressures within the buccal and pharyngeal cavities to ensure diffusion of oxygen onto the gill curtain, neotenic salamanders such as \"Necturus\" use specified musculature, such as the levatores arcuum, to move external gills to keep the respiratory surfaces constantly in contact with new oxygenated water.\nFeeding and diet.\nSalamanders are opportunistic predators. They are generally not restricted to specific foods, but feed on almost any organism of a reasonable size. Large species such as the Japanese giant salamander (\"Andrias japonicus\") eat crabs, fish, small mammals, amphibians, and aquatic insects. In a study of smaller dusky salamanders (\"Desmognathus\") in the Appalachian Mountains, their diet includes earthworms, flies, beetles, beetle larvae, leafhoppers, springtails, moths, spiders, grasshoppers, and mites. Cannibalism sometimes takes place, especially when resources are short or time is limited. Tiger salamander tadpoles in ephemeral pools sometimes resort to eating each other, and are seemingly able to target unrelated individuals. Adult blackbelly salamanders (\"Desmognathus quadramaculatus\") prey on adults and young of other species of salamanders, while their larvae sometimes cannibalise smaller larvae.\nMost species of salamander have small teeth in both their upper and lower jaws. Unlike frogs, even the larvae of salamanders possess these teeth. Although larval teeth are shaped like pointed cones, the teeth of adults are adapted to enable them to readily grasp prey. The crown, which has two cusps (bicuspid), is attached to a pedicel by collagenous fibers. The joint formed between the bicuspid and the pedicel is partially flexible, as it can bend inward, but not outward. When struggling prey is advanced into the salamander's mouth, the teeth tips relax and bend in the same direction, encouraging movement toward the throat, and resisting the prey's escape. Many salamanders have patches of teeth attached to the vomer and the palatine bones in the roof of the mouth, and these help to retain prey. All types of teeth are resorbed and replaced at intervals throughout the animal's life.\nA terrestrial salamander catches its prey by flicking out its sticky tongue in an action that takes less than half a second. In some species, the tongue is attached anteriorly to the floor of the mouth, while in others, it is mounted on a pedicel. It is rendered sticky by secretions of mucus from glands in its tip and on the roof of the mouth. High-speed cinematography shows how the tiger salamander (\"Ambystoma tigrinum\") positions itself with its snout close to its prey. Its mouth then gapes widely, the lower jaw remains stationary, and the tongue bulges and changes shape as it shoots forward. The protruded tongue has a central depression, and the rim of this collapses inward as the target is struck, trapping the prey in a mucus-laden trough. Here it is held while the animal's neck is flexed, the tongue retracted and jaws closed. Large or resistant prey is retained by the teeth while repeated protrusions and retractions of the tongue draw it in. Swallowing involves alternate contraction and relaxation of muscles in the throat, assisted by depression of the eyeballs into the roof of the mouth. Many lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae have more elaborate feeding methods. Muscles surrounding the hyoid bone contract to store elastic energy in springy connective tissue, and actually \"shoot\" the hyoid bone out of the mouth, thus elongating the tongue. Muscles that originate in the pelvic region and insert in the tongue are used to reel the tongue and the hyoid back to their original positions.\nAn aquatic salamander lacks muscles in the tongue, and captures its prey in an entirely different manner. It grabs the food item, grasps it with its teeth, and adopts a kind of inertial feeding. This involves tossing its head about, drawing water sharply in and out of its mouth, and snapping its jaws, all of which tend to tear and macerate the prey, which is then swallowed.\nThough frequently feeding on slow-moving animals like snails, shrimps and worms, sirenids are unique among salamanders for having developed herbivory speciations, such as beak-like jaw ends and extensive intestines. They feed on algae and other soft-plants in the wild, and easily eat offered lettuce.\nDefense.\nSalamanders have thin skins and soft bodies, move rather slowly and might appear vulnerable to opportunistic predation, but have several effective lines of defense. Mucus coating on damp skin makes them difficult to grasp, and the slimy coating may have an offensive taste or be toxic. When attacked by a predator, a salamander may position itself to make the main poison glands face the aggressor. Often, these are on the tail, which may be waggled or turned up and arched over the animal's back. The sacrifice of the tail may be a worthwhile strategy, if the salamander escapes with its life and the predator learns to avoid that species of salamander in the future.\nAposematism.\nSkin secretions of the tiger salamander (\"Ambystoma tigrinum\") fed to rats have been shown to produce aversion to the flavor, and the rats avoided the presentational medium when it was offered to them again. The fire salamander (\"Salamandra salamandra\") has a ridge of large granular glands down its spine which are able to squirt a fine jet of toxic fluid at its attacker. By angling its body appropriately, it can accurately direct the spray for a distance of up to .\nThe Iberian ribbed newt (\"Pleurodeles waltl\") has another method of deterring aggressors. Its skin exudes a poisonous, viscous fluid and at the same time, the newt rotates its sharply pointed ribs through an angle between 27 and 92\u00b0, and adopts an inflated posture. This action causes the ribs to puncture the body wall, each rib protruding through an orange wart arranged in a lateral row. This may provide an aposematic signal that makes the spines more visible. When the danger has passed, the ribs retract and the skin heals.\nCamouflage and mimicry.\nAlthough many salamanders have cryptic colors so as to be unnoticeable, others signal their toxicity by their vivid coloring. Yellow, orange, and red are the colors generally used, often with black for greater contrast. Sometimes, the animal postures if attacked, revealing a flash of warning hue on its underside. The red eft, the brightly colored terrestrial juvenile form of the eastern newt (\"Notophthalmus viridescens\"), is highly poisonous. It is avoided by birds and snakes, and can survive for up to 30 minutes after being swallowed (later being regurgitated). The red salamander (\"Pseudotriton ruber\") is a palatable species with a similar coloring to the red eft. Predators that previously fed on it have been shown to avoid it after encountering red efts, an example of Batesian mimicry. Other species exhibit similar mimicry. In California, the palatable yellow-eyed salamander (\"Ensatina eschscholtzii\") closely resembles the toxic California newt (\"Taricha torosa\") and the rough-skinned newt (\"Taricha granulosa\"), whereas in other parts of its range, it is cryptically colored. A correlation exists between the toxicity of Californian salamander species and diurnal habits: relatively harmless species like the California slender salamander (\"Batrachoseps attenuatus\") are nocturnal and are eaten by snakes, while the California newt has many large poison glands in its skin, is diurnal, and is avoided by snakes.\nAutotomy.\nSome salamander species use tail autotomy to escape predators. The tail drops off and wriggles around for a while after an attack, and the salamander either runs away or stays still enough not to be noticed while the predator is distracted. The tail regrows with time, and salamanders routinely regenerate other complex tissues, including the lens or retina of the eye. Within only a few weeks of losing a piece of a limb, a salamander perfectly reforms the missing structure.\nDistribution and habitat.\nSalamanders split off from the other amphibians during the mid- to late Permian, and initially were similar to modern members of the Cryptobranchoidea. Their resemblance to lizards is the result of symplesiomorphy, their common retention of the primitive tetrapod body plan, but they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals. Their nearest relatives are the frogs and toads, within Batrachia. \nThe oldest known total-group (Caudata) salamander is \"Triassurus\" from the Triassic of Kyrgyzstan. Further salamander fossils are known from the Middle Jurassic of England, Scotland, China, and Kazakhstan. The oldest known crown-group salamander (Urodela) remains uncertain but recent analyses suggest it is \"Valdotriton\" from the Late Jurassic of Spain.\nSalamanders are found only in the Holarctic and Neotropical regions, not reaching south of the Mediterranean Basin, the Himalayas, or in South America the Amazon Basin. They do not extend north of the Arctic tree line, with the northernmost Asian species, \"Salamandrella keyserlingii\", which can survive long-term freezing at \u221255 \u00b0C, occurring in the Siberian larch forests of Sakha and the most northerly species in North America, \"Ambystoma laterale\", reaching no farther north than Labrador and \"Taricha granulosa\" not beyond the Alaska Panhandle. They had an exclusively Laurasian distribution until \"Bolitoglossa\" invaded South America from Central America, probably by the start of the Early Miocene, about 23 million years ago. They also lived on the Caribbean Islands during the early Miocene epoch, confirmed by the discovery of \"Palaeoplethodon hispaniolae\", found trapped in amber in the Dominican Republic. Vertebrae fossils recovered from the Murgon fossil site have been tentatively attributed to that of a salamander, though its true identity is disputed. If the vertebrae truly belong to a salamander, they would represent the only salamanders in Australia.\nThere are about 760 living species of salamander. One-third of the known salamander species are found in North America. The highest concentration of these is found in the Appalachian Mountains region, where the Plethodontidae are thought to have originated in mountain streams. Here, vegetation zones and proximity to water are of greater importance than altitude. Only species that adopted a more terrestrial mode of life have been able to disperse to other localities. The northern slimy salamander (\"Plethodon glutinosus\") has a wide range and occupies a habitat similar to that of the southern gray-cheeked salamander (\"Plethodon metcalfi\"). The latter is restricted to the slightly cooler and wetter conditions in north-facing cove forests in the southern Appalachians, and to higher elevations above 900\u00a0m (3,000\u00a0ft), while the former is more adaptable, and would be perfectly able to inhabit these locations, but some unknown factor seems to prevent the two species from co-existing.\nOne species, the Anderson's salamander, is one of the few species of living amphibians to occur in brackish or salt water.\nReproduction and development.\nMany salamanders do not use vocalisations, and in most species the sexes look alike, so they use olfactory and tactile cues to identify potential mates, and sexual selection occurs. Pheromones play an important part in the process and may be produced by the abdominal gland in males and by the cloacal glands and skin in both sexes. Males are sometimes to be seen investigating potential mates with their snouts. In Old World newts, \"Triturus\" spp., the males are sexually dimorphic and display in front of the females. Visual cues are also thought to be important in some plethodont species.\nExcept for terrestrial species in the three families Plethodontidae, Ambystomatidae, and Salamandridae, salamanders mate in water. The mating varies from courtship between a single male and female to explosive group breeding. In the clade Salamandroidea, which makes up about 90% of all species, fertilization is internal. As a general rule, salamanders with internal fertilization have indirect sperm transfer, but in species like the Sardinian brook salamander, the Corsican brook salamander, the Caucasian salamander and the Pyrenean brook salamander, the male transfers his sperm directly into the female cloaca. For the species with indirect sperm transfer, the male deposits a spermatophore on the ground or in the water according to species, and the female picks this up with her vent. The spermatophore has a packet of sperm supported on a conical gelatinous base, and often an elaborate courtship behavior is involved in its deposition and collection. Once inside the cloaca, the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca, one or more chambers in the roof of the cloaca, where they are stored for sometimes lengthy periods until the eggs are laid. In the Asiatic salamanders, the giant salamanders and Sirenidae, which are the most primitive groups, the fertilization is external. In a reproductive process similar to that of typical frogs, the male releases sperm onto the egg mass. These salamanders also have males that exhibit parental care, which otherwise only occur in females with internal fertilization.\nThree different types of egg deposition occur. \"Ambystoma\" and \"Taricha\" spp. spawn large numbers of small eggs in quiet ponds where many large predators are unlikely. Most dusky salamanders (\"Desmognathus\") and Pacific giant salamanders (\"Dicamptodon\") lay smaller batches of medium-sized eggs in a concealed site in flowing water, and these are usually guarded by an adult, normally the female. Many of the tropical climbing salamanders (\"Bolitoglossa\") and lungless salamanders (Plethodontinae) lay a small number of large eggs on land in a well-hidden spot, where they are also guarded by the mother. Some species such as the fire salamanders (\"Salamandra\") are ovoviviparous, with the female retaining the eggs inside her body until they hatch, either into larvae to be deposited in a water body, or into fully formed juveniles.\nIn temperate regions, reproduction is usually seasonal and salamanders may migrate to breeding grounds. Males usually arrive first and in some instances set up territories. Typically, a larval stage follows in which the organism is fully aquatic. The tadpole has three pairs of external gills, no eyelids, a long body, a laterally flattened tail with dorsal and ventral fins and in some species limb-buds or limbs. Pond-type larvae may have a pair of rod-like balancers on either side of the head, long gill filaments and broad fins. Stream-type larvae are more slender with short gill filaments\u2014in \"Rhyacotriton\" and \"Onychodactylus\", and some species in \"Batrachuperus\", the gills and gill rakers are extremely reduced, narrower fins and no balancers, but instead have hind limbs already developed when they hatch. The tadpoles are carnivorous and the larval stage may last from days to years, depending on species. Sometimes this stage is completely bypassed, and the eggs of most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae) develop directly into miniature versions of the adult without an intervening larval stage.\nBy the end of the larval stage, the tadpoles already have limbs and metamorphosis takes place normally. In salamanders, this occurs over a short period of time and involves the closing of the gill slits and the loss of structures such as gills and tail fins that are not required as adults. At the same time, eyelids develop, the mouth becomes wider, a tongue appears, and teeth are formed. The aqueous larva emerges onto land as a terrestrial adult.\nNot all species of salamanders follow this path. Neoteny, also known as paedomorphosis, has been observed in all salamander families, and may be universally possible in all salamander species. In this state, an individual may retain gills or other juvenile features while attaining reproductive maturity. The changes that take place at metamorphosis are under the control of thyroid hormones and in obligate neotenes such as the axolotl (\"Ambystoma mexicanum\"), the tissues are seemingly unresponsive to the hormones. In other species, the changes may not be triggered because of underactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid mechanism which may occur when conditions in the terrestrial environment are too inhospitable. This may be due to cold or wildly fluctuating temperatures, aridity, lack of food, lack of cover, or insufficient iodine for the formation of thyroid hormones. Genetics may also play a part. The larvae of tiger salamanders (\"Ambystoma tigrinum\"), for example, develop limbs soon after hatching and in seasonal pools promptly undergo metamorphosis. Other larvae, especially in permanent pools and warmer climates, may not undergo metamorphosis until fully adult in size. Other populations in colder climates may not metamorphose at all, and become sexually mature while in their larval forms. Neoteny allows the species to survive even when the terrestrial environment is too harsh for the adults to thrive on land.\nConservation.\nA general decline in living amphibian species has been linked with the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. A higher proportion of salamander species than of frogs or caecilians are in one of the at-risk categories established by the IUCN. Salamanders showed a significant diminution in numbers in the last few decades of the 20th century, although no direct link between the fungus and the population decline has yet been found. The IUCN made further efforts in 2005 as they established the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ACAP), which was subsequently followed by Amphibian Ark (AArk), Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG), and finally the umbrella organization known as the Amphibian Survival Alliance (ASA). Researchers also cite deforestation, resulting in fragmentation of suitable habitats, and climate change as possible contributory factors. Species such as \"Pseudoeurycea brunnata\" and \"Pseudoeurycea goebeli\" that had been abundant in the cloud forests of Guatemala and Mexico during the 1970s were found by 2009 to be rare. Few data have been gathered on population sizes over the years and, by intensive surveying of historic and suitable new locations, it has been possible to locate individuals of other species, such as \"Parvimolge townsendi\", which had been thought to be extinct. Currently, the major lines of defense for the conservation of salamanders includes both in situ and ex situ conservation methods. There are efforts in place for certain members of the salamander family to be conserved under a conservation breeding program (CBP) but there should be research done ahead of time to determine if the salamander species is actually going to value from the CBP, as researchers have noted that some species of amphibians completely fail in this environment.\nVarious conservation initiatives are being attempted around the world. The Chinese giant salamander, at 1.8\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft) the largest amphibian in the world, is critically endangered, as it is collected for food and for use in traditional Chinese medicine. An environmental education programme is being undertaken to encourage sustainable management of wild populations in the Qinling Mountains and captive breeding programmes have been set up. The hellbender is another large, long-lived species with dwindling numbers and fewer juveniles reaching maturity than previously. Another alarming finding is the increase in abnormalities in up to 90% of the hellbender population in the Spring River watershed in Arkansas. Habitat loss, silting of streams, pollution and disease have all been implicated in the decline and a captive breeding programme at Saint Louis Zoo has been successfully established. Of the 20 species of minute salamanders (\"Thorius\" spp.) in Mexico, half are believed to have become extinct and most of the others are critically endangered. Specific reasons for the decline may include climate change, chytridiomycosis, or volcanic activity, but the main threat is habitat destruction as logging, agricultural activities, and human settlement reduce their often tiny, fragmented ranges. Survey work is being undertaken to assess the status of these salamanders, and to better understand the factors involved in their population declines, with a view to taking action.\n\"Ambystoma mexicanum\", an aquatic salamander, is a species protected under the Mexican UMA (Unit for Management and conservation of wildlife) as of April 1994. Another detrimental factor is that the axolotl lost their role as a top predator since the introduction of locally exotic species such as Nile tilapia and carp. Tilapia and carp directly compete with axolotls by consuming their eggs, larvae, and juveniles. Climate change has also immensely affected axolotls and their populations throughout the southern Mexico area. Due to its proximity to Mexico City, officials are currently working on programs at Lake Xochimilco to bring in tourism and educate the local population on the restoration of the natural habitat of these creatures. This proximity is a large factor that has impacted the survival of the axolotl, as the city has expanded to take over the Xochimilco region in order to make use of its resources for water and provision and sewage. It is farmed for use in research facilities and so may one day return to its natural habitat. The recent decline in population has substantially impacted genetic diversity among populations, making it difficult to further progress scientifically. Some genetic indiversity due to paedeomorphism in \"Ambystoma\" species such as the axolotl does not account for the overall lack of diversity. Evidence points toward a historical bottlenecking of \"Ambystoma\" that contributes to the variation issues and no longer a large genetic pool for it to pull from, thus raising concern for inbreeding due to lack of gene flow. One way researchers are looking into maintaining genetic diversity within the population is via cryopreservation of the spermatophores from the male axolotl. It is a safe and non-invasive method that requires the collection of the spermatophores and places them into a deep freeze for preservation. Most importantly, they have found that there is only limited damage done to the spermatophores upon thawing and thus it is a viable option. As of 2013, it is a method that is being used to save not only the axolotl but also numerous other members of the salamander family.\nResearch is being done on the environmental cues that have to be replicated before captive animals can be persuaded to breed. Common species such as the tiger salamander and the mudpuppy are being given hormones to stimulate the production of sperm and eggs, and the role of arginine vasotocin in courtship behaviour is being investigated. Another line of research is artificial insemination, either \"in vitro\" or by inserting spermatophores into the cloacae of females. The results of this research may be used in captive-breeding programmes for endangered species.\nTaxonomy.\nThe order name Urodela comes from the name Urod\u00e8les given by Andr\u00e9 Marie Constant Dum\u00e9ril in 1805, it is derived from the Greek words \"our\u0101\u0301\" \"tail\" and \"d\u0113los\" \"visible, conspicuous\" because of their \"persistent\" tails.\nDisagreement exists among different authorities as to the definition of the terms Caudata and Urodela. Some maintain that the Urodela should be restricted to the crown group, with the Caudata being used for the total group. Others restrict the name Caudata to the crown group and use Urodela for the total group. The former approach seems to be most widely adopted and is used in this article.\nThe ten families belonging to Urodela are divided into three suborders. The clade Neocaudata is often used to separate the Cryptobranchoidea and Salamandroidea from the Sirenoidea.\nPhylogeny and evolution.\nThe origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians (gymnophionans, urodeles and anurans) is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on rDNA analysis, suggested that the first divergence between these three groups took place soon after they had branched from the lobe-finned fish in the Devonian (around 360 million years ago), and before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. The briefness of this period, and the speed at which radiation took place, may help to account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils that appear to be closely related to lissamphibians. More recent studies generally find more recent (Late Carboniferous to Permian) age for the basalmost divergence among lissamphibians.\nThe earliest known salamander-line lissamphibian is \"Triassurus\" from the Middle-Late Triassic of Kyrgyzstan. Other fossil salamanders are known from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Eurasia, including \"Kokartus honorarius\" from the Middle Jurassic of Kyrgyzstan, two species of the apparently neotenic, aquatic \"Marmorerpeton\" from the Middle Jurassic of England and Scotland, and \"Karaurus\" from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Kazakhstan, resembled modern mole salamanders in morphology and probably had a similar burrowing lifestyle. They looked like robust modern salamanders but lacked a number of anatomical features that characterise all modern salamanders.\nThe two groups of extant salamanders are the Cryptobranchoidea (which includes Asiatic and giant salamanders) and the Salamandroidea (which includes all other living salamanders), also known as Diadectosalamandroidei. Both groups are known from the Middle-Late Jurassic of China. the former being exemplified by \"Chunerpeton tianyiensis\", \"Pangerpeton sinensis\", \"Jeholotriton paradoxus\", \"Regalerpeton weichangensis\", \"Liaoxitriton daohugouensis\" and \"Iridotriton hechti\", and the latter by \"Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis\". By the Upper Cretaceous, most or all of the living salamander families had probably appeared.\nThe following cladogram shows the relationships between salamander families based on the molecular analysis of Pyron and Wiens (2011). The position of the Sirenidae is disputed, but the position as sister to the Salamandroidea best fits with the molecular and fossil evidence.\nGenome and genetics.\nSalamanders possess gigantic genomes, spanning 14 Gb to 120 Gb (the human genome is 3.2 Gb long). The genomes of \"Pleurodeles waltl\" (20 Gb) and \"Ambystoma mexicanum\" (32 Gb) have been sequenced.\nTheir giant genomes have strongly affected their physiology. This includes their skeletal and circulatory systems, and have led to a simplified brain, weak heart and slow metabolism. The cell mechanisms that prevent transposons from accumulating seem to be partially defect in salamanders. Some species with the largest genomes have lost the ability to go through metamorphosis. The development and growth of their body is slower when compared to that of their ancestors, and stops at a certain age, leaving them with embryonic traits. The salamander's tissues contain cells that differentiate slowly, weakly, or not at all, due to intron delay. This gives them regenerative properties, notably in parts of the face, eyes, lungs, liver, heart, and even the spinal cord and brain. As such, they have been described as \"walking bags of stem cells\". Research has also shown that they do not develop typical signs of aging and do not accumulate age-related diseases like cancer.\nIn human society.\nMyth and legend.\nLegends have developed around the salamander over the centuries, many related to fire. This connection likely originates from the tendency of many salamanders to dwell inside rotting logs or firewood. When the log was placed into a fire, the salamander would attempt to escape, lending credence to the belief that salamanders were created from flames.\nThe association of the salamander with fire appeared first in Antiquity with Aristotle (\"History of Animals\" 5, 17) and with Pliny the Elder writing in his \"Natural History \" (10, 86) that \"A salamander is so cold that it puts out fire on contact. It vomits from its mouth a milky liquid; if this liquid touches any part of the human body, it causes all the hair to fall off, and the skin to change color and break out in a rash.\" The ability to put out fire is repeated by Saint Augustine in the fifth century and Isidore of Seville in the seventh century.\nThe mythical ruler Prester John supposedly had a robe made from alleged salamander hair, in fact asbestos fibre, already known by ancient Greece and Rome (the \"linum vivum\" of Pliny the Elder \"Naturalis historia\", 19, 4). The \"Emperor of India\" possessed a suit made from a thousand skins; Pope Alexander III had a tunic which he valued highly and William Caxton (1481) wrote: \"This Salemandre berithe wulle, of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not brenne in the fyre.\" The salamander was said to be so toxic that by twining around a tree, it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well, could kill all who drank from it.\nWealthy Persians amazed guests by cleaning a cloth by exposing it to fire. For example, according to Tabari, one of the curious items belonging to Khosrow II Parviz, the great Sassanian king (r. 590\u2013628), was a napkin () that he cleaned simply by throwing it into fire. Such cloth is believed to have been made of asbestos imported over the Hindu Kush. According to Biruni in his book \"Gems\", any cloths made of asbestos (, \"\u0101zarshost\") were called \"shostakeh\" (). Some Persians believed the fiber was the fur of an animal called the \"samandar\" (), which lived in fire and died when exposed to water; this may be where the belief originated that the salamander could tolerate fire. Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor (800\u2013814), is also said to have possessed such a tablecloth.\nMarco Polo recounts having been shown, in a place he calls \"Ghinghin talas\", \"a good vein from which the cloth which we call of salamander, which cannot be burnt if it is thrown into the fire, is made\u00a0...\"\nIn his autobiography, Benvenuto Cellini relates:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I was about five, my father was sitting alone in one of our small rooms, singing and playing his viol. Some washing had just been done there and a good log fire was still burning. It was very cold, and he had drawn near the fire. Then, as he was looking at the flames, his eye fell on a little animal, like a lizard, that was running around merrily in the very hottest part of the fire. Suddenly realizing what it was, he called my sister and myself and showed it to us. And then he gave me such a violent box on the ears that I screamed and burst into tears. At this he calmed me as kindly as he could and said: 'My dear little boy, I didn't hit you because you had done wrong. I only did it so that you will never forget that the lizard you saw in the fire is a salamander, and as far as we know for certain no one has ever seen one before.'\nThe Japanese giant salamander has been the subject of legend and artwork in Japan (e.g. the \"ukiyo-e\" work by Utagawa Kuniyoshi). The well-known Japanese mythological creature known as the \"kappa\" may be inspired by this salamander.\nMedical research.\nSalamanders' limb regeneration has long been the focus of interest among scientists. The first extensive cell-level study was by Vincenzo Colucci in 1886. Researchers have been trying to find out the conditions required for the growth of new limbs and hope that such regeneration could be replicated in humans using stem cells. Axolotls have been used in research and have been genetically engineered so that a fluorescent protein is present in cells in the leg, enabling the cell division process to be tracked under the microscope. It seems that after the loss of a limb, cells draw together to form a clump known as a blastema. This superficially appears undifferentiated, but cells that originated in the skin later develop into new skin, muscle cells into new muscle and cartilage cells into new cartilage. It is only the cells from just beneath the surface of the skin that are pluripotent and able to develop into any type of cell. Researchers from the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute have found that when macrophages were removed, salamanders lost their ability to regenerate and instead formed scar tissue. If the processes involved in forming new tissue can be reverse engineered into humans, it may be possible to heal injuries of the spinal cord or brain, repair damaged organs and reduce scarring and fibrosis after surgery.\nThe spotted salamander (\"Amblystoma maculatum\") lives in a symbiotic relationship with a green algae known as \"Oophila amblystomatis\". The algal cells make their way into tissue cells throughout the embryo's body and appears to avoid rejection by activating genes which suppress the embryo's immune response. A mechanism that could be used in treatment for autoimmune diseases in humans.\nBrandy.\nA 1995 article in the Slovenian weekly magazine \"Mladina\" publicized salamander brandy, a liquor supposedly indigenous to Slovenia. It was said to combine hallucinogenic with aphrodisiac effects and is made by putting several live salamanders in a barrel of fermenting fruit. Stimulated by the alcohol, they secrete toxic mucus in defense and eventually die. Besides causing hallucinations, the neurotoxins present in the brew were said to cause extreme sexual arousal.\nLater research by Slovenian anthropologist Miha Kozorog (University of Ljubljana) paints a very different picture\u2014Salamander in brandy appears to have been traditionally seen as an adulterant, one which caused ill health. It was also used as a term of slander.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This approach is termed as an \"actor-centric\" definition which emphasizes the characteristics of the groups or individuals who use terrorism; whilst act-centric definitions emphasize the unique aspects of terrorism from other acts of violence. Historically, the term terrorism was used to refer to actions taken by governments against their own citizens whereas now it is more often perceived as targeting of non-combatants as part of a strategy directed \"against\" governments.\nHistorian Henry Steele Commager wrote that \"Even when definitions of terrorism allow for 'state terrorism', state actions in this area tend to be seen through the prism of war or national self-defense, not terror.\" Most states use the term \"terrorism\" for non-state actors only.\nThe \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online\" defines terrorism generally as \"the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective\", and states that \"terrorism is not legally defined in all jurisdictions\". The encyclopedia adds that \"[e]stablishment terrorism, often called state or state-sponsored terrorism, is employed by governments\u2014or more often by factions within governments\u2014against that government's citizens, against factions within the government, or against foreign governments or groups.\"\nWhile the most common modern usage of the word \"terrorism\" refers to political violence by insurgents or conspirators, several scholars make a broader interpretation of the nature of terrorism that encompasses the concepts of state terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism. Michael Stohl argues, \"The use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.\"[] Stohl clarifies, however, that \"[n]ot all acts of state violence are terrorism. It is important to understand that in terrorism the violence threatened or perpetrated, has purposes broader than simple physical harm to a victim. The audience of the act or threat of violence is more important than the immediate victim.\"\nScholar Gus Martin describes state terrorism as terrorism \"committed by governments and quasi-governmental agencies and personnel against perceived threats\", which can be directed against both domestic and foreign targets. Noam Chomsky defines state terrorism as \"terrorism practised by states (or governments) and their agents and allies\".\nSimon Taylor provides a definition of state terrorism as \"state agents using threats or acts of violence against civilians, marked by a callous indifference to human life, to instill fear in a community beyond the initial victim for the purpose of preventing a change or challenge to the status quo.\" These acts of violence can include both the types of state violence that some argue ought to be considered terrorism, such as: genocide, mass murders, ethnic cleansing, disappearances, detention without trial, and torture; and more widely accepted methods of terror including bombings and targeted killings.\nStohl and George A. Lopez have designated three categories of state terrorism, based on the openness or secrecy with which the acts are performed, and whether states directly perform the acts, support them, or acquiesce to them.\nHistory.\nAristotle wrote critically of terror employed by tyrants against their subjects. The earliest use of the word \"terrorism\" identified by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is a 1795 reference to tyrannical state behavior, the \"reign of terrorism\" in France. In that same year, Edmund Burke decried the \"thousands of those hell-hounds called terrorists\" who he believed threatened Europe. During the Reign of Terror, the Jacobin government and other factions of the French Revolution used the apparatus of the state to kill and intimidate political opponents, and the Oxford English Dictionary includes as one definition of terrorism \"Government by intimidation carried out by the party in power in France between 1789\u20131794\". The original general meaning of terrorism was of terrorism by the state, as reflected in the 1798 supplement of the Dictionnaire of the , which described terrorism as , . Myra Williamson wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The meaning of \"terrorism\" has undergone a transformation. During the Reign of Terror, a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary \"state\" against the enemies of the people. Now the term \"terrorism\" is commonly used to describe terrorist acts committed by \"non-state or sub-national entities\" against a state. [italics in original]\nLater examples of state terrorism include the police state measures employed by the Soviet Union beginning in the 1930s, and by Germany's Nazi regime in the 1930s and 1940s. According to Igor Primoratz, \"Both [the Nazis and the Soviets] sought to impose total political control on society. Such a radical aim could be pursued only by a similarly radical method: by terrorism directed by an extremely powerful political police at an atomized and defenseless population. Its success was due largely to its arbitrary character\u2014to the unpredictability of its choice of victims. In both countries, the regime first suppressed all opposition; when it no longer had any opposition to speak of, political police took to persecuting 'potential' and 'objective opponents'. In the Soviet Union, it was eventually unleashed on victims chosen at random.\"\nMilitary actions primarily directed against non-combatant targets have also been referred to as state terrorism. For example, the bombing of Guernica has been called an act of terrorism. Other examples of state terrorism may include the World War II bombings of Pearl Harbor, London, Dresden, Chongqing, and Hiroshima.\nAn act of sabotage, sometimes regarded as an act of terrorism, was the peacetime sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, a ship owned by Greenpeace, which occurred while in port at Auckland, New Zealand on July 10, 1985. The bomb detonation killed Fernando Pereira, a Dutch photographer. The organisation who committed the attack, the Directorate-General for External Security (DSGE), is a branch of France's intelligence services. The agents responsible pleaded guilty to manslaughter as part of a plea deal and were sentenced to ten years in prison, but were secretly released early to France under an agreement between the two countries' governments.\nDuring the Troubles, an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland from the 1960s to the 1990s, the Military Reaction Force (MRF), a counterinsurgency unit of the British Intelligence Corps, was tasked with tracking down members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). During the period when it was active, the MRF was involved in the killings of Catholic civilians in Northern Ireland.\nIn November 2013, a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary was aired about the MRF. It drew on information from seven former members, as well as a number of other sources. Soldier H said: \"We operated initially with them thinking that we were the UVF.\" Soldier F added: \"We wanted to cause confusion.\" In June 1972, he was succeeded as commander by Captain James 'Hamish' McGregor.\nIn June 2014, in the wake of the Panorama programme, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) opened an investigation into the matter. In an earlier review of the programme, the position of the PSNI was that none of the statements by soldiers in the programme could be taken as an admission of criminality.\nBy country.\nArgentina.\nThe Dirty War is the name used for the period of state terrorism in Argentina between 1974 and 1983.\nChile.\nChile during Augusto Pinochet's rule was accused of state terror against political opponents.\nChina.\nThe Uyghur American Association has claimed that Beijing's approach to terrorism in Xinjiang constitutes state terrorism. In 2006, a Spanish court opened an investigation into claims that the Chinese state was committing acts of state terrorism in Tibet. However, the investigation was dropped in 2014.\nFrance.\nDuring the \"\u00c8re des attentats\" ('Era of Attacks'), a period of conflict between anarchists and the French state, the latter committed false flags attacks to legitimize repression on anarchists; one of those attacks being probably the Foyot bombing.\nFrench DGSE agents Captain Dominique Prieur and Commander Alain Mafart sank the \"Rainbow Warrior\", the flagship of the Greenpeace Organisation, in Auckland Harbour on July 10, 1985. The attack was aimed at stopping it from interfering in French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The attack resulted in the death of Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira and led to a huge uproar over the first ever attack on New Zealand's sovereignty as a modern nation. In July 1986, a United Nations-sponsored mediation effort between New Zealand and France resulted in the transfer of the two prisoners to the French Polynesian island of Hao, so they could serve three years there, as well as an apology and an NZ$13 million payment from France to New Zealand.\nIsrael.\nIn November 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan accused Israel of being \"a terrorist state\" committing war crimes and violating international law in the Gaza Strip. He said Israeli settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories should be recognized as \"terrorists\".\nIn December 2023, First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel condemned the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and called Israel a \"terrorist state\".\nThe 2024 Lebanon pager explosions, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,500, have been widely attributed to Israel. Iran referred to the attacks as \"Israeli terrorism\". Leon Panetta, the former-CIA director, also termed the attack terrorism.\nLibya.\nIn the 1980s, Libya under Muammar Gaddafi was accused of state terrorism following attacks abroad such as the Lockerbie bombing. Between 9 July and 15 August 1984 seventeen merchant vessels were damaged in the Gulf of Suez and Bab al-Mandeb straits by underwater explosions. Terrorist group Al Jihad (thought to be a pro-Iranian Shiite group connected to the Palestine Liberation Organisation) issued a claim of responsibility for the mining, but circumstantial evidence indicated that Libya was responsible.\nMyanmar.\nMyanmar has been accused of state terrorism in the internal conflict.\nNorth Korea.\nNorth Korea has been accused of state terrorism on several occasions, such as in 1983 in the Rangoon bombing, the Gimpo International Airport bombing, and in 1987 when North Korean agents detonated a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, killing everybody aboard.\nRussia.\nDuring the \"\u00c8re des attentats\", a period of conflict between anarchists and the French state, the Foyot bombing was either done by the French police or by the Russian Empire's secret police, the Okhrana, which would have sought to provoke troubles in France.\nFollowing the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the initial investigations into war crimes committed by Russian soldiers, there were calls for Russia to be designated a terrorist state. On May 10, 2022, Lithuania's parliament designated Russia a terrorist state and its actions in Ukraine a genocide. The US Senate unanimously passed a resolution to this effect on July 27, 2022, and the US House of Representatives is to consider such legislation. On August 11, Latvia's parliament designated Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada on 20 August 2022 also designated Russia as a terrorist state. On October 17, the European Parliament approved a request to debate and vote on a resolution recognizing Russia as a terrorist state, which it did on November 23.\nAs of October 2023, the following states and organizations have designated Russia as terrorist or a sponsor of terrorism:\nSouth Africa.\nBetween 1979 and 1990, the Apartheid government in South Africa operated a branch of the South African Police known as Vlakplaas who routinely used methods of terrorism to support the state in maintaining Apartheid. These methods included the bombing of civilian buildings (COSATU House and Khotso House), and the targeted-killing and assassinations of anti-Apartheid activists.\nIn the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, the former Major-General and Commander of Vlakplaas, Sarel \u201cSakkie\u201d du Plessis Crafford gave the following three reasons for the Apartheid state's policy of extra-judicial killings:\nThe most notorious of the Vlakplaas operatives were Eugene de Kock and the askari Joe Mamasela, who were linked to several high-profile extra-judicial killings, including that of Griffiths Mxenge. Following South Africa's transition to democracy, de Kock was later tried and convicted on eighty-nine charges and sentenced to 212 years in prison.\nUnited Kingdom.\nDuring World War II, the United Kingdom created the Special Operations Executive (SOE) which, in the words of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was to \"set Europe ablaze\"\nwith sabotage and subversion in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. The British military historian John Keegan later wrote, \"We must recognise that our response to the scourge of terrorism is compromised by what we did through SOE. The justification\u00a0... That we had no other means of striking back at the enemy\u00a0... is exactly the argument used by the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhoff gang, the PFLP, the IRA and every other half-articulate terrorist organisation on Earth. Futile to argue that we were a democracy and Hitler a tyrant. Means besmirch ends. SOE besmirched Britain.\"\nBritish Foreign Office documents declassified in 2021 revealed that during the Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366, British propagandists secretly incited anti-communists including army generals to eliminate the PKI, and used black propaganda, due to Indonesian President Sukarno's hostility to the formation of former British colonies into the Malayan federation from 1963. British Prime Minister Harold Wilson's government had instructed propaganda specialists from the Foreign Office to send hundreds of inflammatory pamphlets to leading anti-communists in Indonesia, inciting them to kill the foreign minister, Subandrio, and claiming that ethnic Chinese Indonesians deserved the violence meted out to them.\nBritain has been accused of involvement in state terrorism during the Troubles, an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland from the 1960s to the 1990s by covertly assisting loyalist paramilitaries.\nUnited States.\nRuth J. Blakeley, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Sheffield, accuses the United States of sponsoring and deploying state terrorism, which she defines as \"the illegal targeting of individuals that the state has a duty to protect in order to instill fear in a target audience beyond the direct victim\", on an \"enormous scale\" during the Cold War. The United States government justified this policy by saying it needed to contain the spread of Communism, but Blakeley says the United States government also used it as a means to buttress and promote the interests of U.S. elites and multinational corporations. The U.S. supported governments who employed death squads throughout Latin America and counterinsurgency training of right-wing military forces included advocating the interrogation and torture of suspected insurgents. J. Patrice McSherry, a professor of political science at Long Island University, says \"hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans were tortured, abducted or killed by right-wing military regimes as part of the U.S.-led anti-communist crusade\", which included U.S. support for Operation Condor and the Guatemalan military during the Guatemalan Civil War. John Henry Coatsworth, citing evidence provided by Freedom House, asserts that more people were repressed and killed throughout Latin America in the last three decades of the Cold War than in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.\nDeclassified documents from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta in 2017 confirm that U.S. officials directly facilitated and encouraged the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists in Indonesia during the mid-1960s. Bradley Simpson, Director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, says \"Washington did everything in its power to encourage and facilitate the army-led massacre of alleged PKI members, and U.S. officials worried only that the killing of the party's unarmed supporters might not go far enough, permitting Sukarno to return to power and frustrate the [Johnson] Administration's emerging plans for a post-Sukarno Indonesia.\" According to Simpson, the terror in Indonesia was an \"essential building block of the quasi neo-liberal policies the West would attempt to impose on Indonesia in the years to come\". Historian John Roosa, who commented on documents which were released by the U.S. embassy in Jakarta in 2017, said they confirmed that \"the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI.\" Geoffrey B. Robinson, a historian at UCLA, argues that without the support of the U.S. and other powerful Western states, the Indonesian Army's program of mass killings would not have happened.\nVenezuela.\nAn Organization of American States report on human rights violations in Venezuela stated that , armed groups that support Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) party, murdered at least 131 individuals between 2014 and 2017 during anti-government protests.\nThe National Assembly of Venezuela designated the as terrorist groups due to their \"violence, paramilitary actions, intimidation, murders and other crimes\", declaring their acts as state-sponsored terrorism.\nCasualties.\nState terrorism, with its institutionalized instrumentation of terrorist atrocities through massacres, genocides, forced disappearances, carpet bombings, torture and sponsorship of death squads, is a deadlier form of terrorism than non-state terrorism. State terrorism has been far deadlier than non-state terrorism historically. According to R. J. Rummel, governments killed over 260 million people in the 20th century alone. On the other hand, non-state terrorism caused fewer than 1 million deaths in the same period. Studies show that state forces are 3\u20135 times more lethal against civilians than insurgents.\nCriticism of the concept.\nThe chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has said the twelve previous international conventions on terrorism had never referred to state terrorism, which was not an international legal concept, and when states abuse their powers they should be judged against international conventions which deal with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law, rather than international anti-terrorism statutes. In a similar vein, Kofi Annan, at the time the United Nations Secretary-General, said it is \"time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already regulated under international law\". Annan added, \"regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.\"\nDr. Bruce Hoffman has argued that failing to differentiate between state and non-state violence ignores the fact that there is a \"fundamental qualitative difference between the two types of violence\". Hoffman argues that even in war, there are rules and accepted norms of behaviour that prohibit certain types of weapons and tactics and outlaw attacks on specific categories of targets. For instance, rules which are codified in the Geneva and Hague Conventions on warfare prohibit taking civilians as hostages, outlaw reprisals against either civilians or POWs, recognise neutral territory, etc. Hoffman says \"even the most cursory review of terrorist tactics and targets over the past quarter century reveals that terrorists have violated all these rules.\" Hoffman also says that when states transgress these rules of war \"the term 'war crime' is used to describe such acts\".\nWalter Laqueur has said those who argue that state terrorism should be included in studies of terrorism ignore the fact that \"The very existence of a state is based on its monopoly of power. If it were different, states would not have the right, nor would they be in a position, to maintain that minimum of order on which all civilized life rests.\" Calling the concept a \"red herring\", he stated: \"This argument has been used by the terrorists themselves, arguing that there is no difference between their activities and those by governments and states. It has also been employed by some sympathizers, and it rests on the deliberate obfuscation between all kinds of violence...\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nPrevention of terrorism"}

His descendants (including all Kings of Saxony) have since been Catholic.\nOld Saxony.\nThe original Duchy of Saxony comprised the lands of the Saxons in the north-western part of present-day Germany, namely, the contemporary German state of Lower Saxony as well as Westphalia and Western Saxony-Anhalt, not corresponding to the modern German state of Saxony.\nFrankish king Charlemagne conquered Saxony and integrated it into the Carolingian Empire. In the later 9th century, power began to shift from the (Eastern) Frankish king to the local Saxon rulers, resulting in the emergence of the Younger stem duchy.\nSaxony as part of Frankish kingdom(s).\nWith the removal of the Welfs in 1180, the Duchy of Saxony was sharply reduced in territory. Westphalia fell to the archbishop of Cologne, while the Duchy of Brunswick remained with the Welfs. The Ascanian dukes had their base further east, near the Elbe, in what is sometimes called the \"younger Duchy of Saxony\", resulting in the name Saxony moving towards the east. After the division, the counting of the dukes started anew. Though the first Ascanian duke is competingly counted as Bernard III (because of two predecessors of the same name before 1180) or as Bernard I, his successor, Albert I is already usually counted as the first, although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name, Albert the Bear.\nIn the 10th century Emperor Otto I had created the County Palatine of Saxony in the Saale-Unstrut area of southern Saxony. The honour was initially held by a Count of Hessengau, then from the early 11th century by the Counts of Goseck, later by the counts of Sommerschenburg, and still later by the landgraves of Thuringia. When the Wettin landgraves succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony, the two positions merged.\nThe \"Younger\" Saxony: The Duchy and the Electorate.\nThe new dukes replaced the Saxon horse emblem () and introduced their Ascanian family colours and emblem () added by a bendwise crancelin, symbolising the Saxon ducal crown, as new coat-of-arms of Saxony (). The later rulers of the House of Wettin adopted the Ascanian coat-of-arms.\nAfter the division, the counting of the dukes started anew. Though the first Ascanian duke is counted either as Bernard III (because of two predecessors of the same name before 1180) or as Bernard I, his successor, Albert I is counted as the first, although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name, Albert the Bear.\nHouse of Ascania.\nTable of rulers.\nThe male line of the Saxe-Lauenburgish Ascanians was extinguished in 1689, after Julius Francis' death. In spite of having left two daughters to inherit the rights to the duchy, the House of Welf usurped the duchy, preventing the succession of the legitimate heiress, Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, and resucceeded with its Brunswick and Lunenburg-Celle line. In fact, George William, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg was a great-great-grandson of Magnus I through his great-grandmother Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg. His descendants became Monarchs of Great Britain from 1714 on. In 1814, after being deposed by various occupations in the Napoleonic Wars, George III's son, Regent George agreed to pass Saxe-Lauenburg to his Danish cousin in a general territorial realignment at the Congress of Vienna. This cousin was Frederick VI of Denmark, who changed the official colours of Saxe-Lauenburg to red and gold. The duchy changed hands again when, in 1865, Christian IX of Denmark was deposed in Second Schleswig War and resigned by Treaty of Vienna; Saxe-Lauenburg passed to William I of Prussia, to whom the Estates of Saxe-Lauenburg offered the ducal throne. The coat-of-arms of Saxe-Lauenburg was changed to the colours red and silver, with a border in the Prussian colours of black and white. Both duke and estates decided to merge Saxe-Lauenburg into Prussia, as district Duchy of Lauenburg, with effect from 1 July 1876.\nHouse of Wettin.\nThe Ascanian line of Saxe-Wittenberg became extinct with the death of Elector Albert III in 1422, whereafter Emperor Sigismund bestowed the country and electoral dignity upon Margrave Frederick IV of Meissen, who had been a loyal supporter in the Hussite Wars. Late Albert's Ascanian relative Duke Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg protested in vain. Frederick, now one of the seven Prince-electors, was a member of the House of Wettin, which since 1089 had ruled over the adjacent Margraviate of Meissen up the Elbe river, established under Emperor Otto I in 965, and since 1242 also over the Landgraviate of Thuringia. Thus, in 1423, Saxe-Wittenberg, the Margraviate of Meissen and Thuringia were united under one ruler, and the unified territory.\ngradually received the name of (Upper) Saxony (or simply Saxony).\nKingdom of Saxony.\nThe Holy Roman Empire came to an end in 1806. The Elector of Saxony, allied to Napoleon, anticipated its dissolution by becoming the ruler of an independent Kingdom of Saxony in 1806.\nFree state of Saxony.\nFor heads of government of Saxony since 1918, see List of minister-presidents of Saxony.

It postulates that, holding all else equal, the unit price for a particular good or other traded item in a perfectly competitive market, will vary until it settles at the market-clearing price, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied such that an economic equilibrium is achieved for price and quantity transacted. The concept of supply and demand forms the theoretical basis of modern economics. \nIn situations where a firm has market power, its decision on how much output to bring to market influences the market price, in violation of perfect competition. There, a more complicated model should be used; for example, an oligopoly or differentiated-product model. Likewise, where a buyer has market power, models such as monopsony will be more accurate. \nIn macroeconomics, as well, the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model has been used to depict how the quantity of total output and the aggregate price level may be determined in equilibrium.\nGraphical representations.\nSupply schedule.\nA supply schedule, depicted graphically as a supply curve, is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied by producers. Under the assumption of perfect competition, supply is determined by marginal cost: Firms will produce additional output as long as the cost of extra production is less than the market price.\nA rise in the cost of raw materials would decrease supply, shifting the supply curve to the left because at each possible price a smaller quantity would be supplied. This shift may also be thought of as an upwards shift in the supply curve, because the price must rise for producers to supply a given quantity. A fall in production costs would increase supply, shifting the supply curve to the right or down. \nMathematically, a supply curve is represented by a supply function, giving the quantity supplied as a function of its price and as many other variables as desired to better explain quantity supplied. The two most common specifications are:\n1) linear supply function, e.g., the slanted line \nformula_1, and\n2) the constant-elasticity supply function (also called isoelastic or log-log or loglinear supply function), e.g., the smooth curve\nformula_2\nwhich can be rewritten as \nformula_3\nThe concept of a supply curve assumes that firms are perfect competitors, having no influence over the market price. This is because each point on the supply curve answers the question, \"If this firm is faced with this potential price, how much output will it sell?\" If a firm has market power\u2014in violation of the perfect competitor model\u2014its decision on how much output to bring to market influences the market price. Thus the firm is not \"faced with\" any given price, and a more complicated model, e.g., a monopoly or oligopoly or differentiated-product model, should be used.\nEconomists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve shows the total quantity supplied by all firms, so it is the sum of the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price (that is, the individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally).\nEconomists distinguish between short-run and long-run supply curve. \"Short run\" refers to a time period during which one or more inputs are fixed (typically physical capital), and the number of firms in the industry is also fixed (if it is a market supply curve). \"Long run\" refers to a time period during which new firms enter or existing firms exit and all inputs can be adjusted fully to any price change. Long-run supply curves are flatter than short-run counterparts (with quantity more sensitive to price, more elastic supply).\nCommon determinants of supply are:\nDemand schedule.\nA demand schedule, depicted graphically as a demand curve, represents the amount of a certain good that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all other determinants of demand are held constant, such as income, tastes and preferences, and the prices of substitute and complementary goods. Generally, consumers will buy an additional unit as long as the marginal value of the extra unit is more than the market price they pay. According to the law of demand, the demand curve is always downward-sloping, meaning that as the price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.\nMathematically, a demand curve is represented by a demand function, giving the quantity demanded as a function of its price and as many other variables as desired to better explain quantity demanded. The two most common specifications are linear demand, e.g., the slanted line \nformula_4\nand the constant-elasticity demand function (also called isoelastic or log-log or loglinear demand function), e.g., the smooth curve\nformula_5\nwhich can be rewritten as \nformula_6\nAs a matter of historical convention, a demand curve is drawn with price on the vertical \"y\"-axis and demand on the horizontal \"x\"-axis. In keeping with modern convention, a demand curve would instead be drawn with price on the \"x\"-axis and demand on the \"y\"-axis, because price is the independent variable and demand is the variable that is dependent upon price.\nJust as the supply curve parallels the marginal cost curve, the demand curve parallels marginal utility, measured in dollars. Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the opportunity cost determined by the price, that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the \"willingness\" and \"ability\" of a consumer to purchase a given product at a certain time.\nThe demand curve is generally downward-sloping, but for some goods it is upward-sloping. Two such types of goods have been given definitions and names that are in common use: Veblen goods, goods which because of fashion or signalling are more attractive at higher prices, and Giffen goods, which, by virtue of being inferior goods that absorb a large part of a consumer's income (e.g., staples such as the classic example of potatoes in Ireland), may see an increase in quantity demanded when the price rises. The reason the law of demand is violated for Giffen goods is that the rise in the price of the good has a strong income effect, sharply reducing the purchasing power of the consumer so that he switches away from luxury goods to the Giffen good, e.g., when the price of potatoes rises, the Irish peasant can no longer afford meat and eats more potatoes to cover for the lost calories.\nAs with the supply curve, the concept of a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor\u2014that is, that the purchaser have no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve answers the question, \"If buyers are \"faced with\" this potential price, how much of the product will they purchase?\" But, if a buyer has market power (that is, the amount he buys influences the price), he is not \"faced with\" any given price, and we must use a more complicated model, of monopsony.\nAs with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve for an individual and the demand curve for a market. The market demand curve is obtained by adding the quantities from the individual demand curves at each price.\nCommon determinants of demand are:\nHistory of the curves.\nSince supply and demand can be considered as functions of price they have a natural graphical representation. Demand curves were first drawn by Augustin Cournot in his (1838)\u00a0\u2013 see Cournot competition. Supply curves were added by Fleeming Jenkin in \"The Graphical Representation of the Laws of Supply and Demand...\" of 1870. Both sorts of curve were popularized by Alfred Marshall who, in his \"Principles of Economics\" (1890), chose to represent price\u00a0\u2013 normally the independent variable\u00a0\u2013 by the vertical axis; a practice which remains common.\nIf supply or demand is a function of other variables besides price, it may be represented by a family of curves (with a change in the other variables constituting a shift between curves) or by a surface in a higher dimensional space.\nMicroeconomics.\nEquilibrium.\nGenerally speaking, an equilibrium is defined to be the price-quantity pair where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. It is represented by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. The analysis of various equilibria is a fundamental aspect of microeconomics.\nMarket equilibrium.\nA situation in a market when the price is such that the quantity demanded by consumers is correctly balanced by the quantity that firms wish to supply. In this situation, the market clears.\nChanges in market equilibrium.\nPractical uses of supply and demand analysis often center on the different variables that change equilibrium price and quantity, represented as shifts in the respective curves. Comparative statics of such a shift traces the effects from the initial equilibrium to the new equilibrium.\nDemand curve shifts.\nWhen consumers increase the quantity demanded \"at a given price\", it is referred to as an \"increase in demand\". Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve \"D\"1 to the new curve \"D\"2. In the diagram, this raises the equilibrium price from \"P\"1 to the higher \"P\"2. This raises the equilibrium quantity from \"Q\"1 to the higher \"Q\"2. (A movement along the curve is described as a \"change in the quantity demanded\" to distinguish it from a \"change in demand\", that is, a shift of the curve.) The \"increase\" in demand has caused an increase in (equilibrium) quantity. The increase in demand could come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and substitute goods, market expectations, and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the equilibrium price and quantity. Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new equilibrium price to emerge, resulted in \"movement along\" the supply curve from the point (\"Q\"1, \"P\"1) to the point (\"Q\"2, \"P\"2).\nIf the \"demand decreases\", then the opposite happens: a shift of the curve to the left. If the demand starts at \"D\"2, and \"decreases\" to \"D\"1, the equilibrium price will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will also decrease. The quantity supplied at each price is the same as before the demand shift, reflecting the fact that the supply curve has not shifted; but the equilibrium quantity and price are different as a result of the change (shift) in demand.\nSupply curve shifts.\nWhen technological progress occurs, the supply curve shifts. For example, assume that someone invents a better way of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases. Otherwise stated, producers will be willing to supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve \"S\"1 outward, to \"S\"2\u2014an \"increase in supply\". This increase in supply causes the equilibrium price to decrease from \"P\"1 to \"P\"2. The equilibrium quantity increases from \"Q\"1 to \"Q\"2 as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price. As a result of a supply curve shift, the price and the quantity move in opposite directions. If the quantity supplied \"decreases\", the opposite happens. If the supply curve starts at \"S\"2, and shifts leftward to \"S\"1, the equilibrium price will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded. The quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift, reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted. But due to the change (shift) in supply, the equilibrium quantity and price have changed.\nThe movement of the supply curve in response to a change in a non-price determinant of supply is caused by a change in the y-intercept, the constant term of the supply equation. The supply curve shifts up and down the y axis as non-price determinants of demand change.\nPartial equilibrium.\nPartial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.\nJain proposes (attributed to George Stigler): \"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis.\"\nThe supply-and-demand model is a partial equilibrium model of economic equilibrium, where the clearance on the market of some specific goods is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all substitutes and complements, as well as income levels of consumers are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a general equilibrium model which includes an entire economy.\nHere the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study equilibrium, efficiency and comparative statics. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach makes the model considerably more tractable, but may produce results which, while seemingly precise, do not effectively model real world economic\nphenomena.\nPartial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.\nHence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.\nL\u00e9on Walras first formalized the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist Antoine Augustin Cournot and English political economist Alfred Marshall who developed tractable models to analyze an economic system.\nOther markets.\nThe model of supply and demand also applies to various specialty markets.\nThe model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and demander are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell their labor for the highest price. The demanders of labor are businesses, which try to buy the type of labor they need at the lowest price. The equilibrium price for a certain type of labor is the wage rate. However, economist Steve Fleetwood revisited the empirical reality of supply and demand curves in labor markets and concluded that the evidence is \"at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence.\" For instance, he cites Kaufman and Hotchkiss (2006): \"For adult men, nearly all studies find the labour supply curve to be negatively sloped or backward bending.\" Supply and demand can be used to explain physician shortages, nursing shortages or teacher shortages.\nIn both classical and Keynesian economics, the money market is analyzed as a supply-and-demand system with interest rates being the price. The money supply may be a vertical supply curve, if the central bank of a country chooses to use monetary policy to fix its value regardless of the interest rate; in this case the money supply is totally inelastic. On the other hand, the money supply curve is a horizontal line if the central bank is targeting a fixed interest rate and ignoring the value of the money supply; in this case the money supply curve is perfectly elastic. The demand for money intersects with the money supply to determine the interest rate.\nAccording to some studies, the laws of supply and demand are applicable not only to the business relationships of people, but to the behaviour of social animals and to all living things that interact on the biological markets in scarce resource environments.\nThe model of supply and demand accurately describes the characteristic of metabolic systems: specifically, it explains how feedback inhibition allows metabolic pathways to respond to the demand for a metabolic intermediates while minimizing effects due to variation in the supply.\nEmpirical estimation.\nDemand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity, and other data with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with \"simultaneous-equation methods of estimation\" in econometrics. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \"structural coefficients,\" the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The \"Parameter identification problem\" is a common issue in \"structural estimation.\" Typically, data on exogenous variables (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are endogenous variables) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \"structural estimation\" is reduced-form estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.\nMacroeconomic uses.\nDemand and supply have also been generalized to explain macroeconomic variables in a market economy, including the quantity of total output and the aggregate price level. The aggregate demand-aggregate supply model may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to microeconomic uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such macroeconomic counterparts as aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate money supply and money demand to interest rates, and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.\nHistory.\nThe 256th couplet of Tirukkural, which was composed at least 2000 years ago, says: \"If the world desireth not meat for eating, there will be none to offer it for sale.\" This statement can be restated to mean: \"If people do not consume a product or service, then there will not be anybody to supply that product or service for the sake of price.\"\nAccording to Hamid S. Hosseini, the power of supply and demand was understood to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century Syrian scholar Ibn Taymiyyah, who wrote: \"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nShifting focus to the English etymology of the expression, it has been confirmed that the phrase 'supply and demand' was not used by English economics writers until after the end of the 17th century. \nIn John Locke's 1691 work \"Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money\", Locke alluded to the idea of supply and demand, however, he failed to accurately label it as such and thus, he fell short in coining the phrase and conveying its true significance. Locke wrote: \u201cThe price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers\u201d and \u201cthat which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to [the] Vent.\u201d Locke's terminology drew criticism from John Law. Law argued that,\"The Prices of Goods are not according to the quantity in proportion to the Vent, but in proportion to the Demand.\" From Law the demand part of the phrase was given its proper title and it began to circulate among \"prominent authorities\" in the 1730s. In 1755, Francis Hutcheson, in his \"A System of Moral Philosophy\", furthered development toward the phrase by stipulating that, \"the prices of goods depend on these two jointly, the Demand... and the Difficulty of acquiring.\"\nIt was not until 1767 that the phrase \"supply and demand\" was first used by Scottish writer James Denham-Steuart in his \"Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy.\" He originated the use of this phrase by effectively combining \"supply\" and \"demand\" together in a number of different occasions such as price determination and competitive analysis. In Steuart's chapter entitled \"Of Demand\", he argues that \"The nature of Demand is to encourage industry; and when it is regularly made, the effect of it is, that the supply for the most part is found to be in proportion to it, and then the demand is simple\". It is presumably from this chapter that the idea spread to other authors and economic thinkers. Adam Smith used the phrase after Steuart in his 1776 book \"The Wealth of Nations\". In \"The Wealth of Nations\", Smith asserted that the supply price was fixed but that its \"merit\" (value) would decrease as its \"scarcity\" increased, this idea by Smith was later named the law of demand. In 1803, Thomas Robert Malthus used the phrase \"supply and demand\" twenty times in the second edition of the \"Essay on Population\". \nAnd David Ricardo in his 1817 work, \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\", titled one chapter, \"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\". In \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\", Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. In 1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his \"Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth\", it included diagrams. It is important to note that the use of the phrase was still rare and only a few examples of more than 20 uses in a single work have been identified by the end of the second decade of the 19th century.\nDuring the late 19th century the marginalist school of thought emerged. The main innovators of this approach were Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and L\u00e9on Walras. The key idea was that the price was set by the subjective value of a good at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.\nIn his 1870 essay \"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\", Fleeming Jenkin in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves in English, including comparative statics from a shift of supply or demand and application to the labor market. The model was further developed and popularized by Alfred Marshall in the 1890 textbook \"Principles of Economics\".\nCriticism.\nPiero Sraffa's critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good. The notability of Sraffa's critique is also demonstrated by Paul Samuelson's comments and engagements with it over many years, for example:\nWhat a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how \"nearly empty\" are \"all\" of Marshall's partial equilibrium boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the \"Marshallian partial\" equilibrium box of \"constant\" cost is even more empty than the box of \"increasing\" cost.\nModern Post-Keynesians criticize the supply and demand model for failing to explain the prevalence of administered prices, in which retail prices are set by firms, primarily based on a mark-up over normal average unit costs, and are not responsive to changes in demand up to capacity.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The definition can also include the state dominance of corporatized government agencies (agencies organized using business-management practices) or of public companies (such as publicly listed corporations) in which the state has controlling shares. The term has been used as a pejorative by Marxists, liberals and neoliberals. However, it has also served as a programmatic label for developmentalist and neomercantilist projects in reaction to\nimperialism.\nA state-capitalist country is one where the government controls the economy and essentially acts as a single huge corporation, extracting surplus value from the workforce in order to invest it in further production. This designation applies regardless of the political aims of the state, even if the state is nominally socialist. Some scholars argue that the economy of the Soviet Union and of the Eastern Bloc countries modeled after it, including Maoist China, were state capitalist systems, and Eastern and Western commentators alike assert that the current economies of China and Singapore also constitute a mixture of state-capitalism with private capitalism.\nThe label \"state capitalism\" is used by various authors in reference to a private capitalist economy controlled by a state, i.e. a private economy that is subject to economic planning and interventionism. It has also been used to describe the controlled economies of the Great Powers during World War I (1914\u20131918). Alternatively, state capitalism may refer to an economic system where the means of production are privately owned, but the state has considerable control over the allocation of credit and investment. This was the case with Western European countries during the post-war consensus and with France during the period of dirigisme after World War II. Other examples include Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew and Turkey,\nas well as military dictatorships during the Cold War and fascist regimes such as Nazi Germany.\nThe phrase \"state capitalism\" has also come to be used (sometimes interchangeably with \"state monopoly capitalism\") to describe a system where the state intervenes in the economy to protect and advance the interests of large-scale businesses. Noam Chomsky, a libertarian socialist, applies the term \"state capitalism\" to the economy of the United States, where large enterprises that are deemed by \"the powers that be\" as \"too big to fail\" receive publicly-funded government bailouts that mitigate the firms' assumption of risk and undermine market laws, and where private production is largely funded by the state at public expense, but private owners reap the profits. This practice is contrasted with the ideals of both socialism and \"laissez-faire\" capitalism.\nThere are various theories and critiques of state capitalism, some of which existed before the Russian October Revolution of 1917. The common themes among them identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the means of production and that capitalist social relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism, fundamentally retaining the capitalist mode of production. In ' (1880), Friedrich Engels argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself, but rather would be the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and communication by the bourgeois state. He argued that the tools for ending capitalism are found in state capitalism. In \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\" (1916), Lenin claimed that World War I had transformed \"laissez-faire\" capitalism into monopolist state capitalism.\nOrigins and early usage.\nIn \"\" (1880), Friedrich Engels described state ownership, i.e. state capitalism, as follows:\nIf the crisis revealed the incapacity of the bourgeoisie any longer to control the modern productive forces, the conversion of the great organizations for production and communication into joint-stock companies and state property shows that for this purpose the bourgeoisie can be dispensed with. All the social functions of the capitalists are now carried out by salaried employees. The capitalist has no longer any social activity save the pocketing of revenues, the clipping of coupons, and gambling on the stock exchange, where the different capitalists fleece each other of their capital. Just as at first the capitalist mode of production displaced the workers, so now it displaces the capitalists, relegating them to the superfluous population even if not in the first instance to the industrial reserve army.\nEngels argued that the tools for ending capitalism are found in state capitalism, further writing:\nBut neither the conversion into joint stock companies nor into state property deprives the productive forces of their character as capital. In the case of joint-stock companies this is obvious. And the modern state, too, is only the organization with which bourgeois society provides itself in order to maintain the general external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against encroachments either by the workers or by individual capitalists. The modern state, whatever its form, is then the state of the capitalists, the ideal collective body of all the capitalists. The more productive forces it takes over as its property, the more it becomes the real collective body of the capitalists, the more citizens it exploits. The workers remain wage-earners, proletarians. The capitalist relationship isn't abolished; it is rather pushed to the extreme. But at this extreme it is transformed into its opposite. State ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but it contains within itself the formal means, the key to the solution.\nEngels described state capitalism as a new form or variant of capitalism. In 1896, following Engels, the German Social Democrat Wilhelm Liebknecht said: \"Nobody has combated State Socialism more than we German Socialists; nobody has shown more distinctively than I that State Socialism is really State capitalism.\"\nIt has been suggested that the concept of state capitalism can be traced back to Mikhail Bakunin's critique during the First International of the potential for state exploitation under Marxist-inspired socialism, or to Jan Wac\u0142aw Machajski's argument in \"The Intellectual Worker\" (1905) that socialism was a movement of the intelligentsia as a class, resulting in a new type of society he termed \"state capitalism\". For anarchists, state socialism is equivalent to state capitalism, hence oppressive and merely a shift from private capitalists to the state being the sole employer and capitalist.\nIn \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\" and \"Imperialism and World Economy\", both Vladimir Lenin and Nikolai Bukharin, respectively, had similarly identified the growth of state capitalism as one of the main features of capitalism in its imperialist epoch. In \"The State and Revolution\", Lenin wrote that \"the erroneous bourgeois reformist assertion that monopoly capitalism or state-monopoly capitalism is no longer capitalism, but can now be called \"state socialism\" and so on, is very common\". During World War I, using Lenin's idea that tsarism was taking a Prussian path to capitalism, the Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin identified a new stage in the development of capitalism in which all sectors of national production and all important social institutions had become managed by the state\u2014he termed this new stage \"state capitalism\". After the October Revolution, Lenin used the term \"state capitalism\" positively. In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of war communism and again during the New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the dictatorship of the proletariat to further central control and develop the productive forces, making the following point:\nReality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward. If in a small space of time we could achieve state capitalism, that would be a victory.\nLenin argued the state should temporarily run the economy which would eventually be taken over by workers. To Lenin, \"state capitalism\" did not mean the state would run most of the economy, but that state capitalism would be one of five elements of the economy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months' time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold.\nBy the left.\nAs a term and concept, state capitalism has been used by various socialists, including anarchists, Marxists, Leninists, left communists, Marxist\u2013Leninists and Trotskyists.\nAnarchists.\nPerhaps the earliest critique of the Soviet Union as state capitalist was formulated by the Russian anarchists as documented in Paul Avrich's work on Russian anarchism.\nThe Russian anarchists' claim would become standard in anarchist works. Of the Soviet Union, the prominent anarchist Emma Goldman wrote an article from 1935 titled \"There Is No Communism in Russia\" in which she argued:\nSuch a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically.\nWhen speaking about Marxism, Murray Bookchin said the following:\nMarxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement \u2014 notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described 'socialism' as 'nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people'. This is an extraordinary statement if one thinks out its implications, and a mouthful of contradictions.\nWhile speaking about Leninism, the authors of \"An Anarchist FAQ\" say:\nRather than present an effective and efficient means of achieving revolution, the Leninist model is elitist, hierarchical and highly inefficient in achieving a socialist society. At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. At worst, these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees).\nClassical and orthodox Marxists.\nImmediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, Karl Kautsky said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is only the old feudal large landed property which exists no longer. Conditions in Russia were ripe for its abolition but they were not ripe for the abolition of capitalism. Capitalism is now once again celebrating a resurrection, but in forms that are more oppressive and harrowing for the proletariat than of old.\nInstead of assuming higher industrialised forms, private capitalism has assumed the most wretched and shabby forms of black marketeering and money speculation. Industrial capitalism has developed to become state capitalism. Formerly state officials and officials from private capital were critical, often very hostile towards each other.\nConsequently the working man found that his advantage lay with one or the other in turn. Today the state bureaucracy and capitalist bureaucracy are merged into one\u2014that is the upshot of the great socialist revolution brought about by the Bolsheviks. It constitutes the most oppressive of all despotisms that Russia has ever had to suffer.\nAfter 1929, exiled Mensheviks such as Fyodor Dan began to argue that Stalin's Russia constituted a state capitalist society. In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the Socialist Party of Great Britain independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the Catholic Church's. As John O'Neill notes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whatever other merits or problems their theories had, in arguing that the Russian revolution was from the outset a capitalist revolution they avoided the ad hoc and post hoc nature of more recent Maoist- and Trotskyist-inspired accounts of state capitalism, which start from the assumption that the Bolshevik revolution inaugurated a socialist economy that at some later stage degenerated into capitalism.\nWriting in the Menshevik journal \"Socialist Courier\" on 25 April 25, Rudolf Hilferding rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that as practiced in the Soviet Union it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital. According to Hilferding, state capitalism was not a form of capitalism, but rather a form of totalitarianism.\nCommunist left and council communists.\nAnother early analysis of the Soviet Union as state capitalist came from various groups advocating left communism. One major tendency of the 1918 Russian communist left criticised the re-employment of authoritarian capitalist relations and methods of production. As Valerian Osinsky in particular argued, \"one-man management\" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished) and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production. Taylorism converted workers into the appendages of machines and piece work imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling petty bourgeois values into workers. In sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. In 1918, this tendency within the left communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its transcendence lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of Marx's critique of alienation.\nThis type of criticism was revived on the left of the Russian Communist Party after the 10th Congress in 1921, which introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP). Many members of the Workers' Opposition and the Decists (both later banned) and two new underground left communist groups, Gavril Myasnikov's Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class. The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.\nThe left and council communist traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist, although some left communists such as Amadeo Bordiga also referred to it as simply \"capitalism\" or \"capitalist mode of production\". Otto R\u00fchle, a major German left communist, developed this idea from the 1920s and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist Anton Pannekoek in \"State Capitalism and Dictatorship\" (1936).\nTrotskyists.\nLeon Trotsky stated that the term \"state capitalism\" \"originally arose to designate the phenomena which arise when a bourgeois state takes direct charge of the means of transport or of industrial enterprises\" and is therefore a \"partial negation\" of capitalism.\nHowever, Trotsky rejected that description of the Soviet Union, claiming instead that it was a degenerated workers' state. After World War II, most Trotskyists accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being deformed workers' states. However, alternative opinions within the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a new class theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, Cuba, China and other self-proclaimed socialist states.\nThe discussion goes back to internal debates in the Left Opposition during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Ante Ciliga, a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many within the Left Opposition to a theory of state capitalism influenced by Gavril Myasnikov's Workers Group and other left communist factions.\nFollowing his release and his return to activity in the International Left Opposition, Ciliga \"was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles\". George Orwell, who was an anti-Stalinist leftist like Ciliga, used the term in his \"Homage to Catalonia\" (1938).\nAfter 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency of C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya, who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three Five Year Plans alongside readings of Marx's early humanist writings. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism.\nAnother is that of Tony Cliff, associated with the International Socialist Tendency and the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson\u2013Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones. A relatively recent text by Stephen Resnick and Richard D. Wolff, titled \"Class Theory and History\", explores what they term \"state capitalism\" in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.\nOther terms used by critical left-wing theorists in discussing Soviet-style societies include bureaucratic collectivism, deformed workers' states, degenerated workers' states and the \"new class\".\nMaoists and anti-revisionist Marxist\u2013Leninists.\nIn the common program set up by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, in effect the country's interim constitution, state capitalism meant an economic system of corporatism. It provided as follows: \"Whenever necessary and possible, private capital shall be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism\".\nFrom 1956 to the late 1970s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their Maoist or anti-revisionist adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of Nikita Khrushchev and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled \"socialist\" states. This was involved in the ideological Sino\u2013Soviet split.\nAfter Mao Zedong's death, amidst the supporters of the Cultural Revolution and the Gang of Four, most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the CCP which likewise distanced itself from these former fraternal groups. The related theory of Hoxhaism was developed in 1978, largely by Socialist Albanian President Enver Hoxha, who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and revisionist economic policies.\nMost current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being state capitalist from a certain point in their history onwards\u2014most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and anti-revisionists also sometimes use the term \"social imperialism\" to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence\u2014their phrase, \"socialist in words, imperialist in deeds\" denotes this.\nBy liberal economists.\nMurray Rothbard, an anarcho-capitalist philosopher, used the term \"state capitalism\" interchangeably with the term \"state monopoly capitalism\" and used it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers.\nRothbard distinguished it from \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, where big business is not protected from market forces. This usage dates from the 1960s, when Harry Elmer Barnes described the post-New Deal economy of the United States as \"state capitalism\". More recently, Andrei Illarionov, former economic adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, resigned in December 2005, protesting Russia's \"embracement of state capitalism\".\nThe term \"state capitalism\" is not used by classical liberals to describe the public ownership of the means of production. The explanation why was given by the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises, who argued:\nThe socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism \u2014 until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name. The most recent slogan is \"State Capitalism.\" It is not commonly realized that this covers nothing more than what used to be called Planned Economy and State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, Planned Economy, and State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the \"classic\" ideal of egalitarian Socialism.\nBy Italian Fascists.\nOn economic issues, Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini claimed in 1933 that were Fascism to follow the modern phase of capitalism, its path would \"lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than state socialism turned on its head. In either event, [whether the outcome be state capitalism or state socialism] the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation\".\nMussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or heroic capitalism (1830\u20131870), followed by static capitalism (1870\u20131914) and then reaching its final form of decadent capitalism, also known as supercapitalism beginning in 1914.\nMussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the \"standardization of humankind\" and for causing excessive consumption. Mussolini claimed that at this stage of supercapitalism \"[it] is then that a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously\". Due to the inability of businesses to operate properly when facing economic difficulties, Mussolini claimed that this proved that state intervention into the economy was necessary to stabilize the economy.\nMussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the bourgeoisie could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism only if the concept of economic individualism were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced. Private enterprise would control production, but it would be supervised by the state. Italian Fascism presented the economic system of corporatism as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.\nIn Western countries and European studies.\nAn alternate definition is that state capitalism is a close relationship between the government and private capitalism such as one in which the private capitalists produce for a guaranteed market. An example of this would be the military\u2013industrial complex in which autonomous entrepreneurial firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets.\nBoth the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably Nikolai Bukharin, who in his book \"Imperialism and World Economy\" thought that advanced, imperialist countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.\nState capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for national security. These may involve private investment as well. A government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include Neste, Equinor and OMV.\nThere are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite's political power which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism's creative destruction, the threat of revolution and any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill-equipped to inspire innovation.\nSeveral European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the European Union. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on \"The Futures of European Capitalism\", in which she divides modern European capitalism in three groups, namely market, managed and state. Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-corporatist model.\nThe author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism. A general theory of capitalist forms, whereby state capitalism is a particular case, was developed by Ernesto Screpanti, who argued that Soviet-type economies of the 20th century used state capitalism to sustain processes of primitive accumulation. In their historical analysis of the Soviet Union, Marxist economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick identify state capitalism as the dominant class system throughout the history of the Soviet Union.\nState monopoly capitalism.\nThe theory of state monopoly capitalism was initially a neo-Stalinist doctrine popularised after World War II. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or oligopolistic businesses from competition by smaller firms.\nThe main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a monopoly or cartel position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial oligarchy or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government, and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership.\nState monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin's definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in neo-Trotskyist theories of state capitalism as well as in libertarian anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.\nPolitical implications.\nThe strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the Joseph Stalin era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a people's democratic alliance under the leadership of the communist party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called monopoly for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the anti-monopoly alliance. At the 1965 Afro-Asian Conference, delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algeri, Che Guevara argued that \"[e]ver since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries\".\nCriticism.\nWhen Eugen Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that \"under capitalism anarchy of production reigns\".\nCritics of the stamocap theory (e.g. Ernest Mandel and Leo Kofler) claimed the following :\nCurrent forms in the 21st century.\nState capitalism is distinguished from capitalist mixed economies where the state intervenes in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates businesses for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed-market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as corporations, companies or business enterprises.\nIn the state capitalism of the twenty-first century, the domestic and global aspects are more closely linked. In such a context, the state's intervention in the economy is associated with the strategy of countries to attain international prominence. Models of state capitalist strategies can be identified as a countries' endeavor to gain greater international political power by integrating domestic economic policies with foreign policy. Governments have been utilizing successful national corporations (national champions) to pursue mergers and acquisitions abroad, thereby enhancing their influence in various sectors of the global market.\nPeople's Republic of China.\nMany analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century. In his book \"\", political scientist Ian Bremmer describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the free market economies of the developed world, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Bremmer draws a broad definition of state capitalism as such:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In this system, governments use various kinds of state-owned companies to manage the exploitation of resources that they consider the state's crown jewels and to create and maintain large numbers of jobs. They use select privately owned companies to dominate certain economic sectors.\nThey use so-called sovereign wealth funds to invest their extra cash in ways that maximize the state's profits. In all three cases, the state is using markets to create wealth that can be directed as political officials see fit. And in all three cases, the ultimate motive is not economic (maximizing growth) but political (maximizing the state's power and the leadership's chances of survival). This is a form of capitalism but one in which the state acts as the dominant economic player and uses markets primarily for political gain.\nFollowing on Bremmer, Aligica, and Tarko further develop the theory that state capitalism in countries like modern day China and Russia is an example of a rent-seeking society. They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power.\nIn his article \"We're All State Capitalists Now\", British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University Niall Ferguson warns against \"an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into 'market capitalist' and 'state capitalist' camps. The reality is that most countries are arranged along a spectrum where both the intent and the extent of state intervention in the economy vary\". He then notes: \"The real contest of our time is not between a state-capitalist China and a market-capitalist America, with Europe somewhere in the middle. It is a contest that goes on within all three regions as we all struggle to strike the right balance between the economic institutions that generate wealth and the political institutions that regulate and redistribute it.\"\nIn the common program set up by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, in effect the country's interim constitution, state capitalism meant an economic system of corporatism. It provided as follows: \"Whenever necessary and possible, private capital shall be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism.\"\nAnalysis of the Chinese model and the socialist market economy by the economists Julan Du and Chenggang Xu finds that the contemporary economic system of the People's Republic of China represents a state capitalist system as opposed to a market socialist system. The reason for this categorization is the existence of financial markets in the Chinese economic system, which are absent in the market socialist literature and in the classic models of market socialism; and that state profits are retained by enterprises rather than being equitably distributed among the population in a basic income/social dividend or similar scheme, which are major features in the market socialist literature. They conclude that China is neither a form of market socialism nor a stable form of capitalism.\nThe Chinese government maintains that these reforms are actually the primary stage of socialism and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) remains nominally dedicated to establishing a socialist society and subsequently developing into full communism. This was reiterated by General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping at the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit.\nRepublic of China (Taiwan).\nSome Taiwanese economists referred to Taiwan's economic model during the Kuomintang dictatorship period as party-state capitalism\".\" During this era, Taiwan's economy had been classified as a state capitalist system influenced by its Leninist model of political control. Today, Taiwan's economy includes a number of state-owned enterprises, but the state's role in the economy has shifted from that of an entrepreneur to a minority investor in companies alongside the democratization agenda of the late 1980s.\nNorway.\nAccording to \"The Economist\", Norway is \"embracing state capitalism\", as the government of Norway, funded by the government's ownership of the country's oil reserves, has ownership stakes in many of the country's largest publicly listed companies, owning 37% of the Oslo stock market and operates the country's largest non-listed companies including Avinor and Statkraft. There are legal limits however, as the Government Pension Fund of Norway is not allowed to own more than 15% of any single Norwegian company.\nSingapore.\nSingapore has attracted some of the world's most powerful corporations through business-friendly legislation and through the encouragement of Western-style corporatism, with close cooperation between the state and corporations. Singapore's large holdings of government-linked companies and the state's close cooperation with business are defining aspects of the economy of Singapore. Singapore's government owns controlling shares in many government-linked companies and directs investment through sovereign wealth funds, an arrangement that has been cited as state capitalism when defined as \"system in which the state functions as the leading economic actor and uses markets primarily for political gain\". Listed companies in which the government is the controlling shareholder account for 37% of the total stock market capitalization in Singapore.\nUnited States.\nDuring the second presidency of Donald Trump beginning in 2025, Trump sought an unprecedented amount of control over US business, publicly attacked companies and their executives, demanded firings of corporate leaders who criticized or contradicted him, and demanded cuts of business profits by the federal government. Trump abandoned traditional Republican orthodoxy about protecting and promoting the free market, and sought greater and direct government control over private business which was widely described by academics, economists, commentators, and former corporate CEOs as an embrace of state capitalism. \nHis demand and agreement with NVIDIA and AMD to provide the government with 15% of all overseas chip sales to China were described by critics as a \"shakedown\" and as potentially illegal and unconstitutional. In an unprecedented move, the Pentagon became the largest shareholder of MP Materials, bypassing US procurement and contracting laws in the process. As part of an agreement to allow Japan-based Nippon Steel buy US Steel, Trump was granted a personal, not governmental, golden share in US Steel, allowing him to influence board decisions and maintain veto power over certain decisions set to expire at the end of his presidential term, after which the Treasury and Commerce Departments would exercise control under all future presidents. Intel agreed to grant the government a 10% equity stake in its company with no power to influence board decisions \"with limited exceptions\" in what \"NBC News\" described as \"the president's latest extraordinary move to exert federal government control over private business\". \nWriting for \"Columbia Law Review\" in 2020, Jon D. Michaels argued that there existed growing evidence of government market participation in a \"postliberal\" political economy, coining the term \"public capitalism\" in the United States at the national, state, and local levels.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29666", "revid": "45093283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29666", "title": "Syringomyelia", "text": "Disorder in which a cyst forms in the spinal cord\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nSyringomyelia is a generic term referring to a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord. Often, syringomyelia is used as a generic term before an etiology is determined. This cyst, called a syrinx, can expand and elongate over time, destroying the spinal cord. The damage may result in loss of feeling, paralysis, weakness, and stiffness in the back, shoulders, and extremities. \nSyringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. It may also lead to a cape-like bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation along the upper chest and arms. The combination of symptoms varies from one patient to another depending on the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord, as well as its extent.\nSyringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 8.4 cases per 100,000 people, with symptoms usually beginning in young adulthood. Signs of the disorder tend to develop slowly, although sudden onset may occur with coughing, straining, or myelopathy.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSyringomyelia causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms, due to damage to the spinal cord. Patients may experience severe chronic pain, abnormal sensations and loss of sensation, particularly in the hands. Some patients experience paralysis or paresis, temporarily or permanently. A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, leading to Horner syndrome, abnormal body temperature or sweating, bowel control issues, or other problems. If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem, as in syringobulbia, vocal cord paralysis, ipsilateral tongue wasting, trigeminal nerve sensory loss, and other signs may be present. Rarely, bladder stones can occur at the onset of weakness in the lower extremities.\nClassically, syringomyelia spares the dorsal column/medial lemniscus of the spinal cord, leaving pressure, vibration, touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities. Neuropathic arthropathy, also known as a Charcot joint, can occur, particularly in the shoulders, in patients with syringomyelia. The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to degeneration of the joint over time.\nCause.\nGenerally, there are two forms of syringomyelia: congenital and acquired. Syringomyelia is generally a chronic disorder that occurs over time, resulting in muscular atrophy. Acquired Syringomyelia can be caused by a serious physical trauma to the body such as in a road traffic accident. Syringomyelia can also be classified into communicating and noncommunicating forms. Communicating typically occurs due to lesions on the foramen magnum and noncommunicating occurring due to other spinal cord diseases.\nCongenital.\nThe first major form relates to an abnormality of the brain called an Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation or Chiari malformation. This is the most common cause of syringomyelia, where the anatomic abnormality, which may be due to a small posterior fossa, causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal. A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Here, symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining, called a valsalva maneuver, or any activity that causes cerebrospinal fluid pressure to fluctuate suddenly. Some patients, however, may have long periods of stability. Some patients with this form of the disorder also have hydrocephalus, in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull, or a condition called arachnoiditis, in which a covering of the spinal cord\u2014the arachnoid membrane\u2014is inflamed. Some cases of syringomyelia are familial, although this is rare.\nAcquired.\nThe second major form of syringomyelia occurs as a complication of trauma, meningitis, hemorrhage, a tumor, or arachnoiditis. Here, the syrinx or cyst develops in a segment of the spinal cord damaged by one of these conditions. The syrinx then starts to expand. This is sometimes referred to as noncommunicating syringomyelia. Symptoms may appear months or even years after the initial injury, starting with pain, weakness, and sensory impairment originating at the site of trauma.\nThe primary symptom of post-traumatic syringomyelia (often referred to using the abbreviation of PTS) is pain, which may spread upward from the site of injury. Symptoms, such as pain, numbness, weakness, and disruption in temperature sensation, may be limited to one side of the body. Syringomyelia can also adversely affect sweating, sexual function, and, later, bladder and bowel control. A typical cause of PTS would be a car accident or similar trauma involving a whiplash injury.\nWhat can make PTS difficult to diagnose is the fact that symptoms can often first appear long after the actual cause of the syrinx occurred (e.g., a car accident occurring and then the patient first experiencing PTS symptoms such as pain, loss of sensation, and reduced ability on the skin to feel varying degrees of hot and cold a number of months after the car accident).\nPathogenesis.\nThe pathogenesis of syringomyelia is debated. The cerebrospinal fluid also serves to cushion the brain. Excess cerebrospinal fluid in the central canal of the spinal cord is called hydromyelia. This term refers to increased cerebrospinal fluid that is contained within the ependyma of the central canal. When fluid dissects into the surrounding white matter forming a cystic cavity or syrinx, the term syringomyelia is applied. As these conditions coexist in the majority of cases, the term syringohydromyelia is applied. The terms are used interchangeably.\nIt has been observed that obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces in the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation, and alleviation of the obstruction may improve symptoms. A number of pathological conditions can cause an obstruction of the normal cerebrospinal fluid spaces. These include Chiari malformation, spinal arachnoiditis, scoliosis, spinal vertebrae misalignment, spinal tumors, spina bifida, and others. The reasons that blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid space within the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation are not fully understood although a small posterior fossa is one known cause. It is unclear if syrinx fluid originates from bulk movement of cerebrospinal fluid into the spinal cord, from bulk transmural movement of blood fluids through the spinal vasculature into the syrinx, or from a combination of both. Recent work suggests that central nervous system compliance is the underlying problem for the central nervous system, and also that hydrocephalus and syringomyelia have related causes.\nDiagnosis.\nPhysicians now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose syringomyelia. The MRI radiographer takes images of body anatomy, such as the brain and spinal cord, in vivid detail. This test will show the syrinx in the spine or any other conditions, such as the presence of a tumor. MRI is safe, painless, and informative and has greatly improved the diagnosis of syringomyelia.\nThe physician may order additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis. One of these is called electromyography (EMG), which show possible lower motor neuron damage. Note this test isn't used diagnostically for injuries to the spine but to nerves and muscles. This would be part of a patient's rehab routine. In addition, computed axial tomography (CT) scans of a patient's head may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus.\nLike MRI and CT scans, another test, called a myelogram, uses radiographs and requires a contrast medium to be injected into the subarachnoid space. Since the introduction of MRI, this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia.\nThe possible causes are trauma, tumors, and congenital defects. It is most usually observed in the part of the spinal cord corresponding to the neck area. Symptoms are due to spinal cord damage and include pain, decreased sensation of touch, weakness, and loss of muscle tissue. The diagnosis is confirmed with a spinal CT, myelogram or MRI of the spinal cord. The cavity may be reduced by surgical decompression.\nFurthermore, evidence also suggests that impact injuries to the thorax area highly correlate with the occurrence of a cervical-located syrinx.\nTreatment.\nSurgery.\nTreating syringomyelia sometimes requires surgery. Surgery involving the spinal cord carries certain risks, and as with any medical treatment, the potential benefits have to be weighed against the possible complications. On the other hand, delaying treatment can increase the risk of permanent damage. Evaluation of the condition is necessary because syringomyelia can remain stationary for long periods of time, and in some cases progress rapidly.\nThe main goal of surgical intervention is to correct the condition which led to the formation of the syrinx. Draining the syrinx can also help, by preventing it from becoming worse, but the symptoms the syrinx has already caused may not go away.\nIn cases involving an Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation, the main goal of surgery is to provide more space for the cerebellum at the base of the skull and upper cervical spine, without entering the brain or spinal cord. This often causes the syrinx to shrink or disappear over time, as the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid is restored. If syringomyelia is caused by a tumor, removing the tumor \u2013 if possible \u2013 is the treatment of choice.\nMost patients' symptoms stabilize or have a modest improvement following surgery. Syringomyelia can come back, however, requiring additional surgeries which may be less effective.\nIn some cases, including both communicating and non-communicating forms of the condition, a syrinx may require ongoing drainage. This is done with a shunt, which uses tubes and valves to let cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drain from the syrinx into another cavity within the body (usually the abdomen). This type of shunt, called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, is particularly useful in cases involving hydrocephalus. By continually draining the syrinx, a shunt can arrest the progression of symptoms and relieve pain, headache, and tightness.\nMany factors affect the decision to use a shunt. There are risks of injury to the spinal cord, infection, drainage becoming blocked, and bleeding, and they do not always achieve the intended results. Draining the fluid more quickly does not produce better outcomes, but for some syrinxes, a shunt is the only drainage option.\nIn the case of trauma-related syringomyelia, the surgeon operates at the level of the initial injury. The syrinx collapses at surgery, but a tube or shunt is usually necessary to prevent it from returning.\nNon-surgical interventions.\nSurgery is not always recommended for syringomyelia patients. While there is no medication which can cure the condition, for many patients, the main treatment is analgesia to manage the symptoms. Physicians specializing in pain management can develop a medication and treatment plan to ameliorate pain. Medications to combat any neuropathic pain symptoms such as shooting and stabbing pains (e.g. gabapentin or pregabalin) would be first-line choices. Opiates are usually prescribed for pain for management of this condition. Conversely, facet joint injections are not indicated for the treatment of syringomyelia.\nRadiation is rare, but may be used if a tumor is involved. In these cases, it can halt the extension of a cavity and may help to alleviate pain.\nTreatment is usually reserved for cases which are causing symptoms. Treatment may not provide enough benefits to be recommended for elderly patients, or when symptoms are stable instead of worsening. Whether treated or not, many patients are advised to avoid activities that involve straining.\nA conservative approach may be recommended, as the natural history of syringomyelia is not yet well understood. When surgery is not currently advised, patients are monitored with regular physical evaluations and MRI's.\nResearch.\nThe precise causes of syringomyelia are still unknown, although blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid has been known to be an important factor since the 1970s. Scientists in the UK and US continue to explore the mechanisms that lead to the formation of syrinxes in the spinal cord. It has been demonstrated that a block of the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Duke University in America and Warwick University are conducting research to explore genetic features of syringomyelia.\nSurgical techniques are also being refined by the neurosurgical research community. Successful procedures expand the area around the cerebellum and spinal cord, improving the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and thereby reducing the syrinx.\nIt is also important to understand the role of birth defects in the development of hindbrain malformations that can lead to syringomyelia, as syringomyelia is a feature of intrauterine life and is also associated with spina bifida. Learning when these defects occur during the development of the fetus can help with the understanding of this and similar disorders, and may lead to preventive treatment that can stop the formation of some birth abnormalities.\nDiagnostic technology is another area for continued research. MRI has enabled scientists to see the situation within the spine, including syringomyelia, before any symptoms appear. A new technology, known as dynamic MRI, allows investigators to view spinal fluid flow within the syrinx. CT scans allow physicians to see abnormalities in the brain, and other diagnostic tests have also improved greatly with the availability of new, non-toxic, contrast dyes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In October 2024, he was inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Sant Mateu, Castell\u00f3n, Spain, Aragon\u00e9s emigrated with his family to France, due to the Spanish Civil War, before settling in Mexico at age 6. Aragon\u00e9s had a passion for art since early childhood. As one anecdote goes, Aragon\u00e9s was once left alone in a room by his parents with a box of crayons. His parents returned sometime later to find that he had covered the wall in hundreds upon hundreds of drawings. Aragon\u00e9s recalled his early difficulties in Mexico, saying, \"I didn't have too many friends because I had just arrived. You're the new kid, and you have an accent. I've always had an accent\u00a0... When the other kids make fun of you, you don't want to get out of the house. So you stay at home, and what do you do? You take pencils and start drawing.\"\nAragon\u00e9s used his drawing skills to assimilate. \"The earliest money I ever made was with drawings\", he remembered. \"The teacher would give us homework, which would consist of copying Chapter Eleven, including the illustrations\u00a0... a beetle or a plant, the pistil of a flower, or soldiers\u00a0\u2013 that type of thing. All the kids who couldn't draw would leave a square where the drawing was, and I would charge them to draw that. The equivalent of a few pennies\u00a0... That's probably why I draw so fast, because I drew so many of them.\"\nHe made his first professional sale in 1954 when a high school classmate submitted his work to a magazine without telling Aragon\u00e9s. He continued to sell gag cartoons to magazines while studying architecture at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he learned pantomime under the direction of Alejandro Jodorowsky. \"I joined the class\", Aragon\u00e9s recalled, \"not to become a mime but to apply its physical aspects of movement to my comics.\" \nAragon\u00e9s taught Mexican Popular Art at the University of Mexico, and became engaged to one of his American students, Lilio Chomette. In 1962, Aragon\u00e9s moved to the United States, where he married Chomette and settled with her in New York.\nArt collector Jeff Singh spoke with Sergio at a convention and wrote. \"A friend told me that Sergio's father was a film director/producer in Mexico. I asked about this and it is true. His father didn't want the family on set for fear of actors and workers befriending the family in order to win favor with the father. Among the projects worked on, his father did work for the Irish McCalla TV series \"Sheena, Queen of the Jungle\" which was filmed in Mexico (in 1955). On one of the rare occasions Sergio was on set the stuntman didn't show up. Sergio had to put on the Sheena costume and did some stunts which I understand included swinging from a vine and diving into water. He was in his early teens at this time. He said they were pretty distant shots as despite the wig and costume he didn't look at all like Irish. Irish was not on set that day and he lamented never having got to meet her.\"\nArrival in the United States.\nAccording to the artist, he arrived in New York in 1962 with nothing but 20 dollars and his portfolio of drawings. After working odd jobs around the city, Aragon\u00e9s went to \"Mad\"'s offices on Third Avenue hoping to sell some of his cartoons. \"I didn't think I had anything that belonged in \"Mad,\"\" said Aragon\u00e9s. \"I didn't have any satire. I didn't have any articles. But everybody was telling me, 'Oh, you should go to \"Mad\".\"\nSince his knowledge of English was not very extensive, he asked for the only \"Mad\" artist he knew of that spoke Spanish, Cuban-born artist Antonio Proh\u00edas, creator of the comic strip \"Spy vs. Spy\". Aragon\u00e9s hoped Proh\u00edas could serve as an interpreter between him and the \"Mad\" editors. According to Aragon\u00e9s, this proved to be a mistake, since Proh\u00edas knew even less English than he did. Proh\u00edas did receive Aragon\u00e9s very enthusiastically and, with difficulty, introduced the young artist to the \"Mad\" editors as \"Sergio, my brother from Mexico,\" temporarily leading to even further confusion, as the \"Mad\" editors thought they were meeting \"Sergio Proh\u00edas.\" \"Mad\" editor Al Feldstein and publisher Bill Gaines liked what they saw, and Aragon\u00e9s became a contributor to the magazine in 1963. His first sale was an assortment of astronaut cartoons which the editors arranged into a themed article. \nWhen associate editor Jerry DeFuccio encouraged Aragon\u00e9s to submit more material in the future, the cartoonist took it to heart, producing a full article on motorcycle cops overnight. He returned to the \"Mad\" offices the following morning, and made his second sale. In 2022, Aragon\u00e9s told an interviewer, \"I was back at the door before they opened. They were asking, \"What happened? What do you need?\" I said, \"No, I have your articles here.\" They couldn't believe it. I had drawn close to 15 ideas and they loved it.\"\nWith little money and no connections in the United States, Aragon\u00e9s spent so much time at the office that publisher Gaines allowed him to sleep there overnight. \"I don't think any other company would have been so generous or friendly,\" Aragon\u00e9s recalled 57 years later.\nAragon\u00e9s worked continuously for \"Mad\" from 1963 to 2020, only stopping because the magazine transitioned into an almost-all-reprint format. His final new material appeared in an issue otherwise entirely filled with Aragon\u00e9s reprints. It was the 491st issue to include new work by Aragon\u00e9s, second only to Al Jaffee (509 issues). \"They told me, 'Make \"Mad\" your home,'\" said Aragon\u00e9s, \"and I took it literally.\"\nMarginals.\nAragon\u00e9s has a featured section in every issue called \"A \"Mad\" Look At...\", typically featuring 4\u20135 pages of speechless gag strips that are all related to a single subject, such as \"Gambling,\" \"UFOs\" or \"Pizza.\" Aragon\u00e9s became famous for his wordless \"drawn-out dramas\" or \"marginals\" (\"cf.\" marginalia) which were inserted into the margins and between panels of the magazine. The drawings are both horizontal and vertical, and occasionally extend around corners. Prior to Aragon\u00e9s's arrival at \"Mad\", the magazine had sometimes filled its margins with text jokes under the catch-all heading \"Marginal Thinking.\" Aragon\u00e9s convinced Feldstein to use his cartoons by creating a dummy sample issue with his Marginals drawn along the edges. The staff of \"Mad\" enjoyed his marginals, but did not expect him to be able to maintain the steady stream of small cartoons needed for each issue. Aragon\u00e9s has provided marginals for every issue of \"Mad\" since 1963 except one (his contributions to that issue were lost by the Post Office). Associate Editor Jerry DeFuccio said, \"Writing the 'Marginal Thinking' marginals had always been a pain in the butt. Sergio made the pain go away.\"\nAragon\u00e9s is a very prolific artist; Al Jaffee once said, \"Sergio has, quite literally, drawn more cartoons on napkins in restaurants than most cartoonists draw in their entire careers.\" In 2002, writer Mark Evanier estimated that Aragon\u00e9s had written and drawn more than 12,000 gag cartoons for \"Mad\" alone. His new marginal gags in the April 2024 \"Mad\" marked the 509th issue that Aragon\u00e9s has contributed to, the most of any writer or artist. He passed Al Jaffee, whose work had appeared in 508 \"Mad\" issues between 1955 and 2020.\nComic books.\nIn 1967, he began writing and illustrating full stories for various DC Comics titles, mainly for the horror anthologies House of Mystery and House of Secrets. He wrote or plotted stories that were illustrated by other artists. Aragon\u00e9s helped create DC's Western series \"Bat Lash\" and the humor title \"Plop!\". Aragon\u00e9s broke with DC when the company began insisting on work-for-hire contracts; when Aragon\u00e9s balked, an editor tore up Aragon\u00e9s's paycheck in front of his face. He'd been trying obliquely to sell a comic book premise to DC or Marvel, but neither company would allow Aragon\u00e9s to retain the copyright. \"I didn't want anyone stealing the idea\", said Aragon\u00e9s, \"and they weren't able to talk on a theoretical basis.\"\nAragon\u00e9s had created the humorous barbarian comic book \"Groo the Wanderer\" in the late 1970s, but the character did not appear in print until 1982. Groo was so named because Aragon\u00e9s sought a name which meant nothing in any language. Writer Mark Evanier subsequently joined Aragon\u00e9s on \"Groo.\" Evanier's role originally was as something of a translator, as Aragon\u00e9s was still somewhat shaky at expressing his ideas in English. Eventually, the two began collaborating on story ideas, and there have been several Groo stories in which Evanier is credited as the sole writer. Aragon\u00e9s has since become fluent in English. The other regular contributors to the comic book are letterer Stan Sakai (himself the creator/artist of Usagi Yojimbo), and colorist Tom Luth. As a creator-owned series, \"Groo\" has survived the bankruptcy of a number of publishers, a fact which led to the industry joke that publishing the series was a precursor to a publisher's demise. The title was initially published by Pacific Comics, briefly by Eclipse Comics, then Marvel Comics under their since-discontinued Epic Comics imprint which allowed creators to retain copyrights, then Image Comics, and currently Dark Horse Comics.\nOn 2 December 1982, Marty Feldman died from a heart attack in a hotel room in Mexico City. This occurred during the making of the film \"Yellowbeard\". Aragon\u00e9s, who was filming nearby and was dressed for his role as an armed policeman, had introduced himself to Feldman that night. He encountered Feldman abruptly, startling and frightening him, which may have induced Feldman's heart attack. Aragon\u00e9s has recounted the story with the punchline \"I killed Marty Feldman\". The story was converted into a strip in Aragon\u00e9s's issue of DC Comics' \"Solo\".\nIn the early 1980s, Aragon\u00e9s collaborated with the Belgian cartoonist Fran\u00e7ois Walth\u00e9ry on \"Natacha, l'hotesse de l'air\", a well known series from the magazine \"Spirou\". This story was titled \"Instantan\u00e9 pour Caltech\". Aragon\u00e9s appears in the strip as a police officer character ( / DUPUIS Editor \u2013 Belgium).\nIn April 2022, Aragon\u00e9s was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA's benefit anthology book, \"Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds\", a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nAragon\u00e9s's work can be found in other compilations, including \"The Big Book of the Weird, Wild West\", in which he illustrates a retelling of the Donner Party incident. His cartoons have appeared in a series of paperback editions for \"Mad\".\nFilm and television.\nIn 1976, he had an acting role in the film \"Norman... Is That You?\" where he played one of the desk clerks at the \"Buenos Noches Hotel\".\nHe appeared in the short-lived 1977 revival of TV's \"Laugh-In\".\nIn addition to printed work, Aragon\u00e9s has worked in television animation. He worked on the NBC program \"Speak Up America\" (1980) where he would draw during the show. His segments were used for many years on the Dick Clark \"Bloopers\" programs. Frequent collaborator Mark Evanier related an anecdote from their time on the short-lived 1983 NBC series \"The Half Hour Comedy Hour\", which featured a guest appearance by model Jayne Kennedy:\nThis was one of the most beautiful women in the world, and she wore this dress that was very revealing. So much so, the censors wouldn't let us put her on the air in it without adding some material. So we're all talking to her, the writers and whoever, just in awe of this woman. And Sergio comes walking in looking like a homeless person, carrying his portfolio. And Jayne sees him and she shouts, 'Sergio!' and she runs over and starts kissing him passionately. They'd worked together before, it turned out. But Johnny Carson comes walking out into the hallway and he thinks Jayne Kennedy is being sexually assaulted by a homeless person in the NBC hallways. He came over to make sure she was okay. She said it was fine, that she knew him, and I said, 'It's okay, he's a cartoonist.' So Johnny gives that classic look and he says, 'I knew I should have taken up drawing.'\nStan Lee interviewed Aragon\u00e9s in the 1991 documentary series \"The Comic Book Greats\".\nIn 2009, Aragon\u00e9s told an interviewer, \"I'm thinking and laughing all day long. Every time I think of a joke, I'm also telling myself a new joke. It's a great way to live.\"\nHe appeared as his own preserved head in the \"Futurama\" episode \"Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences\", hosting the \"Last Actual Comic Book Booth\" at Comic Con 3010.\nIn 2020, Aragon\u00e9s guest-starred in \"The Casagrandes\" episode \"Mexican Makeover\" voicing Lupe's pet parrot and Sergio's cousin Paco.\nAwards.\nAragon\u00e9s's work has won him numerous awards. He won Shazam Awards for Best Inker (Humor Division) in 1972 for his work on \"Mad Magazine\" and for Best Humor Story in 1972 for \"The Poster Plague\" from \"House of Mystery\" No. 202 with Steve Skeates. Aragon\u00e9s received an Inkpot Award in 1976. He won the Harvey Award Special Award for Humor in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001. He received the National Cartoonists Society Comic Book Award for 1986, their Humor Comic Book Award for 1973, 1974, and 1976, their Magazine and Book Illustration Award for 1989, their Special Features Award for 1977, their Gag Cartoon Award for 1983, and their top Reuben Award in 1996 for his work on \"Mad\" and \"Groo the Wanderer.\" In 1985 he was awarded the Adamson Award for Best International Comic-Strip or Comic Book work in Sweden. In 1992 he became the first Mexican ever to win the Eisner Award for his work on \"Groo the Wanderer\", along with Mark Evanier.\nIn 2009, an exhibition, \"Mad About Sergio\", was held at the Ojai Valley Museum. Visitors saw examples of Aragon\u00e9s's cartooning dating back to childhood, publications he has appeared in, some of his awards, and Marginal-style sketches by Aragon\u00e9s literally drawn onto the museum's walls and display cases.\nThe Comic Art Professional Society award's prize's name is \"The Sergio\", an homage to his work.\nOn 11 October 2024, the Harvey Awards announced that Aragon\u00e9s was one of five comics creators to be inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame at the 36th annual Harvey Awards ceremony on 18 October at the New York Comic Con. The other four inductees were Arthur Adams, Larry Hama, Akira Toriyama, and John Buscema. Upon learning of the accolade, Aragon\u00e9s commented, \"What an honor it is to be inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame. Harvey was a great inspiration to me and so many other cartoonists.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.\nTraders generally negotiate through a medium of credit or exchange, such as money. Though some economists characterize barter (i.e. trading things without the use of money) as an early form of trade, money was invented before written history began. Consequently, any story of how money first developed is mostly based on conjecture and logical inference. Letters of credit, paper money, and non-physical money have greatly simplified and promoted trade as buying can be separated from selling, or earning. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade. \nIn one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trade for other products and needs. Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able goods\u00a0\u2013 including the production of scarce or limited natural resources elsewhere. For example, different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. In such circumstances, trading at market price between locations can benefit both locations. Different types of traders may specialize in trading different kinds of goods; for example, the spice trade and grain trade have both historically been important in the development of a global, international economy.\nRetail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique, or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. Wholesale trade is the traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.\nHistorically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onward (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.\nEtymology.\n\"Trade\" is from Middle English \"trade\" (\"path, course of conduct\"), introduced into English by Hanseatic merchants, from Middle Low German \"trade\" (\"track, course\"), from Old Saxon \"trada\" (\"spoor, track\"), from Proto-Germanic \"*trad\u014d\" (\"track, way\"), and cognate with Old English \"tredan\" (\"to tread\").\n\"Commerce\" is derived from the Latin \"commercium\", from \"cum\" \"together\" and \"merx\", \"merchandise.\"\nrvkdharwadglish by Hanseatic merchants, from Middle Low German \"trade\" (\"track, course\"), from Old Saxon \"trada\" (\"spoor, track\"), from Proto-Germanic \"*trad\u014d\" (\"track, way\"), and cognate with Old English \"tredan\" (\"to tread\").\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nTrade originated from human communication in prehistoric times. Prehistoric peoples exchanged goods and services with each other in a gift economy before the innovation of modern-day currency. Recent research finds evidence that early humans developed trade networks for obsidian 200,000 years ago as well as ostrich egg shell beads 50,000 years ago.\nIn the Mediterranean region, the earliest contact between cultures involved members of the species \"Homo sapiens\", principally using the Danube river, at a time beginning 35,000\u201330,000 BP.\nThere is evidence of the exchange of obsidian and flint during the Stone Age. Trade in obsidian is believed to have taken place in New Guinea from 17,000 BCE.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; HIH Prince Mikasa no Miya Takahito \nRobert Carr Bosanquet investigated trade in the Stone Age by excavations in 1901. The first clear archaeological evidence of trade in manufactured goods is found in south west Asia.\nArchaeological evidence of obsidian use provides data on how this material was increasingly the preferred choice rather than chert from the late Mesolithic to Neolithic, requiring exchange as deposits of obsidian are rare in the Mediterranean region.\nObsidian provided the material to make cutting utensils or tools, although since other more easily obtainable materials were available, use was exclusive to the higher status of the tribe using \"the rich man's flint\". Obsidian has held its value relative to flint.\nEarly traders traded Obsidian at distances of 900 kilometres within the Mediterranean region.\nTrade in the Mediterranean during the Neolithic of Europe was greatest in this material. Networks were in existence at around 12,000 BCE Anatolia was the source primarily for trade with the Levant, Iran and Egypt according to Zarins study of 1990. Melos and Lipari sources produced among the most widespread trading in the Mediterranean region as known to archaeology.\nThe Sari-i-Sang mine in the mountains of Afghanistan was the largest source for trade of lapis lazuli. The material was most largely traded during the Kassite period of Babylonia beginning 1595 BCE.\nAdam Smith traces the origins of commerce to the very start of transactions in prehistoric times. Apart from traditional self-sufficiency, trading became a principal faculty for prehistoric people, who bartered what they had for goods and services from each other. Anthropologists have found no evidence of barter systems that did not exist alongside systems of credit.\nAncient history.\nMediterranean and Near East.\nThe earliest evidence of writing is deeply bound up with trade, as a system of clay tokens used for accounting \u2013 found in the Upper Euphrates valley in Syria dated to the 10th millennium BCE \u2013 is one of the earliest surviving versions of writing. \nEbla was a prominent trading-center during the third millennium BCE, with a network reaching into Anatolia and north Mesopotamia.\nMaterials used for making jewelry were traded with Egypt from 3000 BCE. Long-range trade routes first appeared in the 3rd millennium BCE, when Sumerians in Mesopotamia traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley. The Phoenicians were noted maritime traders, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea and as far north as Britain for sources of tin to manufacture bronze. For this purpose they established trading colonies \u2014 which the Greeks called emporia. Along the coasts of the Mediterranean, researchers have found a positive relationship between how well-connected a coastal location was and the local prevalence of archaeological sites from the Iron Age. This suggests that a location's trade potential was an important determinant of human settlements.\nThe complaint tablet to Ea-n\u0101\u1e63ir, dated 1750 BCE, documents the tribulations of a copper merchant at the time.\nFrom the beginning of Greek civilization until the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century CE, a financially lucrative trade brought valuable spice to Europe from the far east, including India and China. Roman commerce allowed its empire to flourish and endure, notable by importing grain to Italy from Sicily\nand from Egypt.\nThe latter Roman Republic and the Pax Romana of the Roman empire produced a stable and secure transportation-network that enabled the shipment of trade goods without fear of significant piracy, as Rome had become the sole effective sea-power in the Mediterranean with the conquest of Egypt and the near east.\nIn ancient Greece Hermes was the god of trade (commerce) and weights and measures. In ancient Rome, \"Mercurius\" was the god of merchants, whose festival was celebrated by traders on the 25th day of the fifth month. The concept of free trade was an antithesis to the will and economic direction of the sovereigns of the ancient Greek states. Free trade between states was stifled by the need for strict internal controls (via taxation) to maintain security within the treasury of the sovereign, which nevertheless enabled the maintenance of a \"\" of civility within the structures of functional community life.\nThe fall of the Roman empire and the succeeding Dark Ages brought instability to Western Europe and a near-collapse of the trade network in the western world. Trade, however, continued to flourish among the kingdoms of Africa, the Middle East, India, China, and Southeast Asia. Some trade did occur in the west. For instance, Radhanites were a medieval guild or group (the precise meaning of the word is lost to history) of Jewish merchants who traded between the Christians in Europe and the Muslims of the Near East.\nIndo-Pacific.\nThe first true maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean was by the Austronesian peoples of Island Southeast Asia. Initiated by the indigenous peoples of Taiwan and the Philippines, the Maritime Jade Road was an extensive trading network connecting multiple areas in Southeast and East Asia. Its primary products were made of jade mined from Taiwan by Taiwanese indigenous peoples and processed mostly in the Philippines by indigenous Filipinos, especially in Batanes, Luzon, and Palawan. Some were also processed in Vietnam, while the peoples of Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia also participated in the massive trading network. The maritime road is one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world. It was in existence for at least 3,000 years, where its peak production was from 2000 BCE to 500 CE, older than the Silk Road in mainland Eurasia and the later Maritime Silk Road. The Maritime Jade Road began to wane during its final centuries from 500 CE until 1000 CE. The entire period of the network was a golden age for the diverse societies of the region.\nSea-faring Southeast Asians also established trade routes with Southern India and Sri Lanka as early as 1500 BC, ushering an exchange of material culture (like catamarans, outrigger boats, sewn-plank boats, and paan) and cultigens (like coconuts, sandalwood, bananas, and sugarcane); as well as connecting the material cultures of India and China. Indonesians, in particular were trading in spices (mainly cinnamon and cassia) with East Africa using catamaran and outrigger boats and sailing with the help of the Westerlies in the Indian Ocean. This trade network expanded to reach as far as Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar by the first half of the first millennium AD. It continued up to historic times, later becoming the Maritime Silk Road.\nMesoamerica.\nThe emergence of exchange networks in the Pre-Columbian societies of and near to Mexico are known to have occurred within recent years before and after 1500 BCE.\nTrade networks reached north to Oasisamerica. There is evidence of established maritime trade with the cultures of northwestern South America and the Caribbean.\nMiddle Ages.\nDuring the Middle Ages, commerce developed in Europe by trading luxury goods at trade fairs. Wealth became converted into movable wealth or capital. Banking systems developed where money on account was transferred across national boundaries. Hand-to-hand markets became a feature of town life and were regulated by town authorities.\nWestern Europe established a complex and expansive trade network with cargo ships being the main carrier of goods; cogs and hulks are two examples of such cargo ships. Many ports would develop their own extensive trade networks. The English port city of Bristol traded with peoples from Iceland, all along the western coast of France, and south to present-day Spain.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Central Asia was the economic center of the world. The Sogdians dominated the east\u2013west trade-route known as the Silk Road from after the 4th century CE until the 8th century CE, with Suyab and Talas ranking among their main centers in the north. Sogdians functioned as the main caravan merchants of Central Asia.\nFrom the Middle Ages, the maritime republics, in particular Venice, Pisa and Genoa, played a key role in trade in the Mediterranean. From the 11th to the late-15th centuries, the Venetian Republic and the Republic of Genoa were major trade-centers. They dominated trade in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, maintaining a trading monopoly between Europe and the Near East for centuries.\nFrom the 8th to the 11th centuries, the Vikings and Varangians traded as they sailed from and to Scandinavia. Vikings sailed to Western Europe, while Varangians travelled to Kyivan Rus' and to the Black and Caspian Seas. The Hanseatic League, an alliance of trading cities, maintained a trade monopoly over most of Northern Europe and the Baltic between the 13th and 17th centuries.\nThe Age of Sail and the Industrial Revolution.\nPortuguese explorer Vasco da Gama pioneered the European spice trade in 1498 when he reached Calicut after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of the African continent. Prior to this, the flow of spice into Europe from India was controlled by Islamic powers, especially Egypt. The spice trade was of major economic importance and helped spur the Age of Discovery in Europe. Spices brought to Europe from the Eastern world were some of the most valuable commodities for their weight, sometimes rivaling gold.\nFrom 1070 onward, kingdoms in West Africa became significant members of global trade. This came initially through the movement of gold and other resources sent out by Muslim traders on the Trans-Saharan trading network. Beginning in the 16th century, European merchants would purchase gold, spices, cloth, timber and slaves from West African states as part of the triangular trade. This was often in exchange for cloth, iron, or cowrie shells which were used locally as currency.\nFounded in 1352, the Bengal Sultanate was a major trading nation in the world and often referred to by Europeans as the wealthiest country with which to trade.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the Portuguese gained an economic advantage in the Kingdom of Kongo due to different philosophies of trade. Whereas Portuguese traders concentrated on the accumulation of capital, in Kongo spiritual meaning was attached to many objects of trade. According to economic historian Toby Green, in Kongo \"giving more than receiving was a symbol of spiritual and political power and privilege.\"\nIn the 16th century, the Seventeen Provinces were the center of free trade, imposing no exchange controls, and advocating the free movement of goods. Trade in the East Indies was dominated by Portugal in the 16th century, the Dutch Republic in the 17th century, and the British in the 18th century. The Spanish Empire developed regular trade links across both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.\nIn 1776, Adam Smith published the paper \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\". It criticized Mercantilism, and argued that economic specialization could benefit nations just as much as firms. Since the division of labour was restricted by the size of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more productive. Smith said that he considered all rationalizations of import and export controls \"dupery\", which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of specific industries.\nIn 1799, the Dutch East India Company, formerly the world's largest company, became bankrupt, partly due to the rise of competitive free trade.\n19th century.\nIn 1817, David Ricardo, James Mill and Robert Torrens showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of comparative advantage. In Principles of Political Economy and Taxation Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in economics:\n \"When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.\"\nThe ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was whether it was in any particular country's self-interest to open its borders to imports.\nJohn Stuart Mill proved that a country with monopoly pricing power on the international market could manipulate the terms of trade through maintaining tariffs, and that the response to this might be reciprocity in trade policy. Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier. This was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that more of the economic surplus of trade would accrue to a country following \"reciprocal\", rather than completely free, trade policies. This was followed within a few years by the infant industry scenario developed by Mill promoting the theory that the government had the duty to protect young industries, although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the policy in many countries attempting to industrialize and out-compete English exporters. Milton Friedman later continued this vein of thought, showing that in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but never for the world at large.\n20th century.\nThe Great Depression was a major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s. During this period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators.\nThe lack of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression causing stagnation and inflation. Only during World War II did the recession end in the United States. Also during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the Bretton Woods Agreement, intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions. It set up rules and institutions to regulate the international political economy: the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (later divided into the World Bank $ Bank for International Settlements). These organizations became operational in 1946 after enough countries ratified the agreement. In 1947, 23 countries agreed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to promote free trade.\nThe European Union became the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods and services, the biggest export market for around 80 countries.\n21st century.\nToday, trade is merely a subset within a complex system of companies which try to maximize their profits by offering products and services to the market (which consists both of individuals and other companies) at the lowest production cost. A system of international trade has helped to develop the world economy but, in combination with bilateral or multilateral agreements to lower tariffs or to achieve free trade, has sometimes harmed third-world markets for local products.\nFree trade.\nFree trade is a policy by which a government does not discriminate against imports or exports by applying tariffs or subsidies. This policy is also known as laissez-faire policy. This kind of policy does not necessarily imply a country will then abandon all control and taxation of imports and exports.\nFree trade advanced further in the late 20th century and early 2000s:\nPerspectives.\nProtectionism.\nProtectionism is the policy of restraining and discouraging trade between states and contrasts with the policy of free trade. This policy often takes the form of tariffs and restrictive quotas. Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s, between the Great Depression and the onset of World War II.\nReligion.\nIslamic teachings encourage trading (and condemn usury or interest).\nJudeao-Christian teachings do not prohibit trade. They do prohibit fraud and dishonest measures. Historically they forbade charging interest on loans.\nDevelopment of money.\nThe first instances of money were objects with intrinsic value. This is called commodity money and includes any commonly available commodity that has intrinsic value; historical examples include pigs, rare seashells, whale's teeth, and (often) cattle. In medieval Iraq, bread was used as an early form of money. In the Aztec Empire, under the rule of Montezuma cocoa beans became legitimate currency.\nCurrency was introduced as standardised money to facilitate a wider exchange of goods and services. This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years.\nNumismatists have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of precious metal.\nTrends.\nDoha rounds.\nThe Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations aimed to lower barriers to trade around the world, with a focus on making trade more fair for developing countries. Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich developed countries, represented by the G20, and the major developing countries. Agricultural subsidies are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been the hardest to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on trade facilitation and capacity building. The Doha round began in Doha, Qatar.\nChina.\nBeginning around 1978, the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) began an experiment in economic reform. In contrast to the previous Soviet-style centrally planned economy, the new measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private investment, particularly by farmers, which led to increased productivity and output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) Special Economic Zones located along the South-east coast.\nThe reforms proved spectacularly successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, price and demand. In real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by 1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978 base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels. International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5 years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level. In 2008, China's two-way trade totaled US$2.56 trillion.\nIn 1991 China joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, a trade-promotion forum. In 2001, it also joined the World Trade Organization.\nInternational trade.\nInternational trade is the exchange of goods and services across national borders. In most countries, it represents a significant part of GDP. While international trade has been present throughout much of history (see Silk Road, Amber Road), its economic, social, and political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of Industrialization, advanced transportation, globalization, multinational corporations, and outsourcing.\nEmpirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the contrast between countries such as South Korea, which adopted a policy of export-oriented industrialization, and India, which historically had a more closed policy. South Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions.\nTrade sanctions.\nTrade sanctions against a specific country are sometimes imposed, in order to punish that country for some action. An embargo, a severe form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country on another. For example, the United States has had an embargo against Cuba for over 60 years. Embargoes are usually on a temporary basis. For example, Armenia put a temporary embargo on Turkish products and bans any imports from Turkey on December 31, 2020. The situation is prompted by food security concerns given Turkey's hostile attitude towards Armenia.\nFair trade.\nThe \"fair trade\" movement, also known as the \"trade justice\" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of goods, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.\nImporting firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of employment and commercial law. Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. Non-governmental organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements. As such, it is a form of Protectionism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Classically the term tambourine denotes an instrument with a drumhead, though some variants may not have a head. Tambourines are often used with regular percussion sets. They can be mounted, for example on a stand as part of a drum kit (and played with drum sticks), or they can be held in the hand and played by tapping, hitting, or shaking the instrument.\nTambourines come in many shapes with the most common being circular. It is found in many forms of music: Albanian folk music, Arabic folk music, Balkan folk music, Israeli folk music, Turkish folk music, Greek folk music, Italian folk music, French folk music, classical music, Spanish folk music, Persian music, samba, gospel music, pop music, country music, and rock music.\nHistory.\nThe origin of the tambourine is unknown, but it appears in historical writings as early as 1700 BC and was used by ancient musicians first in Ancient Egypt, the Ancient Near East and eventually to Greece and other places. The tambourine passed to Europe by way of merchants or musicians. Tambourines were used in ancient Egypt, where they were known as the tof to the Hebrews, who mainly used the instrument in religious contexts. The word \"tambourine\" finds its origins in French \"tambourin\", which referred to a long narrow drum used in Provence, the word being a diminutive of \"tambour\" \"drum,\" altered by influence of Arabic \"tunbur\" \"drum\". from the Middle Persian word \"tamb\u016br\" \"lute, drum\".\nPlaying.\nThe tambourine can be held in the hand or mounted on a stand, and can be played in numerous ways, from stroking or shaking the jingles to striking it sharply with the hand or a stick or using the tambourine to strike the leg or hip.\nTambourine rolls.\nThere are several ways to achieve a tambourine roll. The easiest method is to rapidly rotate the hand holding the tambourine back and forth, pivoting at the wrist.\nThumb roll.\nAn advanced playing technique is known as the thumb or finger roll. The middle finger or thumb is moved over the skin or rim of the tambourine, producing a fast roll from the jingles on the instrument. The thumb or middle finger of the hand not holding the tambourine is run around the head of the instrument approximately one centimeter from the rim with some pressure applied. If performed correctly, the finger should bounce along the head rapidly, producing the roll. Usually, the end of the roll is articulated using the heel of the hand or another finger. To perform this technique, the percussionist usually lightly licks the tip of their thumb or uses beeswax or rosin. These materials increase friction making it easier to execute. A continuous roll can be achieved by moving the thumb in a \"figure of 8\" pattern around the head.\nPopular music.\nEurope.\nVarious European folk traditions include the tambourine. The Romani people used the tambourine as a percussion instrument, and it was often passed around the audience to collect money after a performance. In the late 1700s, the tambourine had a surge in popularity in England, with some composers of salon music writing parts for tambourine, indicating as many as 30 different playing strokes or moves. The tambourines of this era often had a circular hole in the frame for the thumb, as one of the moves was to spin the tambourine on the upright thumb. In the late 19th century, The Salvation Army codified the tambourine as one of their important rhythm instruments. They preferred the term \"timbrel\" which was taken from the Bible. By 1945, Salvation Army performances often entailed elaborate tambourine choreography performed by squads in para-military style, more for visual appeal than for musicality.\nAfrican American influence.\nAfrican American slaves were denied drums which might be used for long-distance communication. To supply rhythm in music, they turned to smaller percussion instruments such as the bones and the tambourine, as well as clapping and body percussion. The tambourine could accompany the singing of spirituals, and it was used for celebrations and dancing. The tambourine became one of the main instruments of the American minstrel show in the early 1800s, often performed by whites in blackface such as Ned Christy, or sometimes by actual black performers. On stage, the tambourine and bones players in minstrelsy stood to the far left and far right of the Interlocutor (master of ceremonies) and were titled Brother Tambo and Brother Bones: because of their position they were called the end men. The tambourine was also used in some vaudeville acts, including the 1840s dance and musical performances of Master Juba who was able to elicit a wide range of sounds from the instrument including the chugging of a steam train. Used for Pentecostal praise in revival meetings in the early 20th century, by the 1920s the tambourine was firmly established as the primary percussion instrument of gospel music. The tambourine was played by gospel groups and choirs, and carried prominently by singers who did not otherwise play an instrument, notably by Bessie Jones and Luther Magby.\nAt the same time, the tambourine expanded from gospel music to various forms of African American popular music including blues and jazz. For instance, singer and guitarist Blind Roosevelt Graves was accompanied by his brother Uaroy on tambourine and voice, singing both sacred and secular songs. Singer-songwriter Josh White got his start as a child performing for handouts in the street with an exuberant tambourine performance, beating the instrument's drumhead on his elbows, knees, and head.\nIn the 1950s as gospel elements were incorporated into rhythm and blues by African American singers such as Ray Charles, the tambourine often accompanied the changes. It continued its foray into popular music within the music of Motown. Motown singers and musicians often grew up with gospel music, and they carried the tambourine into pop performance. The Supremes performed with two tambourines \u2013 more for choreography than percussion \u2013 played by Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson standing apart from Diana Ross. Jack Ashford's distinctive tambourine playing was a dominant part of the rhythm section on many Motown records, for instance on the Miracles tune \"Going to a Go-Go\", and Marvin Gaye's \"How Sweet It Is\".\nInspired by African American examples, musicians of all races have used the tambourine in modern pop music. It was featured in \"Green Tambourine\", a busking-oriented song from the Lemon Pipers, a 1960s white American band. Similarly, the Byrds released a hit version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" in 1965, a folk rock and psychedelic rock recording of a song written by Bob Dylan. The tambourine part of the song serves to drive the beat forward.\nSingers who rarely play an instrument are likely to play the tambourine at concerts: among the most well-known examples are Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison of the Doors, Janis Joplin leading Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Stevie Nicks as part of Fleetwood Mac and as a solo performer. Very often, the instrument used in pop music is the headless tambourine or \"jingle ring\", lacking a drum head. The singer should, however, play the tambourine with the overall song arrangement in mind; in some cases, band members have purposely hidden the tambourine from an irresponsible lead singer who disregards the interplay of rhythm. On the other hand, skilled performers such as Jagger have brought a fine sense of timing to their tambourine playing. In the Rolling Stones' 1964 U.S. single of \"Time Is on My Side\", the less-known version, Jagger lays the tambourine on the front of the beat while Charlie Watts holds the snare to the back of the beat, which allows the longer decay time of the tambourine to synchronise with the snare at the end. The result is an intentional feeling of running to catch up.\nIn jazz, the tambourine was used prominently but non-traditionally by percussionist Joe Texidor who backed Rahsaan Roland Kirk in 1969 on \"Volunteered Slavery\". In 1960 when Nina Simone wanted to play the old minstrel song \"Li'l Liza Jane\" at the Newport Jazz Festival, she said \"Where's my tambourine?\", as heard on the album \"Nina Simone at Newport\". Jazz drummer Herlin Riley often takes the stage while beating and shaking a tambourine, and he is featured on the tambourine in Wynton Marsalis's jazz oratorio \"Blood on the Fields\", which tells the story of slavery in the US.\nJazz, pop and rock drummers sometimes mount a headless tambourine in the drum kit. Some position the tambourine above the toms in the same manner as a cymbal, for instance, Nathan Followill of Kings of Leon, and Larry Mullen Jr of U2. Bill Ward of Black Sabbath connected a tambourine to a foot pedal, for his left foot to operate like a hi-hat. John Bonham of Led Zeppelin simply mounted a tambourine above the hi-hat for extra sonic colour. The Subdudes, a roots rock group from New Orleans, opted for a tambourine player, Steve Amed\u00e9e, instead of a drummer.\nIn classical music.\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart was among the earliest western composers to include the tambourine in his compositions. Since the late eighteenth century it has become more common in western orchestral music, as exemplified in some of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's dance pieces from the \"Nutcracker Suite\". Gustav Holst's seven-movement orchestral suite \"The Planets\" also features the tambourine in several places, especially in the \"Jupiter\" movement. Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\" opera includes the famous \"Habanera\" aria which has a series of tambourine strikes in each chorus.\nSimilar instruments.\nBuben.\nBuben ( in Russian, in Ukrainian, in Slovenian, in Czech, in Polish) is a musical instrument of the percussion family similar to a tambourine. A buben consists of a wooden or metal hoop with a tight membrane stretched over one of its sides (some bubens have no membrane at all). Certain kinds of bubens are equipped with clanking metal rings, plates, cymbals, or little bells. It is held in the hand and can be played in numerous ways, from stroking or shaking the jingles to striking it sharply with hand. It is used for rhythmical accompaniment during dances, soloist or choral singing. Buben is often used by some folk and professional bands, as well as orchestras.\nThe name is related to Greek language ('low and hollow sound') and ('a breed of bees') and related to Indo-Aryan ('bee') and English \"bee\". Buben is known to have existed in many countries since time immemorial, especially in the East. There are many kinds of bubens, including , \"daf\", or (Azerbaijan), or (Armenia), (Georgia), (Uzbekistan and Tajikistan), or (Iran), (Arab countries), (Spain). In Kievan Rus, drums and military timpani were referred to as \"buben\".\nDaf.\nA daf () is a large-sized tambourine or Perso-Arabic frame drum used to accompany both popular and classical music in Iran, Azerbaijan, the Arab world, Turkey (where it is called ), Uzbekistan (where it is called ), the Indian subcontinent (where it is known as the ) and Turkmenistan. Daf typically indicates the beat and tempo of the music being played, thus acts like the conductor in the monophonic oriental music. The Persian poet Rudaki, who widely used names of the musical instruments in his poems, mentions the daf and the tambourine () in a Ruba'i: A common use of tambourine (Daf) is by Albanians. They are often played by women and bridesmaids in wedding cases to lead the ceremony when bride walks down the aisle.\nPandeiro.\nOriginated in Galicia or Portugal, the pandeiro was brought to Brazil by the Portuguese settlers. It is a hand percussion instrument consisting of a single tension-headed drum with jingles in the frame. It is very typical of more traditional Brazilian music.\nPanderoa.\nThe Basque pandero is a folk instrument currently played along with the trikitixa (basque diatonic accordion) in a duo most of the time. Sometimes the players, who play in festivities to enliven the atmosphere or less frequently at onstage performances, sing along. At times the pandero accompanies the alboka or txistu too. Yet these kinds of duos have not always been the case. As attested http://, the youth gathered to dance to the rhythm of the bare pandero, with no other music instrument implicated but the player's (a woman's) voice.\nRiq.\nThe riq (also spelled riqq or rik) is a type of tambourine used as a traditional instrument in Arabic music. It is an important instrument in both folk and classical music throughout the Arabic-speaking world. The instruments are widely known as \"shakers\".\nDayereh.\nA dayereh (or doyra, dojra, dajre, doira, daire) is a medium-sized frame drum with jingles used to accompany both popular and classical music in Iran (Persia), the Balkans, and many central Asian countries such as Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. It is a percussion instrument, and is something intermediate between a drum and a tambourine.\nKanjira.\nThe kanjira or ganjira is a South Indian frame drum of the tambourine family. It is mostly used in Carnatic music concerts (South Indian classical music) as a supporting instrument for the \"mridangam\". The instrument is called ( in the northern Hindi-speaking parts of India and is a common instrument in orchestras and solos. Nepal also has a variety of tambourines, going by the names , \"damphu\" (), , and ().\nTar.\nTar () is a single-headed frame drum of Turkish origin, but is commonly played in North Africa and the Middle East.\nTimbrel.\nTimbrel or tabret (the of the ancient Hebrews, the \"deff\" of Islam, the \"adufe\" of the Moors of Spain), the principal musical instrument of percussion of the Israelites, similar to the modern tambourine.\nRabana.\nA rabana (plural \"raban\") is a one-sided traditional tambourine played with the hands, used in Sri Lanka.\nRebana.\nRebana is a Malay tambourine that is used in Islamic devotional music in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29773", "revid": "9910201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29773", "title": "Tennis", "text": "Racket sport\nTennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. If a player is unable to return the ball successfully, the opponent scores a point.\nTennis can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users, and is played by people at every level of society and across all ages. The original forms of tennis developed in France during the late Middle Ages. The modern form of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.\nThe rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. The two exceptions being the server needing to have one foot on the ground at all times prior to 1961, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.\nTennis has millions of recreational players and is a popular spectator sport worldwide. The four Grand Slam tournaments, also known as \"majors\" are especially popular and are considered the height of competitive tennis. The four Grand Slam tournaments are the Australian Open, played on hardcourts; the French Open, played on red clay courts; Wimbledon, played on grass courts; and the US Open, also played on hardcourts. Tennis was one of the original Olympic sports, and has been consistently part of the Summer Olympic Games since 1988.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nPredecessors.\nHistorians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th-century northern France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of \"jeu de paume\" (\"game of the palm\"), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris \"around the end of the 13th\u00a0century\". In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. In June\u00a01316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne, and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis\u00a0X is history's first tennis player known by name. Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France, who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace.\nThe word \"tennis\" probably comes from the French term \"tenez\", which can be translated as \"hold!\", \"receive!\" or \"take!\", an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent. It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors, where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis.\nAn epitaph in St Michael's Church, Coventry, written c.\u20091705, read, in part:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nHere lyes an old toss'd Tennis Ball:\nWas racketted, from spring to fall,\nWith so much heat and so much hast,\nTime's arm for shame grew tyred at last.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nDuring the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England.\nThe invention of the first lawn mower in Britain in 1830 is believed to have been a catalyst for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis, most football codes, lawn bowls and others.\nOrigins of the modern game.\nBetween 1859 and 1865, Harry Gem, a solicitor, and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the Basque ball game pelota, which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in Birmingham, England. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, Leamington Spa. This is where \"lawn tennis\" was used as the name of an activity by a club for the first time.\nIn \"Tennis: A Cultural History\", Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on 8\u00a0December 1874, British army officer Walter Clopton Wingfield wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he (Wingfield) had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis \"for a year and a half\". In December\u00a01873, Wingfield designed and patented a game which he called \"sphairistik\u00e8\" (, meaning \"ball-playing\"), and which was soon known simply as \"sticky\" \u2013 for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, Wales. According to R. D. C. Evans, turfgrass agronomist, \"Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis.\" According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield \"popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game \u2013 and most importantly you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874.\" The world's oldest annual tennis tournament took place at Leamington Lawn Tennis Club in Birmingham in 1874. This was three years before the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club would hold its first championships at Wimbledon, in 1877. The first Championships culminated in a significant debate on how to standardise the rules.\nIn the United States in 1874, Mary Ewing Outerbridge, a young socialite, returned from Bermuda with a \"sphairistik\u00e8\" set. She became fascinated by the game of tennis after watching British army officers play. She laid out a tennis court at the Staten Island Cricket Club at Camp Washington, Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York. The first American National championship was played there in September 1880. An Englishman named O.E. Woodhouse won the singles title, and a silver cup worth $100, by defeating Canadian I. F. Hellmuth. There was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair. There were different rules at each club. The ball in Boston was larger than the one normally used in New York.\nOn 21 May 1881, the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world was formed, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) in order to standardize the rules and organize competitions. The US National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at the Newport Casino, Newport, Rhode Island. The US National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia.\nTennis also became popular in France, where the French Championships date to 1891, although until 1925 they were open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs. Thus, Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open and the Australian Open (dating to 1905) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis. Together, these four events are called the Majors or \"Slams\" (a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball).\nIn 1913, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), now the International Tennis Federation (ITF), was founded and established three official tournaments as the major championships of the day. The World Grass Court Championships were awarded to Great Britain. The World Hard Court Championships were awarded to France; the term \"hard court\" was used for clay courts at the time. Some tournaments were held in Belgium instead. And the World Covered Court Championships for indoor courts were awarded annually; Sweden, France, Great Britain, Denmark, Switzerland and Spain each hosted the tournament. At a meeting held on 16\u00a0March 1923 in Paris, the title \"World Championship\" was dropped and a new category of \"Official Championship\" was created for events in Great Britain, France, the US and Australia \u2013 today's Grand Slam events. The impact on the four recipient nations to replace the \"world championships\" with \"official championships\" was simple in a general sense: each became a major nation of the federation with enhanced voting power, and each now operated a major event.\nThe comprehensive rules promulgated in 1924 by the ILTF have remained largely stable in the ensuing 80 years, the one major change being the addition of the \"tiebreak\" system designed by Jimmy Van Alen. That same year, tennis withdrew from the Olympics after the 1924 Games, but returned 60 years later as a 21-and-under demonstration event in 1984. This reinstatement was credited by the efforts of then ITF president Philippe Chatrier, ITF general secretary David Gray and ITF vice president Pablo Llorens, with support from International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch. The success of the event was overwhelming, and the IOC decided to reintroduce tennis as a full-medal sport at Seoul in 1988.\nThe Davis Cup, an annual competition between men's national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous competition for women's national teams, the Fed Cup, was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the ITF.\nIn 1926, promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. The most notable of these early professionals were the American Vinnie Richards and the Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen. Players \"turned pro\" would no longer be permitted to compete in the major (amateur) tournaments.\nIn 1968, commercial pressures and rumours of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their living from tennis. With the beginning of the Open Era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights, tennis's popularity has spread worldwide, and the sport has shed its middle-class English-speaking image (although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists).\nIn 1954, Van Alen founded the International Tennis Hall of Fame, a nonprofit museum in Newport, Rhode Island. The building contains a large collection of tennis memorabilia as well as a hall of fame honouring prominent members and tennis players from all over the world.\nEquipment.\nPart of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racket and balls.\nRackets.\nThe components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.\nUnder modern rules of tennis, the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines;\nThe rules regarding rackets have changed over time, as material and engineering advances have been made. For example, the maximum length of the frame had been until 1997, when it was shortened to .\nMany companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets. Wilson, Head and Babolat are three of the most commonly used brands; however, many more companies exist. The same companies sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become better known by the public.\nStrings.\nThere are multiple types of tennis strings, including natural gut and synthetic strings made from materials such as nylon, kevlar, or polyester.\nNatural gut.\nThe first type of tennis strings available were natural gut strings, introduced by Babolat. They were the only type used until synthetic strings were introduced in the 1950s. Natural gut strings are still used frequently by players such as Roger Federer. They are made from cow intestines, and provide increased power, and are easier on the arm than most strings.\nSynthetic.\nMost synthetic strings are made from monofilament or multifiliament nylon strings. Monofilament strings are cheap to buy, and are used widely by many recreational level players for their all round performance, while multifilament strings are created to mimic natural gut more closely by weaving together fibres, but are generally more expensive than their monofilament counterparts. Polyester strings allow for more spin on the ball than any other string, due to their firm strings, while keeping control of the ball, and this is why many players use them, especially higher player ones. Kevlar tennis strings are highly durable, and are mostly used by players that frequently break strings, because they maintain tension well, but these strings can be stiff on the arm.\nHybrid strings.\nHybrid stringing is when a tennis racket is strung with two different strings for the mains (the vertical strings) and the crosses (the horizontal strings). This is most commonly done with two different strings that are made of different materials, but can also be done with two different types of the same string. A notable example of a player using hybrid strings is Roger Federer, using natural gut strings in his mains and polyester strings in his crosses.\nBalls.\nTennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers. Modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as . Balls must weigh between . Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the United States and Europe. Although the process of producing the balls has remained virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the Far East. The relocation is due to cheaper labour costs and materials in the region. Tournaments that are played under the ITF Rules of Tennis must use balls that are approved by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and be named on the official ITF list of approved tennis balls.\nManner of play.\nCourt.\nTennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77\u00a0m) long, and wide for singles matches and for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than . The net is high at the posts and high in the centre. The net posts are outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, outside the singles court on each side.\nThe modern tennis court owes its design to Major Walter Clopton Wingfield. In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his stick\u00e9 tennis (sphairistike). This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle.\nTennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces. Grass, clay, and hard courts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. Artificial turf courts can also be found.\nLines.\nThe lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the centre of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the centre mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines; they are the boundaries for doubles matches. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines, and are the boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the centre of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.\nThe line dividing the service line in two is called the centre line or centre service line. The boxes this centre line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player's position, they have to hit the ball into one of these when serving. A ball is out only if none of it has hit the area inside the lines, or the line, upon its first bounce. All lines are required to be between in width, with the exception of the baseline which can be up to wide, although in practice it is often the same width as the others.\nPlay of a single point.\nThe players or teams start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the \"server\", and the opposing player is the \"receiver\". The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game between the two players or teams. For each point, the server starts behind the baseline, between the centre mark and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net. When the receiver is ready, the server will serve, although the receiver must play to the pace of the server.\nFor a service to be legal, the ball must travel over the net without touching it into the diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a \"let\" or \"net service\", which is void, and the server retakes that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net. There is also a \"foot fault\" when a player's foot touches the baseline or an extension of the centre mark before the ball is hit. If the second service, after a fault, is also a fault, the server \"double faults\", and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service.\nA legal service starts a \"rally\", in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the server's court, before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel over or round the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.\nScoring.\nGame, set, match.\nGame.\nA game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as \"love\", \"15\", \"30\", and \"40\", respectively. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as \"40\u201340\", but rather as \"deuce\". If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than their opponent, the score of the game is \"advantage\" for the player in the lead. During informal games, advantage can also be called \"ad in\" or \"van in\" when the serving player is ahead, and \"ad out\" or \"van out\" when the receiving player is ahead; alternatively, either player may simply call out \"my ad\" or \"your ad\".\nThe score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first. In tournament play, the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g., \"15\u2013love\") after each point. At the end of a game, the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score.\nSet.\nA set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7\u20135. If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6\u20136) a \"tiebreak\" is played. A tiebreak, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7\u20136. A tiebreak game can be won by scoring at least seven points and at least two points more than the opponent. In a tiebreak, two players serve by 'ABBA' system which has been proven to be fair. If a tiebreak is not played, the set is referred to as an \"advantage set\", where the set continues without limit until one player leads by a two-game margin. A \"love set\" means that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a \"jam donut\" in the US. In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. The final score in sets is always read with the winning player's score first, e.g. \"6\u20132, 4\u20136, 6\u20130, 7\u20135\".\nMatch.\nA match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five \"sets\" system. On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match. Only in the final sets of matches at the Fed Cup are tiebreaks not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, occasionally leading to some remarkably long matches.\nIn tournament play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase \"Game, set, match\" followed by the winning person's or team's name.\nSpecial point terms.\nGame point.\nA \"game point\" occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40\u2013love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.\nBreak point.\nA \"break point\" occurs if the receiver, not the server, has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30\u201340 or advantage), two (score of 15\u201340) or three (score of love\u201340) consecutive chances to win the game has \"break point\", \"double break point\" or \"triple break point\", respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have \"converted\" their break point. If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a \"failure to convert.\" Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as \"breaking serve\", as the receiver has disrupted, or \"broken\" the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as \"breaking back\". Except where tiebreaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set (otherwise a two-game lead would never occur).\n From 'No advantage'. Scoring method created by Jimmy Van Alen. The first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by World Team Tennis professional competition, ATP tours, WTA tours, ITF Pro Doubles and ITF Junior Doubles.\n Instead of playing multiple sets, players may play one \"pro set\". A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. A 12-point tiebreak is usually played when the score is 8\u20138 (or 10\u201310). These are often played with no-ad scoring.\n This is sometimes played instead of a third set. A match tiebreak (also called \"super tiebreak\") is played like a regular tiebreak, but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. Match tiebreaks are used in the Hopman Cup, Grand Slams (excluding Wimbledon) and the Olympic Games for mixed doubles; on the ATP (since 2006), WTA (since 2007) and ITF (excluding four Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play.\n Fast4 is a shortened format that offers a \"fast\" alternative, with four points, four games and four rules: there are no advantage scores, lets are played, tiebreakers apply at three games all, with it being first to five points with a \"sudden death\" point at four points all, and the first to four games wins the set. In the event of a no advantage deuce, the receiver gets to choose the service side. If a let occurs, the point continues as normal, and the non-receiver (in a doubles game) is permitted to return the serve. When players swap sides, they are not permitted to sit down and must be ready to play within sixty seconds. Between sets, players are permitted to sit down, and must be ready to play within ninety seconds.\nRule variations.\nAnother, however informal, tennis format is called Canadian doubles. This involves three players, with one person playing against a doubles team. The single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. Conversely, the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot. The scoring is the same as for a regular game. This format is not sanctioned by any official body.\n\"Australian doubles\", another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the Canadian doubles style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game, each player taking a turn at playing alone against the other two. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve.\nWheelchair tennis can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility. An extra bounce is permitted. This rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and able-bodied matches. It is possible for a doubles team to consist of a wheelchair player and an able-bodied player (referred to as \"one-up, one-down\"), or for a wheelchair player to play against an able-bodied player. In such cases, the extra bounce is permitted for the wheelchair users only.\nMatch play.\nContinuity.\nA tennis match is intended to be continuous. Because stamina is a relevant factor, arbitrary delays are not permitted. In most cases, service is required to occur no more than 20 seconds after the end of the previous point. This is increased to 90 seconds when the players change ends (after every odd-numbered game), and a 2-minute break is permitted between sets. Other than this, breaks are permitted only when forced by events beyond the players' control, such as rain, damaged footwear, damaged racket, or the need to retrieve an errant ball. Should a player be deemed to be stalling repeatedly, the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of \"point\", \"game\", and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit.\nIn the event of a rain delay, darkness or other external conditions halting play, the match is resumed at a later time, with the same score as at the time of the delay, and each player at the same end of the court as when rain halted play, or as close to the same relative compass point if play is resumed on a different court.\nBall changes.\nBalls wear out quickly in serious play and, therefore, in ATP and WTA tournaments, they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games, because the first set of balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up. In ITF tournaments like Fed Cup, the balls are changed after every eleven games (rather than nine) with the first change occurring after only nine games (instead of seven). An exception is that a ball change may not take place at the beginning of a tiebreaker, in which case the ball change is delayed until the beginning of the second game of the next set. As a courtesy to the receiver, the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used as a reminder that they are using new balls. Continuity of the balls' condition is considered part of the game, so if a re-warm-up is required after an extended break in play (usually due to rain), then the re-warm-up is done using a separate set of balls, and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes.\nOn-court coaching.\nA recent rule change is to allow coaching on court on a limited basis during a match. This has been introduced in women's tennis for WTA Tour events in 2009 and allows the player to request her coach once per set.\nStance.\nStance refers to the way a player prepares themselves in order to best be able to return a shot. Essentially, it enables them to move quickly in order to achieve a particular stroke. There are four main stances in modern tennis: open, semi-open, closed, and neutral. All four stances involve the player crouching in some manner: as well as being a more efficient striking posture, it allows them to isometrically preload their muscles in order to play the stroke more dynamically. What stance is selected is strongly influenced by shot selection. A player may quickly alter their stance depending on the circumstances and the type of shot they intend to play. Any given stance also alters dramatically based upon the actual playing of the shot with dynamic movements and shifts of body weight occurring.\nOpen stance.\nThis is the most common stance in tennis. The player's feet are placed parallel to the net. They may be pointing sideways, directly at the net or diagonally towards it. This stance allows for a high degree of torso rotation which can add significant power to the stroke. This process is sometimes likened to the coiling and uncoiling of a spring. i.e. the torso is rotated as a means of preloading the muscular system in preparation for playing the stroke: this is the coiling phase. When the stroke is played the torso rotates to face forwards again, called uncoiling, and adds significant power to the stroke. A disadvantage of this stance is that it does not always allow 'for proper weight transfer and maintenance of balance' when making powerful strokes. It is commonly used for forehand strokes; double-handed backhands can also be made effectively from it.\nSemi-open stance.\nThis stance is somewhere between open and closed and is a very flexible stance. The feet are aligned diagonally towards the net. It allows for a lot of shoulder rotation and the torso can be coiled, before being uncoiled into the shot in order to increase the power of the shot. It is commonly used in modern tennis especially by 'top professional players on the forehand'. Two-handed backhands can also be employed from this stance.\nClosed stance.\nThe closed stance is the least commonly used of the three main stances. One foot is placed further towards the net with the other foot further from it; there is a diagonal alignment between the feet. It allows for effective torso rotation in order to increase the power of the shot. It is usually used to play backhand shots and it is rare to see forehand shots played from it. A stroke from this stance may entail the rear foot coming completely off the floor with bodyweight being transferred entirely to the front foot.\nNeutral stance.\nThis is sometimes also referred to as the square stance. One foot is positioned closer to the net and ahead of the other which is behind and in line with it. Both feet are aligned at a 90 degree angle to the net. The neutral stance is often taught early because 'It allows beginners to learn about shifting weight and rotation of the body.' Forehands and backhands may be made from it.\nShots.\nCompetent tennis players have eight basic shots in their repertoire: the serve, forehand, backhand, volley, half-volley, overhead smash, drop shot, and lob.\nGrip.\nA grip is a way of holding the racket in order to hit shots during a match. The grip affects the angle of the racket face when it hits the ball and influences the pace, spin, and placement of the shot. Players use various grips during play, including the Continental (The \"Handshake Grip\"), Eastern (either semi-eastern or full eastern, usually used for backhands), and Western (semi-western or full western, usually for forehand grips) grips. Most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting; for example, slice shots and serves call for a Continental grip.\nServe.\nA serve (or, more formally, a \"service\") in tennis is a shot to start a point. The serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a \"let\" and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. There can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get one more try to get the serve in the box.\nExperienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement. The server may employ different types of serve including flat serve, topspin serve, slice serve, and kick (American twist) serve. A reverse type of spin serve is hit in a manner that spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server, the spin direction depending upon right- or left-handedness. If the ball is spinning counterclockwise, it will curve right from the hitter's point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise.\nSome servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; however, advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an \"ace\".\nForehand.\nFor a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. There are various grips for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the \"continental\", the \"eastern\", the \"semi-western\", and the \"western\". For a number of years, the small, frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a \"western\" grip. Few top players used the \"western\" grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the \"western\" forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s, the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. Players such as Monica Seles or France's Fabrice Santoro and Marion Bartoli are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands.\nBackhand.\nFor right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body. It can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. For most of the 20th century, the backhand was performed with one hand, using either an \"eastern\" or a \"continental\" grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich, but they were lone exceptions. The two-handed grip gained popularity in the 1970s as Bj\u00f6rn Borg, Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, and later Mats Wilander and Marat Safin used it to great effect, and it is now used by a large number of the world's best players, including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams.\nTwo hands give the player more control, while one hand can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. Reach is also limited with the two-handed shot. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles, use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.\nOther shots.\nA \"volley\" is a shot returned to the opponent in mid-air before the ball bounces, generally performed near the net, and is usually made with a stiff-wristed punching motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent's court. The \"half volley\" is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, also generally in the vicinity of the net, and played with the racket close to the ground. The \"swinging volley\" is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net. It is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent, as it returns the ball into the opponent's court much faster than a standard volley.\nFrom a poor defensive position on the baseline, the \"lob\" can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, an opponent near the net may then hit an \"overhead smash\", a hard, serve-like shot, to try to end the point.\nA difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player. When the contact point is higher than the reach of a two-handed backhand, most players will try to execute a high slice (under the ball or sideways). Fewer players attempt the backhand sky-hook or smash. Rarely, a player will go for a high topspin backhand, while themselves in the air. A successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing, with less margin of error than the lower contact point backhands, since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play.\nIf their opponent is deep in their court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected \"drop shot\", by softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it. Advanced players will often apply back spin to a drop shot, causing the ball to \"skid\" upon landing and bounce sideways, with less forward momentum toward their opponent, or even backwards towards the net, thus making it even more difficult to return.\nTournaments.\nTournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. Common tournament configurations include men's singles, women's singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net. Tournaments may be organized for specific age groups, with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. Example of this include the Orange Bowl and Les Petits As junior tournaments. There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis. In the four Grand Slam tournaments, the singles draws are limited to 128 players for each gender.\nMost large tournaments seed players, but players may also be matched by their skill level. According to how well a person does in sanctioned play, a player is given a rating that is adjusted periodically to maintain competitive matches. For example, the United States Tennis Association administers the National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP), which rates players between 1.0 and 7.0 in 1/2 point increments. Average club players under this system would rate 3.0\u20134.5 while world class players would be 7.0 on this scale.\nGrand Slam tournaments.\nThe four Grand Slam tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis events in the world. They are held annually and comprise, in chronological order, the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Apart from the Olympic Games, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, and Hopman Cup, they are the only tournaments regulated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The ITF's national associations, Tennis Australia (Australian Open), the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tennis (French Open), the Lawn Tennis Association (Wimbledon) and the United States Tennis Association (US Open) are delegated the responsibility to organize these events.\nAside from the historical significance of these events, they also carry larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments, the ATP Masters 1000 (men) and Premier events (women). Another distinguishing feature is the number of players in the singles draw. There are 128, more than any other professional tennis tournament. This draw is composed of 32 seeded players, other players ranked in the world's top 100, qualifiers, and players who receive invitations through wild cards. Grand Slam men's tournaments have best-of-five set matches while the women play best-of-three. Grand Slam tournaments are among the small number of events that last two weeks, the others being the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Masters.\nCurrently, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have mixed doubles contests. Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and junior tennis competitions. These tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies. For example, players at Wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white. Andre Agassi chose to skip Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 citing the event's traditionalism, particularly its \"predominantly white\" dress code. Wimbledon has its own particular methods for disseminating tickets, often leading tennis fans to follow complex procedures to obtain tickets.\nMen's tournament structure.\nATP 1000.\nThe ATP Masters 1000 is a group of nine tournaments that form the second-highest echelon in men's tennis. Each event is held annually, and a win at one of these events is worth 1000 ranking points. When the ATP, led by Hamilton Jordan, began running the men's tour in 1990, the directors designated the top nine tournaments, outside of the Grand Slam events, as \"Super 9\" events. In 2000 this became the Tennis Masters Series and in 2004 the ATP Masters Series. In November at the end of the tennis year, the world's top eight players compete in the ATP Finals, a tournament with a rotating locale. It is currently held in Turin.\nIn August 2007 the ATP announced major changes to the tour that were introduced in 2009. The Masters Series was renamed to the \"ATP Masters 1000\", the addition of the number 1000 referring to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of each tournament. Contrary to earlier plans, the number of tournaments was not reduced from nine to eight and the Monte-Carlo Masters remains part of the series although, unlike the other events, it does not have a mandatory player commitment. The Hamburg Masters has been downgraded to a 500-point event. The Madrid Masters moved to May and onto clay courts, and a new tournament in Shanghai took over Madrid's former indoor October slot. As of 2011 six of the nine \"1000\" level tournaments are combined ATP and WTA events.\n500 and 250 series.\nThe third and fourth tier of men's tennis tournaments are formed by the ATP 500 series, consisting of 11 tournaments, and the ATP 250 series with 40 tournaments. Like the ATP Masters 1000, these events offer various amounts of prize money and the numbers refer to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of a tournament. The Dubai Tennis Championships offer the largest financial incentive to players, with total prize money of US$2,313,975 (2012). These series have various draws of 28, 32, 48 and 56 for singles and 16 and 24 for doubles. It is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four 500 events, including at least one after the US Open.\nChallenger Tour and Futures tournaments.\nThe Challenger Tour for men is the lowest level of tournament administered by the ATP. It is composed of about 150 events and, as a result, features a more diverse range of countries hosting events. The majority of players use the Challenger Series at the beginning of their career to work their way up the rankings. Andre Agassi, between winning Grand Slam tournaments, plummeted to World No. 141 and used Challenger Series events for match experience and to progress back up the rankings. The Challenger Series offers prize funds of between US$25,000 and US$150,000.\nBelow the Challenger Tour are the Futures tournaments, events on the ITF Men's Circuit. These tournaments also contribute towards a player's ATP rankings points. Futures Tournaments offer prize funds of between US$10,000 and US$15,000. Approximately 530 Futures Tournaments are played each year.\nWomen's tournament structure.\nIn 2021, the WTA rebranded, resembling the men's tournament series, and also providing extra simplicity for fans and consumers. The numbers do not indicate ranking points, or prize money, but is a system to help define different levels of women's tennis.\nWTA 1000.\nThe WTA 1000 Tournaments (formerly the Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 Tournaments), are a series of seven tournaments that are part of the second-highest tier in women's tennis.\n500 and 250 Series.\nThe third and fourth tier of women's tennis tournaments are formed from the WTA 500 Series (formerly Premier 700), with fifteen tournaments, and the WTA 250 Series (formerly International), consisting of thirty tournaments.\nWTA 125.\nThe WTA 125 Series (formerly 125K Series), is the lowest tier of women's tennis, with fourteen tournaments.\nPlayers.\nProfessional players.\nProfessional tennis players enjoy the same relative perks as most top sports personalities: clothing, equipment and endorsements. Like players of other individual sports such as golf, they are not salaried, but must play and finish highly in tournaments to obtain prize money.\nIn recent years, professional tennis players have been mocked by tabloids and fans for the involuntary or deliberate noise caused by players' grunting. This controversy has spurred the Grand Slam Committee, the International Tennis Association, and the Women's Tennis Association to teach players techniques to avoid grunting.\nSingles and doubles professional careers.\nWhile players are gradually less competitive in singles by their late 20s and early 30s, they can still continue competitively in doubles (as instanced by Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe, who won doubles titles in their 40s).\nIn the Open Era, several female players such as Martina Navratilova, Margaret Court, Martina Hingis, Serena Williams, and Venus Williams (the latter two sisters playing together) have been prolific at both singles and doubles events throughout their careers. John McEnroe is one of the very few professional male players to be top ranked in both singles and doubles at the same time, and Yevgeny Kafelnikov is the most recent male player to win multiple Grand Slams in both singles and doubles during the same period of his career.\nIn terms of public attention and earnings (see below), singles champions have far surpassed their doubles counterparts. The Open Era, particularly the men's side, has seen many top-ranked singles players that only sparingly compete in doubles, while having \"doubles specialists\" who are typically being eliminated early in the singles draw but do well in the doubles portion of a tournament. Notable doubles pairings include The Woodies (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde) and the Bryan brothers (identical twin brothers Robert Charles \"Bob\" Bryan and Michael Carl \"Mike\" Bryan). Woodbridge has disliked the term \"doubles 'specialists'\", saying that he and Woodforde \"set a singles schedule and doubles fitted in around that\", although later in Woodbridge's career he focused exclusively on doubles as his singles ranking fell too low that it was no longer financially viable to recover at that age. Woodbridge noted that while top singles players earn enough that they do not need to nor want to play doubles, he suggested that lower-ranked singles players outside the Top Ten should play doubles to earn more playing time and money.\nOlympics.\nThe Olympics doubles tennis tournament necessitates that both members of a doubles pairing be from the same country, hence several top professional pairs such as Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares cannot compete in the Olympics. Top-ranked singles players that are usually rivals on the professional circuit, such as Boris Becker and Michael Stich, and Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka have formed a rare doubles partnership for the Olympics. Unlike professional tennis tournaments (see below) where singles players receive much more prize money than doubles players, an Olympic medal for both singles and doubles has similar prestige. The Olympics is more of a priority for doubles champions while singles champions often skip the tournament. While the ATP has voted for Olympic results to count towards player ranking points, WTA players voted against it.\nFor the 2000 Olympics, Lisa Raymond was passed over for Team USA in favour of Serena Williams by captain Billie Jean King, even though Raymond was the top-ranked doubles player in the world at the time, and Raymond unsuccessfully challenged the selection.\nPrize money.\nIn professional tennis tournaments such as Wimbledon, the singles competition receives the most prize money and coverage, followed by doubles, and then mixed doubles usually receive the lowest monetary awards. For instance in the US Open as of 2018, the men's and women's singles prize money (US$40,912,000) accounts for 80.9 percent of total player base compensation, while men's and women's doubles (US$6,140,840), men's and women's singles qualifying (US$3,008,000), and mixed doubles (US$505,000) account for 12.1 percent, 5.9 percent, and 1.0 percent, respectively. The singles winner receives US$3,800,000, while the doubles winning pair receives $700,000 and the mixed doubles winning pair receives US$155,000.\nGrand Slam tournament winners.\nThe following players have won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments (active players in bold):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGreatest male players.\nA frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. By a large margin, an Associated Press poll in 1950 named Bill Tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century. From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at Wimbledon three times and the US Championships seven times. In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge \"the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.\" In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever. Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Tony Trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the Open Era, Kramer was the best male champion.\nBy the 1960s, Budge and others had added Pancho Gonzales and Lew Hoad to the list of contenders. Budge reportedly believed that Gonzales was the greatest player ever. Gonzales said about Hoad, \"When Lew's game was at its peak nobody could touch him.\u00a0... I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique.\"\nBefore and during the Open Era, Rod Laver remains the only male player in history to have won the calendar year Grand Slam twice in 1962 and 1969 and also the calendar year Professional Grand Slam in 1967.\nJimmy Connors, Bj\u00f6rn Borg, and John McEnroe had a fierce rivalry in the late 1970s and early 1980s that propelled \"the men's game to new heights of popularity\". Connors had a long and prolific career and holds the Open Era men's singles records of 109 titles including eight Grand Slams, 1,557 matches played, and 1,274 match wins. Borg was regarded by his contemporaries as among the greatest ever, having a calm court demeanor and unrivalled physical conditioning, winning six French Opens and five straight Wimbledon titles, retiring at age 26 when he was still in his prime. McEnroe attained the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles, finishing his career with 77 singles and 78 doubles titles; this remains the highest men's combined total of the Open Era.\nThe Agassi\u2013Sampras rivalry showcased the two best players in the 1990s. Sampras had a precise and powerful serve while Agassi was considered to be one of the best service returners in the history of the game. By the early 2000s, Pete Sampras had won a then-record of 14 Grand Slam titles which was by far the most among his contemporaries. Sampras also held the record for most weeks at No. 1 with 286 until it was broken a decade later by Federer and Djokovic after that. Andre Agassi was the first player to complete the Career Grand Slam on all modern three surfaces (hard, grass, and clay courts) as previous winners of Grand Slam tournaments played in an era of grass and clay only (Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall also won major Pro tournaments on the three surfaces). Agassi also is the only player to win all four Grand Slam titles along with the year-end championships and the olympics. Both Sampras and Agassi are regarded to be among the greatest players of all time.\nBy the early twenty-first century, the 'Big Three' of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have dominated men's singles tennis for two decades, collectively winning 66 major singles tournaments; Djokovic with an all-time record 24 titles, Nadal with 22 and Federer with 20. They have been ranked as world No. 1s in singles for a total 947 weeks (equivalent to 18 years); Djokovic for a record 428 weeks, Federer for 310, and Nadal for 209.\nGreatest female players.\nAs with the men there are frequent discussions about who is the greatest female singles player of all time with Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams being the three players most often nominated.\nIn March 2012 the Tennis Channel published a combined list of the 100 greatest men and women tennis players of all time. It ranked Steffi Graf as the greatest female player (in 3rd place overall), followed by Martina Navratilova (4th place) and Margaret Court (8th place). The rankings were determined by an international panel.\nSportswriter John Wertheim of Sports Illustrated stated in an article in July 2010 that Serena Williams is the greatest female tennis player ever with the argument that \"Head-to-head, on a neutral surface (i.e. hard courts), everyone at their best, I can't help feeling that she crushes the other legends.\". In a reaction to this article Yahoo sports blog Busted Racket published a list of the top-10 women's tennis players of all time placing Martina Navratilova in first spot. This top-10 list was similar to the one published in June 2008 by the Bleacher Report who also ranked Martina Navratilova as the top female player of all time.\nSteffi Graf is considered by some to be the greatest female player. Billie Jean King said in 1999, \"Steffi is definitely the greatest women's tennis player of all time.\" Martina Navratilova has included Graf on her list of great players. In December 1999, Graf was named the greatest female tennis player of the 20th century by a panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press. Tennis writer Steve Flink, in his book \"The Greatest Tennis Matches of the Twentieth Century\", named her as the best female player of the 20th century, directly followed by Martina Navratilova.\n\"Tennis\" magazine selected Martina Navratilova as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1965 through 2005. Tennis historian and journalist Bud Collins has called Navratilova \"arguably, the greatest player of all time.\" Billie Jean King said about Navratilova in 2006, \"She's the greatest singles, doubles and mixed doubles player who's ever lived.\"\nIn 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena Williams as the greatest female tennis player in the Open Era. In May 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of all time.\nIn November 2018, Tennis.com polled its readers to choose the greatest women's tennis player of all time and Graf came in first. In July 2020, The Guardian polled its readers to determine the greatest female tennis player of the past 50 years, and Graf was the clear favorite, picking up nearly twice as many votes as any other player.\nOfficials.\nIn most professional play and some amateur competition, there is an officiating head judge or chair umpire (usually referred to simply as the umpire), who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court. The umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. The umpire may be assisted by line judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. The umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made.\nIn past tournaments, line judges tasked with calling the serve were sometimes assisted by electronic sensors that beeped to indicate an out-of-bounds serve; one such system was called \"Cyclops\". Cyclops has since largely been replaced by the Hawk-Eye system. In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tiebreak to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review. The US Open, Miami Masters, US Open Series, and World Team Tennis started using this challenge system in 2006 and the Australian Open and Wimbledon introduced the system in 2007. In clay-court matches, such as at the French Open, a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball's impact on the court surface.\nThe referee, who is usually located off the court, is the final authority about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a question of fact. If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision. (This would only happen in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair.)\nJunior tennis.\nIn tennis, a junior is a player under 18 who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian. Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian. These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) or Women's Tennis Association (WTA) ranking. Most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through ITF, Satellite, Future, and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit. The latter three circuits also have adults competing in them. Some juniors, however, such as Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Frenchman Ga\u00ebl Monfils, have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.\nIn 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally. Junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the Grand Slam tournaments, which are the most prestigious junior events. Juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the Future, Satellite, or Challenger tours. Tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points, culminating with Grade A.\nLeading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the Junior Fed Cup and Davis Cup competitions. To succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age. To facilitate and nurture a junior's growth in tennis, almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system. Juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces, accommodating all different standards of play. Talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions.\nInjuries.\nMuscle strain is one of the most common injuries in tennis. When an isolated large-energy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge amount of pressure to the lengthened muscle, muscle strain can occur. Inflammation and bleeding are triggered when muscle strain occurs, which can result in redness, pain and swelling. Overuse is also common in tennis players of all levels. Muscle, cartilage, nerves, bursae, ligaments and tendons may be damaged from overuse. The repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recovery is the most common cause of injury.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her roles as Kelly Kapowski on NBC's \"Saved by the Bell\" (1989\u20131993) and its spin-off media, and as Valerie Malone on Fox's \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" (1994\u201398) established her as a teen idol of the 1990s. As an adult, she has played Wilhemina 'Billie' Chambers in Fox's \"Fastlane\" (2002\u20132003), Natasha Drew in ABC's \"What About Brian\" (2007), Elizabeth Burke in USA Network's \"White Collar\" (2009\u20132014), and Lori Mendoza in Netflix's \"Alexa &amp; Katie\" (2018\u20132020). For the latter, she earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination.\nThiessen has appeared in several films, such as \"Son in Law\" (1993), \"Speedway Junky\" (1999), \"\" (1999), \"Love Stinks\" (1999), \"Ivans Xtc\" (2000), \"Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th\" (2000), \"The Ladies Man\" (2000), \"Hollywood Ending\" (2002) and \"Cyborg Soldier\" (2008). She directed the short film \"Just Pray\" (2005), for which she earned a nomination from the Tribeca Festival for Best Narrative Short. She hosted the Cooking Channel series \"Dinner at Tiffani's\" (2015\u20132017) and the MTV comedy clip show \"Deliciousness\" (2020\u20132022).\nEarly life.\nThiessen was born in Long Beach, California, the daughter of Robyn (n\u00e9e Ernest), a homemaker, and Frank Thiessen, a park designer and landscape architect. She has credited her brother, Todd, as one of her most important sources of inspiration, and her mother and grandmother as role models. Thiessen told \"InStyle\" magazine: \"I'm a mutt. I have so much of everything in me, and half of it I don't even know. German on one side, Greek, Turkish and Welsh on the other. My mom is very olive-skinned; I get my blue eyes from my dad.\"\nCareer.\nThiessen participated in beauty pageants during her childhood and was crowned Miss Junior America in 1987. The following year, she appeared on the cover of \"Teen\" magazine, having won the magazine's \"Great Model Search\". In 1989, she was named \"Cover Girl\"'s \"Model of the Year\", and landed her first role of Kelly Kapowski on NBC's television sitcom \"Saved by the Bell\", starring until its end in 1993. The success of the show gave her career a boost and Thiessen received Young Artist Award nominations for Outstanding Young Ensemble Cast in 1990 and Best Young Actress Starring in an Off-Primetime Series in 1991 and 1993. Simultaneously, Thiessen guest-starred on series such as \"Married... with Children\", \"Charles in Charge\" and \"Step by Step\". In 1992, she starred in her first television movies ' and \"A Killer Among Friends\", making her film debut in \"Son in Law\" in 1993. She then continued with starring in spin-off ' in its single season (1993\u201394) and in television movie \"\" (1994), which marked the end of the original \"Saved by the Bell\" series.\nIn 1994, after her tenure on \"Saved by the Bell\" had ended, Thiessen landed the role of Valerie Malone in Fox's Aaron Spelling-produced hit teen-drama \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", to fill the void after Shannen Doherty's departure. She was the first actress to directly join the main cast of the show and portrayed Valerie until 1998, when she left in the early episodes of the ninth season of the show. While starring in \"90210\", Thiessen began to take on continuous dramatic leading roles in television films: \"The Stranger Beside Me\" (1995) and \"She Fought Alone\" (1995), \"Sweet Dreams\" and \"Buried Secrets\" in 1996. After her departure from the show, she appeared in a number of films, including \"Speedway Junky\" (1999), \"\" (1999), \"Love Stinks\" (1999) and \"The Ladies Man\" (2000); she also guest-starred on \"NewsRadio\" (1999), \"Two Guys and a Girl\" (2000), \"Just Shoot Me!\" (2001) and \"Good Morning, Miami\" (2003\u201304). In 2000, she was featured in the music video for \"You're a God\" by Vertical Horizon, portraying a beauty pageant contestant, in her first music video appearance. That year she also dropped her middle name which she had been including professionally for many years and is now credited as simply Tiffani Thiessen. Thiessen was Spelling's first choice to replace Doherty in the series \"Charmed\" in 2001, but she refused his offer because she was hoping the NBC pilot for \"Everything But the Girl\" would be picked up. The role eventually went to Rose McGowan.\nMeanwhile, Thiessen starred in direct-to-video parody film \"Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth\" (2000) and in television movie \"Everything But the Girl\" (2001), before appearing in the Woody Allen-directed film \"Hollywood Ending\" (2002) and starring in action-drama series \"Fastlane\" (2002\u201303) as Wilhelmina 'Billie' Chambers, for which she received a Teen Choice Award nomination for Choice TV Actress \u2013 Drama/Action Adventure. In 2003, she launched her production company Tit 4 Tat Productions, producing and directing the short film \"Just Pray\" in 2005, which earned distinctions at several film festivals, including winning Best Score at the Rhode Island International Film Festival, an Academy Award qualifying festival.

He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory.\nEdison was raised in the American Midwest. Early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He went into business and became wealthy. Edison used his fortune to further his passion for invention. This was realized in experimental mining operations, the first film studio, and 1,093 US patents.\nEarly life.\nThomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, after the family moved there in 1854. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804\u20131896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810\u20131871, born in Chenango County, New York). His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey.\nHis great-grandfather, loyalist John Edison, fled New Jersey for Nova Scotia in 1784. The family moved to Middlesex County, Upper Canada, around 1811, and his grandfather, Capt. Samuel Edison Sr. served with the 1st Middlesex Militia during the War of 1812. His father, Samuel Edison Jr. moved to Vienna, Ontario, and fled to Ohio after his involvement in the Rebellion of 1837.\nEdison was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, a former school teacher. He attended school for only a few months, but was a very curious child who learned most things by reading on his own. Inspired by \"A School Compendium of Natural and Experimental Philosophy\", a book given to him by his mother, the young Edison tinkered and learned about electricity. His parents also owned a book by Thomas Paine, whose work inspired Edison's thinking throughout his life.\nEdison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. Historian Paul Israel attributed the cause of his deafness to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. He subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of his deafness. He was completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other. Edison later listened to a music player or piano by clamping his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull. As an adult, he believed his hearing loss allowed him to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on his work.\nEdison began his career as a news butcher, selling newspapers, candy, and vegetables on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit. He turned a $50-a-week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and chemical experiments. He founded the \"Grand Trunk Herald\", which he sold with his other papers. The paper only ran twenty-four issues and was unique in its original coverage of local news. Five hundred people subscribed to the paper, and Edison was able to hire at least two assistants. Edison was proud of his work on the train, and he hung a frame with the first issue of the \"Grand Trunk Herald\" in his home until he died.\nAt age 15, in 1862, he saved a child from being struck by a runaway train. The father was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. He began working as a telegrapher in a local general store before moving to Stratford Junction, Ontario, where he worked as a night telegrapher for the Grand Trunk Railway. While on the job, he studied qualitative analysis, conducted chemical experiments, and negligently slept. This led to the near collision of two trains, after which he resigned.\nTelegraphy.\nFrom 1863 to 1869, Edison worked several night shift telegraphy jobs in Ontario, Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Massachusetts. As an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. In Cincinnati, he lived with Ezra Gilliland, who he remained friends with for 25 years. He joined the National Telegraph Union and wrote for their magazine. In addition to spending his time tinkering, he studied Spanish. He created a reputation among the other young, male telegraph operators for being bright and trying new things, but on several occasions his tinkering interfered with his work.\nIn Boston, from 1867 to 1869, Edison made some money from inventing a stock ticker for some local customers but lost it when he tried to expand the venture to New York without adoption.\nHis first patent was for the electric vote recorder, https://, which was granted on June 1, 1869.\nEdison moved to New York City in 1869. One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher, Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished young Edison to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home while Edison worked for Samuel Laws at the Gold Indicator Company. Pope and Edison founded their own company in October 1869, working as electrical engineers. Edison attracted wealthy and connected investors. With the money, they hired fifty employees within a few months and opened a larger shop in Newark, New Jersey. The company made money by renting out telegraph lines. To win business, they manufactured machines to record telegraphs and typewriters that printed directly to the wire. Edison strictly regulated his employees\u2019 work and efficiency while trying many experiments.\nEdison enrolled in a chemistry course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art to support his work on a new telegraphy system with Charles Batchelor. This appears to have been his only enrollment in courses at an institution of higher learning. At the factory, Edison and Batchelor collaborated fervently; their notebooks jointly signed \"E&amp;B\" contain near-constant experimentation with improvements to the telegraph.\nEdison grew the company to a few hundred employees, and in 1874, received $30,000 &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;) for inventing the first telegraph that could simultaneously transmit four messages through a single wire. With the money, Edison invested in the Port Huron street railway, which was owned by his brother William Pitt. He expanded his own business, and he hired his young nephew and father.\nMenlo Park laboratory.\nResearch and development facility.\nIn Menlo Park, New Jersey, Edison created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application. It was built in 1876, a part of Raritan Township (now named Edison Township in his honor) with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results. Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents. As the leader of his laboratory, Edison was credited for inventions made in large part by those working under him. He worked extreme hours and expected those around him to follow suit. This often meant 18 hours per day Monday through Friday and additional work on Saturday and Sunday. One employee described the work as \"the limits of human exhaustion.\" Edison often litigated and employed several patent lawyers. At times, this allowed him to challenge the intellectual property rights of many contemporaries.\nFor Edison, big business came with big publicity. He shut down public and reporter access to the laboratory at Menlo Park and tailored his image with interviews. He expanded his public involvement by funding the creation of \"Science\", which published its first volume in 1880. He was the chief editor but kept his role anonymous. The journal began as a mouthpiece for pro-Edison articles. He gave up the journal in 1883 due to its lack of profit. It was subsequently led by Alexander Graham Bell.\nIn just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have \"a stock of almost every conceivable material\". In 1887 the lab contained \"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minks, camels\u00a0... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hooves, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell\u00a0... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores\u00a0...\" and the list goes on.\nCarbon telephone microphone.\nIn 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones by developing a carbon microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves.\nIn 1877, Edison and his backers at Western Union wanted to compete with Alexander Graham Bell on telephone technology. Edison believed that the worst part of Bell's telephone was the microphone designed by Emile Berliner. Edison iterated many different designs and tested which gave the best sound while ensuring it was loud enough for his deaf ears. His core idea was to use a stronger current and vary it in proportion to the sound waves. The sound varied the current by applying pressure to a carbon pad, which in turn changed the resistance of the circuit. After testing 150 materials, Edison determined that parchment and tinfoil were best suited for constructing the diaphragm, while a specially coated rubber served as the semiconductor.\nDavid Edward Hughes' also published a paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon microphones in 1878. He claimed, and at the time was credited for, discovering the semiconductor effect and presented a \"Hughes Telephone\". This angered Edison and caused public controversy, particularly because Hughes acknowledged that he was advised by one of Edison's colleagues.\nPhonograph.\nThe invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. He vigorously stirred up public awareness for this new invention by engaging with journalists and performing public demonstrations. The phonograph was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\". As he aged, he grew to resent titles representing him as a \"genius\", and he emphasized \"one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.\"\nHis first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \"the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other\". In April 1878, Edison demonstrated the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences. Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.\nIn 1887, the Edison Phonograph Company was founded to compete with Bell. Gilliland had worked for Bell developing the phonograph but came to help Edison start the new venture. Unfortunately for their friendship, the venture ran out of money before getting a product to market and had to raise money from an exploitative investor. Jesse Lippincott offered simultaneous deals to Edison, Gilliland, and Bell in an attempt to form a phonograph monopoly. However, he knew Edison would not take the bargain, so obfuscated his own, Gilliland's, and Bell's roles in the deal and made the offer through Edison's personal attorney. When Edison discovered the scheme, he was infuriated, but Gilliland went to Europe, which ended their friendship. After five years of litigation, Edison assumed total control of the company. The drama led to multiple other fall outs that tore apart the tight circle of Edison's wealthy inventor-friends. \nEdison struggled for years to bring a phonograph to market. The principal technical issue was getting the recording material durable enough for prolonged use without it wearing out the phonograph's needle. He attempted to pivot to making talking dolls with a miniature phonograph inside. However, the system usually failed during shipment and production was shut down in 1890. Edison thought that the phonograph would be a powerful instrument for conducting business and would redefine the role of secretaries. However, by 1899 Edison's phonograph company submitted to market demands and produced a cheap model that was in high demand for entertainment. In 1900, this phonograph was sold for $10, and buyers could additionally select from the 3,000 different musical records produced by Edison's 1,000 employees in the phonograph works. The quality of line work was strictly supervised by experts.\nEdison had no musical training, could not read sheet music, and was mostly deaf. Through 1915, he exerted tight control on the production of records, personally approving every artist based on what he thought sounded good and preventing their names from being attached to the music.\nWidespread adoption of the radio was detrimental to phonograph sales. Edison's business sold 90% fewer records in 1921 compared to 1920. From 1922 to 1926, radio sales went up 843%. Younger managers, especially his son Charles, tried to get Edison to enter the radio business or adopt new advertising methods. However, Edison chose to focus on weeding out employees that did not meet his mark.\nTasimeter.\nEdison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation. His impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar corona during the total solar eclipse of July 29, 1878.\nElectric light.\nIn 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination that he could deploy in a large-scale commercial utility, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting. Key to his system would be developing a durable low resistance incandescent lamp, essential for a wide-scale indoor lighting system. There had been many incandescent lamps devised by inventors prior to Edison, but these early bulbs all had flaws such as an extremely short life and requiring a high electric current to operate, which made them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison first tried using a filament made of cardboard, carbonized with compressed lampblack. This burnt out too quickly to provide lasting light. He then experimented with different grasses and canes such as hemp, and palmetto, before settling on bamboo as the best filament.\nHe addressed lighting as a system. Solving it took experimental research; market research, with Grosvenor Lowrey that included forging connections with powerful investors, viewing a mechanical electric generator, and planning power distribution; and grand public statements to promote his work. Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask, and the members of the Vanderbilt family.\nEdison continued trying to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\". The patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament, including \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\". It was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and Batchleor discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1,200\u00a0hours. This high-resistance filament led Edison to select the 110V power source standard in the United States today. This was much higher voltage than what competitors were using. Many of his employees assisted in carrying out experiments on filaments, manufacturing the glass for the bulbs, and establishing vacuums for the filament to incandesce within. By February 1880, spectators were coming to see the \"Village of Light\" around Menlo Park.\nAttempts to prevent blackening of the bulb due to emission of charged carbon from the hot filament culminated in Edison effect bulbs. Edison's 1883 patent for voltage-regulating is the first US patent for an electronic device due to its use of an Edison effect in an active component. The Edison Effect was instrumental in the eventual design of vacuum tubes.\nEdison hired Francis Robbins Upton, a former student of Hermann von Helmholtz, in 1878. Upton received 5% of the company profits and eventually became the general manager after leading much of the research into electric lighting. He wrote some of Edison's speeches and assisted with hiring decisions. John Ott also worked for Edison. He made many of the mechanical improvements Edison suggested and conducted experiments in Edison's lab. Both men agreed to give Edison credit for most of the patents, but Ott was solely credited for some of the patents he worked on. Ott's testimony was important for holding up Edison's patent claims. John's brother, Fred, also worked for Edison as an experimental assistant for fifty-seven years. \nHenry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard the \"Columbia\". Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the \"Columbia\" went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed \"Columbia\"'s new lighting system. The \"Columbia\" was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from \"Columbia\" in 1895.\nVillard was subsequently induced to finance the construction of an electrically powered and lighted train built on a custom track built by Edison's company. The train worked and some of the technology was patented, but Edison elected to focus on the bulbs and did not follow through with developing the train.\nThe incandescent light bulb patented by Edison began to gain widespread popularity in Europe as well. He sent engineers to promote their system, first to London, then around Europe.\nOn September 4 1882, Edison turned on the system to supply the company's 946 customers in Manhattan. Few people noticed and some came in the evening to ask why the system was not on yet, since the lights were so steady and so similar to the gas people were used to that they had not noticed the switch. There was little press but the Boston Globe stated, Edison has had an 'opening night.' His aim is to open night until it shall be as day.\nIn 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patented filament improvement process was based on Sawyer's \"flashing\" method and was, therefore, invalid. Edison's company modified their improvement process until 1889, when a judge ruled that their new patent was valid. To avoid a possible court battle with yet another competitor, Joseph Swan, who held an 1880 British patent on a similar incandescent electric lamp, formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain. Sawyer's original filament improvement process was better, and Westinghouse, which owned rights to Sawyer's patent, was able to take a sizeable portion of the bulb market share from Edison by 1889.\nElectric power distribution.\nAfter devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric utility to compete with the existing gas light utilities. To prove he was making progress, Edison hosted a board meeting that was illuminated by his system. On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution.\nThe amount of copper wire needed to commercialize this new technology was enormous. In order to reduce the copper requirement, Edison invented the three-prong wire system.[]\nTo expand its influence in New York, especially to secure the rights for installing underground electric lines, the Edison Illuminating Company opened a second office on 65th Avenue. The Edison Machine Works and Edison Electric Tube Company opened in New York by the end of the year. Edison paid his New York workers significantly more than other firms in the 1880s. Before fully commercializing power distribution, Edison needed a way to measure how much power his customers consumed. He invented a cell with a zinc solution and zinc plates that received some of each customer's current. This resulted in zinc from the solution precipitating onto the plates, which were weighed on a monthly basis to determine how much current had passed through and bill the customer accordingly.\nIn January 1882, to demonstrate feasibility, Edison had switched on the 93\u00a0kW first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. On September 4, 1882, in Pearl Street, New York City, his 600\u00a0kW cogeneration steam-powered generating station, Pearl Street Station's, electrical power distribution system was switched on, providing 110 volts direct current (DC). Subscriptions quickly grew to 508 customers with 10,164 lamps.\nExpansion and competition.\nAs Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s, AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885\u20131886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \"step down\" (reduce) the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small businesses and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply. Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically. Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from improperly installed AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general. The primary reason was that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC, and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built twenty-two power stations.\nParallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it. Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \"war of the currents\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse, via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to ensure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\nEdison was becoming marginalized in his own company having lost majority control in the 1889 merger that formed Edison General Electric. In 1890 he told president Henry Villard he thought it was time to retire from the lighting business and moved on to an iron ore refining project that preoccupied his time. Edison's dogmatic anti-AC values were no longer controlling the company. By 1889 Edison's Electric's own subsidiaries were lobbying to add AC power transmission to their systems and in October 1890 Edison Machine Works began developing AC-based equipment. \nCut-throat competition and patent battles were bleeding off cash in the competing companies and the idea of a merger was being put forward in financial circles. With the Edison company winning its electric lamp patent infringement cases, Villard began to float the idea of acquiring one of Edison's AC rivals, thereby eliminating many of the further costly patent case and gaining control of that companies AC patents. In 1892 Villard teamed up with J. P. Morgan to engineer a merger of Edison General Electric with its main alternating current based rival, The Thomson-Houston Company. For Villard and Edison General Electric the plan backfired. Morgan decided Thomson-Houston was the more valuable of the two companies, ousted Villard, and put the Thomson-Houston board in charge of the new company, now called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market. \nEdison put on a brave face, noting to the media how his stock had gained value in the deal, but privately he was bitter that his company and all of his patents had been turned over to the competition. He served as a figurehead on the company's board of directors for a few years before selling his shares.\nMining.\nStarting in the late 1870s, Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast, resulting in high costs as ore was usually shipped from the Midwest. He tried to change this by mining low-grade ore and beach sand. Several others had attempted to improve the refining process by using magnets to separate iron from other metals, but none had been able to do so profitably.\nThe Edison Ore Milling Company began in 1880 with separating iron out of beach sand. Edison made promises to deliver hundreds of tons of ore a month to several customers, but after three years the operation was shut down and only one customer had received their ore. William Kennedy Dickson and John Birkinbine helped lead the venture. Batchelor and Insull provided some of the capital with Edison taking the majority share financed from his own pocket.\nRather than a complete loss, this first mining venture allowed Edison to license some of the technology to more profitable iron producers. The West Orange team continued to iterate on the technology for years and Edison purchased a mine in Bechtelsville, Pennsylvania. Birkinbine wanted to use this as a demonstration mine to sell the technology to mine owners, but Edison wanted to take over the mining industry himself. Birkinbine was fired in 1890.\nEdison bought several mines in the eastern states and began constructing a new centralized mining operation in Ogdensburg, New Jersey. The new process used rollers and crushers that pulverized five ton rocks. To obtain the boulders, Edison purchased the largest steam shovel in America. One novelty of Edison's system was the electrically powered seventy ton rollers which were rotated 3500\u00a0ft/min. To protect the system, the roller's gears released at the moment the boulders were dropped in and their momentum crushed the rocks. Edison departed from contemporary, manually intensive, mining practices by prioritized automation. This meant the rocks journeyed up, down, and across the facility on conveyor belts utilizing gravity, sieves, and additional rollers to separate ore in fines. The fines were recirculated through a magnetic gradient created by an array of 480 electromagnets to select for iron.\nCustomers would not accept iron with a significant phosphorus content because it ruined the Bessemer process. Edison's system removed the phosphorus with a light pneumatic system that leveraged phosphorus' lower density. Economic forces also dictated that the iron ore be mixed into briquettes for transport and handling at steel mills. Edison advanced the automation of this process and was proud of it taking two hours. The eventual goal was for no humans to touch the iron. Nevertheless, the mine was rapidly losing money.\nIn 1893, the United States was in a severe recession. Between the capital investments in mining, falling iron prices, and the expensive lifestyle of Mina and his children, Edison was at risk of becoming insolvent. He was also unwell as his diabetes was beginning to effect him. He decided to take a loan from his father in law.\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada, and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.\nCement.\nDespite the failure of his mining company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce Portland cement. Manufacturing of iron ore produced a large quantity of waste sand which Edison sold to cement manufacturers. In 1899, he established the Edison Portland Cement Company, intending to manufacture his own cement and make improvements to its production process. \nIn the manufacturing of Portland cement, limestone, the primary ingredient, is baked at high temperature with the other minerals. Edison designed a novel system which improved the efficiency of this process by baking the cement in horizontal 150ft long kilns which allowed the cement to achieve the same quality after cooking longer at a lower temperature. This consumed less coal resulting in saving from the manual labor needed to load coal into kilns. Edison reused most of the factory material from the iron extraction process at the Ogden mine to construct his new system. In addition to selling the cement itself, Edison later licensed the proven system to cement manufactures in America and collected royalties into the 1920s. \nRunning machines in the dusty environment natural to crushing rocks yielded many problems for the machines. Dynamos in particular were problematic because they could not be sealed off due to heat dissipation being required. Edison invented a fan cooling system to bring in fresh air to cool the dynamos while sealing them off from the dusty factory air.\nIn 1901, Edison sought to parlay his cement business by starting a cheap housing development initiative. He wanted to create small towns in which every American could afford to buy a home. To bring down the cost of building he commissioned a system for casting a whole three story house from cement in a single mold. He used this method to build employee housing and made a public relations campaign that did not yield sufficient demand for him to pursue it further.\nWest Orange.\nMoving the works.\nThe first labor strike against Edison occurred in the spring of 1886. It was led by D.J. O'Dare of the Edison Tube Works. Manufacturing in New York City was typically performed for nine hours a day, and Edison's employees were among the best paid in the city. However, they were not paid overtime for the additional work that was often performed. The strike sought more pay, overtime pay, and the right to unionize work. Edison and other managers were completely unwilling to negotiate unionization due to the loss of control. By the end of the year, the various manufacturing facilities in the city were closed and centralized as the Edison United Manufacturing Company opened a new factory in Schenectady, New York. The citizen's of Schenectady subsidized 16% of the real estate cost to help attract Edison's business to their town.\nSamuel Insull began working for Edison in 1881 as a secretary. He had previously worked at Vanity Fair. The two became friends as Insull became a trusted lieutenant. Later, when Mary was dying, Insull helped the family make arrangements. As with all of Edison's men, Insull worked hard. When Edison United Manufacturing Company opened, he was one of two managers.\nIn December, Edison was housebound due to pleurisy. He recovered, but by May 1887 he needed emergency surgery to treat abscesses below his ear. He had surgeries there again in 1906 and 1908.\nBy 1887, Edison felt he had outgrown Menlo Park. He put Batchelor in charge of constructing a new laboratory complex in West Orange, which when finally constructed was more than ten times the size of the old lab.\nIn December 1914, a fire killed one employee and destroyed thirteen buildings causing $1.5 million in damages. The phonograph works was destroyed. Edison was optimistic about the situation, ordered everything rebuilt with the newest technology and was manufacturing records again by January. The impact of the fire was partially mitigated because the factory practiced regular fire drills.\nIn 1921, following the inauguration of Warren G. Harding, the American economy was entering a recession. At this point, Edison had experience leading his businesses through recessions and had seen several of his friends go bankrupt when they were unable to manage. He fired thousands of his employees including executives. By the fall, the economy recovered, and business returned; however, it was a near miss with bankruptcy.\nFluoroscopy.\nEdison learned about X-rays in 1896, following their discovery by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen. He was sent a photo of R\u00f6ntgen's hands with the bones visible. The new technology excited Edison and he tried developing an X-ray system with better glass and more electric power than previously used. While experimenting, Edison learned X-ray images display better on calcium tungstate screens and informed Lord Kelvin.\nThe fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistants, Clarence Dally and Charles Dally. In 1903, a shaken Edison said: \"Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\" The brothers often acted as human guinea pigs for the fluoroscopy project. Clarence died, at the age of 39, of injuries related to the exposure, including mediastinal cancer.\nRechargeable battery.\nIn the late 1890s, Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient rechargeable battery. He sought something customers could use to power their phonographs, but in the early 1900s he focused on batteries for electric cars. At the time, lead acid batteries were widely used, but they were not very efficient and protected by others' patents. In 1900, Edison decided to pursue an alkaline battery for electric cars. His lab tested 10,000 combinations of electrodes and solutions eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. \nWaldemar Jungner simultaneously worked on a similar design which Edison likely knew about. Edison and Junger litigated over their respective intellectual property as Edison attempted to commercialize his battery. Edison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel\u2013iron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company. In 1904, Edison was worried about losing the patent fight and personally petitioned president Theodore Roosevelt to step in. Roosevelt obliged; however, the patent office still denied Edison's claim.\nBy 1904 Edison Storage Battery Company had 450 employees. The first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars. A total recall was issued due to the batteries losing power after several recharge cycles. When the capital of the company was exhausted, Edison paid for the company with his private money. \nHenry Ford first met Edison, in 1896, while working for Edison Illuminating Company. Edison encouraged Ford's nascent automobile tinkering and Ford resigned in 1899 to start his first motor company. By 1908, with the Model T on the road, gas cars were taking over the market. Edison did not demonstrate a mature battery until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel\u2013iron battery was never very successful; by the time it was ready, electric cars were disappearing, and lead acid batteries had become the standard for starting gas-powered cars. Ford was still enamored with Edison and lent him $1.1 million &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;) to finance further battery research, but Edison was unable to bring a sufficient battery to market.\nMotion pictures.\nWhile working on the mining project, Edison and William Kennedy Dickson, one of his employees at the mine who was also a photographer, began trying to make camera \"to do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear\". Edison focused on the electromechanical elements while Dickson lead the optical and film effort. Edison was granted a patent for a motion picture camera, labeled the \"Kinetograph\". Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.\nIn fact, Edison's eye was trained on a bigger prize than a motion camera. He wanted a \"kinetophonograph\" to capture motion picture and record sounds with synchronized playback. In the spring of 1890, Dickson produced the first video with sound starring himself. However, keeping the sound and video synchronized outside of a laboratory setting proved to be very difficult and Edison shelved commercial development of the technology.\nIn 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.\nEdison and Dickson were preoccupied with the mining project and growing revenue from the phonograph business. This slowed the commercialization of Edison's motion picture camera and gave Dickson more time to iterate on the details. In 1894, they shifted from marketing campaigns to raise awareness to commercializing their inventions.\nIn the last three months of 1894, an associate of Edison's sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in the Netherlands and Italy. In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-\u00f6sterreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck of the Schokoladen-S\u00fcsswarenfabrik Stollwerck &amp; Co of Cologne.\nBy 1895, Dickson was beginning to set up business for himself separate from Edison. The exact motivation for the split is unknown but likely stemmed from disagreements between Dickson and Edison.\nThe first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's Kin\u00e9toscope Fran\u00e7ais, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists. On May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kin\u00e9toscope Belge was founded in Brussels. Businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.\nIn April 1896, Thomas Armat reached a deal with Edison in which Edison's company manufactured and sold the Vitascope to project films produced in Edison's film studio. Armat advertised as an Edison invention to boost sales, but was in fact, Armat's invention. Edison had made his own projector, but both men knew the Vitascope was better at the time.\nEdison's film studio made nearly 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as \"Fred Ott's Sneeze\" (1894), \"The Kiss\" (1896), \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903), \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1910), and the first \"Frankenstein\" film (1910). Edison was happy to have Edwin S. Porter porter run the creative side of the movie business. In 1903, the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant. Edison Manufacturing filmed, \"Electrocuting an Elephant\", as AC current killed the poor animal.\nAs the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films. To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.\nIn 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust).\nIn 1913, movies used live actors and bands to add sound to the experience. However, Edison was again feeling confident in his \"kinetophone\" technology to synchronize recorded sound and motion picture playback. Simultaneously, Leon Gaumont was developing similar technology. Both their systems required a skilled projectionist who could adjust the video speed for the sound playback. \nIn 1914, Edison fired Porter for unclear reasons. The technical aspects of silent, black and white film were mostly solved and the storytelling did not capture the inventor's interest. The kinetophone was hard to sell due to the difficulty in operating it. Edison's movie business began to decline.\nEdison said his favorite movie was \"The Birth of a Nation\". He thought that talkies had \"spoiled everything\" for him. \"There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\" His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.\nNational security.\nDue to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915. However, he attended few of the meetings due to his deafness. One of the board's main tasks was to prepare a site to conduct research for the navy. Edison wanted to locate the site far from Washington DC, as too many visits from bureaucrats would slow down the research. However, he was not listened to by the other board members and turned his focus to experiments in military technology.\nSubmarines.\nAt the start of the war, Edison attempted several methods for improving submarine detection which failed to gain adoption by the Navy. He allowed Miller Hutchinson, to promote his battery technology as a safer solution to lead battery power on submarines. An American submarine crew had suffered serious injuries to due one such battery leaking sulfuric acid which mixed with seawater to produce chlorine gas inside the vessel. However, the nickle-iron batteries, used by Edison, leak hydrogen gas. This was not a problem on automobiles but confined in the submarine becomes explosive. In January 1916, while undergoing maintenance with the new Edison test battery there was a hydrogen explosion inside the USS E-2 which killed five men. Edison and Hutchinson defended their battery stating that the explosion was due to operator error. However, many naval officials blamed Edison and Hutchinson for overselling the battery. The event derailed sales of the battery but did not destroy Edison's good standing with the navy.\nRubber.\nIn 1915, the United States consumed 75% of the world's rubber and produced a negligible amount. Edison, and many other businessmen, became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber. He sought a native supply of rubber. Domestic fears were realized when the Stevenson Plan was introduced in 1921. The laboratory was funded by Edison, Ford, and Firestone with $75,000.\nAge did not make Edison any less familiar with the press. He used his 80th birthday to give tours of his experimental garden and promote his research into various domestic plants for producing rubber.\nAfter testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant. Near the end of 1929, Edison announced \"Solidago leavenworthii\", also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod could be bred to give a 12% latex yield. Edison employed systematic problem solving to rubber production. He rejected other plants based on combinations of their latex content, the extraction processes needed to get the latex from the plant, where the latex is found in the plants, growth speed, and ability to harvest the plant.\nChemicals.\nThe phonograph business had led Edison to personally search for and hire several chemists to develop chemicals to coat records with that would prevent them from being worn down as they were played. Edison eventually licensed Condensite from another chemist which was formed from the condensation of phenol and formaldehyde. At the start of World War I, the American chemical industry was primitive: most chemicals were imported from Europe. The war resulted in a shortage of phenol which was used to make explosives and Aspirin.\nEdison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake facility using processes developed by his chemists. He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day. Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe. He built two plants to produce raw material benzene at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Bessemer, Alabama, replacing supplies previously from Germany. Edison manufactured aniline dyes, which previously had been supplied by the German dye trust. Other wartime products include xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrax. Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable. In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear. Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses. However, he sold his surplus to Bayer who exported it to Germany.\nFinal years.\nHenry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs also participated. The trips functioned as a moving advertisement for Ford cars, Firestone tires, and whatever Edison had going on at the time. A team of reporters joined to ensure word spread.\nIn 1926, at 79 years old, Edison handed over the presidency of Thomas A. Edison, Inc. to Charles.\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange. \nDeath.\nIn the final years of his life, Edison continued to chew tobacco daily and his diabetes worsened. Edison died on October 18, 1931, at Glenmont and was buried on the property.\nEdison's last breath is kept, as a momento, in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Charles Edison had the test tube prepared and sent to Ford as a symbol of his father's love of chemistry and friendship with Ford. A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made.\nDomestic life.\nMary.\nOn December 25, 1871, at the age of 24, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855\u20131884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:\nEdison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family. He did not provide Mary much companionship and she was closest with her sister.\nThomas Jr. was often sick as a child, but Edison left his care in Mary's hands. In her childhood, Marion often came to the laboratory at Menlo park.\nWanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, Thomas Jr. became a problem for his father and his father's business. Starting in the 1890s, Thomas Jr. became involved in snake oil products and shady and fraudulent enterprises, producing products being sold to the public as \"The Latest Edison Discovery\". The situation became so bad that Thomas Sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay Thomas Jr. an allowance of $35 () per week, in exchange for not using the Edison name; the son began using aliases, such as Burton Willard. Thomas Jr. struggled with alcoholism and depression. Thomas Jr. had a disastrous one year marriage which began in 1899 and caused scandal for himself and the senior Edison. In 1931, nearing the end of his life, he obtained a role in the Edison company, thanks to the intervention of his half-brother Charles. \nWhen the Edisons moved to New York, they lived by Gramercy Park. Edison neglected his wife after the first few years of their marriage. She enjoyed shopping for fashionable gowns, and attending balls. By 1882, Mary's mental health was highly concerning to her doctor.\nMary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women at this time to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.\nMina.\nThomas met Mina Miller at the World Cotton Centennial in December 1884. She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, who had made significant personal wealth by selling a wheat mower for which he had invented several improvements. He was a co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. Mina enjoyed the socialite lifestyle and practiced a strict Methodist faith her whole life. She was a family friend of the Gillilands' and Edison met her several times in 1885 while working on a project with Ezra in Boston. He joined her for the Chautauqua gathering in 1885, but their flirting was dampened by the religious nature of the gathering. He proposed to her after the two took a trip in September.\nOn February 24, 1886, at the age of 39, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865\u20131947) in Akron, Ohio.\nThey had three children:\nMarion did not get along with Mina and moved to Germany in 1894. She returned, in 1924, after divorcing her unfaithful husband.\nAccording to Tesla:If Edison had not married a woman of exceptional intelligence, who made it the one object of her life to preserve him, he would have died many years ago from consequences of sheer neglect.\nIn his second marriage he was also often neglectful of his wife and children. When he was around, he was extremely controlling. He left nearly every aspect of housekeeping and child rearing to Mina and her five maids. One exception was the Fourth of July. Being deaf, Edison enjoyed the very loud boom made by fireworks. He made his own fireworks into which he added a small amount of TNT.\nEdison wrote Mina love letters about missing her while he was away for extended periods.\nMadeleine stated she had few childhood memories of her father, and he was typically only home once a week during her childhood. She married John Eyre Sloane.\nTheodore was named after Mina's brother, who died in the Spanish-American War shortly before she gave birth. Her sister died in November of that year and her father died the following February 1899.\nTheodore went on to study physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After working for Charles while their father stepped down, Theodore decided to become an independent inventor running his own lab.\nCharles studied general science at MIT. He took over his father's business after his death. Later he served one term as Governor of New Jersey (1941\u20131944).\nProperty.\nIn 1885, Thomas Edison bought 13 acres of property in Fort Myers, Florida, for roughly $2,750 () and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. The main house and guest house are representative of Italianate architecture and Queen Anne style architecture.\nEdison purchased a home known as Glenmont in 1886, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. He sold it to Mina in 1891.\nEdison liked boats, cars, and fishing. He drove only on very limited occasions, but, for research purposes, owned several cars which helped him bond with his son, Charles, who he encouraged to drive even as a child.\nViews.\nOn religion and metaphysics.\nHistorian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a \"freethinker\". Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine's \"The Age of Reason\". Edison defended Paine's \"scientific deism\", saying, \"He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.\" In an October 2, 1910, interview Edison stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me\u2014the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love\u2014He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us\u2014nature did it all\u2014not the gods of the religions.\nEdison was labeled an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe also stated, \"I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.\"\nEdison explored and promoted ideas in panpsychism.\nPolitics.\nRepublican.\nEdison's father was a Democrat that supported the secession of the Confederate States of America. Edison was a lifelong Republican, but he briefly supported Theodore Roosevelt in his third attempt at the presidency as a Progressive party candidate. He liked the Republican party's support of industrial capitalism and tariffs.\nPresidents.\nEdison met several presidents. He met Rutherford B. Hayes in 1879 to demonstrate the phonograph. He met Benjamin Harrison in 1890. In 1921, Edison met Harding with the Firestone, Ford summer caravan. He met Calvin Coolidge in 1924 at the president's home in Vermont. In 1928, Edison received the Congressional Gold Medal and Coolidge called into the ceremony via radio. Herbert Hoover met Edison in 1929 at Seminole Lodge. Ten months later, Hoover traveled with Edison and Ford to Ford's reconstruction of Menlo Park.\nSuffrage.\nEdison was a supporter of women's suffrage. He said in 1915, \"Every woman in this country is going to have the vote.\" Edison signed onto a statement supporting women's suffrage which was published to counter anti-suffragist literature spread by Senator James Edgar Martine. His employment of women was somewhat notable at the time. He assigned women factory jobs that required nimble fingers like making the brush wires for dynamos.\nPacifism.\nNonviolence was key to Edison's political and moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\" Following a tour of Europe in 1911, Edison spoke negatively about \"the belligerent nationalism that he had sensed in every country he visited\".\nMonetary policy.\nIn May 1922, he published a proposal, \"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\". Which proposes a commodity-backed currency. The proposals failed to find support and were abandoned.\nAwards.\nThe following is an incomplete list of awards given to Edison during his lifetime:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "29780", "revid": "1316312547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29780", "title": "Thomas Reid", "text": "Scottish philosopher (1710\u20131796)\nThomas Reid (; 7 May (O.S. 26 April) 1710 \u2013 7 October 1796) was a religiously trained Scottish philosopher best known for his philosophical method, his theory of perception, and its wide implications on epistemology, and as the developer and defender of an agent-causal theory of free will. He also focused extensively on ethics, theory of action, language and philosophy of mind. \nHe was the founder of the Scottish School of Common Sense and played an integral role in the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. A contemporary of David Hume, Reid was also \"Hume's earliest and fiercest critic\".\nLife.\nReid was born in the manse at Strachan, Aberdeenshire, on 26 April 1710, the son of Lewis Reid (1676\u20131762) and his wife Margaret Gregory, first cousin to James Gregory. He was educated at Kincardine Parish School then the O'Neil Grammar School in Kincardine.\nHe went to the University of Aberdeen in 1723 and graduated MA in 1726. He was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland in 1731 when he came of age. He began his career as a minister of the Church of Scotland but ceased to be a minister when he was given a professorship at King's College, Aberdeen, in 1752. He obtained his doctorate and wrote \"An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense\" (published in 1764). He and his colleagues founded the 'Aberdeen Philosophical Society, popularly known as the 'Wise Club' (a literary-philosophical association). Shortly after the publication of his first book, he was given the prestigious Professorship of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow when he was called to replace Adam Smith. He resigned from this position in 1781, after which he prepared his university lectures for publication in two books: \"Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man\" (1785) and \"Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind\" (1788). However, in 1787 he is still listed as \"Professor of Moral Philosophy\" at the university, but his classes were being taught by Archibald Arthur.\nIn 1740 Thomas Reid married his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of the London physician George Reid. His wife and \"numerous\" children predeceased him, except for a daughter who married Patrick Carmichael. Reid died of palsy, in Glasgow. He was buried at Blackfriars Church in the grounds of Glasgow College and when the university moved to Gilmorehill in the west of Glasgow, his tombstone was inserted in the main building.\nPhilosophical work.\nOverview.\nReid believed that common sense (in a special philosophical sense of \"sensus communis\") is, or at least should be, at the foundation of all philosophical inquiry. He disagreed with Hume, who asserted that we can never know what an external world consists of as our knowledge is limited to the ideas in the mind, and George Berkeley, who asserted that the external world is instead ideas in the mind. By contrast, Reid claimed that the foundations upon which our \"sensus communis\" are built justify our belief that there is an external world.\nIn his day and for some years into the 19th century, he was regarded as more important than Hume. He advocated direct realism, or common sense realism, and argued strongly against the Theory of Ideas advocated by John Locke, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and (in varying forms) nearly all Early Modern philosophers who came after them. He had a great admiration for Hume and had a mutual friend send Hume an early manuscript of Reid's \"Inquiry.\" Hume responded that the work \"is wrote in a lively entertaining manner,\" although he found \"there seems to be some Defect in Method\", and he criticized Reid's doctrine for implying the presence of innate ideas.\nThomas Reid's theory of common sense.\nReid's theory of knowledge had a strong influence on his theory of morals. He thought epistemology was an introductory part to practical ethics: When we are confirmed in our common beliefs by philosophy, all we have to do is to act according to them, because we know what is right. His moral philosophy is reminiscent of Roman stoicism in its emphasis on the agency of the subject and self-control. He often quotes Cicero, from whom he adopted the term \"sensus communis\". Reid's answer to Hume's sceptical and naturalist arguments was to enumerate a set of principles of \"common sense\" (\"sensus communis\") which constitute the foundations of rational thought. Anyone who undertakes a philosophical argument, for example, must implicitly presuppose certain beliefs like, \"I am talking to a real person,\" and \"There is an external world whose laws do not change,\" among many other positive, substantive claims. For Reid, the belief in the truth of these principles is not rational; rather, reason itself demands these principles as prerequisites, as does the innate \"constitution\" of the human mind. It is for this reason (and possibly a mocking attitude toward Hume and Berkeley) that Reid sees belief in the principles of common sense as a litmus test for sanity. For example, in \"The Intellectual Powers of Man\" he states, \"For, before men can reason together, they must agree in first principles; and it is impossible to reason with a man who has no principles in common with you.\" One of the first principles he goes on to list is that \"qualities must necessarily be in something that is figured, coloured, hard or soft, that moves or resists. It is not to these qualities, but to that which is the subject of them, that we give the name body. If any man should think fit to deny that these things are qualities, or that they require any subject, I leave him to enjoy his opinion as a man who denies first principles, and is not fit to be reasoned with.\"\nReid also made positive arguments based in phenomenological insight to put forth a novel mixture of direct realism and ordinary language philosophy. In a typical passage in \"The Intellectual Powers of Man\" he asserts that when he has a conception of a centaur, the thing he conceives is an animal, and no idea is an animal; therefore, the thing he conceives is not an idea, but a centaur. This point relies both on an account of the subjective experience of conceiving an object and also on an account of what we mean when we use words. Because Reid saw his philosophy as publicly accessible knowledge, available both through introspection and through the proper understanding of how language is used, he saw it as the philosophy of common sense.\nExploring sense and language.\nReid started out with a 'common sense' based on a direct experience of an external reality but then proceeded to explore in two directions\u2014external to the senses, and internal to human language\u2014to account more effectively for the role of rationality.\nReid saw language as based on an innate capacity pre-dating human consciousness, and acting as an instrument for that consciousness. (In Reid's terms: it is an 'artificial' instrument based on a 'natural' capacity.) On this view, language becomes a means of examining the original form of human cognition. Reid notes that current human language contains two distinct elements: first, the acoustic element, the sounds; and secondly the meanings\u2014which seem to have nothing to do with the sounds as such. This state of the language, which he calls 'artificial', cannot be the primeval one, which he terms 'natural', wherein sound was not an abstract sign, but a concrete gesture or natural sign. Reid looks to the way a child learns language, by imitating sounds, becoming aware of them long before it understands the meaning accorded to the various groups of sounds in the artificial state of contemporary adult speech. If, says Reid, the child needed to understand immediately the conceptual content of the words it hears, it would never learn to speak at all. Here Reid distinguishes between natural and artificial signs:\n\"It is by natural signs chiefly that we give force and energy to language; and the less language has of them, it is the less expressive and persuasive. ... Artificial signs signify, but they do not express; they speak to the intellect, as algebraic characters may do, but the passions and the affections and the will hear them not: these continue dormant and inactive, till we speak to them in \"the language of nature\", to which they are all attention and obedience.\" (p. 52)\nHis external exploration, regarding the senses, led Reid to his critical distinction between 'sensation' and 'perception'. While we become aware of an object through the senses, the content of that perception is not identical with the sum total of the sensations caused in our consciousness. Thus, while we tend to focus on the object perceived, we pay no attention to the process leading from sensation to perception, which contains the knowledge of the thing as real. How, then, do we receive the conviction of the latter's existence? Reid's answer is, by entering into an immediate intuitive relationship with it, as a child does. In the case of the adult, the focus is on perceiving, but with the child, it is on receiving of the sensations in their living nature. For Reid, the perception of the child is different from the adult, and he states that man must become like a child to get past the artificial perception of the adult, which leads to Hume's view that what we perceive is an illusion. Also, the artist provides a key to the true content of sense experience, as he engages the 'language of nature':\n\"It were easy to show, that the fine arts of the musician, the painter, the actor, and the orator, so far as they are expressive .. are nothing else but the language of nature, which we brought into the world with us, but have unlearned by disuse and so find the greatest difficulty in recovering it.\" (p. 53)\n\"That without a natural knowledge of the connection between these [natural] signs and the things signified by them, the language could never have been invented and established among men; and, That the fine arts are all founded upon this connection, which we may call the natural language of mankind.\" (p. 59)\nThus, for Reid, common sense was based on the innate capacity of man in an earlier epoch to directly participate in nature, and one we find to some extent in the child and artist, but one that from a philosophical and scientific perspective, we must re-awaken at a higher level in the human mind above nature. Why does Reid believe that perception is the way to recognize? Well, to him \"an experience is purely subjective and purely negative. It supports the validity of a proposition, only on the fact that I find that it is impossible for me not to hold it for true, to suppose it therefore not true\" (Reid, 753). To understand this better, it is important to know that Reid divides his definition of perception into two categories: conception, and belief. \"Conception is Reid's way of saying to visualize an object, so then we can affirm or deny qualities about that thing. Reid believes that beliefs are our direct thoughts of an object, and what that object is\" (Buras, The Functions of Sensations to Reid). So, to Reid, what we see, what we visualize, what we believe of an object, is that object's true reality. Reid believes in direct objectivity, our senses guide us to what is right since we cannot trust our own thoughts. \"The worlds of common sense and of philosophy are reciprocally the converse of each other\" (Reid, 841). Reid believes that Philosophy overcomplicates the question of what is real. So, what does Common Sense actually mean then? Well, \"common sense is the senses being pulled all together to form one idea\" (Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid, 164). Common sense (all the senses combined) is how we truly identify the reality of an object; since all that can be perceived about an object, are all pulled into one perception. How do people reach the point of accessing common sense? That's the trick, everyone is born with the ability to access common sense, that is why it is called common sense. \"The principles of common sense are common to all of humanity,\" (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid).\nCommon sense works as such: If all men observe an item and believe the same qualities about that item, then the knowledge of that item is universally true. It is common knowledge, which without explanation is held true by other people; so, what is universally seen is universally believed. \"The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you. Thus, the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a community, without definite limits, and capable of a definite increase of knowledge,\" (Reid, 155). The combination of the same ideas, of a thing, by multiple people, is what confirms the reality of an object. Reid also believes that the philosophers of his time exaggerated what is truly real. Where most philosophers believe that what we see is not fully what that thing is, for example, Descartes, Reid counters this argument simply by stating that \"such a hypothesis is no more likely to be true than the common-sensical belief that the world is much the way we perceive it to be,\" (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid). Reality is what we make it out to be, nothing more.\nReid also claimed that this discovery of the link between the natural sign and the thing signified was the basis of natural philosophy and science, as proposed by Bacon in his radical method of discovery of the innate laws of nature:\nThe great Lord Verulam had a perfect comprehension of this, when he called it \"an interpretation of nature\". No man ever more distinctly understood, or happily expressed the nature and foundation of the philosophic art. What is all we know of mechanics, astronomy, and optics, but connections established by nature and discovered by experience or observation, and consequences deduced from them? (..) What we commonly call natural \"causes\" might, with more propriety, be called natural \"signs\", and what we call \"effects\", the things signified. The causes have no proper efficiency or causality, as far as we know; and all we can certainly affirm, is, that nature hath established a constant conjunction between them and the things called their effects; (..). (p. 59)\nInfluences.\nIt has been claimed that Reid's reputation waned after attacks on the Scottish School of Common Sense by Immanuel Kant (although Kant, only 14 years Reid's junior, also bestowed much praise on Scottish philosophy\u2014Kant attacked the work of Reid, but admitted he had never actually read his works) and by John Stuart Mill. But Reid's was the philosophy taught in the colleges of North America during the 19th century and was championed by Victor Cousin, a French philosopher. Justus Buchler has shown that Reid was an important influence on the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, who shared Reid's concern to revalue common sense and whose work links Reid to pragmatism. To Peirce, conceptions of truth and the real involve the notion of a community without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed), and capable of a definite increase of knowledge. Common sense is socially evolved, open to verification much like scientific method, and constantly evolving, as evidence, perception, and practice warrant, albeit with a slowness that Peirce came only in later years to see, at which point he owned his \"adhesion, under inevitable modification, to the opinion of...Thomas Reid, in the matter of Common Sense\" (Peirce called his version \"critical common-sensism\"). By contrast, on Reid's concept, the \"sensus communis\" is not a social evolutionary product but rather a precondition of the possibility that humans could reason with each other. The work of Thomas Reid influenced the work of Noah Porter and James McCosh in the 19th century United States and is based upon the claim of universal principles of objective truth. Pragmatism is not the development of the work of the Scottish \"Common Sense\" School\u2014it is the negation of it. There are clear links between the work of the Scottish Common Sense School and the work of the Oxford Realist philosophers Harold Prichard and Sir William David Ross in the 20th century.\nReid's reputation has revived in the wake of the advocacy of common sense as a philosophical method or criterion by G. E. Moore early in the 20th century, and more recently because of the attention given to Reid by contemporary philosophers, in particular philosophers of religion in the school of Reformed epistemology such as William Alston, Alvin Plantinga, and Nicholas Wolterstorff, seeking to rebut charges that theistic belief is irrational where it has no doxastic foundations (that is, where that belief is not inferred from other adequately grounded beliefs).\nHe wrote a number of important philosophical works, including \"Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense\" (1764, Glasgow &amp; London), \"Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man\" (1785) and \"Essays on the Active Powers of Man\" (1788). In 1844, Schopenhauer praised Reid for explaining that the perception of external objects does not result from the raw data that is received through the five senses:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Thomas Reid's excellent book, \"Inquiry into the Human Mind\"... affords us a very thorough conviction of the inadequacy of the \"senses\" for producing the objective perception of things, and also of the non-empirical origin of the intuition of space and time. Reid refutes Locke's teaching that perception is a product of the \"senses\". This he does by a thorough and acute demonstration that the collective sensations of the senses do not bear the least resemblance to the world known through perception, and in particular by showing that Locke's five primary qualities (extension, figure, solidity, movement, number) cannot possibly be supplied to us by any sensation of the senses...\u2014\u200a\nOther philosophical positions.\nThough known mainly for his epistemology, Reid is also noted for his views in the theory of action and the metaphysics of personal identity. Reid held an incompatibilist or libertarian notion of freedom, holding that we are capable of free actions of which we are the cause, and for which we are morally appraisable. Regarding personal identity, he rejected Locke's account that self-consciousness in the form of memory of one's experiences was the basis of a person's being identical with their self over time. Reid held that continuity of memory was neither necessary nor sufficient to make one numerically the same person at different times.\nReid also argued that the operation of our mind connecting sensations with belief in an external world is accounted for only by an intentional Creator. In his natural religion lectures, Reid provides five arguments for the existence of God, focusing on two mainly, the cosmological and design. Reid loved and frequently used Samuel Clarke's cosmological argument, which says, in short that the universe either has always been, or began to exist, so there must be a cause (or first principle) for both (Cuneo and Woudenberg 242). As everything is either necessary or contingent, an Independent being is required for contingency (Cuneo and Woudenberg 242). Reid spends even more time on his design argument, but is unclear exactly what he wanted his argument to be, as his lectures only went as far as his students needed. Though there is no perfect interpretation, Reid states that \"there are in fact the clearest marks of design and wisdom in the works of nature\" (Cuneo and Woudenberg 291) If something carries marks of design (regularity or variety of structure), there must be an intelligent being behind it (Reid EIP 66). This can't be known by experience, fitting with the casual excellence principle, but the cause can be seen in works of nature (Cuneo and Woudenberg 241).\nWorks.\nUntil recently the standard edition of the \"Inquiry\" and the \"Essays\" has been the sixth edition of Sir William Hamilton (ed.), Edinburgh: Maclachlan and Stewart, 1863. A new critical edition of these titles, plus correspondence and other important material, is being brought out by Edinburgh University Press as The Edinburgh Edition of Thomas Reid. An accessible selection from Hamilton's 6th ed. is \"Thomas Reid's Inquiry and Essays\", ed.

The film stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow, and Gunnar Hansen. The plot follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate. Although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer Ed Gein, its plot is largely fictional.\nHooper produced the film for less than $140,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor, but it was eventually acquired by the Bryanston Distributing Company. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally, being banned in several countries, and numerous theaters stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence.\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" was released in the United States on October 11, 1974. While the film initially received mixed reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office, equivalent with roughly over $150.8 million as of 2019, selling over 16.5 million tickets in 1974. It has since become widely regarded as one of the best and most influential horror films. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons, the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, masked figure, and the final girl. It led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, prequels, a remake, comic books, and video games. In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nIn the early hours of August 18, 1973, a grave robber steals several corpses from a cemetery near Newt, Muerto County, Texas. The robber ties a rotting corpse and other body parts onto a monument, creating a grisly display that is discovered by a local resident as the sun rises.\nDriving in a van, five teenagers take a road trip through the area: Sally Hardesty, Jerry, Pam, Kirk, and Sally's paraplegic brother Franklin. They stop at the cemetery to check on the grave of Sally and Franklin's grandfather, which appears undisturbed. As the group drives past a slaughterhouse, Franklin recounts the Hardesty family's history with animal slaughter. They soon pick up a hitchhiker, who talks about his family who worked at the old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket knife and cuts himself, then takes a single Polaroid picture of the group, for which he demands money. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and attacks Franklin with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van, where he smears blood on the side as they drive off. Low on gas, the group stops at a gas station but its proprietor says that fuel is unavailable. The group explores a nearby abandoned house, owned by the Hardesty family.\nKirk and Pam leave the others behind, planning to visit a nearby swimming hole mentioned by Franklin. On their way there, they discover another house, surrounded by run-down cars, and run by gas-powered generators. Hoping to barter for gas, Kirk enters the house through the unlocked door, while Pam waits outside. As he searches the house, a large man wearing a mask made of skin appears and murders Kirk with a hammer. When Pam enters the house, she stumbles into a room strewn with decaying remains and furniture made from human and animal bones. She attempts to flee but is caught by the man and impaled on a meat hook. The man then starts up a chainsaw, dismembering Kirk as Pam watches. In the evening, Jerry searches for Pam and Kirk. When he enters the other house, he finds Pam's nearly-dead, spasming body in a chest freezer and is killed by the masked man.\nWith darkness falling, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. En route, the masked man ambushes them, killing Franklin with the chainsaw. The man chases Sally into the house, where she finds a very old, seemingly dead man and a woman's rotting corpse. She escapes from the man by jumping through a second-floor window, and she flees to the gas station. With the man in pursuit, Sally arrives at the gas station when he seems to disappear. The station's proprietor comforts Sally with the offer of help, after which he beats and subdues her, loading her into his pickup truck. The proprietor drives to the other house, and the hitchhiker appears. The proprietor scolds him for his actions at the cemetery, identifying the hitchhiker as the grave robber. As they enter the house, the masked man reappears, dressed in women's clothing. The proprietor identifies the masked man and the hitchhiker as brothers, and the hitchhiker refers to the masked man as \"Leatherface\". The two brothers bring the old man\u2014\"Grandpa\"\u2014down the stairs and cut Sally's finger so that Grandpa can suck her blood, Sally then faints from the ordeal.\nThe next morning, Sally regains consciousness. The men taunt her and bicker with each other, resolving to kill her with a hammer. They try to include Grandpa in the activity, but Grandpa is too weak. Sally breaks free and runs onto a road in front of the house, pursued by the brothers. An oncoming truck accidentally runs over the hitchhiker, killing him. The truck driver attacks Leatherface with a large wrench, causing him to fall and injure his leg with the chainsaw. The truck driver flees while Sally, covered in blood, flags down a passing pickup truck and climbs into the bed, narrowly escaping Leatherface. As the pickup drives away, Sally laughs hysterically while an enraged Leatherface swings his chainsaw in the road as the sun rises.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe concept for \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" arose in the early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an assistant film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on murderer Ed Gein, who committed his crimes in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as \"Psycho\" (1960) and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). During development, several names for the film were considered, including \"Saturn in Retrograde\", \"Head Cheese\", \"Stalking Leatherface\", and \"Leatherface\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n I definitely studied Gein\u00a0... but I also noticed a murder case in Houston at the time, a serial murderer you probably remember named Elmer Wayne Henley. He was a young man who recruited victims for an older homosexual man. I saw some news report where Elmer Wayne\u00a0... said, \"I did these crimes, and I'm gonna stand up and take it like a man.\" Well, that struck me as interesting, that he had this conventional morality at that point. He wanted it known that, now that he was caught, he would do the right thing. So this kind of moral schizophrenia is something I tried to build into the characters.\n \u2014 Kim Henkel\nHooper has cited changes in the cultural and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the \"film you are about to see is true\", was a response to being \"lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world\". It reflected the skepticism against the Richard Nixon administration in the wake of the Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, the 1973 economic recession, and \"the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War\". The \"lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things\" that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by \"showing brains spilled all over the road\", led to his belief that \"man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film\". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper while he was in the hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.\nHooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the screenplay and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel as president and Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of the cast and crew that he would have to defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.\nCasting.\nMany of the cast members at the time were relatively unknown actors\u2014Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the \"Austin American-Statesman\". For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.\nIcelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was selected for the role of Leatherface. He regarded Leatherface as having an intellectual disability and having never learned to speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke. John Larroquette performed the narration in the opening credits, for which he was paid in marijuana.\nFilming.\nThe primary filming location was an early 1900s farmhouse located on Quick Hill Road near Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera development is now located. The crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was hot and the cast and crew found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110\u00b0F (43\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 26. Hansen later recalled, \"It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldn't wash my costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didn't have enough money for a second costume. So I wore that [mask] 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for a month.\"\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" was mainly shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, low-speed Ektachrome Commercial film that required considerably more light than modern digital cameras and even most filmstocks of the day. This allowed more mobility and cost savings over shooting on the standard theatrical 35mm format of the time, without significant sacrifices to image quality. Most of the filming took place in the farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.\nThe special effects were simple and limited by the budget. The on-screen blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds \"Grandpa\". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood to come out of its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor. Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was \"virtually solid\" by the last day of shooting. The scene in which Leatherface dismembers Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within of Vail's face. A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's head. Still, the shoot was quite dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that \"everyone hated me by the end of the production\" and that \"it just took years for them to kind of cool off.\"\nThe gas station featured in several scenes of the film is located in Bastrop, Texas. It now operates as a horror-themed attraction, Texas barbecue restaurant, and motel. To maintain its resemblance to the film, the owners preserved various antiques, including the vintage sign that reads \"We Slaughter Barbecue\".\nPost-production.\nThe production exceeded its original $60,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) budget during editing. Sources differ on the film's final cost, offering figures between $93,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and $300,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted). A film production group, Pie in the Sky, partially led by future President of the Texas State Bar Joe K. Longley provided $23,532 (about $ inflation-adjusted) in exchange for 19% of Vortex. This left Henkel, Hooper and the rest of the cast and crew with a 40.5% stake. Warren Skaaren, then head of the Texas Film Commission, helped secure the distribution deal with Bryanston Distributing Company. David Foster, who would later produce the 1982 horror film \"The Thing\", arranged for a private screening for some of Bryanston's West Coast executives, and received 1.5% of Vortex's profits and a deferred fee of $500 (about $ inflation-adjusted).\nOn August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston agreed to distribute the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, \"We made a deal with the devil, [sigh], and I guess that, in a way, we got what we deserved.\" They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),\u2014and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid\u2014only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjusted) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983, New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.\nRelease.\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" premiered in Austin, Texas, on October 11, 1974, almost a year after filming concluded. It screened nationally in the United States as a Saturday afternoon matin\u00e9e and its false marketing as a \"true story\" helped it attract a broad audience. For eight years after 1976, it was annually reissued to first-run theaters, promoted by full-page ads. The film eventually grossed more than $30 million in the United States and Canada ($14.4 million in rentals), making it the 12th-highest-grossing film initially released in 1974, despite its minuscule budget. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The film which you are about to see is an account of the tragedy which befell a group of five youths, in particular Sally Hardesty and her invalid brother, Franklin. [...]\"\n\u2014 The opening crawl falsely suggests that the film is based on true events, a conceit that contributed to its success.\nHooper reportedly hoped that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) would give the complete, uncut release print a \"PG\" rating due to its minimal amount of visible gore. Instead, it was originally rated \"X\". After several minutes were cut, it was resubmitted to the MPAA and received an \"R\" rating. A distributor restored the offending material, and at least one theater presented the full version under an \"R\". In San Francisco, cinema-goers walked out of theaters in disgust and in February 1976, two theaters in Ottawa, Canada, were advised by local police to withdraw the film lest they face morality charges.\nAfter its initial British release, including a one-year theatrical run in London, \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" was initially banned on the advice of British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) Secretary Stephen Murphy, and subsequently by his successor, James Ferman. While the British ban was in force the word \"chainsaw\" itself was barred from movie titles, forcing imitators to rename their films. In 1998, despite the BBFC ban, Camden London Borough Council granted the film a license. The following year the BBFC passed \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" uncut for release with an 18 certificate, and it was broadcast a year later on Channel 4.\nWhen the 83-minute version of the film was submitted to the Australian Classification Board by distributor Seven Keys in June 1975, the Board denied the film a classification, and similarly refused classification of a 77-minute print in December that year. In 1981, the 83-minute version submitted by Greater Union Film Distributors was again refused registration. It was later submitted by Filmways Australasian Distributors and approved for an \"R\" rating in 1984. It was banned for periods in many other countries, including Brazil, Chile, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and West Germany.In France, it was X-rated for \"incitement to violence.\" In Sweden, it would also symbolize a video nasty, a discussed topic at the time.\nThe film was released in 2021 in Australia and 2024 in Russia, grossing $36,879 at the international box office. In 2025, a 4K remaster was released in Poland \u2014 the first time ever it was shown in movie theaters. It grossed $2.5 million in Blu-Ray home sales.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" received a mixed reaction upon its initial release. Linda Gross of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"despicable\" and described Henkel and Hooper as more concerned with creating a realistic atmosphere than with its \"plastic script\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" said it was \"as violent and gruesome and blood-soaked as the title promises\", yet praised its acting and technical execution. Donald B. Berrigan of \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" praised the lead performance of Burns: \"Marilyn Burns, as Sally, deserves a special Academy Award for one of the most sustained and believable acting achievements in movie history.\" Patrick Taggart of the \"Austin American-Statesman\" hailed it as the most important horror film since George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968). \"Variety\" found the picture to be well-made, despite what it called the \"heavy doses of gore\". John McCarty of \"Cinefantastique\" stated that the house featured in the film made the Bates motel \"look positively pleasant by comparison\". Revisiting the film in his 1976 article \"Fashions in Pornography\" for \"Harper's Magazine\", Stephen Koch found its sadistic violence to be extreme and unimaginative.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground. \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" belongs in a select company (with \"Night of the Living Dead\" and \"Last House on the Left\") of films that are really a lot better than the genre requires. Not, however, that you'd necessarily enjoy seeing it.\n\u2014 Roger Ebert, writing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\"\nCritics later frequently praised both the film's aesthetic quality and its power. Observing that it managed to be \"horrifying without being a bloodbath (you'll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)\", Bruce Westbrook of the \"Houston Chronicle\" called it \"a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing\". \"TV Guide\" thought it was \"intelligent\" in its \"bloodless depiction of violence\", while Anton Bitel felt the fact that it was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences \"a punishing assault on the senses\". In \"Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema\", Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence. Mike Emery of \"The Austin Chronicle\" praised the film's \"subtle touches\"\u2014such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas\u2014and said that what made it so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality.\nIt has often been described as one of the scariest films of all time. Rex Reed called it the most terrifying film he had ever seen. \"Empire\" described it as \"the most purely horrifying horror movie ever made\" and called it \"never less than totally committed to scaring you witless\". Reminiscing about his first viewing of the film, horror director Wes Craven recalled wondering \"what kind of Mansonite crazoid\" could have created such a thing. It is a work of \"cataclysmic terror\", in the words of horror novelist Stephen King, who declared, \"I would happily testify to its redeeming social merit in any court in the country.\" Critic Robin Wood found it one of the few horror films to possess \"the authentic quality of nightmare\". Quentin Tarantino called it \"one of the few perfect movies ever made.\"\nBased on 85 reviews published since 2000, the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 84% of critics gave it a positive review, with an average score of 8.20/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"Thanks to a smart script and documentary-style camerawork, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" achieves start-to-finish suspense, making it a classic in low-budget exploitation cinema.\"\nCultural impact.\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" is widely considered one of the greatest\u2014and most controversial\u2014horror films of all time and a major influence on the genre. In 1999, Richard Zoglin of \"Time\" commented that it had \"set a new standard for slasher films\". \"The Times\" listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time. Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary. Describing it as \"cheap, grubby and out of control\", Mark Olsen of the \"Los Angeles Times\" declared that it \"both defines and entirely supersedes the very notion of the exploitation picture\". In his book \"Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film\", David Hogan called it \"the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" is something far more horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity.\" According to Bill Nichols, it \"achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal\". Leonard Wolf praised the film as \"an exquisite work of art\" and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence.\nLeatherface has gained a reputation as a significant character in the horror genre. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said, \"In our collective consciousness, Leatherface and his chainsaw have become as iconic as Freddy and his razors or Jason and his hockey mask.\" Don Sumner called \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" a classic that not only introduced a new villain to the horror pantheon but also influenced an entire generation of filmmakers. According to Rebecca Ascher-Walsh of \"Entertainment Weekly\", it laid the foundations for the \"Halloween\", \"Evil Dead\", and \"Blair Witch\" horror franchises. Wes Craven crafted his 1977 film \"The Hills Have Eyes\" as an homage to \"Massacre\", while Ridley Scott cited Hooper's film as an inspiration for his 1979 film \"Alien\". French director Alexandre Aja credited it as an early influence on his career. Horror filmmaker and heavy metal musician Rob Zombie sees it as a major influence on his work, including his films \"House of 1000 Corpses\" (2003) and \"The Devil's Rejects\" (2005).\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" was selected for the 1975 Cannes Film Festival Directors' Fortnight and London Film Festival. In 1976, it won the Special Jury Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in France. \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the film sixth on its 2003 list of \"The Top 50 Cult Films\". In a 2005 \"Total Film\" poll, it was selected as the greatest horror film of all time. It was named among \"Time\"'s top 25 horror films in 2007. In 2008 the film ranked number 199 on \"Empire\" magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". \"Empire\" also ranked it 46th in its list of the 50 greatest independent films. In a 2010 \"Total Film\" poll, it was again selected as the greatest horror film; the judging panel included veteran horror directors such as John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and George A. Romero. In 2010, as well, \"The Guardian\" ranked it number 14 on its list of the top 25 horror films. It was also voted the greatest horror film of all time in \"Slant Magazine\"'s 2013 list of the greatest horror films of all time. It was also voted the scariest movie of all time in a 2017 list by \"Complex\" and voted the best horror movie of all time in a 2017 list by \"Thrillist\". It was also voted the scariest movie of all time in a 2018 list by \"Consequence of Sound\" and voted the best horror movie of all time in a 2018 list by \"Esquire\". In 2024, Variety selected it as the greatest horror movie of all time.\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" was inducted into the Horror Hall of Fame in 1990, with Hooper accepting the award, and it is part of the permanent collection of New York City's Museum of Modern Art. In 2012, the film was named by critics in the British Film Institute's \"Sight &amp; Sound\" magazine as one of the 250 greatest films. The Academy Film Archive houses the Texas Chain Saw Massacre Collection, which contains over fifty items, including many original elements for the film.\nThemes and analysis.\nContemporary American life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Hooper's apocalyptic landscape is\u00a0... a desert wasteland of dissolution where once vibrant myth is desiccated. The ideas and iconography of Cooper, Bret Harte and Francis Parkman are now transmogrified into yards of dying cattle, abandoned gasoline stations, defiled graveyards, crumbling mansions, and a ramshackle farmhouse of psychotic killers. \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" [is]\u00a0... recognizable as a statement about the dead end of American experience.\n \u2014 Christopher Sharrett\nCritic Christopher Sharrett argues that since Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" (1960) and \"The Birds\" (1963), the American horror film has been defined by the questions it poses \"about the fundamental validity of the American civilizing process\", concerns amplified during the 1970s by the \"delegitimation of authority in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate\". \"If \"Psycho\" began an exploration of a new sense of absurdity in contemporary life, of the collapse of causality and the diseased underbelly of American Gothic\", he writes, \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" \"carries this exploration to a logical conclusion, addressing many of the issues of Hitchcock's film while refusing comforting closure\".\nRobin Wood characterizes Leatherface and his family as victims of industrial capitalism, their jobs as slaughterhouse workers having been rendered obsolete by technological advances. He states that the picture \"brings to focus a spirit of negativity\u00a0... that seems to lie not far below the surface of the modern collective consciousness\". Naomi Merritt explores the film's representation of \"cannibalistic capitalism\" in relation to Georges Bataille's theory of taboo and transgression. She elaborates on Wood's analysis, stating that the Sawyer family's values \"reflect, or correspond to, established and interdependent American institutions\u00a0... but their embodiment of these social units is perverted and transgressive.\"\nIn Kim Newman's view, Hooper's presentation of the Sawyer family during the dinner scene parodies a typical American sitcom family: the gas station owner is the bread-winning father figure; the killer Leatherface is depicted as a bourgeois housewife; the hitchhiker acts as the rebellious teenager. Isabel Cristina Pinedo, author of \"Recreational Terror: Women and the Pleasures of Horror Film Viewing\", states, \"The horror genre must keep terror and comedy in tension if it is to successfully tread the thin line that separates it from terrorism and parody\u00a0... this delicate balance is struck in \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" in which the decaying corpse of Grandpa not only incorporates horrific and humorous effects, but actually uses one to exacerbate the other.\"\nViolence against women.\nThe underlying themes of the film have been the subject of extensive critical discussion; critics and scholars have interpreted it as a paradigmatic exploitation film in which female protagonists are subjected to brutal, sadistic violence. Stephen Prince comments that the horror is \"born of the torment of the young woman subjected to imprisonment and abuse amid decaying arms\u00a0... and mobiles made of human bones and teeth.\" As with many slasher films, it incorporates the \"final girl\" trope\u2014the heroine and inevitable lone survivor who somehow escapes the horror that befalls the other characters: Sally Hardesty is wounded and tortured, yet manages to survive with the help of a male truck driver. Critics argue that even in exploitation films in which the ratio of male and female deaths is roughly equal, the images that linger will be of the violence committed against the female characters. The specific case of \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" provides support for this argument: three men are killed in quick fashion, but one woman is brutally slaughtered\u2014hung on a meathook\u2014and the surviving woman endures physical and mental torture. In 1977, critic Mary Mackey described the meathook scene as probably the most brutal onscreen female death in any commercially distributed film. She placed it in a lineage of violent films that depict women as weak and incapable of protecting themselves.\nIn one study, a group of men were shown five films depicting differing levels of violence against women. On first viewing \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" they experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, upon subsequent viewing they found the violence against women less offensive and more enjoyable. Another study, investigating gender-specific perceptions of slasher films, involved 30 male and 30 female university students. One male participant described the screaming, especially Sally's, as the \"most freaky thing\" in the film.\nAccording to Jesse Stommel of \"Bright Lights Film Journal\", the lack of explicit violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they play a central role in imagining. Nonetheless\u2014citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium\u2014Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.\nVegetarianism.\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" has been described as \"the ultimate pro-vegetarian film\" due to its animal rights themes. In a video essay, film critic Rob Ager describes the irony in humans' being slaughtered for meat, putting humans in the position of being slaughtered like farm animals. Hooper has confirmed that \"it's a film about meat\" and even gave up meat while making the film, saying, \"In a way I thought the heart of the film was about meat; it's about the chain of life and killing sentient beings.\" Writer-director Guillermo del Toro became a vegetarian for a time after seeing the film.\nPost-release.\n\"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" has appeared on various home video formats. In the US, it was first released on videotape and CED in the early 1980s by Wizard Video and Vestron Video. The British Board of Film Classification had long since refused a certification for the uncut theatrical version and in 1984 they also refused to certify it for home video, amid a moral panic surrounding \"video nasties\". After the retirement of BBFC Director James Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut for theatrical and video distribution with an 18 certificate, almost 25 years after the original release. \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" was released on LaserDisc in the United States in November 1993. It was initially released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States, May 2000 in the United Kingdom and 2001 in Australia.\nIn 2005 the film received a 2K scan and full restoration from the original 16mm A/B rolls, which was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2014, a more extensive 4K restoration, supervised by Hooper, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out. After a screening in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. Dark Sky Films' US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards. In 2024, for the film's 50th anniversary, the film was released to Ultra HD Blu-ray and re-released to VHS in a collector's edition.\nIn 1982, shortly after \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" established itself as a success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As one of the first horror-themed video games, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.\nThe film has been followed by eight other films to date, including sequels, prequels and remakes. The first sequel, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\" (1986), was considerably more graphic and violent than the original and was banned in Australia for 20 years before it was released on DVD in a revised special edition in October 2006. ' (1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film, \"Spontaneous Combustion\". ', starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, was released in 1995. While briefly acknowledging the events of the preceding two sequels, its plot makes it a virtual remake of the 1974 original. A straight remake, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", was released by Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema in 2003. It was followed by a prequel, \"\", in 2006. A seventh film, \"Texas Chainsaw 3D\", was released on January 4, 2013. It is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, with no relation to the previous sequels, or the 2003 remake. Another prequel, \"Leatherface\", was released exclusively to DirecTV on September 21, 2017, before receiving a wider release on video on demand and in limited theaters, simultaneously, in North America on October 20, 2017. Another sequel, \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", was released exclusively on Netflix on February 18, 2022.\nAdaptations.\nIn 2023, both a tabletop game and a pinball machine based on the film were released. In 2025, a haunted house attraction called Universal Horror Unleashed features characters from the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It follows the life of Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler who gets assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire, also named Jeffrey Lebowski, was the intended victim.\nThe film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story \u2013 how it moves episodically and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.\" The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.\n\"The Big Lebowski\" was produced by Working Title Films and distributed by Gramercy Pictures in the United States and Canada and by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment internationally. It received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Reviews have since become largely positive and the film has garnered a cult following, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nIn 1991, slacker and bowler Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski is attacked in his Los Angeles home by two enforcers for porn kingpin Jackie Treehorn, to whom a different Jeffrey Lebowski's wife owes money. One enforcer urinates on the Dude's rug before they realize they have the wrong man and leave.\nAfter consulting his bowling partners, Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos, the Dude visits philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (\"the big Lebowski\"), requesting compensation for the rug. Lebowski refuses, but the Dude tricks his assistant Brandt into letting him take a similar rug from the mansion. Outside, he meets Lebowski's trophy wife Bunny and her German nihilist friend Uli. Soon afterward, Bunny is apparently kidnapped and Lebowski hires the Dude to deliver a ransom. That night, another group of thugs ambushes the Dude, taking his replacement rug on behalf of Lebowski's daughter Maude.\nConvinced the kidnap was a ruse by Bunny, Walter fakes the ransom drop. He and the Dude return to the bowling alley, leaving the briefcase of money in the Dude's car. While they are bowling, the car is stolen. The Dude is confronted by Lebowski, who has an envelope from the kidnappers containing a severed toe, supposedly Bunny's. Maude asks the Dude to help recover the money her father illegally withdrew from the family's charity foundation.\nThe police recover the Dude's car. The briefcase is missing, but the Dude finds a sheet of homework signed by a teenager named Larry Sellers. Walter learns that Larry is the son of Arthur Digby Sellers, a writer for the television show \"Branded\", that Walter reveres. The Dude and Walter visit Larry but get no information from him.\nJackie Treehorn's thugs abduct the Dude and bring him to the porn kingpin, who demands to know where Bunny is. The Dude says Bunny faked her kidnapping and Larry has the money, then passes out from a spiked drink Treehorn gave him. He is briefly arrested while wandering intoxicated in Malibu. On his way home, Bunny drives by, unnoticed by the Dude.\nMaude is waiting for the Dude at his home and has sex with him, wishing to become pregnant by a father with whom she will not have to interact. She tells the Dude that her father has no money of his own; he is dependent on an allowance that Maude gives him from her inheritance from her late mother.\nThe Dude and Walter confront Lebowski and find that Bunny has returned, having simply gone out of town. Bunny's nihilist friends took the opportunity to blackmail her husband, who in turn had tried to embezzle money from the family charity, blaming its disappearance on the blackmailers. The Dude believes the briefcase never contained any money. Walter suspects that Lebowski is faking his paralysis and lifts him out of his wheelchair, but his condition is real.\nWalter and the Dude are bowling when a rival bowler, Jesus Quintana, interrupts them. Walter had previously stated that he could not bowl on Saturdays since he is shomer Shabbos. Quintana implies that he does not believe Walter's excuse for not bowling on Saturday, threatens Walter and the Dude, and storms out. Outside the bowling alley, the nihilists set fire to the Dude's car and demand the ransom money. Walter fights them off, but Donny dies from a heart attack in the commotion. Unwilling to pay for an urn from the local crematorium, the Dude and Walter opt to put Donny's ashes in a coffee can instead. On a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Walter eulogizes Donny's death but ruins it by referring to his fallen comrades in Vietnam. As he scatters Donny's ashes, they are blown back onto the Dude by an updraft. As Walter tries to brush off the ashes, the Dude loses his temper and yells at him for everything that has happened. After apologizing and consoling the Dude, the two go bowling.\nAt the bowling alley, the Dude encounters the Stranger, the movie's narrator, who sums up everything that happened in the film and states that while he \"didn't like seeing Donny go\", he remains inspired by the Dude and that Maude is pregnant with a \"little Lebowski on the way\".\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe Dude is mostly inspired by Jeff Dowd, an American film producer and political activist the Coen brothers met while they were trying to find distribution for their first feature, \"Blood Simple\". Dowd had been a member of the Seattle Seven, liked to drink white Russians, and was known as \"The Dude\". The Dude was also partly based on a friend of the Coen brothers, Peter Exline (now a member of the faculty at USC's School of Cinematic Arts), a Vietnam War veteran who reportedly lived in a dump of an apartment and was proud of a little rug that \"tied the room together\". Exline knew Barry Sonnenfeld from New York University and Sonnenfeld introduced Exline to the Coen brothers while they were trying to raise money for \"Blood Simple\". Exline became friends with the Coens and in 1989, told them many stories from his own life, including some about his actor-writer friend Lewis Abernathy (one of the inspirations for Walter), a fellow Vietnam vet who later became a private investigator and helped him track down and confront a high school kid who stole his car. As in the film, Exline's car was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department and Abernathy found an 8th grader's homework under the passenger seat.\nExline also belonged to an amateur softball league but the Coens changed it to bowling in the film, because \"it's a very social sport where you can sit around and drink and smoke while engaging in inane conversation\". The Coens met filmmaker John Milius when they were in Los Angeles making \"Barton Fink\" and incorporated his love of guns and the military into the character of Walter. Milius introduced the Coen Brothers to one of his best friends, Jim Ganzer, who also served as a source for creating Jeff Bridges' character. Also known as the Dude, Ganzer and his gang, typical Malibu surfers, served as inspiration as well for Milius's film \"Big Wednesday\".\nBefore David Huddleston was cast as \"Big\" Jeffrey Lebowski, the Coens considered numerous actors for the role: Robert Duvall (who did not like the script), Anthony Hopkins (who was not interested in playing an American), Gene Hackman (who was taking a break from acting at the time), Jack Nicholson (who was not interested, he only wanted to portray Moses), Tommy Lee Jones (who was considered \"too young\"), Ned Beatty, Michael Caine, Bruce Dern, James Coburn, Charles Durning, Jackie Cooper, Fred Ward, Richard Mulligan, Rod Steiger, Peter Boyle, Lloyd Bridges, Paul Dooley, Pat Hingle, Jonathan Winters, Norman Mailer, George C. Scott, Jerry Falwell, Gore Vidal, Andy Griffith, William F. Buckley, and Ernest Borgnine. The Coens' top choice was Marlon Brando. Charlize Theron was considered for the role of Bunny Lebowski. David Cross auditioned for the role of Brandt.\nAccording to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist Carolee Schneemann, \"who worked naked from a swing\", and on Yoko Ono.\nThe character of Jesus Quintana, a bowling opponent of the Dude's team, was inspired in part by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988 at the Public Theater in a play called \"Mi Puta Vida\" in which he played a pederast-type character, \"so we thought, let's make Turturro a pederast. It'll be something he can really run with,\" Joel said in an interview.\nThe film's overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, \"We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling \u2013 like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes.\" The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, \"He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain.\"\nThe significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, \"important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless.\"\nScreenplay.\nThe Coen Brothers wrote \"The Big Lebowski\" around the same time as \"Barton Fink\". When the Coen brothers wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for \"Roseanne\" and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film \"Wild Bill\". The Coens decided to make \"Fargo\" in the meantime. According to Ethan, \"the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter\", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in \"Barton Fink\". They also came up with the idea of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's \"The Long Goodbye\" as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that \"The Big Lebowski\" \"is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges\". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often \"encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies.\" In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an \"effete art-world hanger-on\", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.\nPre-production.\nPolyGram and Working Title Films, which had funded \"Fargo\", backed \"The Big Lebowski\" with a budget of $15\u00a0million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, \"we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's going to play the role. In \"The Big Lebowski\" we did write for John [Goodman] and Steve [Buscemi], but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role.\" The Coens originally considered Mel Gibson for the role of the Dude, but he did not take the pitch too seriously. Bridges was hesitant to play the role as he was worried that would be a bad example for his daughters, but his daughter Jessica convinced him to take it after a meeting. In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually \"drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude.\" The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the \"Gladiator\" or what they called the \"Chin Strap\" and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.\nFor the film's look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clich\u00e9s like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and for it to be \"consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy\", Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif, featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he \"came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior\". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. \"Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars\", remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a \"very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it.\"\nCinematographer Roger Deakins discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.\nPrincipal photography.\nActual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the Hollywood Star Lanes (for three weeks) and the Dude's Busby Berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar. According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges \"was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot.\" Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on \"\". She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997, while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech. During the latter stages of shooting, Moore became pregnant with her son, who was eventually born in December 1997.\nJoel Coen said that Jeff Bridges was upset there was no playback monitor so Bridges made them get a playback monitor at the end of the second week of production.\nThe scenes in Jackie Treehorn's house were shot in the Sheats-Goldstein Residence, designed by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills.\nDeakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, \"it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty\" with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect. The Coen brothers shot much of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.\nTo achieve the point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen brothers mounted a camera \"on something like a barbecue spit\", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. CGI was used to create the vantage point of the thumb hole in the bowling ball.\nSoundtrack.\nThe original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a veteran of all the Coen Brothers' films. \"The Big Lebowski (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\" was released through Mercury Records on February 24, 1998, and was jointly produced by the Coens and the film's music supervisor T\u00a0Bone Burnett.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"The Big Lebowski\" received its world premiere at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 1998, at the 1,300-capacity Eccles Theater. It was also screened at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival before opening in the United States and Canada on March 6, 1998, in 1,207 theaters. It grossed $5.5\u00a0million on its opening weekend, finishing up with a gross of $19.5 million in the United States and Canada, just above its $15 million budget. The film's worldwide gross outside of the US and Canada was $28.8 million, (including $2.6 million in the United Kingdom) bringing its worldwide gross to $48.3 million.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 191 reviews, with an average score of 7.40/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"\"The Big Lebowski\"'s shaggy dog story won't satisfy everybody, but those who abide will be treated to a rambling succession of comic delights, with Jeff Bridges' laconic performance really tying the movie together.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nMany critics and audiences have likened the film to a modern Western, while many others dispute this, or liken it to a crime novel that revolves around mistaken identity plot devices. Peter Howell, in his review for the \"Toronto Star\", wrote: \"It's hard to believe that this is the work of a team that won an Oscar last year for the original screenplay of \"Fargo\". There's a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps.\" Howell revised his opinion in a later review, and in 2011 stated that \"it may just be my favourite Coen Bros. film.\"\nTodd McCarthy in \"Variety\" magazine wrote: \"One of the film's indisputable triumphs is its soundtrack, which mixes Carter Burwell's original score with classic pop tunes and some fabulous covers.\" \"USA Today\" gave the film three out of four stars and felt that the Dude was \"too passive a hero to sustain interest,\" but that there was \"enough startling brilliance here to suggest that, just like the Dude, those smarty-pants Coens will abide.\"\nIn his review for \"The Washington Post\", Desson Howe praised the Coens and \"their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, peculiar Americana\u00a0\u2013 but a sort of neo-Americana that is entirely invented\u00a0\u2013 the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. No one does it like them and, it almost goes without saying, no one does it better.\"\nJanet Maslin praised Bridges' performance in her review for \"The New York Times\": \"Mr. Bridges finds a role so right for him that he seems never to have been anywhere else. Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair.\" Andrew Sarris, in his review for the \"New York Observer\", wrote: \"The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there'll be anything else like it the rest of this year.\" In a five star review for \"Empire,\" Ian Nathan wrote: \"For those who delight in the Coens' divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana\" and \"in a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars out of four, saying \"The Big Lebowski\" was inferior to \"Fargo\" but nonetheless described it as \"a genial, shambling comedy\" which was \"weirdly engaging.\" In a 2010 review, Ebert raised his original score to four stars out of four and added the film to his \"Great Movies\" canon. Ebert declared the film's plot was almost irrelevant, but the film was nonetheless a triumph of visual style and eccentric character performances anchored by Bridges' role: \"The Dude is in a sense [Raymond Chandler's private investigator] Philip Marlowe \u2014 not in his energy or focus, but in the code he lives by.\"\nA more negative assessment came from Jonathan Rosenbaum, who wrote in the \"Chicago Reader\": \"To be sure, \"The Big Lebowski\" is packed with show-offy filmmaking and as a result is pretty entertaining. But insofar as it represents a moral position\u2014and the Coens' relative styling of their figures invariably does\u2014it's an elitist one, elevating salt-of-the-earth types like Bridges and Goodman ... over everyone else in the movie.\" Dave Kehr, in his review for the \"Daily News\", criticized the film's premise as a \"tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film.\" \"The Guardian\" criticized the film as \"a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random. The film is infuriating, and will win no prizes. But it does have some terrific jokes.\"\nLegacy.\nSince its original release, \"The Big Lebowski\" has become a cult classic. Ardent fans of the film call themselves \"achievers\". Steve Palopoli wrote about the film's emerging cult status in July 2002. He first realized that the film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and witnessed people quoting dialogue from the film to each other. Soon after the article appeared, the programmer for a local midnight film series in Santa Cruz decided to screen \"The Big Lebowski\" and on the first weekend they had to turn away several hundred people. The theater held the film over for six weeks, which had never happened before.\nAn annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, and has since expanded to several other cities. The festival's main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands the night before the bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event. The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as the Dude Abides and is held in London.\nDudeism, a religion devoted largely to spreading the philosophy and lifestyle of the film's main character, was founded in 2005. Also known as \"The Church of the Latter-Day Dude\" (a name parody of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), the organization has ordained over 220,000 \"Dudeist Priests\" all over the world via its website.\n\"The Big Lebowski and Philosophy: Keeping Your Mind Limber with Abiding Wisdom,\" published in 2012 by Wiley, is a collection of 18 essays by different writers analyzing the movie's philosophical themes of nihilism, war and politics, money and materialism, idealism and morality, and the Dude as the philosopher's hero who struggles to live the good life in spite of the challenges he endures.\nTwo species of African spider are named after the film and main character: \"Anelosimus biglebowski\" and \"Anelosimus dude\", both described in 2006. Additionally, an extinct Permian conifer genus is named after the film in honor of its creators. The first species described within this genus in 2007 is based on 270-million-year-old plant fossils from Texas, and is called \"Lebowskia grandifolia\".\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked it 8th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list. The film was also ranked No. 34 on their list of \"The Top 50 Cult Films\" and ranked No. 15 on the magazine's \"The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83\" list. In addition, the magazine also ranked the Dude No. 14 in their \"The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\" poll. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association. \"The Big Lebowski\" was voted as the 10th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of \"Los Angeles Times\" writers and editors with two criteria: \"The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list.\" \"Empire\" magazine ranked Walter Sobchak No. 49 and the Dude No. 7 in their \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll. Roger Ebert added \"The Big Lebowski\" to his list of \"Great Movies\" in March 2010.\nSpin-off.\nThe Coen brothers have stated that they will never make a sequel to \"The Big Lebowski\". Nevertheless, John Turturro expressed interest in reprising his role as Jesus Quintana, and in 2014, he announced that he had requested permission to use the character. In August 2016, it was reported that Turturro would reprise his role as Jesus Quintana in \"The Jesus Rolls\", a spin-off of \"The Big Lebowski\", based on the 1974 French film \"Going Places\", with Turturro starring, writing, and directing. It was released in 2020. The Coen brothers, although having granted Turturro the right to use the character, were not involved, and no other character from \"The Big Lebowski\" was featured in the film.\nStella Artois commercial.\nOn January 24, 2019, Jeff Bridges posted a 5-second clip on Twitter with the statement: \"Can't be living in the past, man. Stay tuned\" and showing Bridges as the Dude, walking through a room as a tumbleweed rolls by. The clip was a teaser trailer for an ad during Super Bowl LIII which featured Bridges reprising the role of the Dude for a Stella Artois commercial.\nUse as social and political analysis.\n\"The Big Lebowski\" has been interpreted from a variety of social and political perspectives by academics and pundits.\nIn September 2008, \"Slate\" published an article that interpreted \"The Big Lebowski\" as a political critique. The center piece of this viewpoint was that Walter Sobchak is \"a neocon,\" citing the film's references to then President George H. W. Bush and the first Gulf War. The article says Sobchak's aggressive and impulsive attitude, which always results in catastrophe, is an allegory of neoconservative foreign policy and its supposed consequences.\nA journal article by Brian Wall, published in the feminist journal \"Camera Obscura,\" uses the film to explain Karl Marx's commodity fetishism and the feminist consequences of sexual fetishism.\nIn \"That Rug Really Tied the Room Together,\" first published in 2001, Joseph Natoli argues that the Dude represents a counter narrative to the post-Reaganomic entrepreneurial rush for \"return on investment\" on display in such films as \"Jerry Maguire\" and \"Forrest Gump.\"\nThe movie has been interpreted as carnivalesque critique of society, as an analysis on war and ethics, as a narrative on mass communication and US militarism and other issues.\nHome media.\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment released a \"Collector's Edition\" DVD on October 18, 2005, with extra features that included an \"introduction by Mortimer Young\", \"Jeff Bridges' Photography\", \"Making of \"The Big Lebowski\"\", and \"Production Notes\". In addition, a limited-edition \"Achiever's Edition Gift Set\" also included \"The Big Lebowski\" Bowling Shammy Towel, four Collectible Coasters that included photographs and quotable lines from the film, and eight Exclusive Photo Cards from Jeff Bridges' personal collection.\nA \"10th Anniversary Edition\" was released on September 9, 2008, and features all of the extras from the \"Collector's Edition\" and \"The Dude's Life: Strikes and Gutters ... Ups and Downs ... The Dude Abides\" theatrical trailer (from the first DVD release), \"The Lebowski Fest: An Achiever's Story\", \"Flying Carpets and Bowling Pin Dreams: The Dream Sequences of the Dude\", \"Interactive Map\", \"Jeff Bridges Photo Book\", and a \"Photo Gallery\". There are both a standard release and a Limited Edition which features \"Bowling Ball Packaging\" and is individually numbered.\nA high-definition version of \"The Big Lebowski\" was released by Universal on HD DVD format on June 26, 2007. The film was released in Blu-ray format in Italy by Cecchi Gori.\nOn August 16, 2011, Universal Pictures released \"The Big Lebowski\" on Blu-ray. The limited-edition package includes a Jeff Bridges photo book, a ten-years-on retrospective, and an in-depth look at the annual Lebowski Fest. The film is also available in the Blu-ray Coen Brothers box set released in the UK; however, this version is region-free and will work in any Blu-ray player.\nFor the film's 20th Anniversary, Universal Pictures released a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the film, which was released on October 16, 2018.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cook and Mark Rosner. It stars Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris, with supporting roles played by Michael Biehn, William Forsythe, David Morse, Tony Todd and John Spencer. Connery plays a former SAS captain and Cage an FBI chemist, who must rescue hostages from a rogue group of Force Recon Marines on Alcatraz Island.\n\"The Rock\" was dedicated to the memory of Simpson, who died five months before its release. It was released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution through the Hollywood Pictures label on June 7, 1996. It received positive reviews and was nominated for Best Sound at the 69th Academy Awards. It earned over $335\u00a0million at the box office on a production budget of $75\u00a0million, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 1996. \"The Rock\" was remade in India in 2003 as \"\".\n\"The Rock\" was the basis for false descriptions of the Iraqi chemical weapons program. Britain's Secret Intelligence Service was led to believe Saddam Hussein was continuing to produce weapons of mass destruction by a false agent who based his reports on \"The Rock\", according to the Chilcot Inquiry.\nPlot.\nAfter many failed attempts to get his fallen men the recognition they deserved via the proper channels and fed up with the U.S. Government\u2019s underhanded tactics, USMC Brigadier General Francis Hummel and his rogue group of Force Recon Marines, including his loyal subordinate Major Tom Baxter, steal 15 rockets filled with lethal VX gas from a U.S. Navy facility. The next day, they seize control of Alcatraz Island, taking the tourists and guards hostage. Hummel contacts the FBI and threatens to launch the rockets at the San Francisco Bay Area unless the government pays him $100 million, of which some will be donated to the families of the men who died during his command but were never compensated.\nThe Department of Defense and the FBI both attempt to retake Alcatraz by infiltrating the old tunnel system beneath the island, with Navy SEALs led by Commander Anderson. They recruit FBI chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed to join them and disarm the rockets safely. With no knowledge of the latest architecture of the tunnels whatsoever, FBI Director Womack and others reluctantly call on the aid of the imprisoned John Mason, a former British MI6 and SAS operative and the only man to escape Alcatraz after he stole a microfilm created by J. Edgar Hoover containing classified U.S. information. Mason refused to reveal the microfilm's location after being captured, knowing he would be killed and was imprisoned without trial. Mason agrees after signing a pardon that clears his record, though Womack destroys it shortly thereafter.\nMason escapes and leads the FBI on a car chase, causing a rampage through the city before being caught by Goodspeed when he meets with his estranged daughter, Jade. At the command center, Mason negotiates to join the team heading to Alcatraz. The team infiltrates the prison, but Hummel's men are alerted to their presence and ambush them in the shower room. Hummel tries to convince Anderson to surrender, but the zealous Captain Frye and Captain Darrow deliberately cause a shootout that kills Anderson and his team. Mason and Goodspeed manage to evade them. Believing the mission to be a failure, Mason prepares to leave until Goodspeed reveals the truth about the VX, explaining that Mason's daughter and his pregnant fianc\u00e9e, Carla (who came to San Francisco despite Goodspeed telling her to stay home), would be killed as well.\nMason works together with Goodspeed to disable twelve rockets and kill several Marines. After Hummel threatens to execute a hostage, Mason surrenders to stall him while Goodspeed disables another rocket before also being captured. They escape from their cells, but Mason, having assessed Hummel as a soldier who doesn't kill innocents, leaves, with Goodspeed continuing on his own. Caught and held at gunpoint, Goodspeed is forced to surrender, but Mason saves him, convinced that Goodspeed's unborn child needs its father.\nAs the ransom deadline passes, Frye and Darrow pressure Hummel into firing a rocket, but he redirects it to detonate in the sea. Hummel explains the rockets were a bluff and that he never intended to kill anyone. Realizing they will not be paid, Frye and Darrow convince the remaining soldiers to mutiny against Hummel and Baxter. Baxter is killed and Hummel is mortally wounded but tells Goodspeed the location of the last rocket.\nWith the SEALs dead, the government attempts to launch a secondary measure: an airstrike aimed at destroying Alcatraz with experimental thermite plasma bombs, which will neutralize the gas but kill everyone on the island. Goodspeed and Mason kill the remaining Marines before Goodspeed launches green flares, a signal that the attack be aborted. However, one of the bombs was already dropped at the back of the island. The blast throws Goodspeed into the bay, but Mason saves him from drowning.\nGoodspeed confirms the mission's success to Womack but claims Mason was killed in the explosion before telling Mason that Womack shredded his pardon. The pair part ways amicably, with Goodspeed telling Mason the location of fake papers and money. Mason suggests Goodspeed attend a church in Kansas where he kept the microfilm. Sometime later, Goodspeed and his newly wedded wife, Carla, recover the microfilm from the church, which apparently contains information on the assassination of John F. Kennedy and various other famous conspiracy theories.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Sean Connery as Captain (retired) John Patrick Mason SAS/MI6\nUncredited members of the cast include Stuart Wilson as General Al Kramer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; David Marshall Grant as White House Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair; Philip Baker Hall as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; Xander Berkeley as FBI technician Lonner; and Stanley Anderson as the President of the United States. Moreover, Luenell Campbell features as a tourist in a jail cell.\nOther actors in smaller roles include Todd Louiso as FBI agent Marvin Isherwood, David Bowe as Dr. Ling, Howard Platt as Louis Lindstrom, John Laughlin as General Peterson, Harry Humphries as Admiral Johansson, Willie Garson as Francis Reynolds, Anthony Clark as Paul the hairdresser, Tom Towles as an Alcatraz park ranger, and Anthony Guidera and Jim Caviezel as F-18 pilots.\nMembers of Hummel's USMC unit are played by Raymond Cruz (\"uncredited\") as Sergeant Rojas, Jim Maniaci as Private Scarpetti, Greg Collins as Private Gamble, Brendan Kelly as Private Cox, and Steve Harris as Private McCoy. Dennis Chalker (Dando) and Marshall R. Teague (Reigert) play members of Anderson's SEAL team.\nProduction.\nWriting and pre-production.\nJonathan Hensleigh participated in writing the script, which became the subject of a dispute with the Writers Guild of America. The spec script (by David Weisberg and Douglas Cook) was reworked by several writers, but other than the original team, Mark Rosner was the only one granted official credit by guild arbitration. The rule is that the credited writing team must contribute 50% of the final script (effectively limiting credits to the screenplay's initial authors, plus one re-write team). Despite his work on the script, Hensleigh was not credited in the film. Michael Bay wrote an open letter of protest, in which he criticized the arbitration procedure as a \"sham\" and a \"travesty\". He said Hensleigh had worked closely with him and should have received screen credit.\nBritish screenwriting team Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were brought in at Sean Connery's request to rewrite his lines, but ended up altering much of the film's dialogue. Quentin Tarantino and Aaron Sorkin were also uncredited script doctors.\nCasting.\nAt one point, Arnold Schwarzenegger was to have played the role of Goodspeed. Schwarzenegger turned the role down because he did not like the script.\nFilming.\nMost of \"The Rock\" was shot on location in the Alcatraz Prison on Alcatraz Island. As it is governed by the National Park Service, it was not possible to close Alcatraz, and much of the filming had to accommodate tour parties. The scene in which FBI Director Womack is thrown off the balcony was filmed on location at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. The filming led to numerous calls to the hotel by people who saw a man dangling from the balcony. The closing scene was shot outside the Sacred Heart Mission Church in Saticoy, California.\n\"The Rock\" was Bay's first film shot in a widescreen 2.39:1 aspect ratio, via Super 35. On the commentary track for the Criterion Collection DVD of \"Armageddon\", Bay recalls not liking the format, due to the quality of the release prints, and did not touch the format again until \"Bad Boys II\", at which point the digital intermediate process was available.\nThere were tensions during shooting between Bay and Walt Disney Studios executives who were supervising the production. On the commentary track for the Criterion Collection DVD, Bay recalls a time when he was preparing to leave the set for a meeting with the executives when he was approached by Connery in golfing attire. Connery, who also produced the film, asked Bay where he was going, and when Bay explained he had a meeting with the executives, Connery asked if he could accompany him. When Bay arrived in the conference room, the executives were surprised when they saw Connery behind him. According to Bay, Connery stood up for Bay and insisted that he was doing a good job and should be left alone.\nMusic.\nThe soundtrack to \"The Rock\" was released on the same day as the film, June 7, 1996, by Hollywood Records. Hans Zimmer and his longtime collaborator Nick Glennie-Smith were the principal composers, while Harry Gregson-Williams was the score producer, with additional music composed by Don Harper, Steven M. Stern and Gregson-Williams. The film represents the first collaboration between Zimmer and Bay, the composer would write and/or produce the scores for many of Bay\u2019s films moving forward.\nReception.\nBox office.\nFor its opening weekend, \"The Rock\" grossed $25 million, beating out \"\" to reach the number one spot. Upon opening, it surpassed \"Dick Tracy\" to achieve the highest opening weekend for a live-action Disney film. It would be overtaken by \"The Cable Guy\" during its second weekend, earning $18.5 million with a 26.2% decline. The film would hold well in its third weekend, collecting $14.3 million and ranking third behind \"Eraser\" and Disney's own \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". Produced on a $75\u00a0million budget, \"The Rock\" grossed a total of $134\u00a0million in the U.S. and Canada and $201\u00a0million elsewhere, for a worldwide total of $335\u00a0million. It was the seventh-highest-grossing film for the U.S. box office in 1996, and the fourth highest-grossing U.S. film worldwide that year.\nCritical response.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"For visceral thrills, it can't be beat. Just don't expect \"The Rock\" to engage your brain.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRoger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising it as \"a first-rate, slam-bang action thriller with a lot of style and no little humor\". Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, commenting \"The yarn has its share of gaping holes and jaw-dropping improbabilities, but director Michael Bay sweeps them all aside with his never-take-a-breath pacing.\" Richard Corliss, writing for \"Time\", wrote: \"Slick, brutal and almost human, this is the team-spirit action movie \"\" should have been.\"\nAccolades.\n\"The Rock\" won several minor awards, including 'Best On-Screen Duo' for Connery and Cage at the MTV Movie Awards. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound (Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell and Keith A. Wester).\nThe film was selected for a limited edition DVD release by the Criterion Collection, a distributor of primarily arthouse films it categorizes as \"important classic and contemporary films\" and \"cinema at its finest\". In an essay supporting the selection of \"The Rock\", Roger Ebert, who was strongly critical of most of Bay's later films, gave the film 3 1/2 out of four stars, calling it \"an action picture that rises to the top of the genre because of a literate, witty screenplay and skilled craftsmanship in the direction and special effects.\"\nIn 2014, \"Time Out\" polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. \"The Rock\" was listed at 74th place on the list. In 2019, Tom Reimann from Collider ranked \"The Rock\" as Bay's best film and \"a perfect snapshot of the height of 90s action movies\".\nIraqi chemical weapons program.\nIn September 2002, MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove said the agency had acquired information from a new source revealing that Iraq was stepping up production of chemical and biological warfare agents. The source, who was said to have \"direct access\", claimed senior staff were working seven days a week while the regime was concentrating a great deal of effort on the production of anthrax. Dearlove told the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), Sir John Scarlett, that they were \"on the edge of (a) significant intel breakthrough\" which could be the \"key to unlock\" Iraq's weapons programme.\nHowever, it was noticed that the agent's description of glass containers, not typically used for chemical munitions, resembled the nerve gas inaccurately depicted in glass beads or spheres in \"The Rock\". By February 2003 \u2013 a month before the invasion of Iraq \u2013 MI6 concluded that their source had been lying \"over a period of time\" but failed to inform No 10 or others, even though Prime Minister Tony Blair had been briefed on this intelligence. According to \"The Independent\", the false claims of weapons of mass destruction were the justification for UK's entering the war.\nScreenwriter David Weisberg said, \"What was so amazing was anybody in the poison gas community would immediately know that this was total bullshit \u2013 such obvious bullshit\". Weisberg said he was unsurprised a desperate agent might resort to films for inspiration, but dismayed that authorities \"didn't do apparently the most basic fact-checking or vetting of the information. If you'd just asked a chemical weapons expert, it would have been immediately obvious it was ludicrous.\" Weisberg said he had had some \"funny emails\" after the report, but he felt \"it's not a nice legacy for the film.\" \"It's tragic that we went to war,\" he concluded.\nUnproduced sequel.\nIn June 2017, director Michael Bay discussed his idea for a follow-up to \"The Rock\" that never developed past the concept that Goodspeed and Mason are chased by the government after escaping, due to possession of the microfilm as shown in the ending.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29789", "revid": "21857263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29789", "title": "Tourism", "text": "Travel for recreational or leisure purposes\nTourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel. UN Tourism defines tourism more generally, in terms which go \"beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only\", as people \"travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes\". Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international. International tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.\nBetween the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, tourism numbers declined due to a severe economic slowdown (see Great Recession) and the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. These numbers, however, recovered until the COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth. The United Nations World Tourism Organization has estimated that global international tourist arrivals might have decreased by 58% to 78% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$0.9\u20131.2 trillion in international tourism receipts.\nGlobally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in the balance of payments) grew to US$ trillion (\u20ac billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012. Emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.\nGlobal tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies. Many tourist development organizations are shifting focus to sustainable tourism to minimize the negative effects of growing tourism. This approach aims to balance economic benefits with environmental and social responsibility. The United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, through programs such as the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017.\nEtymology.\nThe English-language word \"tourist\" was used in 1772 and \"tourism\" in 1811. These words derive from the word \"tour\", which comes from Old English , from Old French , from Latin , \"to turn on a lathe\", which is itself from Ancient Greek (), \"lathe\".\nDefinitions.\nIn 1936, the League of Nations defined a \"foreign tourist\" as \"someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours\". Its successor, the United Nations, amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.\nIn 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as \"the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.\" In 1976, the Tourism Society of England's definition was: \"Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes.\" In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.\nIn 1994, the United Nations identified three forms of tourism in its \"Recommendations on Tourism Statistics\":\nOther groupings derived from the above grouping:\nTourism has reached new dimensions with the emerging industry of space tourism, as well as the transoceanic cruise ship industry.\nThe terms \"tourism\" and \"travel\" are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms \"tourism\" and \"tourist\" are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, \"traveller\" is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.\nThere are many varieties of tourism. Of those types, there are multiple forms of outdoor-oriented tourism. Outdoor tourism is generally categorized into nature, eco, and adventure tourism (NEAT). These categories share many similarities but also possess definite and unique characteristics. Nature tourism generally encompasses tourism activities that would take place outside. Nature tourism appeals to a large audience of tourists and many may not know they are participating in this form of tourism. This type of tourism has a low barrier to entry and is accessible to a large population. Ecotourism focuses on education, maintaining a social responsibility for the community and the environment, as well as centering economic growth around the local economy. Weaver describes ecotourism as sustainable nature-based tourism. Ecotourism is more specific than nature tourism and works toward accomplishing a specific goal through the outdoors. Finally, we have adventure tourism. Adventure tourism is the most extreme of the categories and includes participation in activities and sports that require a level of skill or experience, risk, and physical exertion. Adventure tourism often appeals less to the general public than nature and ecotourism and tends to draw in individuals who partake in such activities with limited marketing.\nIt is important to understand that these definitions may vary. Perceived risk in adventure tourism is subjective and may change for each individual.\nExamples of these tourism types include...\nNature tourism\nEcotourism\nAdventure tourism\nTourism products.\nAccording to the World Tourism Organization, a tourism product is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"a combination of tangible and intangible elements, such as natural, cultural, and man-made resources, attractions, facilities, services and activities around a specific center of interest which represents the core of the destination marketing mix and creates an overall visitor experience including emotional aspects for the potential customers. A tourism product is priced and sold through distribution channels and it has a life-cycle.\"\nA tourist map shows the functional zones of a city. Tourism products cover a wide variety of services including:\nInternational tourism.\nInternational tourism is tourism that crosses national borders. Globalization has made tourism a popular global leisure activity. The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people \"traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes\". The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 500,000 people are in flight at any one time.\nIn 2010, international tourism reached US$919B, growing 6.5% over 2009, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 4.7%. In 2010, there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide. By 2016 that number had risen to 1,235 million, producing $1.22 trillion USD in destination spending. The COVID-19 crisis had significant negative effects on international tourism significantly slowing the overall increasing trend.\nInternational tourism has significant impacts on the environment, exacerbated in part by the problems created by air travel but also by other issues, including wealthy tourists bringing lifestyles that stress local infrastructure, water and trash systems among others. In many countries, there have been protests against Air bnb tourism raising rents.\nBasis.\nTourism typically requires the tourist to feel engaged in a genuine experience of the location they are visiting. According to Dean MacCannell, tourism requires that the tourist can view the toured area as both authentic and different from their own lived experience.113 By viewing the \"exotic,\" tourists learn what they themselves are not: that is, they are \"un-exotic,\" or normal.\nAccording to MacCannell, all modern tourism experiences the \"authentic\" and \"exotic\" as \"developmentally inferior\" to the modern\u2014that is, to the lived experience of the tourist.114\nHistory.\nAncient.\nTravel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times travelled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, learn new languages, experience new cultures, enjoy pristine nature and to taste different cuisines. As early as Shulgi, however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travellers. Travelling for pleasure can be seen in Egypt as early on as 1500 BC. Ancient Roman tourists during the Republic would visit spas and coastal resorts such as Baiae. The Roman upper class used to spend their free time on land or at sea and travelled to their \"villa urbana\" or \"villa maritima\". Numerous villas were located in Campania, around Rome and in the northern part of the Adriatic as in Barcola near Trieste. Pausanias wrote his \"Description of Greece\" in the second century AD. In ancient China, nobles sometimes made a point of visiting Mount Tai and, on occasion, all five Sacred Mountains.\nMedieval.\nBy the post-classical era, many religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam had developed traditions of pilgrimage. \"The Canterbury Tales\" (c.\u20091390s), which uses a pilgrimage as a framing device, remains a classic of English literature, and \"Journey to the West\" (c.\u20091592), which holds a seminal place in Chinese literature, has a Buddhist pilgrimage at the center of its narrative.\nIn medieval Italy, Petrarch wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of Mont Ventoux that praised the act of travelling and criticized (a 'cold lack of curiosity'); this account is regarded as one of the first known instances of travel being undertaken for its own sake. The Burgundian poet Michault Taillevent later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the Jura Mountains.\nIn China, 'travel record literature' () became popular during the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279). Travel writers such as Fan Chengda (1126\u20131193) and Xu Xiake (1587\u20131641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' \"Record of Stone Bell Mountain\" by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi (1037\u20131101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.\nGrand Tour.\nModern tourism can be traced to what was known as the Grand Tour, which was a traditional trip around Europe (especially Germany and Italy), undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, the young Prince of Poland, Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa, the eldest son of Sigismund III, embarked on a journey across Europe, as was in custom among Polish nobility. He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, where he admired the siege of Breda by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic. It was an educational journey and one of the outcomes was introduction of Italian opera in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nThe custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transit in the 1840s and generally followed a standard itinerary. It was an educational opportunity and rite of passage. Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations on the Continent, and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and Thomas Cook made the \"Cook's Tour\" a byword.\nThe Grand Tour became a status symbol for upper-class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers, and travellers (such as Goethe) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France, and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centers, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.\n\"The New York Times\" recently described the Grand Tour in this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-Oxbridge trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of Western civilization. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they commissioned paintings, perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.\u2014\u200a\nThe primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.\nEmergence of leisure travel.\nLeisure travel was associated with the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom\u00a0\u2013 the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population. Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders. These comprised the new middle class. Cox &amp; Kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.\nThe British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In Nice, France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the French Riviera, the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the \"Promenade des Anglais\"; in many other historic resorts in continental Europe, old, well-established palace hotels have names like the \"Hotel Bristol\", \"Hotel Carlton\", or \"Hotel Majestic\"\u00a0\u2013 reflecting the dominance of English customers.\nA pioneer of the travel agency business, Thomas Cook's idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at Kibworth. With the opening of the extended Midland Counties Railway, he arranged to take a group of 540 temperance campaigners from Leicester Campbell Street station to a rally in Loughborough, away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price. This was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains. During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and Sunday school children. In 1844, the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.\nIn 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to Calais to coincide with the Paris Exhibition. The following year he started his \"grand circular tours\" of Europe. During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt, and the United States. Cook established \"inclusive independent travel\", whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food, and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.\nTourism, Empire and \"Othering\".\nAlthough tourism is more often associated with cultural appreciation and leisure, it is also directly connected with power dynamics, cultural representations, and conflicts. As a matter of fact, tourism developed alongside violent colonial domination in many regions of the world.\nColonial authorities often developed transportation infrastructure that facilitated the growth of tourism, while simultaneously promoting racialized and demeaning representations of native populations.\nThe violence of the colonial powers was justified by labelling European culture as superior and civilized, while labeling others as inferior, uncivilized and in-need of domestication.\nEuropean people often depicted non-European peoples and cultures as fundamentally different and inferior, establishing hierarchical representations of societies in various kinds of media such as academic books, travel journals, and travel guidebooks.\n By portraying colonized societies as inferior on the hierarchy of cultural value, they \"othered\" these populations. The concept of \"othering\" refers to the representation of individuals and cultures in a way that simultaneously romanticizes and devalues them, with the goal of establishing dominance. \"Othering\" also refers to representing peoples while ignoring their own self-representations.\nIn the 19th century, in order to foster the development of tourism in the colonies, touristic enterprises used tourist media to present them as attractive destinations for European travelers. Consequently, tourism media not only promoted the colonies as touristic destinations and helped shape popular conceptions about them, but also helped consolidate ideas of Western cultural superiority.\nOne notable example is Thomas Cook's travel enterprise established in the United Kingdom in 1841 and his travel newspaper called \u201cThe Excursionist\u201d. Thomas Cook enterprise promoted touristic excursions and package tours all over the world. In the case of the tour to Egypt, Thomas Cook &amp; Son\u2019s promotional materials aimed to portray it as an \u201cout-of-the-ordinary\u201d, wild, yet safe and domesticated destination, appealing to European tourists\u2019 desire for both familiarity and adventure. Thomas Cook &amp; Son collaboration with the British Empire during the occupation of Egypt facilitated European access to the Middle East through the construction of transportation networks such as steamships on the River Nile. At the same time, it reinforced Eurocentric and imperial politics.\nThese narratives, as reflected in travel guidebooks present in the Orientalist collection, often reveal more about the symbolic authority of European powers over colonized regions than they do about the actual cultures depicted. The process of othering and categorizing societies into simplistic binary oppositions\u2014such as civilized/primitive and superior/inferior \u2014 contributes to the perpetuation of imperialist ideologies because it silences the voices of local communities and obscures their cultural complexity.\nTourism after 1945.\nIn the period following World War II, an increasing number of individuals from diverse backgrounds were able to participate in tourism.\nRacial segregation and tourism in the United States.\nPrior to the Civil Rights Act, Black travellers encountered specific challenges when travelling within the United States. Jim Crow legislation enforced racial segregation in numerous public spaces, including public transport, accommodation, and tourist sites in general.\nThe Negro Motorist Green Book was a travel guide published from 1936 to 1967 by Victor and Alma Duke Green. It was aimed at Black travellers in the United States during the era of segregation and listed places where Black travellers were welcome. Several major companies collaborated with the Green Book. For instance, the Esso Standard Oil Company placed advertisements in the Green Book and sold it at their nationwide gas stations.\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites and Culture.\nCultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism. Cultural tourism is one of the mega-trends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales. As UNESCO is increasingly observing, the cultural heritage is needed for tourism, but also endangered by it. The \"ICOMOS - International Cultural Tourism Charter\" from 1999 is already dealing with all of these problems. As a result of the tourist hazard, for example, the Lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists. Overtourism is an important buzzword in this area. Furthermore, the focus of UNESCO in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic basis for the local population. And there is intensive cooperation between UNESCO, the United Nations, the United Nations peacekeeping and Blue Shield International. There are extensive international and national considerations, studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war. In particular, it is also about training civilian and military personnel. But the involvement of the locals is particularly important. The founding president of Blue Shield International Karl von Habsburg summed it up with the words: \"Without the local community and without the local participants, that would be completely impossible'.\nForms of tourism.\nMass tourism.\nMass tourism and its tourist attractions have emerged as among the most iconic demonstration of western consumer societies. Academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals. This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the United Kingdom and was pioneered by Thomas Cook. Cook took advantage of Europe's rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses, in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used Thomas Cook &amp; Son.\nThe relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads. One contemporary form of mass tourism, package tourism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.\nTravel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes.\nImprovements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.\nIn Continental Europe, early seaside resorts included: Heiligendamm, founded in 1793 at the Baltic Sea, being the first seaside resort; Ostend, popularized by the people of Brussels; Boulogne-sur-Mer and Deauville for the Parisians; Taormina in Sicily. In the United States, the first seaside resorts in the European style were at Atlantic City, New Jersey and Long Island, New York.\nBy the mid-20th century, the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the Spanish economic \"miracle\".\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, scientists discussed negative socio-cultural impacts of tourism on host communities. Since the 1980s the positive aspects of tourism began to be recognized as well.\nIn more recent times, mass tourism is something which has become a negative experience for local residents of cities and destinations that experience heavy tourism, especially in summer months. In July 2024 for example, protests by local residents in Barcelona, Spain were held in the city, where \u2033thousands of people joined an anti-tourism protest amid rising housing costs.\u2033\nNiche tourism.\nNiche tourism refers to the specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics. Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:\nOther terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term \"destination\" in the descriptions, such as destination weddings, and terms such as location vacation.\nSpace tourism.\nThere has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism, with only the Russian Space Agency providing transport to date. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion-dollar market by 2030. The space market has been around since 1979, however, there has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism, with only the Russian Space Agency providing transport on its Soyuz and the Chinese Shenzhou being the only two spacecrafts suitable for human travel . In April 2001, Dennis Tito, a customer of the Russian Soyuz became the first tourist to visit space. In May 2011, Virgin Galactic launched its SpaceShipTwo plane that allows people to travel 2 hours space at the advertised price of $200,000 per seat. A challenge that the commercial space tourism industry faces is to be able to have fundings from private investments needed to lower the cost of access to space in addition to being able to encourage both private and public sector support to increase capacity to allow commercial passengers. With space tourism still being new concept, there are many factors that needs to be considered for the industry. From its actual demand to its risk factor to its liabilities and insurance issues, there are still a lot of research that needs to be conducted. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that the industry is expected to grow by 18% - 26% per year during 2020 to 2030.\nSports tourism.\nSports tourism that attracts spectators is associated with negative impacts such as traffic congestion, vandalism, and anti-social behaviour. Sports tourist destinations may therefore be subject public displays of resentment and antagonism even though the host community benefits substantially. Sports tourism growth and decline can be subject to international commercial sporting events. For example, the irreversible environmental damage caused by the 1992 Winter Olympics is cited as a reason for stagnating ski tourism.\nWater Tourism.\nCruising is a popular form of water tourism. Leisure cruise ships were introduced by the P&amp;O in 1844, sailing from Southampton to destinations such as Gibraltar, Malta and Athens. In 1891, German businessman Albert Ballin sailed the ship \"Augusta Victoria\" from Hamburg into the Mediterranean Sea. 29 June 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was \"Prinzessin Victoria Luise\", built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.\nWinter tourism.\nSt. Moritz, Switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend. It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.\nMajor ski resorts are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. Andorra, Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey), Canada, the United States (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) Argentina, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Chile, and Lebanon.\nRecent developments.\nThere has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades, especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialized holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted destination hotels.\nThe developments in air transport infrastructure, such as jumbo jets, low-cost airlines, and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable. A major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels. The WHO estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time. There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example, some retirement-age people sustain year-round tourism. This is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging, in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.\nThere have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the September 11 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations, such as in Bali and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a tsunami, caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, hit the Asian countries on the Indian Ocean, including the Maldives. Thousands of people died including many tourists. This, together with the vast clean-up operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.\nIndividual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like CouchSurfing and airbnb being established. There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in Dubai.\nEcotourism.\nEcotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveller; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities, and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights. \"Take only memories and leave only footprints\" is a very common slogan in protected areas. Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.\nVolunteer tourism.\nVolunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves to counter global inequalities. Volunteer tourism is defined as applying \"to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society\" (Wearing 2001). VSO founded in 1958 in the UK and the US Peace Corps founded in 1958 were the first large-scale voluntary organisations sending groups, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.\nThis form of tourism is largely praised for being a more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures and avoiding the criticism of consumptive, exploitative mass tourism. However, increasingly, voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest that volunteer tourism may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives. While host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with their experiences, volunteer shortages persist. Increasingly, organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.\nPro-poor tourism.\nPro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the Overseas Development Institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in Tanzania and cultural tourism in Luang Prabang, Laos. There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.\nRecession tourism.\nRecession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place at once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travellers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation. In general, studies have primarily focused on the short-term effects of the crisis on tourism demand, often overlooking the long-term implications for the competitive positioning of the impacted destinations.\nMedical tourism.\nWhen there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Eastern Europe, Cuba and Canada where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. dentistry), travelling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as \"medical tourism\".\nEducational tourism.\nEducational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment. Brent W. Ritchie, publisher of Managing Educational Tourism, created a study of a geographic subdivision to demonstrate how tourism educated high school students participating in foreign exchange programs over the last 15 years. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program. In 2018, one impact was many exchange students traveled to America to assist students financially in order to maintain their secondary education.\nEvent tourism.\nThis type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the city/region. This type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival South by Southwest that is hosted in Austin, Texas annually. Every year people from all over the world flock to the city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see bands perform. People are drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown, which defines event tourism.\nCreative tourism.\nCreative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism, since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the Grand Tour, which saw the sons of aristocratic families travelling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards, who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the European Commission, including cultural and crafts tourism, known as sustainable tourism. They have defined \"creative tourism\" as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.\nMeanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as UNESCO, who through the Creative Cities Network, have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place. UNESCO wrote in one of its documents: \"'Creative Tourism' involves more interaction, in which the visitor has an educational, emotional, social, and participative interaction with the place, its living culture, and the people who live there. They feel like a citizen.\" Saying so, the tourist will have the opportunity to take part in workshops, classes and activities related to the culture of the destination.\nMore recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travellers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy, New Zealand and South Korea.\nThe growing interest of tourists in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers, attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism, highlighting the intangible heritage (craft workshops, cooking classes, etc.) and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure (for example, through the rent of halls and auditoriums).\nExperiential tourism.\nExperiential travel (or \"immersion travel\") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its history, people, food and culture.\nThe term \"experiential travel\" has been mentioned in publications since 1985, but it was not discovered as a meaningful market trend until much later.\nDark tourism.\nOne emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000) as \"dark\" tourism. This type of tourism involves visits to \"dark\" sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide, for example concentration camps. Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.\nSocial tourism.\nSocial tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation. It includes youth hostels and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations, trade unions, or in Communist times publicly owned enterprises. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, Walter Hunziker proposed the following definition: \"Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low-income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services\".\nDoom tourism.\nAlso known as \"tourism of doom,\" or \"last chance tourism\", involves travelling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of Mount Kilimanjaro, the melting glaciers of Patagonia, or the coral of the Great Barrier Reef) before it is too late. The trend emerged in the 21st century, identified in 2007 by travel trade magazine in 2007 and explored in \"The New York Times\", This type of tourism has been on the rise. Some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual's carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing. As of 2024, climate change has been making Last Chance Tourism more popular, and riskier. In August 2024, an American was killed visiting an ice cave at the foot of the Breidamerkurjokull glacier.\nReligious tourism.\nReligious tourism, in particular pilgrimage, can serve to strengthen faith and to demonstrate devotion. Religious tourists may seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self-identity in a positive manner. Given this, the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self-identity or not.\nDNA tourism.\nDNA tourism, also called \"ancestry tourism\" or \"heritage travel\", is tourism based on DNA testing. These tourists visit their remote relatives or places where their ancestors came from, or where their relatives reside, based on the results of DNA tests. DNA tourism became a growing trend in 2019.\nSleep tourism.\nSleep tourism focuses on medical treatments or other approaches, and may focus on people who have difficulty falling asleep, people who experience interrupted sleep, people who don't feel rested after sleeping, snoring, breathing difficulties, and dreaming.\nEffects of Tourism.\nEconomic significance of tourism.\nThe tourism industry, as part of the service sector, has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries. The \"Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980\" recognized its importance as \"an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their international relations.\"\nTourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists, accounting as of 2011[ [update]] for 30% of the world's trade in services, and, as an invisible export, for 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism. It is also claimed that travel broadens the mind.\nThe hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services (such as airlines, cruise ships, transits, trains and taxicabs); lodging (including hotels, hostels, homestays, resorts and renting out rooms); and entertainment venues (such as amusement parks, restaurants, casinos, festivals, shopping malls, music venues, and theatres). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including souvenirs.\nOn the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest. Tourism frequently also puts additional pressure on the local environment.\nThe economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets, the cultural property and the nature of the travel location. The World Heritage Sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets. But even a country's current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism. For example, the fascination of the British royal family brings millions of tourists to Great Britain every year and thus the economy around \u00a3550 million a year. The Habsburg family can be mentioned in Central Europe. According to estimates, the Habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of 60 million euros per year for Vienna alone. The tourist principle \"Habsburg sells\" applies.\nTourism industry growth.\nIn 2004 the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4 percent. With the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become prominent traded items on the internet. Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.\nAs a result of the late-2000s recession, international arrivals experienced a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008. Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7 percent during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8 percent. By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6 percent over six quarters. While this was considerably milder than what occurred after the September 11 attacks, the decline was at twice the rate, as real GDP has fallen. However, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term. The UNWTO has noted, that tourists increasingly view vacations and travel as a necessity rather than a luxury, and that this shift in attitudes may explain tourist numbers recovering globally in 2009.\nIt has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context. Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.\nLiabilities and insurance.\nAfter the September 11 attacks the tourism industry operators had to consider the health and safety of tourists because it became increasingly difficult to obtain liability insurance. The organisations willing to provide insurance to tourism industry operators required, that operators put in place best practice risk management structures. This included, that whatever was promised in the contract about the holiday was really delivered by the operator.\nSecurity in Tourism.\nSecurity in Tourism is a sub-discipline of tourist studies that explores the factors that affect the ontological security of tourists. Risks are evaluated by their impact and nature. Tourism security includes methodologies, theories and techniques oriented to protect the organic image of tourist destinations. Three academic waves are significant in tourism security: risk perception theory, disaster management, and post-disaster consumption.\nAndrew Spencer &amp; Peter Tarlow argue that tourism security is not an easy concept to define. It includes a set of sub-disciplines, and global risks different in nature which cause different effects in the tourism industry. The rise of tourism security and safety as a consolidated discipline coincides with the globalization and ultimate maturation of the industry worldwide. Some threats include, for example, terrorist groups looking to destabilize governments affecting not only the local economies but killing foreign tourists to cause geopolitical tensions between delivery-country and receiving-tourist countries. Today, island destinations are more affected by terrorism and other global risks than other continent destinations \nImpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic travel bans and a substantial reduction in passenger travel by air and sea contributed to a sharp decline in tourism activity. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) reported a 70% decrease in international travel in 2020, where 165 of 217 worldwide destinations completely stopped international tourism by April 2020. Since every country imposes different travel restrictions, it makes traveling plans complicated and often too difficult to figure out, thus the willingness to travel for the general population decreases. It is estimated that the United States lost 147 billion U.S. dollars in revenue from tourism between January and October 2020. Spain had the next highest loss of revenue at around 46.7 billion U.S dollars, and countries in Africa collectively lost about 55 billion dollars during April and June 2020.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "29798", "revid": "873891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29798", "title": "The Lord of the Rings", "text": "1954\u20131955 fantasy novel by J. R. R. Tolkien\nThe Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by the English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book \"The Hobbit\" but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, \"The Lord of the Rings\" is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.\nThe title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One Ring, allowing him to rule the other Rings of Power given to men, dwarves, and elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Aiding the hobbits are the wizard Gandalf, the men Aragorn and Boromir, the elf Legolas, and the dwarf Gimli, who unite as the Company of the Ring to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.\nTolkien drew inspiration from various influences for the story, including philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War. Although often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be a single volume in a two-volume set, along with \"The Silmarillion\". For economic reasons, it was first published over the course of a year, from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955, in three volumes rather than one, under the titles \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", \"The Two Towers\", and \"The Return of the King\"; \"The Silmarillion\" appeared only after Tolkien's death. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of chronologies, genealogies, and linguistic information. These three volumes were later published as a boxed set in 1957, and even finally as a single volume in 1968, following Tolkien's original intent. \nAfter an initial mixed reception by the literary establishment, \"The Lord of the Rings\" has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes, literary devices, and origins. It is considered one of the most influential fantasy books ever written, and has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games, and board games. Award-winning adaptations of \"The Lord of the Rings\" have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in a 2003 poll by the BBC called The Big Read.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\n\"The Fellowship of the Ring\".\nBilbo Baggins celebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring to Frodo, his heir. Gandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of Power; seventeen years later, he confirms it is the One Ring, lost by the Dark Lord Sauron, and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return, but fails to do so. Frodo sets out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee. They are pursued by Black Riders, but meet some Elves, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders. The Hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey. They try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are trapped by the malign Old Man Willow, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Leaving Tom's house, they are caught by a barrow-wight. Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard. \nThe Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they meet Strider, a Ranger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell. At Weathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb \"athelas\". They are joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, towards Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford of Bruinen, where they are swept away by flood waters summoned by Elrond.\nFrodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. Gandalf informs Frodo that the Black Riders are the Nazg\u00fbl, Men enslaved by Rings of Power to serve Sauron. The Council of Elrond discusses what to do with the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur who had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand in the Second Age, but claimed it for himself. The Ring was lost when Isildur was killed; it passed to Gollum and then to Bilbo. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman, is a traitor.\nThe Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed in the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond chooses companions for him: Sam, Merry, and Pippin; Gandalf; the Men Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor; the Elf Legolas; and the Dwarf Gimli, representing the Free Peoples of the West.\nAfter a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship risk the path through the Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin and his Dwarves, who had attempted to regain possession of Moria, were killed by Orcs. They are attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, a fire demon. Gandalf confronts the Balrog: both fall into an abyss. The others escape to the Elvish forest of Lothl\u00f3rien, where the Lady Galadriel tests their loyalty, and gives them magical gifts. She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her vision-giving fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel. Frodo offers her the Ring: she refuses, knowing that it would master her.\nGaladriel's husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, cloaks, and waybread. They travel down the River Anduin. At Amon Hen, Boromir tries to take the Ring, but Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears. Frodo chooses to cross the river and go alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts and joins him.\n\"The Two Towers\".\nA party of Orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two Hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs. The Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by \u00c9omer. The Hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by the Ent Treebeard. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf: he explains that he killed the Balrog; he too was killed in the fight, but was sent back to Middle-earth. He is now Gandalf the White, replacing Saruman as chief of the wizards. They ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees King Th\u00e9oden from the influence of Saruman's spy Gr\u00edma Wormtongue. Th\u00e9oden musters his army and rides to the fortress of Helm's Deep; Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard. The Ents destroy Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Th\u00e9oden's aid. He brings an army of Riders of Rohan to Helm's Deep. They defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns and are destroyed. Gandalf, Th\u00e9oden, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, where they find Merry and Pippin relaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. Wormtongue throws down a hard round object to try to kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals it in the night. It is a \"palant\u00edr\", a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, becoming ensnared. Sauron sees Pippin, but misunderstands the circumstances. Gandalf rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.\nFrodo and Sam struggle through the barren hills of the Emyn Muil. They realize they are being tracked; on a moonlit night they capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. Frodo makes Gollum swear to serve him, as Ringbearer, and asks him to guide them to Mordor. Gollum leads them across the Dead Marshes. Sam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, Sm\u00e9agol, whether to steal the Ring.\nThe Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded, so they travel south through Ithilien to a secret pass that Gollum knows. They are captured by rangers led by Faramir, Boromir's brother, and brought to the secret fastness of Henneth Ann\u00fbn. Faramir resists the temptation to seize the Ring and, disobeying orders to arrest strangers, releases them. Gollum guides the hobbits to the pass, but leads them into the lair of the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol. Frodo holds up his gift, the Phial of Galadriel, which holds the light of E\u00e4rendil's star: it drives Shelob back. Frodo cuts through a giant web using his sword Sting. Shelob attacks again, and Frodo falls to her venom. Sam picks up Sting and the Phial. He wounds the monster. Believing Frodo to be dead, a devastated Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Orcs take Frodo; Sam overhears them saying that Frodo is still alive, and sets out to rescue him.\n\"The Return of the King\".\nSauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Th\u00e9oden musters the Riders of Rohan to go to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged; the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl uses a spell-wound battering ram to destroy the city's gates. Denethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre; Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, oathbreakers who will have no rest until they fight for the King of Gondor. Aragorn unleashes the Army of the Dead on the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. He and men of southern Gondor sail in the Corsairs' ships up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. Th\u00e9oden's niece \u00c9owyn, who joined the army in disguise, kills the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl with help from Merry; both are wounded. Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but Th\u00e9oden is killed. Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals the sick. He leads an army through Ithilien to the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. At the Battle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.\nSam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. When they reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer: he claims it for himself and puts it on. Gollum reappears. He bites off Frodo's Ring finger. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power. All he created collapses, the Nazg\u00fbl perish, Aragorn wins the battle of the Morannon, and the Eagles rescue Frodo and Sam from the ruin of Mount Doom. Aragorn is crowned King, and weds Arwen, Elrond's daughter. Th\u00e9oden is buried; \u00c9omer is crowned King of Rohan. His sister \u00c9owyn is engaged to Faramir, now Steward of Gondor and Prince of Ithilien. Galadriel, Celeborn, and Gandalf say farewell to Treebeard, and to Aragorn. The four hobbits travel home, only to find it has been taken over by Saruman's men. Merry raises a rebellion and scours the Shire. Saruman reveals crimes that Wormtongue has done, causing Wormtongue to turn on Saruman and kill him in front of Bag End, Frodo's home. Wormtongue then is killed by hobbit archers. Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts to heal the Shire. Frodo, broken by the quest, leaves a few years later, sailing from the Grey Havens over the Sea to find peace.\nExtensive appendices outline more details of the history, cultures, genealogies, and languages that Tolkien imagined for the peoples of Middle-earth. In antiquarian style, they provide background details for the narrative, with much detail for Tolkien fans who want to know more about the stories.\nFrame story.\nTolkien presents \"The Lord of the Rings\" within a fictional frame story where he is not the original author, but merely the translator of part of an ancient document, the \"Red Book of Westmarch\". That book is modelled on the real \"Red Book of Hergest\", which similarly presents an older mythology. Various details of the frame story appear in the Prologue, its \"Note on Shire Records\", and in the Appendices, notably Appendix F. In this frame story, the \"Red Book\" is the purported source of Tolkien's other works relating to Middle-earth: \"The Hobbit\", \"The Silmarillion\", and \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\".\nConcept and creation.\nBackground.\nAlthough a major work in itself, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was only the last movement of a much older set of narratives Tolkien had worked on since 1917 encompassing \"The Silmarillion\", in a process he described as \"mythopoeia\".\n\"The Lord of the Rings\" started as a sequel to Tolkien's work \"The Hobbit\", published in 1937. The popularity of \"The Hobbit\" led George Allen &amp; Unwin, the publishers, to request a sequel. Tolkien warned them that he wrote quite slowly, and responded with several stories he had already developed. Having rejected his contemporary drafts for \"The Silmarillion\", putting \"Roverandom\" on hold, and accepting \"Farmer Giles of Ham\", Allen &amp; Unwin continued to ask for more stories about hobbits.\nWriting.\nPersuaded by his publishers, he started \"a new Hobbit\" in December 1937. After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged. The idea for the first chapter (\"A Long-Expected Party\") arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title \"The Lord of the Rings\" did not come until the spring of 1938. Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work. As the story progressed, he brought in elements from \"The Silmarillion\" mythology.\nWriting was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, marked exams to bring in a little extra income, and wrote many drafts. Tolkien abandoned \"The Lord of the Rings\" during most of 1943 and only restarted it in April 1944, as a serial for his son Christopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with the Royal Air Force. Tolkien made another major effort in 1946 and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947. The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949. The original manuscripts, which total 9,250 pages, now reside in the J. R. R. Tolkien Collection at Marquette University.\nPoetry.\nUnusually for 20th century novels, the prose narrative is supplemented throughout by over 60 pieces of poetry. These include verse and songs of many genres: for wandering, marching to war, drinking, and having a bath; narrating ancient myths, riddles, prophecies, and magical incantations; and of praise and lament (elegy). Some, such as riddles, charms, elegies, and narrating heroic actions are found in Old English poetry. Scholars have stated that the poetry is essential for the fiction to work aesthetically and thematically, as it adds information not given in the prose, and it brings out characters and their backgrounds. The poetry has been judged to be of high technical skill, reflected in Tolkien's prose; for instance, he wrote much of Tom Bombadil's speech in metre.\nIllustrations.\nTolkien worked on the text using his maps of Middle-earth as a guide, to ensure the elements of the story fitted together in time and space. He prepared a variety of types of illustration \u2013 maps, calligraphy, drawings, cover designs, even a facsimile painting of the Book of Mazarbul \u2013 but only the maps, the inscription on the Ring, and a drawing of the Doors of Durin were included in the first edition.\nThe hardback editions sometimes had cover illustrations by Tolkien, sometimes by other artists. According to \"The New York Times\", Barbara Remington's cover designs for Ballantine's paperback editions \"achieved mass-cult status in the 1960s, particularly on college campuses\" across America.\nInfluences.\nTolkien drew on a wide array of influences including language, Christianity, mythology and Germanic heroic legend including the Norse \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\", archaeology, especially at the Temple of Nodens, ancient and modern literature, like Finnish 19th-century epic poetry \"The Kalevala\" by Elias L\u00f6nnrot, and personal experience. He was inspired primarily by his profession, philology; his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially \"Beowulf\", and he acknowledged its importance to his writings.\nHe was a gifted linguist, influenced by Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology.\nCommentators have attempted to identify literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings; he acknowledged that he had enjoyed adventure stories by authors such as John Buchan and Rider Haggard. The Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris was a major influence, and Tolkien undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home.\nTolkien stated, too, that he had been influenced by his childhood experiences of the English countryside of Worcestershire near Sarehole Mill, and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham, and his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War. Moreover, the militarization and industrialization inspired the character of Sauron and his forces. The Orcs represented the worst of it as workers that have been tortured and brutalized by the war and industry.\nThemes.\nScholars and critics have identified many themes in the book with its complex interlaced narrative, including a reversed quest, the struggle of good and evil, death and immortality, fate and free will, the addictive danger of power, and various aspects of Christianity such as the presence of three Christ figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements like hope and redemptive suffering.\nThere is a common theme throughout the work of language, its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places, along with hints of providence in descriptions of weather and landscape. Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality. To those who supposed that the book was an allegory of events in the 20th century, Tolkien replied in the foreword to the Second Edition that it was not, saying he preferred \"history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.\"\nSome commentators have criticized the book for being a story about men for boys, with no significant women; or about a purely rural world with no bearing on modern life in cities; of containing no sign of religion; or of racism. Other commentators responded by noting that there are three powerful women in the book, Galadriel, \u00c9owyn, and Arwen; that life, even in rural Hobbiton, is not idealized; that Christianity is a pervasive theme; and that Tolkien was sharply anti-racist both in peacetime and during the Second World War, while Middle-earth is evidently polycultural. Others have discussed the apparent or implicit sexuality in the book.\nPublication history.\nA dispute with his publisher, Allen &amp; Unwin, led Tolkien to offer the work to William Collins in 1950. Tolkien intended \"The Silmarillion\" (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with \"The Lord of the Rings,\" but Allen &amp; Unwin was unwilling to do this. After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that \"The Lord of the Rings\" itself \"urgently wanted cutting\", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952. Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen &amp; Unwin, telling that he would have gladly considered the publication of any part of the stuff, fearing his work would never see the light of day.\nFor publication, the work was divided into three volumes to minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type-setting and modest anticipated sales: \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (Books I and II), \"The Two Towers\" (Books III and IV), and \"The Return of the King\" (Books V and VI, and six appendices). Delays in producing appendices, maps and especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped \u2013 on 29 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Houghton Mifflin published \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" on 21 October 1954, \"The Two Towers\" on 21 April 1955, and \"The Return of the King\" on 5 January 1956.\n\"The Return of the King\" was especially delayed as Tolkien revised the ending and prepared appendices (some of which had to be left out because of space constraints). Tolkien did not like the title \"The Return of the King\", believing it gave away too much of the storyline, but deferred to his publisher's preference. Tolkien wrote that the title \"The Two Towers\" \"can be left ambiguous\", but considered naming the two as Orthanc and Barad-d\u00fbr, Minas Tirith and Barad-d\u00fbr, or Orthanc and the Tower of Cirith Ungol. However, a month later he wrote a note published at the end of \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and later drew a cover illustration, both of which identified the pair as Minas Morgul and Orthanc.\nTolkien was initially opposed to titles being given to each two-book volume, preferring instead the use of book titles: e.g. \"The Lord of the Rings\": Vol. 1, \"The Ring Sets Out\" and \"The Ring Goes South\"; Vol. 2, \"The Treason of Isengard\" and \"The Ring Goes East\"; Vol. 3, \"The War of the Ring\" and \"The End of the Third Age\". However, these individual book titles were dropped, and after pressure from his publishers, Tolkien suggested the volume titles: Vol. 1, \"The Shadow Grows\"; Vol. 2, \"The Ring in the Shadow\"; Vol. 3, \"The War of the Ring\" or \"The Return of the King\".\nBecause the three-volume binding was so widely distributed, the work is often referred to as the \"Lord of the Rings\" \"trilogy\". In a letter to the poet W. H. Auden, who famously reviewed the final volume in 1956, Tolkien himself made use of the term \"trilogy\" for the work though he did at other times consider this incorrect, as it was written and conceived as a single book. It is often called a novel; however, Tolkien objected to this term as he viewed it as a heroic romance.\nThe books were published under a profit-sharing arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits. It has ultimately become one of the best-selling novels ever written, with at least 50 million copies sold by 2003 and over 150 million copies sold by 2007. The work was published in the UK by Allen &amp; Unwin until 1990, when the publisher and its assets were acquired by HarperCollins.\nEditions and revisions.\nIn the early 1960s Donald A. Wollheim, science fiction editor of the paperback publisher Ace Books, claimed that \"The Lord of the Rings\" was not protected in the United States under American copyright law because Houghton Mifflin, the US hardcover publisher, had neglected to copyright the work in the United States. Then, in 1965, Ace Books proceeded to publish an edition, unauthorized by Tolkien and without paying royalties to him. Tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection. Grass-roots pressure from these fans became so great that Ace Books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to Tolkien.\nAuthorized editions followed from Ballantine Books and Houghton Mifflin to tremendous commercial success. Tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an unquestioned US copyright. This text became the Second Edition of \"The Lord of the Rings\", published in 1965. The first Ballantine paperback edition was printed in October that year, selling a quarter of a million copies within ten months. On 4 September 1966, the novel debuted on \"The New York Times\"'s Paperback Bestsellers list as number three, and was number one by 4 December, a position it held for eight weeks. Houghton Mifflin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by Tolkien, and corrections supervised by Christopher Tolkien, which resulted, after some initial glitches, in a computer-based unified text.\nIn 2004, for the 50th Anniversary Edition, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, under supervision from Christopher Tolkien, studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inconsistencies as possible, some of which had been introduced by well-meaning compositors of the first printing in 1954, and never been corrected. The 2005 edition of the book contained further corrections noticed by the editors and submitted by readers. Yet more corrections were made in the 60th Anniversary Edition in 2014. Several editions, including the 50th Anniversary Edition, print the whole work in one volume, with the result that pagination varies widely over the various editions.\nPosthumous publication of drafts.\nFrom 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts of \"The Lord of the Rings\", chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text's development, in volumes 6\u20139 of his \"History of Middle-earth\" series. The four volumes carry the titles \"The Return of the Shadow\", \"The Treason of Isengard\", \"The War of the Ring\", and \"Sauron Defeated\".\nTranslations.\nThe work has been translated, with varying degrees of success, into at least 38, and reportedly at least 70, languages. Tolkien, an expert in philology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the Swedish translation by \u00c5ke Ohlmarks, Tolkien wrote a \"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\" (1967). Because \"The Lord of the Rings\" purports to be a translation of the fictitious \"Red Book of Westmarch\", using the English language to represent the Westron of the \"original\", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance.\nReception.\n1950s.\nEarly reviews of the work were mixed. The initial review in the \"Sunday Telegraph\" described it as \"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\". The \"Sunday Times\" echoed this sentiment, stating that \"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" and those who are going to read them.\" The \"New York Herald Tribune\" appeared to predict the books' popularity, writing in its review that they were \"destined to outlast our time\". W. H. Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien's and an admirer of his writings, regarded \"The Lord of the Rings\" as a \"masterpiece\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". Kenneth F. Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction, April 1955, \"... if you don't read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear\". On the other hand, in 1955, the Scottish poet Edwin Muir attacked \"The Return of the King\", writing that \"All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes ... and will never come to puberty ... Hardly one of them knows anything about women\", causing Tolkien to complain angrily to his publisher. In 1956, the literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote a review entitled \"Oo, Those Awful Orcs!\", calling Tolkien's work \"juvenile trash\", and saying \"Dr. Tolkien has little skill at narrative and no instinct for literary form.\"\nWithin Tolkien's literary group, The Inklings, the work had a mixed reception. Hugo Dyson complained loudly at its readings, whereas C. S. Lewis had very different feelings, writing, \"here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.\" Lewis observed that the writing is rich, in that some of the 'good' characters have darker sides, and likewise some of the villains have \"good impulses\". Despite the mixed reviews and the lack of a paperback until the 1960s, \"The Lord of the Rings\" initially sold well in hardback.\nLater.\nJudith Shulevitz, writing in \"The New York Times\", criticized the \"pedantry\" of Tolkien's literary style, saying that he \"formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself\". The critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in \"The New Republic\", criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth. Both the characters and the work itself were, according to Jenkyns, \"anemic, and lacking in fibre\". The science fiction author David Brin interprets the work as holding unquestioning devotion to a traditional hierarchical social structure. In his essay \"Epic Pooh\", fantasy author Michael Moorcock critiques the world-view displayed by the book as deeply conservative, in both the \"paternalism\" of the narrative voice and the power structures in the narrative. Tom Shippey, like Tolkien an English philologist, notes the wide gulf between Tolkien's supporters, both popular and academic, and his literary detractors, and attempts to explain in detail both why the literary establishment disliked \"The Lord of the Rings\", and the work's subtlety, themes, and merits, including the impression of depth that it conveys. The scholar of humanities Brian Rosebury analysed Tolkien's prose style in detail, showing that it was generally quite plain, varying to suit the voices of the different characters, and rising to a heroic register for special moments. The critic Patrick Curry cited the work's first publisher, Rayner Unwin's \"pithy and accurate\" assessment of the novel: \"a very great book in its own curious way\".\nAwards.\nIn 1957, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was awarded the International Fantasy Award. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped \"The Lord of the Rings\" become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by all of three different measures: sales, library borrowings, and reader surveys. In the 2003 \"Big Read\" survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was found to be the \"Nation's best-loved book\". In similar 2004 polls both Germany and Australia chose \"The Lord of the Rings\" as their favourite book. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was judged to be their favourite \"book of the millennium\". In 2019, the BBC News listed \"The Lord of the Rings\" on its list of the \"100 most inspiring novels\".\nAdaptations.\n\"The Lord of the Rings\" has been adapted into various media, including radio, stage, motion pictures, and videogames.\nRadio.\nThe book has been adapted for radio four times. In 1955 and 1956, the BBC broadcast \"The Lord of the Rings\", a 13-part radio adaptation of the story. In the 1960s radio station WBAI produced a short radio adaptation. A 1979 dramatization of \"The Lord of the Rings\" was broadcast in the United States and subsequently issued on tape and CD. In 1981, the BBC broadcast \"The Lord of the Rings\", a new dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments.\nMotion pictures.\nA variety of filmmakers considered adapting Tolkien's book, among them Stanley Kubrick, who thought it unfilmable, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jim Henson, Heinz Edelmann, and John Boorman. A Swedish live action television film, \"Sagan om ringen\", was broadcast in 1971. In 1978, Ralph Bakshi made an animated film version covering \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and part of \"The Two Towers\", to mixed reviews. In 1980, Rankin/Bass released an animated TV special based on the closing chapters of \"The Return of the King\", gaining mixed reviews. \nThe 1991 Soviet Union live-action adaptation of \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", \"Khraniteli\", was aired once and thought lost, but was rediscovered and republished on the Web. It includes Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-wight, omitted from Jackson's version.\nIn Finland, a live action television miniseries, \"Hobitit\", was broadcast in 1993 based on \"The Lord of the Rings\", with a flashback to Bilbo's encounter with Gollum in \"The Hobbit\".\nA far more successful adaptation was Peter Jackson's live action \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, produced by New Line Cinema and released in three instalments as ' (2001), ' (2002), and \"\" (2003). All three parts won multiple Academy Awards, including consecutive Best Picture nominations. The final instalment of this trilogy was the second film to break the one-billion-dollar barrier and won a total of 11 Oscars (something only two other films in history, \"Ben-Hur\" and \"Titanic\", have accomplished), including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Commentators including Tolkien scholars, literary critics and film critics are divided on , and if so the reasons for any changes, and the effectiveness of the result.\n\"The Hunt for Gollum\", a 2009 film by Chris Bouchard, and the 2009 \"Born of Hope\", written by Paula DiSante and directed by Kate Madison, are fan films based on details in the appendices of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nFrom September 2022, Amazon has been presenting a multi-season television series of stories, \"\". It is set at the beginning of the Second Age, long before the time of \"The Lord of the Rings\", based on materials in the novel's appendices.\nIn 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery began making a series of films set in Middle-earth, produced along with New Line Cinema and Freemode. The first was \"\", an anime written by Jeffrey Addiss, Will Matthews and Philippa Boyens, directed by Kenji Kamiyama and released in December 2024. It was based on the story of the legendary Rohan king Helm Hammerhand.\nAudiobooks.\nIn 1990, Recorded Books published an audio version of \"The Lord of the Rings\", read by the British actor Rob Inglis. A large-scale musical theatre adaptation, \"The Lord of the Rings\", was first staged in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2006 and opened in London in June 2007; it was a commercial failure.\nIn 2013, the artist Phil Dragash recorded the whole of the book, using the score from Peter Jackson's movies.\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Andy Serkis read the entire book of \"The Hobbit\" online to raise money for charity. He then recorded the work again as an audiobook. The cover art was done by Alan Lee. In 2021, Serkis recorded \"The Lord of the Rings\" novels.\nLegacy.\nInfluence on fantasy.\nThe enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy. Largely thanks to \"The Lord of the Rings\", the genre flowered throughout the 1960s and enjoys popularity to the present day. The opus has spawned many imitations, such as \"The Sword of Shannara\", which Lin Carter called \"the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read,\" as well as alternate interpretations of the story, such as \"The Last Ringbearer\".\n\"The Legend of Zelda\", which popularized the action-adventure game genre in the 1980s, was inspired by \"The Lord of the Rings\" among other fantasy books. \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", which popularized the role-playing game genre in the 1970s, features several races from \"The Lord of the Rings,\" including halflings (hobbits), elves, dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons. However, Gary Gygax, the lead designer of the game, stated that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game.\nBecause Dungeons &amp; Dragons has gone on to influence many popular games, especially role-playing video games, the influence of \"The Lord of the Rings\" extends to many of them, with titles such as \"Dragon Quest\", \"EverQuest\", the \"Warcraft\" series, and \"The Elder Scrolls\" series of games as well as video games set in Middle-earth itself.\nMusic.\nIn 1965, the composer and songwriter Donald Swann, best known for his collaboration with Michael Flanders as Flanders &amp; Swann, set six poems from \"The Lord of the Rings\" and one from \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\" (\"Errantry\") to music. When Swann met with Tolkien to play the songs for his approval, Tolkien suggested for \"Nam\u00e1ri\u00eb\" (Galadriel's lament) a setting reminiscent of plain chant, which Swann accepted. The songs were published in 1967 as \"The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle\", and a recording of the songs performed by singer William Elvin with Swann on piano was issued that same year by Caedmon Records as \"Poems and Songs of Middle Earth\".\nRock bands of the 1970s were musically and lyrically inspired by the fantasy-embracing counter-culture of the time. The British rock band Led Zeppelin recorded several songs that contain explicit references to \"The Lord of the Rings\", such as mentioning Gollum and Mordor in \"Ramble On\", the Misty Mountains in \"Misty Mountain Hop\", and Ringwraiths in \"The Battle of Evermore\". In 1970, the Swedish musician Bo Hansson released an instrumental concept album entitled \"Sagan om ringen\" (\"The Saga of the Ring\", the title of the Swedish translation at the time). The album was subsequently released internationally as \"Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings\" in 1972. From the 1980s onwards, many heavy metal acts have been influenced by Tolkien.\nIn 1988, the Dutch composer and trombonist Johan de Meij completed his \"Symphony No. 1 \"The Lord of the Rings\"\". It had 5 movements, titled \"Gandalf\", \"Lothl\u00f3rien\", \"Gollum\", \"Journey in the Dark\", and \"Hobbits\". The 1991 album \"Shepherd Moons\" by the Irish musician Enya contains an instrumental titled \"Lothl\u00f3rien\", in reference to the home of the wood-elves.\nImpact on popular culture.\n\"The Lord of the Rings\" has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially during the 1960s and 1970s, when young people embraced it as a countercultural saga. \"Frodo Lives!\" and \"Gandalf for President\" were two phrases popular among United States Tolkien fans during this time. Its impact is such that the words \"Tolkienian\" and \"Tolkienesque\" have entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", and many of his fantasy terms, formerly little-known in English, such as \"Orc\" and \"Warg\", have become widespread in that domain.\nAmong its effects are numerous parodies, especially \"Harvard Lampoon\"'s \"Bored of the Rings\", which has had the distinction of remaining continuously in print from its publication in 1969, and of being translated into at least 11 languages.\nIn 1969, Tolkien sold the merchandising rights to \"The Lord of The Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" to United Artists under an agreement stipulating a lump sum payment of \u00a310,000 () plus a 7.5% royalty after costs, payable to Allen &amp; Unwin and the author. In 1976, three years after the author's death, United Artists sold the rights to Saul Zaentz Company, who now trade as Tolkien Enterprises. Since then all \"authorised\" merchandise has been signed off by Tolkien Enterprises, although the intellectual property rights of the specific likenesses of characters and other imagery from various adaptations is generally held by the adaptors.\nOutside commercial exploitation from adaptations, from the late 1960s onwards there has been an increasing variety of original licensed merchandise, with posters and calendars created by illustrators such as Barbara Remington.\nThe work was named Britain's best novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read. In 2015, the BBC ranked \"The Lord of the Rings\" 26th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels. It was included in \"Le Monde\"'s list of \"100 Books of the Century\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
