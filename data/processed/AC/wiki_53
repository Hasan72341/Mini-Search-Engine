His work includes science fiction, crime, and historical epic films, with an atmospheric and highly concentrated visual style. He ranks among the highest-grossing directors, with his films grossing a cumulative $5 billion worldwide. He has received many accolades, including the BAFTA Fellowship for Lifetime Achievement in 2018, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Golden Globe Award. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003, and appointed a Knight Grand Cross by King Charles III in 2024.\nAn alumnus of the Royal College of Art in London, Scott began his career in television as a designer and director before moving into advertising as a director of commercials. He made his film directorial debut with \"The Duellists\" (1977) and gained wider recognition with his next film, \"Alien\" (1979). Though his films range widely in setting and period, they showcase memorable imagery of urban environments, spanning 2nd-century Rome in \"Gladiator\" (2000) and its 2024 sequel, 12th-century Jerusalem in \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005), medieval England in \"Robin Hood\" (2010), ancient Memphis in ' (2014), contemporary Mogadishu in \"Black Hawk Down\" (2002), futuristic cityscapes of Los Angeles in \"Blade Runner\" (1982), and extraterrestrial worlds in \"Alien\", \"Prometheus\" (2012), \"The Martian\" (2015) and ' (2017).\nScott has been nominated for three Academy Awards for Directing for \"Thelma &amp; Louise\", \"Gladiator\" and \"Black Hawk Down\". \"Gladiator\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and he received a nomination in the same category for \"The Martian\". In 1995, both Scott and his brother Tony received a British Academy Film Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. Scott's films \"Alien\", \"Blade Runner\" and \"Thelma &amp; Louise\" were each selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being considered \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In a 2004 BBC poll, Scott was ranked 10 on the list of most influential people in British culture. Scott also works in television, and has earned 10 Primetime Emmy Award nominations. He won twice, for Outstanding Television Film for the HBO film \"The Gathering Storm\" (2002) and for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special for the History Channel's \"Gettysburg\" (2011). He was Emmy-nominated for \"RKO 281\" (1999), \"The Andromeda Strain\" (2008), and \"The Pillars of the Earth\" (2010).\nEarly life and education.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMy mum brought three boys up: my dad was in the army and so he was frequently away. During the war and post-war, we tended to travel following him around so my mum was the boss. She laid down the law and the law was God. We just said, \"Yup, okay\" \u2013 we didn't argue. I think that's where the respect has come from, because she was tough.\n\u2014 A supporter of strong female characters in his work, Scott credits his mother Elizabeth as his first female role model\nScott was born on 30 November 1937 in South Shields, to Francis (\"Frank\") Percy Scott, a partner in a commercial shipping business based in Newcastle who would serve as a Colonel in the Royal Engineers during the Second World War, and Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Williams, a miner's daughter. His great-uncle Dixon Scott was a pioneer of the cinema chain and opened many cinemas around Tyneside. One of his cinemas, Tyneside Cinema, is still operating in Newcastle and is the last remaining newsreel cinema in the UK.\nBorn two years before the Second World War began, Scott was brought up in a military family. His father, a senior officer in the Royal Engineers, was absent for most of his early life. His elder brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around; they lived in Cumberland as well as other areas of England, in addition to Wales and Germany, where Colonel Scott was part of the post-war Allied Control Council. After the war the Scott family moved back to County Durham and eventually settled on Teesside.\nHis interest in science fiction began by reading the novels of H. G. Wells as a child. He was also influenced by science-fiction films such as \"It! The Terror from Beyond Space\", \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and \"Them!\" He said these films \"kind of got [him] going a little\" but his attention was not fully caught until he saw Stanley Kubrick's \"\", about which he said, \"Once I saw that, I knew what I could do.\" He went to Grangefield Grammar School in Stockton on Tees and obtained a diploma in design at West Hartlepool College of Art. While in Stockton during the mid 1950s, he played for Stockton Rugby Football Club. The industrial landscape in West Hartlepool would later inspire visuals in \"Blade Runner\", with Scott stating, \"There were steelworks adjacent to West Hartlepool, so every day I'd be going through them, and thinking they're kind of magnificent, beautiful, winter or summer, and the darker and more ominous it got, the more interesting it got.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI use everything I learned every day at art school. It's all about white sheets of paper, pens and drawing.\n \u2014 Scott speaking about the influence the Royal College of Art has had in designing the visuals for his films\nScott went on to study at the Royal College of Art in London, contributing to the college magazine \"ARK\" and helping to establish the college film department. For his final show he made a black and white short film, \"Boy and Bicycle\", starring both his younger brother and his father, which was later released on the \u2018Extras\u2019 section of \"The Duellists\" DVD. In February 1963 Scott was named in the title credits as Designer for the BBC television programme \"Tonight\".\nAfter graduation in 1963 he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series \"Z-Cars\" and science fiction series \"Out of the Unknown\". He was originally assigned to design the second \"Doctor Who\" serial, \"The Daleks\", which would have entailed realizing the serial's eponymous alien creatures. Shortly before he was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant he was replaced by Raymond Cusick. In 1965 he began directing episodes of television series for the BBC, only one of which, an episode of \"Adam Adamant Lives!\", is available commercially.\nIn 1968 Ridley and his younger brother, Tony Scott, who would also go on to become a film director, founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company. Working alongside Alan Parker, Hugh Hudson and cinematographer Hugh Johnson, Ridley Scott made many commercials at RSA during the 1970s, including a 1973 Hovis bread advertisement, \"Bike Round\" (underscored by the slow movement of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's \"New World\" symphony rearranged for brass), filmed in Gold Hill, Shaftesbury, Dorset. A nostalgia-themed television advert that captured the public imagination, it was voted the UK's favourite commercial in a 2006 poll. In the 1970s the Chanel No. 5 brand needed revitalisation, having run the risk of being labelled as mass market and pass\u00e9. Directed by Scott in the 1970s and 1980s, Chanel television commercials were inventive mini-films with production values of surreal fantasy and seduction, which \"played on the same visual imagery, with the same silhouette of the bottle.\"\nFive members of the Scott family are directors and all have worked for RSA. His brother Tony was a successful film director whose career spanned more than two decades; his sons, Jake and Luke, are both acclaimed directors of commercials, as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles; Luke is based in London. In 1995 Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.\nCareer.\n1970s: \"The Duellists\", \"Alien\".\n\"The Duellists\" (1977) marked Ridley Scott's first feature film as director. Shot in continental Europe, it was nominated for the main prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and won an award for Best Debut Film. \"The Duellists\" had limited commercial impact internationally. Based on Joseph Conrad's short story \"The Duel\" and set during the Napoleonic Wars, it follows two French Hussar officers, D'Hubert and Feraud (Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel) whose quarrel over an initially minor incident turns into a bitter extended feud spanning fifteen years, interwoven with the larger conflict that provides its backdrop. The film has been acclaimed for providing a historically authentic portrayal of Napoleonic uniforms and military conduct. The 2013 release of the film on Blu-ray coincided with the publication of an essay on the film in a collection of scholarly essays on Scott.\nScott had originally planned next to adapt a version of \"Tristan and Iseult\", but after seeing \"Star Wars\", he became convinced of the potential of large-scale, effects-driven films. He accepted the job of directing \"Alien\", the 1979 horror/science-fiction film that would win him international success. Scott made the decision to switch Ellen Ripley from the standard male action hero to a heroine. Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), who appeared in the first four \"Alien\" films, would become a cinematic icon. The final scene of John Hurt's character has been named by a number of publications as one of the most memorable in cinematic history. Filmed at Shepperton Studios in England, \"Alien\" was the sixth highest-grossing film of 1979, earning over $104\u00a0million worldwide. Scott was involved in the 2003 restoration and re-release of the original film. In promotional interviews at the time, Scott indicated he had been in discussions to make a fifth film in the \"Alien\" franchise. However, in a 2006 interview, Scott remarked that he had been unhappy about \"Alien: The Director's Cut\", feeling that the original was \"pretty flawless\" and that the additions were merely a marketing tool. Scott later returned to \"Alien\"-related projects when he directed \"Prometheus\" and \"\" three decades after the original film's release.\n1980s: \"Blade Runner\" and other films.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOutside \"Star Wars\", no sci-fi universe has been etched into cinematic consciousness more thoroughly than \"Blade Runner\". Ridley Scott's definitive 1982 neo-noir offered an immersive dystopia of rain-soaked windows and shadowy buildings adorned with animated neon billboards, where flying cars hum through the endless night. \n\u2014 Eric Kohn, \"IndieWire\", 2017\nAfter a year working on the film adaptation of \"Dune\", and following the sudden death of his brother Frank, Scott signed to direct the film version of Philip K. Dick's novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" Re-titled \"Blade Runner\" and starring Harrison Ford, the film was a commercial disappointment in theaters in 1982, and was criticised by Pauline Kael in the New Yorker who wrote \"...Scott doesn't seem to have a grasp of how to use words as part of the way a movie moves. \"Blade Runner\" is a suspenseless thriller; it appears to be a victim of its own imaginative use of hardware and miniatures and mattes. At some point, Scott and the others must have decided that the story was unimportant; maybe the booming, lewd and sultry score by Chariots-for-Hire Vangelis that seems to come out of the smoke convinced them that the audience would be moved even if vital parts of the story were trimmed.\"\nIn response to the review, Scott said: \"...It was four pages of destruction. I never met her. I was so offended. I framed those pages and they've been in my office for 30 years to remind me there's only one critic that counts and that's you. I haven't read critiques ever since. Because if it's a good one, you can get a swollen head and forget yourself. And if it's a bad one, you're so depressed that it's debilitating.\" The movie is now widely regarded as a classic. In 1991, Scott's notes were used by Warner Bros. to create a rushed director's cut which removed the main character's voiceover and made a number of other small changes, including to the ending. Later Scott personally supervised a digital restoration of \"Blade Runner\" and approved what was called \"The Final Cut\". This version was released in Los Angeles, New York City and Toronto cinemas on 5 October 2007, and as an elaborate DVD release in December 2007.\nToday, \"Blade Runner\" is ranked by many critics as one of the most important and influential science fiction films ever made, partly thanks to its much imitated portraits of a future cityscape. It is often discussed along with William Gibson's novel \"Neuromancer\" as initiating the cyberpunk genre. Stephen Minger, stem cell biologist at King's College London, states, \"It was so far ahead of its time and the whole premise of the story \u2013 what is it to be human and who are we, where we come from? It's the age-old questions.\" Scott has described \"Blade Runner\" as his \"most complete and personal film\".\nIn 1985, Scott directed \"Legend\", a fantasy film produced by Arnon Milchan. Scott decided to create a \"once upon a time\" tale set in a world of princesses, unicorns and goblins, filming almost entirely inside the studio. Scott cast Tom Cruise as the film's hero, Jack; Mia Sara as Princess Lili; and Tim Curry as the Satan-horned Lord of Darkness. Scott had a forest set built on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, with trees 60 feet high and trunks 30 feet in diameter. In the final stages of filming, the forest set was destroyed by fire; Jerry Goldsmith's original score was used for European release, but replaced in North America with a score by Tangerine Dream. Rob Bottin provided the film's Academy Award-nominated special make-up effects, most notably Curry's red-coloured Satan figure. Despite a major commercial failure on release, the film has gone on to become a cult classic. The 2002 Director's Cut restored Goldsmith's original score.\nScott made \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", a romantic thriller starring Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers in 1987, and \"Black Rain\" (1989), a police drama starring Michael Douglas and Andy Garc\u00eda, shot partially in Japan. The latter was very well received at the box office. \"Black Rain\" was the first of Scott's six collaborations with the composer Hans Zimmer.\n\"1984\" Apple Macintosh commercial.\nIn 1984, Scott collaborated with Apple Inc. to direct a big-budget ($900,000) television commercial, \"1984\", to launch Apple Computer's Macintosh computer. Scott filmed the advertisement in England for about $370,000; which was given a showcase airing in the US on 22 January 1984, during Super Bowl XVIII, alongside screenings in theaters. Some consider this advertisement a \"watershed event\" in advertising and a \"masterpiece\". \"Advertising Age\" placed it top of its list of the 50 greatest commercials.\nSet in a dystopian future modelled after George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", Scott's advertisement used its hero (portrayed by English athlete Anya Major) to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by her white tank top adorned with a picture of the Apple Macintosh computer) as a means of saving humanity from \"conformity\" (Big Brother), an allusion to IBM, at that time the dominant force in computing.\n1990s.\nThe road film \"Thelma &amp; Louise\" (1991) starring Geena Davis as Thelma, Susan Sarandon as Louise, in addition to the breakthrough role for Brad Pitt as J.D, proved to be one of Scott's biggest critical successes, helping revive the director's reputation and receiving his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. His next project, independently funded historical epic \"\", was a box-office failure. The film recounts the expeditions to the Americas by Christopher Columbus (French star G\u00e9rard Depardieu). Scott did not release another film for four years.\nIn 1995 Ridley and his brother Tony formed a production company, Scott Free Productions, in Los Angeles. All Ridley's subsequent feature films, starting with \"White Squall\" (starring Jeff Bridges) and \"G.I. Jane\" (starring Demi Moore), have been produced under the Scott Free banner. In 1995 the two brothers purchased a controlling interest in the British film studio Shepperton Studios. In 2001 Shepperton merged with Pinewood Studios to become The Pinewood Studios Group, which has its headquarters in Buckinghamshire, England.\n2000s.\nScott's historical drama \"Gladiator\" (2000) proved to be one of his biggest critical and commercial successes. It won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for the film's star Russell Crowe, and saw Scott nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. Scott collaborated with British visual effects and animation company The Mill for the film's computer-generated imagery, and the film was dedicated to Oliver Reed, who died during filming \u2013 The Mill created a digital body double for Reed's remaining scenes. Some have credited \"Gladiator \" with reviving the nearly defunct \"sword and sandal\" historical genre. The film was named the fifth best action film of all time in the ABC special \"Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time\".\nScott directed \"Hannibal\" (2001) starring Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. The film was commercially successful despite receiving mixed reviews. Scott's next film, \"Black Hawk Down\" (2002), featuring Tom Hardy in his film debut, was based on a group of stranded US soldiers fighting for their lives in Somalia, Scott was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. In 2003, Scott directed a smaller scale project, \"Matchstick Men\", adapted from the novel by Eric Garcia and starring Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman. It received mostly positive reviews but performed moderately at the box office.\nIn 2005 he made the modestly successful \"Kingdom of Heaven\", a film about the Crusades. The film starred Orlando Bloom and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composer Harry Gregson-Williams. The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes. Unhappy with the theatrical version of \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (which he blamed on paying too much attention to the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006. The director's cut of \"Kingdom of Heaven\" has been met with critical acclaim, with \"Empire\" magazine calling the film an \"epic\", adding: \"The added 45 minutes in the director's cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle.\" \"This is the one that should have gone out\" reflected Scott. Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: \"It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version to go out into the cinema.\"\nScott collaborated again with \"Gladiator\" star Russell Crowe for \"A Good Year\", based on the best-selling book by Peter Mayle about an investment banker who finds a new life in Provence. The film was released on 10 November 2006. A few days later Rupert Murdoch, chairman of studio 20th Century Fox (who backed the film), dismissed \"A Good Year\" as \"a flop\" at a shareholders' meeting.\nScott's next film was \"American Gangster\", based on the story of real-life drug kingpin Frank Lucas. Scott took over the project in early 2006 and had screenwriter Steven Zaillian rewrite his script to focus on the dynamic between Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. Denzel Washington signed on to the project as Lucas, with Russell Crowe costarring as Roberts. The film premiered in November 2007 to positive reviews and box office success and Scott was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Director.\nIn late 2008 Scott's espionage thriller \"Body of Lies\", starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, opened to lukewarm ticket sales and mixed reviews. Scott directed a remake adaptation of \"Robin Hood\", which starred Russell Crowe as Robin Hood and Cate Blanchett as Maid Marian. It was released in May 2010 to mixed reviews but a respectable box office.\nOn 31 July 2009 news surfaced of a two-part prequel to \"Alien\" with Scott attached to direct. The project, ultimately reduced to a single film called \"Prometheus\", which Scott described as sharing \"strands of \"Alien\"'s DNA\" while not being a direct prequel, was released in June 2012. The film starred Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender, with Noomi Rapace playing the leading role of the scientist named Elizabeth Shaw. The film received mostly positive reviews and grossed $403\u00a0million at the box office.\nIn August 2009 Scott planned to direct an adaptation of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" set in a dystopian London with Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2009, the TV series \"The Good Wife\" premiered with Ridley and his brother Tony credited as executive producers.\n2010s.\nOn 6 July 2010, YouTube announced the launch of \"Life in a Day\", an experimental documentary executive produced by Scott. Released at the Sundance Film Festival on 27 January 2011, it incorporates footage shot on 24 July 2010 submitted by YouTube users from around the world. As part of the buildup to the 2012 London Olympics, Scott produced \"Britain in a Day\", a documentary film consisting of footage shot by the British public on 12 November 2011.\nIn 2012, Scott produced the commercial for Lady Gaga's fragrance, \"Fame\". It was touted as the first-ever black Eau de Parfum, in the informal credits attached to the trailer for this advertisement. On 24 June 2013, Scott's series \"Crimes of the Century\" debuted on CNN. In November 2012 it was announced that Scott would produce the documentary, \"Springsteen &amp; I\" directed by Baillie Walsh and inspired by \"Life in a Day\", which Scott also produced. The film featured fan footage from throughout the world on what musician Bruce Springsteen meant to them and how he impacted their lives. The film was released for one day only in 50 countries and on over 2000 film screens on 22 July 2013.\nScott directed \"The Counselor\" (2013), with a screenplay by author Cormac McCarthy. On 25 October 2013, \"Indiewire\" reported that \"Before McCarthy sold his first spec script for Scott's (\"The Counselor\") film, the director was heavily involved in developing an adaptation of the author's 1985 novel \"Blood Meridian\" with screenwriter Bill Monahan (\"The Departed\"). But as Scott said in a \"Time Out\" interview, '[Studios] didn't want to make it. The book is so uncompromising, which is what's great about it.' Described as an 'anti-western'...\" Scott directed the biblically inspired epic film \"\", released in December 2014 which received negative reviews from critics (particularly for the casting of white actors as Middle Eastern characters) and grossed $268\u00a0million worldwide on a $140\u00a0million budget, making it a financial disappointment. Filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, the film starred Christian Bale in the lead role.\nIn May 2014, Scott began negotiations to direct \"The Martian\", starring Matt Damon as Mark Watney. Like many of Scott's previous works, \"The Martian\" features a heroine in the form of Jessica Chastain's character who is the mission commander. The film was originally scheduled for release on 25 November 2015, but Fox later switched its release date with that of \"Victor Frankenstein\", and thus \"The Martian\" was released on 2 October 2015. \"The Martian\" was a critical and commercial success, grossed over $630\u00a0million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date.\nA sequel to \"Prometheus\", \"\", started filming in 2016, premiered in London on 4 May 2017, and received general release on 19 May 2017. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Michael Fassbender's dual performance and calling the film a return to form for both director Ridley Scott and the franchise.\nIn August 2011, information leaked about production of a sequel to \"Blade Runner\" by Alcon Entertainment, with Alcon partners Broderick Johnson and Andrew Kosove. Scott informed the \"Variety\" publication in November 2014 that he was no longer the director for the film and would only fulfill a producer's role. Scott also revealed that filming would begin sometime within 2015, and that Harrison Ford has signed on to reprise his role from the original film but his character should only appear in \"the third act\" of the sequel. On 26 February 2015, the sequel was officially confirmed, with Denis Villeneuve hired to direct the film, and Scott being an executive producer. The sequel, \"Blade Runner 2049\", was released on 6 October 2017 to universal acclaim.\nFrom May to August 2017, Scott filmed \"All the Money in the World\", a drama about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, starring Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams. Kevin Spacey originally portrayed Getty Sr. However, after multiple sexual assault allegations against the actor, Scott decided to replace him with Christopher Plummer, saying \"You can't condone that kind of behaviour in any shape or form. We cannot let one person's action affect the good work of all these other people. It's that simple.\" Scott began re-shooting Spacey's scenes with Plummer on 20 November, which included filming at Elveden Hall in west Suffolk, England. With a release date of 25 December 2017, the film studio had its doubts that Scott would manage it, saying: \"They were like, 'You'll never do it. God be with you.'\"\n2020s.\nIn 2020, Scott directed \"The Last Duel\", a film adaptation of Eric Jager's 2004 book \"\", starring Adam Driver, Matt Damon and Jodie Comer which was released on 15 October 2021 to positive reviews but it bombed at the box office, grossing only $30.6\u00a0million against a production budget of $100\u00a0million. Filming locations included the French medieval castle of Berz\u00e9-le-Ch\u00e2tel (with a film crew of 300 people including 100 extras), and Ireland. He directed \"House of Gucci\", a film about the murder of Maurizio Gucci orchestrated by Patrizia Reggiani, who were portrayed by Adam Driver and Lady Gaga, respectively. Scott had originally been set to direct the film in 2006, but the project languished in development hell for several years, with different directors entering talks to sign on, before he returned to the project in November 2019. The film was released on 24 November 2021.\nScott next directed \"Napoleon\", a biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte starring Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon and Vanessa Kirby as Empress Jos\u00e9phine, the first wife of Napoleon. Filming began in February 2022; the film was released on 22 November 2023 by Sony Pictures Releasing before streaming on Apple TV+ on 1 March 2024. Scott's next film was \"Gladiator II\", a sequel to \"Gladiator\", starring Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington, and Pedro Pascal. The film, which began production in June 2023 but had been discussed since early 2001, was released on 22 November 2024.\nUpcoming projects.\nIn February 2024, it was announced that Scott will direct Paramount Pictures' Bee Gees biopic titled \"You Should Be Dancing\", written by John Logan and Joe Penhall.

In November that year, Scott was announced to be directing \"The Dog Stars\", based on the Peter Heller novel of the same name that will star Jacob Elordi, with principal photography set to begin in April 2025, in Italy.\nWhile promoting \"Gladiator II\", in a September 2024 interview for French network La Premiere, Scott revealed that he was planning a \"Gladiator III\", comparing the ending of \"II\" to \"The Godfather\", \"with Michael Corleone ending up with a job he didn't want [...] So the next [film] will be about a man who doesn't want to be where he is.\"\nTelevision projects.\nIn 2002, Ridley Scott and his brother Tony were among the executive producers of \"The Gathering Storm\", a television biographical film of Winston Churchill in the years just prior to World War II. A BBC\u2013HBO co-production, it received acclaim, with Mark Lawson of \"The Guardian\" ranking it as the most memorable television portrayal of Churchill. The brothers produced the CBS series \"Numb3rs\" (2005\u201310), a crime drama about a genius mathematician who helps the FBI solve crimes; and \"The Good Wife\" (2009\u20132016), a legal drama about an attorney balancing her job with her husband, a former state attorney trying to rebuild his political career after a major scandal. The two Scotts also produced a 2010 film adaptation of 1980s television show \"The A-Team\", directed by Joe Carnahan.\nRidley Scott was an executive producer of the first season of Amazon's \"The Man in the High Castle\" (2015\u201316).

Scott was an executive producer for the 2019 BBC/FX three-part miniseries \"A Christmas Carol\", developed by Steven Knight, alongside Tom Hardy.\nScott's first television directing role in 50 years, \"Raised by Wolves\", was released on HBO Max in 2020. Scott said his \"tendency was to think, 'I don't want to go down that road of androids again'\", but decided to take on the project after he read the script and liked it. The show revolves around androids Mother and Father, who attempt to save humankind on planet Kepler-22b after earth is demolished by war between the Mithraic, who follow a god called Sol, and militant atheists.\nIn August 2022, it was announced Scott would executive produce the Apple TV+ series \"Dope Thief\", written by Peter Craig and starring Brian Tyree Henry, and would also direct an episode.\nPersonal life.\nScott was married to Felicity Heywood from 1964 to 1975. The couple had two sons, Jake and Luke, both of whom work as directors in Scott's production company, Ridley Scott Associates. Scott later married advertising executive Sandy Watson in 1979, with whom he had a daughter, Jordan Scott, also a director, and divorced in 1989. In 2015 he married actress Giannina Facio, whom he has cast in all his films since \"White Squall\" except \"American Gangster\" and \"The Martian\". He divides his time between homes in London, France, and Los Angeles.\nHis eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer in 1980. His younger brother Tony, who was also his business partner in their company Scott Free, died on 19 August 2012 at the age of 68 after jumping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge which spans Los Angeles Harbor, after an originally disputed long struggle with cancer. Before Tony's death, he and Ridley collaborated on a miniseries based on Robin Cook's novel \"Coma\" for A&amp;E. The two-part miniseries premiered on A&amp;E on 3 September 2012, to mixed reviews.\nScott has dedicated several of his films in memory of his family: \"Blade Runner\" to his brother Frank, \"Black Hawk Down\" to his mother, and \"The Counselor\" and \"\" to his brother Tony. Ridley also paid tribute to his late brother Tony at the 2016 Golden Globes, after his film, \"The Martian\", won Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy.\nIn 2013, Scott stated that he is an atheist. Although when asked by the BBC in a September 2014 interview if he believes in God, Scott replied:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'm not sure. I think there's all kinds of questions raised... that's such an exotic question. If we looked at the whole thing practically speaking, the Big Bang occurred and then we go through this evolution of millions, billions of years where, by coincidence, all the right biological accidents came out the right way. To an extent, that doesn't make sense unless there was a controlling decider or mediator in all of that. So who was that? Or what was that? Are we one big grand experiment in the basic overall blink of the universe, or the galaxy? In which case, who is behind it?\nDirectorial style.\nScott's frequent collaborator Russell Crowe commented, \"I like being on Ridley's set because actors can perform [...] and the focus is on the performers.\" Paul M. Sammon, in his book \"Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner\", commented in an interview with Brmovie.com that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years. More recently during the filming of Scott's 2012 film, \"Prometheus\", Charlize Theron praised the director's willingness to listen to suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on screen. Theron worked alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming. When working on epics, Scott states, \"there's always the danger that the characters can get swamped\" on a large canvas, before adding, \"My model is David Lean, whose characters never got lost in the proscenium.\"\nScott's work is identified for its striking visuals, with heroines also a common theme. \"Los Angeles Times\" film editor Joshua Rothkopf wrote \"Scott may be the movies' most consistent stealth feminist\". His visual style, incorporating a detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent generation of filmmakers. James Cameron commented, \"I love Ridley's films and I love his filmmaking, I love the beauty of the photography, I love the visceral sense that you're there, that you're present.\" Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples include \"Alien\" and \"Blade Runner\"; the \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter \"Blade Crawler\" \"because it's so damn slow\". Scott claims to have an eidetic memory, which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.\nScott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: \"I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and\u00a0\u2013 whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up\u00a0\u2013 then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on.\"\nArtificial intelligence is a theme that appears in several of Scott's films, including \"Blade Runner\", \"Alien\", and \"Prometheus\". The 2013 book \"The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott\" identifies pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing and the philosopher John Searle as presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as the Turing test and the Chinese Room Thought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled \"What's Wrong with Building Replicants\", which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films. The chapter titled \"Artificial Intelligence in \"Blade Runner\", \"Alien\", and \"Prometheus\",\" concludes by citing the writings of John Stuart Mill in the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants in \"Blade Runner\" (Rutger Hauer), the android Ash (Ian Holm) in \"Alien\", and the android David 8 (Michael Fassbender) in \"Prometheus\", where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.\nDVD format and director's cut.\nScott provides audio commentaries and interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue of \"Total Film\" magazine, he stated: \"After all the work we go through, to have it run in the theater and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it.\"\nThe positive reaction to the \"Blade Runner\" Director's Cut encouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (including \"Legend\" and \"Kingdom of Heaven\"), which have been met with acclaim. Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.\nHonours, awards and legacy.\nScott was knighted in the 2003 New Year Honours \"for services to the British film industry\". He received his accolade from Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 8 July 2003. Scott admitted feeling \"stunned and truly humbled\" after the ceremony, saying, \"As a boy growing up in South Shields, I could never have imagined that I would receive such a special recognition. I am truly humbled to receive this treasured award and believe it also further recognises the excellence of the British film industry.\" In the 2024 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) by King Charles III also \"for services to the UK film industry\".\nScott has been nominated for three Academy Awards for Directing\u2014\"Thelma &amp; Louise\", \"Gladiator\" and \"Black Hawk Down\"\u2014as well as three British Academy Film Awards for Best Director, four Golden Globe Awards for Best Director, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. In 1995, Ridley and his brother Tony received the BAFTA for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema. In 2018 he received the highest accolade from BAFTA, the BAFTA Fellowship, for lifetime achievement.\nScott was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2017 the German newspaper \"FAZ\" compared Scott's influence on the science fiction film genre to Sir Alfred Hitchcock's on thrillers and John Ford's on Westerns. In 2011, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nScott has received three Hugo Awards in the category of Best Dramatic Presentation for \"Alien\", \"Blade Runner\" and \"The Martian\". In 2012, Scott was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork, The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday. On 3 July 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London at which he described how he still keeps on his office wall his school report placing him 31st out of 31 in his class, and how his teacher encouraged him to pursue what became his passion at art school.\nDirected Academy Award performances\nUnder Scott's direction, these actors have received Academy Award nominations (and wins) for their performances in their respective roles.\nBelgian bike manufacturing company Ridley Bikes is named in honour of Scott.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25495", "revid": "32005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25495", "title": "History of the Republic of the Congo", "text": "The history of the Republic of the Congo has been marked by diverse civilisations: Indigenous, French and post-independence.\nBantus and Forest Peoples.\nThe earliest inhabitants of the region comprising present-day Congo were the Forest peoples whose Stone Age culture was slowly replaced by Bantu tribes. The main Bantu tribe living in the region were the Kongo, also known as Bakongo, who established mostly unstable kingdoms along the mouth, north and south, of the Congo River. The capital of this Kongolese kingdom, Mbanza Kongo, later baptized as S\u00e3o Salvador by the Portuguese, is a town in northern Angola near the border with the DRC.\nFrom the capital they ruled over an empire encompassing large parts of present-day Angola, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They ruled over nearby tributary states, often by appointing sons of the Kongo kings to head these states. It had six 'so-called' provinces called Mpemba, Soyo, Mbamba, Mbata, Nsundi and Mpangu. With the Kingdom of Loango in the north and the Kingdom of Mbundu in the south being tributary states. In the East it bordered on the Kwango river, a tributary of the Congo River. In total the kingdom is said to have had 3 to 4 million inhabitants and a surface of about 300,000\u00a0km2. According to oral traditions it was established in around 1400 when King Lukeni lua Nimi conquered the kingdom of Kabunga and established Mbanza Kongo as its capital.\nPortuguese exploration.\nThis African Iron Age culture came under great pressure with the arrival of the first Europeans, in this case Portuguese explorers. King John II of Portugal sought, in order to break Venetian and Ottoman control over trade with the East, to organize a series of expeditions south along the African coast with the goal of establishing direct contact with Asia. In 1482\u20131483, Captain Diogo C\u00e3o, sailing southwards on the uncharted Congo River, discovered the mouth of the river, and became the first European to encounter the Kingdom of Kongo.\nInitially relations were limited and considered beneficial to both sides. With Christianity easily accepted by the local nobility, leading on 3 May 1491 to the baptism of king Nzinga a Nkuwu as the first Christian Kongolese king Jo\u00e3o I. He was succeeded after his death in 1506 by his son Nzinga Mbemba, who ruled as King Afonso I until 1543. Under his reign Christianity gained a strong foothold in the country. Many churches were built in Mbanza, of which the Kulumbimbi Cathedral (erected between 1491 and 1534) was the most impressive. In theory the kings of Portugal and Kongo were equals and they exchanged letters as such. Kongo at some point even established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, and the Pope appointed a local priest as bishop for the region.\nRevolts.\nThe result was a series of revolts against Portuguese rule of which the battle of Mbwila and the revolt led by Kimpa Vita (Tchimpa Vita) were the most important. The battle of Mbwila (or battle of Ambouilla or battle of Ulanga) was the result of a conflict between the Portuguese, led by governor Andr\u00e9 Vidal de Negreiros, and the Kongolese king Ant\u00f3nio I concerning mining rights. The Kongolese refused to give the Portuguese extra territorial rights and the Portuguese were angry because of Kongolese support for previous Dutch invasions of the region. During a battle on 25 October 1665 an estimated 20,000 Kongolese fought against the Portuguese, who won the battle thanks to the early death in battle of Kongolese King Afonso I of Kongo.\nThe revolt of Kimpa Vita was another attempt to regain independence from the Portuguese. Baptised around 1684 as Dona B\u00e9atrice, Kimpa Vita was raised Catholic and being very pious she became a nun seeing visions of St. Anthony of Padua ordering her to restore the kingdom of Kongo to its former glory. Creating the Anthonian prophetic movement she interfered directly in the then civil war between the three members of the local nobility claiming the Kongolese throne, Jo\u00e3o II, Pedro IV and Pedro Kibenga. In it she took sides against Pedro IV, considered the favorite of the Portuguese. Her revolt, during which she captured the capital Mbanza Kongo, was short lived. She was captured by the forces of Pedro IV and under orders of Portuguese Capuchin Friars condemned for being a witch and a heretic and consequently burned to death. For many, she is the African version of Joan of Arc and an early symbol of African resistance against colonialism because, for her outspokenness, she was burned alive on a pyre.\nCongo's disintegration.\nAs a result of all these wars the kingdom of the Loango in the north gained independence from Kongo. Also new kingdoms came to existence of which the T\u00e9k\u00e9 was the most important, ruling over a large area encompassing present-day Brazzaville and Kinshasa. Portugal's position in Europe suffered a major change in 1580 when the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal were united by a personal union under King Philip, creating the Iberian Union which lasted until 1640. This resulted in a diminished role for Portugal in African affairs, including the area around the mouth of the Congo River. The Kingdom of Kongo was reduced to a small enclave in the north of Angola with King Pedro V in 1888 finally accepting to become a vassal of the Portuguese. The Portuguese abolished the kingdom after the revolt of the Kongolese in 1914.\nFrench rule.\nScramble for raw materials.\nThe period leading up to the Berlin Conference on Africa saw a rush by the major European powers to increase their control of the African continent. The rise in Western Europe of capitalism and the consequent industrialization led to a fast-growing demand for African raw materials like rubber, palm oil and cotton. Those who had these raw materials could have their economy grow strong. Others would lose out. This resulted in a new and more intensified scramble for Africa.\nThe Congo River hereby was a prime target for this new conquest by the European nations. Here the French, the Belgian King Leopold II and the Portuguese, in close cooperation with the British, fought for control of this area. Resulting in the division of the mouth of the Congo River between Portugal, who obtained Cabinda, an enclave north of the Congo River situated on the Atlantic Coast, the French who seized the large area north of the River, and king Leopold II gaining only a small foothold at the mouth of the Congo River but obtaining the huge hinterland, the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Za\u00efre). Hereby Leopold II obtained control via his International African Society and later the International Congolese Society, so-called philanthropic organizations who hired the British explorer Henry Morton Stanley to establish its authority. This resulted in the creation of the Congo Free State, the private empire of Leopold II. On November 15, 1908, the Belgian parliament annexed the colony, the reign of Leopold II over the Congo being discredited.\nPierre Savorgnan de Brazza.\nOn the north bank of the river arrived the French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, born in the Italian city of Rome in 1852. As a French naval officer he refused to work for the International African Society and instead helped the French in their conquest of the area north of the Congo River. Traveling from the Atlantic Ocean coast in present-day Gabon via the rivers Ogoou\u00e9 and Lefini he arrived in 1880 in the kingdom of the T\u00e9k\u00e9 where on 10 September 1880 he signed the treaty with King Makoko establishing French control over the region and making his capital soon afterwards at the small village named Mfoa later to be called Brazzaville.\nEstablishing control.\nEstablishing French control was difficult. Belgian King Leopold II also tried to gain a foothold on the northern bank of the Congo River and sent Stanley to the area around Brazzaville. Following this was a series of revolts against the French of which the Bahangala Revolt led by Mabiala Ma Nganga was the first important one. It started in 1892 with the murder of the French administrator Laval and ended with the killing by the French of its leader in 1896. Many of the revolts were the result of French policy of maltreating the local population through the use of harsh forced labor. The locals were governed through the use of the repressive Code de l'indig\u00e9nat Act. A law, which introduced forced labor, made it illegal for the local population to publicly air its grievances and excluded them from all the important jobs.The French government allowed for the establishment of the so-called Concessionary Companies in 1889 so as to circumvent the economic non-discrimination provisions of the Treaty of Berlin and maximize the revenue drawn from underpopulated and undeveloped regions under their control. Roughly forty companies with a capital of roughly 59.5 million francs were given a free hand to exploit the colony's resources under virtual monopoly conditions. 650,000 square miles of land, except for a few strategic locations mainly around the Congo River, were leased as concessions for a thirty-year period. Cost-benefit considerations reigned supreme as often undercapitalized companies employed unqualified personnel and/or adventurers who lived off the land while stripping their concessions of all possible riches. Ivory and rubber virtually disappeared from the concessionary areas; indigenous populations were decimated by brutal forced labor, disease, and maladministration, and some fled to neighboring colonies.\nFrench rule was brutal and led to many thousands of deaths. The construction between 1921 and 1934 of the 511\u00a0km long railway, the Chemin de Fer Congo-Oc\u00e9an between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire is for example said to have cost the lives of around 23,000 locals and a few hundred Europeans. Any resistance against French colonial rule, however small, was brutally repressed. Ultimately the French government lost more money than it gained in rents and taxes from the Concessionary system upon which the colony had become reliant, and French public opinion was shocked by reports of the wide-scale brutalities which the system had given rise to. By 1930 most of the Concessionary companies had gone bankrupt and the practice had largely ceased.\nIn 1911 parts of the colony (the so-called New Cameroon territories) were ceded to the German Empire in exchange for German recognition of France's rights to Morocco. German rule in these regions lasted only five years, and ultimately the New Cameroon territories were seized back by France in 1916, after the fall of German forces in Kamerun.\nFrench administration.\nThe first name given officially on 1 August 1886 for the new colony was Colony of Gabon and Congo. On 30 April 1891 this was renamed Colony of French Congo, consisting of Gabon and Middle Congo, the name the French gave to Congo-Brazzaville at that time. On 15 January 1910 the colony again was renamed to French Equatorial Africa (Afrique Equatoriale Fran\u00e7aise or AEF), this time it also included Chad and Oubangui-Chari, nowadays the Central African Republic. Congo-Brazzaville gained autonomy on the November 28, 1958 and independence from France on the August 15, 1960. The capital of the AEF was Brazzaville, for Middle Congo the capital was Pointe Noire.\nThe Federation quickly became centered on Middle Congo due to the presence of the Governor-General in Brazzaville, so while each colony was theoretically fairly autonomous the centralization of powers meant that the Governor-General gave preferential treatment to the region in which he resided. Education, health services, judicial systems, and public works were all under the control of Brazzaville-based authorities who could overrule the territorial governors. Middle Congo was provided with the only deep-water port in the Federation at Pointe Noire as well as the railway. Brazzaville's public buildings, schools, law courts, trading firms, telecommunications and medical services soon surpassed by far their counterparts elsewhere in the Federation. Peoples from more marginal areas of AEF such as Chad were forced to work in Middle Congo, and funds were funneled primarily into the region, causing a great sense of resentment. Ultimately the massive expansion of Middle Congo's civil service contributed to a drain of the rural population into the cities, and created an entrenched bureaucracy and trade union network that would prove to be a burden on state stability following independence.\nThe French government continued to rule through a Governor-General until the elections of 1957 when a High Commissioner of the R\u00e9publique was established. The total population in 1950 for the whole AEF was 4,143,922, with only around 15,000 non-Africans present.\n1940s and Reforms.\nWorld War II.\nAs with the arrival of the Portuguese events in Europe again had a deep impact on the affairs of Congo-Brazzaville, and Africa in general. Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain surrendered to Germany on 22 June 1940, and this gave birth to the so-called Vichy France republic. P\u00e9tain had earlier refused to continue the war against Germany from African territory alongside Great Britain. With the help of a handful of local French administrators and officers, the British, and the Belgian government in exile Charles de Gaulle's Free French won over large parts of the French Empire. Politicians such as Ren\u00e9 Pleven, who later became prime minister, and officers as General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, Lieutenant Ren\u00e9 Amiot, Captain Raymond Delange, Colonel Edgar De Larminat and Adolphe Sic\u00e9 helped him to gain control of the AEF territory. In three days troops loyal to De Gaulle took control of Chad (26 August 1940), Cameroon (27 August) and of Middle Congo (the 28th of August). Brazzaville hereby became the capital of the so-called Free French in Africa, ruled in theory by a Conseil de d\u00e9fense de l'Empire set up by De Gaulle on 27 October 1940. The FEA centred on Middle Congo went overnight from a backwater to a linchpin of Free French forces in Africa. Point Noire in particular became a vital transit area and base for bringing supplies, soldiers and labor from the interior to the coast and back again. The intense use of the railway led to the rise of a new urban labor class and improved the infrastructure of the colony.\nFelix Ebou\u00e9.\nIn this revolt the then-governor of Chad F\u00e9lix Ebou\u00e9 played a key role. Because of this and his earlier support for De Gaulle he became Governor-General of the Afrique Equatoriale Fran\u00e7aise (AEF) in 1940, the first non-white to achieve this position in French colonial history. Born in 1884 in French Guiana this descendant of African slaves was a key figure together with Ren\u00e9 Pleven in the organization by the De Gaulle government of the Brazzaville Conference of 1944, which took place between January 30 and February 8, 1944 and which set out the new direction of French colonial policies after World War II. Many of these were policies already put forward by Ebou\u00e9 in his 1941 book entitled \"La nouvelle politique coloniale de l'A.E.F.\" This conference led to the abolition of forced labor and the code de l'indig\u00e9nat, which had made the political and social activities of the indigenous people illegal. This in turn led to the new French constitution of the Fourth Republic approved on 27 October 1946 and the election of the first Equatorial African members of Parliament in Paris. For Ebou\u00e9 and the new French government the people in the colonies were officially part of the French empire and had a new series of rights, including freedom of association, a uniform code of law, and elective institutions at three levels. A severely weakened France, under pressure from the US, had hardly any option but to change its colonial policies.\nRise of nationalism.\nGovernor General Felix Ebou\u00e9 had a carrot and stick approach to local Congolese grievances. While allowing certain freedoms he brutally repressed any activities deemed dangerous to French colonial control. The case of the Congolese trade unionist Andr\u00e9 Matsoua (Matswa) shows his tough approach to political dissent.\nAndr\u00e9 Matsoua can be seen as the father of modern Congolese nationalism. His rise shows how, in spite of the Code de l'Indig\u00e9nat and the brutal repression, Africans in French colonies were able to set up resistance movements to colonial rule. Local schools run by French missionaries, as elsewhere in Africa formed the basis of this rise of African nationalism. Andr\u00e9 Matsoua got his education and contacts with European thinking through the church. Born in 1899 in Mandzakala he joined the French customs administration in Brazzaville in 1919 and soon after left for France where he joined the French army to fight in Morocco. He returned home as a non-commissioned officer. In 1926 he in Paris formed the Association des Originaires de l'A.E.F. with the purpose of helping people from his region living in France. For this he got support from some sections of French society as the French Communist Party and elements within the Free Masonry movement.\nWhen in 1929 his group also became active in Congo itself and demanded an end to the Code de l'Indig\u00e9nat, things changed. In 1929 the French dissolved Matsoua's association and he together with some of his friends were jailed and sent in exile to Chad, leading to riots and a campaign of disobedience against the French administration lasting many years. He however escaped to France in 1935 where under a new identity he continued his political work. Showing his loyalty to France, in spite of the harsh repression, he joined the French army to fighting the German invasion in 1940. Wounded, he was rearrested, and sent back to Brazzaville where on 8 February 1941 he was sentenced under Felix Ebou\u00e9 to work in labor camps for the rest of his life. He died under unclear circumstances in prison on 13 January 1942. His supporters maintain that he was murdered, and began the Matsouanist movement, active chiefly among the Lari, even after independence.\nRoad to independence.\nThe Congo went in the space of fourteen years from having no political freedom whatsoever to complete independence, making the rise of legitimate democratic institutions respected by a substantial proportion of the population near-impossible. Original democratic institutions were modeled on those of France, but multiple Africanising constitutions were instituted and then set aside in 1961, 1963, 1968, 1973 and 1992. As a heterogeneous state, political parties very quickly began to focus solely on ethnic and regionalist groupings. For example, between 1946 and 1956 the Lari, an important community in the country, refused to take part in elections, with many under the belief that their deceased messianic leader Andr\u00e9 Matsoua would return. The absence of the Bakongo from early politics led to a power vacuum into which the Vili and Mbochi moved until independence.\nThe most prominent Congolese politician until 1956 was Jean-F\u00e9lix Tchicaya, born in Libreville on 9 November 1903 and a member of the royal family of the Kingdom of Loango. Together with Ivorian leader F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny and others, he formed the Rassemblement D\u00e9mocratique Africain (RDA) in 1946 and, in 1947, the Parti Progressiste Africain. On 21 November 1945, Tchicaya became one of the first African leaders elected to the French parliament, giving him great prestige in his native country.\nAlthough Tchicaya was on the left of the French political spectrum, he never strongly questioned French colonial rule. This resulted in a loss of influence as the Congo prepared for independence, influenced by nationalist anti-colonial leaders as Kwame Nkrumah from Ghana and Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser. Only by aligning himself with his erstwhile enemy, the more radical Jacques Opangault in the parliamentary elections of March 31, 1957 could he continue to play a leading role in Congolese political life.\nPrior to independence, the French establishment and Catholic Church feared Opangault's radicalism and favored the rise of Fulbert Youlou, a former priest. The defection of Georges Yambot from the African Socialist Movement (MSA) to Youlou's Union D\u00e9mocratique pour la D\u00e9fense d'Int\u00e9r\u00eats Africains (UDDIA) helped Youlou become prime minister in 1958. This led to the establishment of the Republic of the Congo on 28 November 1958 (with Brazzaville replacing Point Noire as the country's capital).\nOn 16 February 1959, a revolt organized by Opangault and his MSA erupted in clashes along tribal lines between Southerners, supporting Youlou, and people from the North, loyal to the MSA. The riots were suppressed by French army and Opangault was arrested. In total about 200 people died. Prime Minister Youlou then held the elections for which Opangault had previously asked in vain. After the May 9 arrest of several politicians, including veteran politician Simon Kikhounga Ngot, because of an alleged communist plot, parliamentary elections were convincingly won by Youlou. On 12 July 1960 France agreed to Congo becoming fully independent. On 15 August 1960, the Republic of the Congo became an independent country and Fulbert Youlou became its first President.\nIn November that year, Youlou released Opangault, Ngot and other adversaries, as part of an amnesty. In return both politicians, as well as Germain Bicoumat, joined Youlou's government and received ministerial posts, effectively destroying any organized political opposition.\nOil.\nShortly before gaining independence an event occurred that in the years to come would have deep influence on the country and its relations with the outside world, mainly France. Although French geologists had already established for certain in 1926 the presence of oil and gas in the country, in 1957 near Pointe Indienne the French Societ\u00e9 des P\u00e9troles de l'Afrique Equatoriale Fran\u00e7aises (SPAEF) found oil and gas reserves offshore in sufficient exploitable quantities. Only then did France start exploiting these reserves. The reason was that in Algeria a war of independence was fought, and the French were losing. Until then Algeria was the main source of oil and gas destined for the French market. To remain independent of the American and British oil majors France had to look elsewhere for its supply. For some the discovery of oil off the Congolese coast was a blessing. For the majority of the local population it rather proved to be a curse as the International Monetary Fund in its yearly reports on the country a few years ago sadly observed. By the 1970s oil was Congo's largest export, however global market-price vicissitudes together with Congo's tendency to rely on overly optimistic projections of future revenues for the political purposes of sustaining a large civil service and a highly inefficient State sector, have regularly caused serious fiscal imbalances. Development of the sector has been hampered by the nation's traditionally powerful trade unionist movement, political uncertainties, as well as the costs of exploitation in a country with poor transport infrastructure.\nLes Trois Glorieuses and the 1968 Coup d'\u00e9tat.\nAs Brazzaville had been the capital of the large federation of French Equatorial Africa, it had an important workforce and many trade unions. Further radicalization elsewhere in Africa as a result of the decolonization led to revolt against the dictatorial rule of Youlou. Following Youlou's 6 August 1963 announcement of the formation of a one-party state with only one legal trade union, trade unions started their revolt on 13 August. Youlou's palace was besieged in August by angry workers and the French refused to intervene militarily, and he was forced to resign. This uprising is known as Les Trois Glorieuses (the Three Glorious Days), named after the French July Revolution against King Charles X in 1830. Fulbert Youlou and his main supporters were arrested by the military and ceased to play any further role in Congolese political life.\nThe Congolese military took charge of the country briefly and installed a civilian provisional government headed by Alphonse Massamba-D\u00e9bat. Under the 1963 constitution, Massamba-D\u00e9bat was elected president for a five-year term and named Pascal Lissouba to serve as prime minister.\nPresident Massamba-D\u00e9bat's term in office was characterized by a shift to the political left which included nationalizations and increased political ties to the USSR and communist China. Massamba-D\u00e9bat's government ended in August 1968 when Captain Marien Ngouabi and other army officers toppled the government in a bloodless coup. After a period of consolidation under the newly formed National Revolutionary Council, Ngouabi assumed the presidency on December 31, 1968. One year later, President Ngouabi proclaimed the People's Republic of the Congo, Africa's first People's Republic and announced the decision of the National Revolutionary Movement to change its name to the Congolese Party of Labour (PCT).\nAssassination of Ngouabi and election of Sassou-Nguesso.\nOn March 18, 1977, President Ngouabi was assassinated. A number of people were accused of shooting Ngouabi were tried and some of them executed, including former President Alphonse Massemba-D\u00e9bat and a fisherman, Chanrithy Moukoko, but there was little evidence to prove their involvement, and the motive behind the assassination remains unclear.\nAn 11-member Military Committee of the Party (CMP) was named to head an interim government with Col. (later Gen.) Joachim Yhombi-Opango to serve as President of the Republic. After two years in power, Yhombi-Opango was accused of corruption and deviation from party directives, and removed from office on February 5, 1979, by the Central Committee of the PCT, which then simultaneously designated Vice President and Defense Minister Col. Denis Sassou-Nguesso as interim President.\nThe Central Committee directed Sassou-Nguesso to take charge of preparations for the Third Extraordinary Congress of the PCT, which proceeded to elect him President of the Central Committee and President of the Republic. Under a congressional resolution, Yhombi-Opango was stripped of all powers, rank, and possessions and placed under arrest to await trial for high treason. He was released from house arrest in late 1984 and ordered back to his native village of Owando.\nDemocracy and civil war.\nAfter decades of turbulent politics bolstered by Marxist-Leninist rhetoric, and with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Congolese gradually moderated their economic and political views to the point that, in 1992, Congo completed a transition to multi-party democracy. Ending a long history of one-party Marxist rule, a specific agenda for this transition was laid out during Congo's national conference of 1991 and culminated in August 1992 with multi-party parliamentary and presidential elections. Sassou Nguesso conceded defeat and Congo's new president, Professor Pascal Lissouba, was inaugurated on August 31, 1992.\nCongolese democracy experienced severe trials in 1993 and early 1994. The President dissolved the National Assembly in November 1992, calling for new elections in May 1993. The results of those elections were disputed, touching off violent civil unrest in June and again in November. In February 1994 the decisions of an international board of arbiters were accepted by all parties, and the risk of large-scale insurrection subsided.\nLissouba lost favour with the French government early in his presidency by asking the American-owned Occidental Petroleum company to provide financial support for his Government in exchange for promises of future oil production. As the French company Elf Aquitaine (which reaped much of its profits from the Republic of the Congo) had only just recently opened a large deep-water oil platform off the coast of Pointe-Noire, Mr. Lissouba was pressured by the French into canceling all contracts with Occidental Petroleum, but suspicions of Lissouba remained.\nHowever, Congo's democratic progress derailed in 1997. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached, tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso camps mounted. In May, a visit by Sassou Nguesso to Owando, Joachim Yhombi-Opango's political stronghold, led to the outbreak of violence between their supporters. On June 5, 1997, government forces surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home in the Mpila section of Brazzaville, attempting to arrest two men, Pierre Aboya and Engobo Bonaventure, who had been implicated in the earlier violence. Fighting broke out between the government forces and Sassou Nguesso's fighters, called Cobras, igniting a 4-month conflict that destroyed or damaged much of Brazzaville.\nAngola supported Sassou Nguesso with about 1,000 Angolan tanks, troops. Support by the sympathetic French government further bolstered Sassou Nguesso's rebels.\nTogether these forces took Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire in the morning of October 16. Lissouba fled the capital while his soldiers surrendered and citizens began looting. Yhombi-Opango supported Lissouba during the war, serving as leader of the Presidential Majority, and after Sassou Nguesso's victory he fled into exile in Ivory Coast and France. Soon thereafter, Sassou Nguesso declared himself President and named a 33-member government.\nIn January 1998 the Sassou Nguesso regime held a National Forum for Reconciliation to determine the nature and duration of the transition period. The Forum, tightly controlled by the government, decided elections should be held in about three years, elected a transition advisory legislature, and announced that a constitutional convention will finalize a draft constitution. However, the eruption in late 1998 of fighting between Sassou Nguesso's government forces and an armed opposition disrupted the transitional return to democracy. This new violence also closed the economically vital Congo-Ocean Railway, caused great destruction and loss of life in southern Brazzaville and in the Pool, Bouenza, and Niari regions, and displaced hundreds of thousands of persons.\nIn November and December 1999, the government signed agreements with representatives of many, though not all, of the rebel groups. The December accord, mediated by President Omar Bongo of Gabon, called for follow-on, inclusive political negotiations between the government and the opposition.\nSassou's second presidency.\nSassou won elections in 2002 with an implausible 90% or so of the votes. His two main rivals, Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas, were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival, Andr\u00e9 Milongo, boycotted the elections and withdrew from the race due to, among other reasons, perceived voter fraud on the part of Sassou. A new constitution was agreed upon in January 2002, granting the president new powers and extending his term to seven years as well as introducing a new bicameral assembly. On December 30, twenty opposition political parties issued a statement through spokesman Chistope Ngokaka, saying Sassou's government had purchased \"weapons and military craft... under contracts signed between the officials in Brazzaville and the government in Beijing.\" Sassou was re-elected for a further seven-year term at the next presidential election in July 2009.\nIn 2015, Sassou changed the constitution to run in the 2016 election. He won the election believed by many to be fraudulent. After violent protests in the capital, Sassou attacked the Pool region, where the Ninja rebels of the civil war used to be based, in what was believed to be a distraction. This led to a revival of the Ninja rebels who launched attacks against the army in April 2016, leading 80,000 people to flee their homes. A ceasefire deal was signed in December 2017.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thus, Congo is one of the most urbanized countries in Africa, with 85% of its total population living in a few urban areas, namely in Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, or one of the small cities or villages lining the railway which connects the two cities. In rural areas, industrial and commercial activity has declined rapidly in recent years, leaving rural economies dependent on the government for support and subsistence. Before the 1997 civil war, about 15,000 Europeans and other non-Africans lived in Congo, most of whom were French. Presently, only about 9,500 remain.

Executive power is exercised by the President and the Government. Recently, following the approval of a new Constitution after a referendum in 2015, Congo became a semi-presidential republic after the creation of the post of prime minister who is responsible to the legislature, as well is the cabinet of the former. Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the two chambers of parliament.\nMany countries have a semi-presidential republic and elections, examples of other countries than the Republic of the Congo include France, Peru, and Croatia. However, having semi-presidential republic does not necessarily mean that a country is a democracy. A central, but not the only, component of democracy is free and fair elections, where the population can hold accountable those in power. Data collected from Freedom House, shows that the country scored 2/40 on political rights, and 15/60 on civil liberties; however, more specifically, the country scored 0/4 on whether there were free and fair elections.\nIn terms of civil, political, and human rights, another tenant of democracy, another non-governmental organization, BTI, reports that the rule of law \u201conly exists on paper\u201d in the country; this follows suit from a report from Amnesty International, which documents how Alexandre Ibacka Dzabana and Ras le Bol, both human rights leaders in the country were arrested the day after they announced they would hold a press conference to denounce election irregularities that occurred.\nLegislative branch.\nThe Parliament (\"Parlement\") has two chambers. The National Assembly (\"Assembl\u00e9e Nationale\") elects its members to five-year terms in single-seat constituencies. The members of the Senate (\"S\u00e9nat\") are elected for a six-year term by district, local and regional councils. \nThe Republic of Congo is a one party dominant state with the Congolese Labour Party in power.

Government spending is characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. Petroleum has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports. Nowadays the Republic of the Congo is increasingly converting natural gas to electricity rather than burning it, greatly improving energy prospects.\nHistorical overview.\nEarlier in the 1990s, Congo's major employer was the state bureaucracy, which had a payroll of 80,000, which is enormous for a country of Congo's size. The World Bank and other international financial institutions pressured Congo to institute sweeping civil service reforms to reduce the size of the state bureaucracy and pare back a civil service payroll that amounted to more than 20% of GDP in 1993. The effort to cut back began in 1994 with a 50% devaluation that cut the payroll in half in dollar terms and by a mid-year reduction of nearly 8,000 in civil service employment and resulted in inflation of 61%. Inflation has since subsided.\nBetween 1994 and 1996, the Congolese economy underwent a difficult transition. The prospects for building the foundation of a healthy economy, however, were better than at any time in the previous 15 years. Congo took a number of measures to liberalize its economy, including reforming the tax, investment, labor, and hydrocarbon codes. Planned privatizations of key parastatals, primarily telecommunications and transportation monopolies, were launched to help improve a dilapidated and unreliable infrastructure. To build on the momentum achieved during the two-year period, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a three-year ESAF economic program in June 1996.\nBy the end of 1996, Congo had made substantial progress in various areas targeted for reform. It made significant strides toward macroeconomic stabilization through improving public finances and restructuring external debt. This change was accompanied by improvements in the structure of expenditures, with a reduction in personnel expenditures. Further, Congo benefited from debt restructuring from a Paris Club agreement in July 1996.\nThis reform program came to a halt, however, in early June 1997 when war broke out. Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who returned to power when the war ended in October 1997, publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions. However, economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices in 1998, which worsened the Republic of the Congo's budget deficit. A second blow was the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998.\nCongo's economic prospects remain largely dependent on the country's ability to establish political stability and democratic rule. The World Bank is considering Congo for post-conflict assistance. Priorities will be in reconstruction, basic services, infrastructure, and utilities.\nCongo and the United States ratified a bilateral investment treaty designed to facilitate and protect foreign investment. The country also adopted a new investment code intended to attract foreign capital. Despite this, Congo's investment climate is not considered favorable, offering few meaningful incentives. High costs for labor, energy, raw materials, and transportation; a restrictive labor code; low productivity and high production costs; militant labor unions; and an inadequate transportation infrastructure are among the factors discouraging investment. The recent political instability, war damage, and looting also undermined investor confidence. As a result, Congo has little American investment outside of the oil sector.\nIn recent years, the Republic's economic growth has slowed because of the 2014\u20132016 fall in oil prices.\nPetroleum.\nThe Congo's growing petroleum sector is by far the country's major revenue earner. In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. However, the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings, contributing to the government's shortage of revenues. The Congolese oil sector is dominated by the French parastatal oil company Total, which accounts for 70% of the country's annual oil production. In second position is the Italian oil firm \u0395ni. Chevron, independent CMS Nomeco, and ExxonMobil are among the American companies active in petroleum exploration or production. Following recent discoveries and oil fields currently under development, Congo's oil production is expected to continue to rise significantly in the next few years.\nCongo plans to use the auction to grow its small oil industry, which only produces about 25,000 barrels a day from a project in the west of the country run by France\u2019s Perenco SA. The process has drawn criticism from environmental groups for offering blocks that overlap with Congo\u2019s peatlands, which are among the world\u2019s most important carbon sinks. https://\nStatistics.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132024.\nGDP:\npurchasing power parity \u2013 $18.48 billion (2011 est.)\nGDP \u2013 real growth rate:\n4.5% (2011 est.)\nGDP \u2013 per capita:\npurchasing power parity \u2013 $4,600 (2011 est.)\nGDP \u2013 composition by sector:\n&lt;br&gt;\"agriculture:\"\n4.2% (2011 est.)\n&lt;br&gt;\"industry:\"\n70.7% (2011 est.)\n&lt;br&gt;\"services:\"\n25.1% (2011 est.)\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n&lt;br&gt;\"lowest 10%:\"\n2.1% (2005)\n&lt;br&gt;\"highest 10%:\"\n37.1% (2005)\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\n6% (2011 est.)\nLabor force:\n1.514 million (2007)\nEase of Doing Business Rank:\n181st\nBudget:\n&lt;br&gt;\"revenues:\"\n$6.938 billion (2011 est.)\n&lt;br&gt;\"expenditures:\"\n$3.535 billion (2011 est.)\nIndustries:\npetroleum extraction, cement, lumber, brewing, sugar, palm oil, soap, flour, cigarettes\nIndustrial production growth rate:\n12% (2010 est.)\nElectricity \u2013 production:\n452 million kWh (2008 est.)\nElectricity \u2013 consumption:\n534 million kWh (2008 est.)\nElectricity \u2013 exports:\n0 kWh (2009 est.)\nElectricity \u2013 imports:\n436 million kWh (2008 est.)\nAgriculture \u2013 products:\ncassava (tapioca), sugar, rice, maize, peanuts, vegetables, coffee, cocoa, forest products\nExports:\n$12.38 billion (2011 est.)\nExports \u2013 commodities:\npetroleum, lumber, plywood, sugar, Cocoa bean, coffee, diamonds\nExports \u2013 partners:\nChina 37.9%, United States 20%, Australia 6.2%, France 6.0%, Spain 4.8%, Italy 4.3%, Netherlands 4.3% (2011)\nImports:\n$4.917 billion (2011 est.)\nImports \u2013 commodities:\ncapital equipment, construction materials, foodstuffs\nImports \u2013 partners:\nFrance 17.3%, China 12.6%, India 9.5%, Italy 7.5%, Brazil 7.3%, United States 5.8% (2011)\nDebt \u2013 external:\n$4.955 billion (2011 est.)\nCurrency:\n1 Communaute Financiere Africaine franc (CFAF) = 100 centimes\nFiscal year:\ncalendar year\nPublic debt as percentage of GDP:\n61.2% (2017)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights. The law makes certain types of speech illegal, including incitement of ethnic hatred, violence, or civil war.\nThe constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions.

Post-colonial administrations in practice relied on implicit bans and seize of images distributed by Congolese revolutionaries and oppositions. Restrictive censorship was especially uncompromising towards the foreign press, which was meticulously scrutinized during legislation creation. Order number 2294 prohibits the circulation of publishings by foreign origins including pamphlets, journal writings, or any association as such. Occasional success in overcoming newspaper censorship can be seen in the case of La Semaine Africaine, which consistently expresses notable messages representative of the \u2018revolutionary press\u2019. Unsuccessful efforts, however, are more common in Congo print, as seen by the failures of The Voice of the Congolese Revolution, the weekly Basali-ba-Kongo and Dipanda, and the National Youth Movement for the Revolution.\nIntentional Shutdowns.\nThe Congolese government performed a series of intentional internet shutdowns. The first was conducted in December 2011 and lasted approximately 25 days. During the 25 days, Short Message Service otherwise known as SMS was the only one affected by the shutdown. According to an article by CIPESA, \"One of the reasons cited by the government for blocking communication was to prevent the spread of fake results over the internet before the electoral commission announced official results\"\nUnlike the first shutdown the second intentional shutdown had a broader range of impact.The second intentional shutdown occurred in January 2015. The Congolese government directed telecommunication companies within the country to halt all its services. Not only was SMS affected, but the entire internet itself. This action by the government came on the eve of political protest on a proposed electoral bill.\nThe most recent government shutdown occurred on December 19, 2016. This was an important date as President Joseph Kabila was supposed to step down as head of state. In order to quell, political upheaval the Congolese government ordered telecom operators to block social media in the country.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They consist of the Congolese Army, the Congolese Air Force, the Congolese Navy, and the Congolese National Gendarmerie. The dissolution of French Equatorial Africa in 1958, and France's impending military withdrawal from the Congo in August 1960, provided the impetus for the formation of the FAC. The FAC and state paramilitary agencies are headed by an \"Armed Forces Chief of General Staff\", usually appointed by the President of the Republic of the Congo. Major General Guy Blanchard Oko\u00ef has served as chief of staff since 2012.\nHistory.\nThe Congolese military was created on January 16, 1961, and reflected the nature of the colonial security forces, which recruited among the country's northern ethnic groups and were staffed by junior Bakongo officers and a handful of French senior commissioned officers. President Alphonse Massamba-D\u00e9bat, who seized power in 1963, expelled all the French personnel and sidelined the military in favor of independent political militias, which were trained by Cuban troops. The militias and the Congo's civil defense corps were later integrated with the FAC as the \"Arm\u00e9e Nationale Populaire\".\nUnder the People's Republic of the Congo, the FAC was again reorganized, with Mbochi career soldiers making up the bulk of the new officer corps; its effectiveness and standards, however, were gradually eroded by draconian political purges throughout the 1970s. A second major setback occurred during the 1990s, when mass desertions led to many FAC officers and enlisted troops joining regional militias. The FAC was reformed for the third time after the Second Congo War, incorporating many former rebels and militia combatants.\nOn 5 February 2012, there were munitions explosions at a tank regiment (seemingly 'Regiment Blinde') barracks located in Brazzaville's fifth arrondissement, Ouenz\u00e9. Some 206 people were initially reported killed. There are five military barracks in the city, and after the explosion officials said the government had promised to move all munitions out of the capital.\nOrganization.\nThe army Is composed of: the 10th Pointe Noir Infantry Brigade in Military Defense Zone No. 1\nWhich contains: the - Command and Services Battalion - Combat Engineering Company - 101\u00b0 Motorized Infantry Battalion - 102\u00b0 Airborne Battalion -104\u00b0 Light Tank Battalion -106\u00b0 Jet Artillery Group -108\u00b0 Air Sol Artillery Group\nNavy.\nThe Navy has around 800 personnel. In October 2007, the US Navy provided some training to Congolese Navy personnel in Pointe-Noire, a port city that is the second largest settlement in the country.\nAs of 2016 it was commanded by Rear Admiral Andre Bouagnabea-Moundanza.\nAs of 2019 the Navy operates a single Mil Mi-14 helicopter.\nAir Force.\nAfter achieving independence from France in 1960, the Congolese Air Force (Force Aerienne Congolaise) was started with equipment such as the Douglas C-47s, Broussards and Bell 47Gs, these were followed by Nord Noratlas tactical transports and Sud Alouette helicopter. In the 1970s the air force switched to Soviet equipment. This included five Ilyushin IL-14 and six turboprop Antonov An-24 transports and an An-26 in return for providing bases for Cuban MiG-17 operations over Angola. These fighters and a few MiG-15UTI combat trainers were transferred to the FAC. In 1990 these fighter were replaced by 16 USSR supplied MiG-21MF/bis Fishbeds plus a couple of MiG-21US trainers. Together with a Soviet training mission which stayed until late 1991, during that time there were numerous accidents that involved both Soviet and Congolese personnel. After the Soviets left there was only limited funding for MiG operations and they were withdrawn. Six Mi-8 helicopters were delivered from Ukraine in mid-1997 before the Cobra rebel takeover.\nIn 1990, the Air Force was reformed into its present state. Most fighter aircraft it possessed were scrapped in 2001. France and China provided most training to the Air Force in recent times.\nSee the article Congolese Air Force for current inventory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin's screenplay adapts Jake LaMotta's 1970 memoir \"\". Robert De Niro stars as LaMotta, a former middleweight boxing champion whose turbulent personal life is beset by rage and jealousy. The supporting cast includes Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty, Theresa Saldana, Frank Vincent and Nicholas Colasanto (in his final film role).\nScorsese was initially reluctant to develop the project, although he eventually came to relate with LaMotta's story. Schrader rewrote Martin's first screenplay, and Scorsese and De Niro together made uncredited contributions thereafter. Pesci was a relatively unknown actor prior to the film, as was Moriarty, whom Pesci recommended. During principal photography, each of the boxing scenes was choreographed for a specific visual style, and De Niro gained approximately to portray LaMotta in his later years. Scorsese was exacting in the process of editing and mixing the film, expecting it to be his last major feature.\n\"Raging Bull\" premiered in New York City on November 14, 1980, and was released in theaters on December 19. The film had a lukewarm box office of $23.4 million against its $18 million budget, and received mixed reviews from critics. While De Niro's performance and the editing were widely acclaimed, its violent content received criticism. \"Raging Bull\" received a leading eight nominations at the 53rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won two: Best Actor for De Niro and Best Editing for Thelma Schoonmaker.\nIn the decades since its release, \"Raging Bull\" has come to be considered one of the greatest films ever made. In 1990, it became the first film to be selected in its first year of eligibility for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" In 2007 the American Film Institute ranked \"Raging Bull\" as the fourth-greatest American movie of all time.\nPlot.\nIn 1941, Jake LaMotta is a young up-and-coming middleweight boxer who suffers his first-ever loss to Jimmy Reeves after a controversial decision. Jake's brother Joey discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts. However, Jake repeatedly refuses the Mafia's help, wanting to win the championship on his own terms. Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie at a swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, despite his being already married and her being underage. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite Jake dominating Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson, who Joey feels won only because he was enlisting in the Army the following week.\nBy 1945, Jake marries Vickie, but he is controlling and domineering over her, and suspicious that she has feelings for other men. When she remarks off-hand that his next opponent Tony Janiro is good-looking, Jake flies into a rage, asking her what she meant by that. At the fight with Janiro, with Vickie looking on in horror, Jake makes it a point to brutally disfigure his opponent. At the Copacabana afterwards, Joey sees Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey confronts Vickie, who implies that she is dissatisfied in her marriage. Enraged, Joey viciously attacks Salvy in a fight that spills outside the club. Local mob boss Tommy Como orders them to patch up, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a shot at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive. Jake thus throws his next match against Billy Fox, but cannot convincingly fake his defeat. He is booed out of the building and shortly thereafter suspended from boxing on suspicion of throwing the fight. By 1949, he is reinstated and wins the middleweight championship title by defeating Marcel Cerdan.\nIn 1950, Jake becomes increasingly paranoid that Vickie is having an affair. He asks Joey if he has slept with her, which enrages Joey and causes him to leave. After Jake presses Vickie too about this, she sarcastically confesses that she had sex with Joey, Salvy, and Tommy. In a fit of rage, Jake storms into Joey's house and assaults him in front of his wife and children, and knocks Vickie unconscious as well. Vickie returns to their home and threatens to leave, but they reconcile. After defending his championship belt in a grueling 15-round bout against Laurent Dauthuille, he calls his brother to make amends. When Jake does not speak Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting him; Jake hangs up. Estranged from his brother, Jake's career declines, and he loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.\nBy 1956, an aging and overweight Jake has retired and moved with his family to Miami. After he stays out all night at the nightclub he owns, Vickie tells him that she wants a divorce, as well as full custody of their children. She also threatens to call the police if he comes anywhere near them. Soon after, Jake is arrested for admitting underage girls into his nightclub, and he unsuccessfully attempts to bribe his way out of his criminal case by pawning the jewels on his championship belt. In 1957, he is put in solitary confinement awaiting his sentence, where he questions his misfortune and cries in despair. After returning to New York City in 1958 after serving six months, he encounters Joey, whom he forcefully embraces; Joey half-heartedly reciprocates. \nIn 1964, Jake performs stand-up comedy at various clubs. Backstage before a show, LaMotta prepares for his performance by shadowboxing, quoting scenes from \"On the Waterfront\" and chanting \"I'm the boss\".\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta\nLaMotta's opponents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Johnny Barnes as Sugar Ray Robinson\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\n\"Raging Bull\" was initiated when Robert De Niro read the while he was on the set of \"The Godfather Part II\". Although disappointed by the book's writing style, De Niro became fascinated by the character of Jake LaMotta. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese on the set of \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\", with the hope that he would consider the project.\nScorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to direct the film, claiming that he had no idea what \"Raging Bull\" was about, although he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, \"A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp.\" His overall opinion of sport in general is, \"Anything with a ball, no good.\"\nThe book was passed on to Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said, \"The trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before\u2014a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him.\" De Niro had even shown the book to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed.\nAfter nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it, he saw how the boxing ring can be \"an allegory for whatever you do in life\", which for him paralleled moviemaking: \"You make movies, you're in the ring each time.\"&lt;ref name=\"Thompson pp.76/77\"&gt;Thompson, David and Christie, Ian, \"Scorsese on Scorsese\", pp.\u00a076/77.&lt;/ref&gt;\nPreparation for the film began when Scorsese shot some 8\u00a0mm color footage featuring De Niro boxing in a ring. One night, when the footage was being shown to De Niro, Michael Chapman and his friend and mentor, the British director Michael Powell, Powell pointed out that the color of the gloves at the time would have been only maroon, oxblood or black. It is one of the reasons that Scorsese chose to film \"Raging Bull\" in black and white. Other reasons were to distinguish the film from color films at the time, and to acknowledge the problem of fading color film stock\u2014an issue that Scorsese recognized. Scorsese attended two matches at Madison Square Garden to aid his research, picking up on minor but essential details, such as the blood sponge and subsequently, the blood on the ropes (which would be used in the film).\nAccording to the brief comments on the inlay card of the DVD, Scorsese was not a fan of sports nor boxing, which he describes as boring. When he saw the blood-soaked sponges being dipped in a bucket, he recalls thinking, \"And they call this sport\".\nMultiple titles were considered for \"Raging Bull\", including \"Prizefighter\" and \"The Jake La Motta Story\". Scorsese stated that \"Prizefighter\" was his favorite title, but did not select it, for he was afraid that people would think that the film was solely about boxing.\nScreenplay.\nUnder the guidance of Chartoff and Winkler, Mardik Martin was asked to start writing the screenplay. According to De Niro, under no circumstances would United Artists accept Martin's script. The story was based on the vision of journalist Pete Hamill of a 1930s and 1940s style, when boxing was known as \"the great dark prince of sports\". De Niro, however, was unimpressed when he finished reading the first draft.\n\"Taxi Driver\" screenwriter Paul Schrader was swiftly brought in to rewrite the script around August 1978. Some of the changes that Schrader made to the script include a rewrite of the scene with the undercooked steak, and the inclusion of LaMotta seen masturbating in a Florida cell.\nThe character of LaMotta's brother Joey was finally added, previously absent from Martin's script. United Artists saw a massive improvement on the quality of the script. However, its chief executives Steven Bach and David Field met with Scorsese, De Niro and producer Irwin Winkler in November 1978 to say that they were worried that the content would be X-rated material and have no chance of finding an audience.\nAccording to Scorsese, the script was left to him and De Niro, and they spent two-and-a-half weeks on the island of Saint Martin extensively re-building the content of the film. The most significant change would be the scene in which LaMotta fixes his television and accuses his wife of having an affair.\nOther changes included the removal of Jake and Joey's father, the reduction of organized crime's role in the story, and a major rewrite of LaMotta's fight with Tony Janiro. They were also responsible for the end sequence in which LaMotta is alone in his dressing room, quoting \"I could have been a contender\" from \"On the Waterfront\". An extract of \"Richard III\" had been considered, but Michael Powell thought that it would be a bad decision within the context of an American film. According to Steven Bach, the first two screenwriters (Martin and Schrader) would receive credit, but since there was no payment to the writer's guild on the script, De Niro and Scorsese's work remained uncredited.\nCasting.\nOne of Scorsese's trademarks was casting many actors and actresses new to the profession. De Niro, who was already committed to play Jake LaMotta, began to help Scorsese track down unfamiliar names to play his on-screen brother Joey and wife Vikki. The role of Joey LaMotta was the first to be cast. De Niro was watching a low-budget television film called \"The Death Collector\" when he saw the part of a young career criminal played by a relatively-unknown Joe Pesci as an ideal candidate. Prior to receiving a call from De Niro and Scorsese for the proposal to star in the film, Pesci had not worked in film for four years and was working at an Italian restaurant in New Jersey.\nThe role of Vikki (spelled \"Vickie\" in the final film), Jake's second wife, had interest across the board, but it was Pesci who suggested the unknown Cathy Moriarty from a picture that he saw at a New Jersey disco. Both De Niro and Scorsese believed that Moriarty, at 18 years old, could portray the role after meeting with her on several occasions and noticing her husky voice and physical maturity. The duo had to prove to the Screen Actors Guild that she was right for the role when Cis Corman showed 10 comparing pictures of Moriarty and the real Vikki LaMotta for proof that she had a resemblance.\nMoriarty was asked to take a screen test, which she managed\u2014partly aided by some improvised lines from De Niro\u2014after some confusion wondering why the crew was filming her take. Joe Pesci also persuaded his former show-biz pal and co-star in \"The Death Collector\", Frank Vincent, to audition for the role of Salvy Batts. Following a successful audition and screen test, Vincent received the call to say that he had received the part.&lt;ref name=\"Evans pp.65/66\"&gt;Evans, Mike, \"The Making of Raging Bull\", pp.\u00a065/66.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Scorsese, the director's father, made his film debut as Tommy Como's cousin Charlie.\nWhile in the midst of practicing a Bronx accent and preparing for his role, De Niro met with both LaMotta and his ex-wife Vikki on separate occasions. Vikki, who lived in Florida, told stories about her life with her former husband, and showed old home movies (that later inspired a similar sequence to be done for the film).\nJake LaMotta, on the other hand, served as his trainer, accompanied by Al Silvani as coach at the Gramercy club in New York City, getting him into shape. The actor found that boxing came naturally to him; he entered as a middleweight boxer, winning two of his three fights in a Brooklyn ring dubbed \"young LaMotta\" by the commentator. According to Jake LaMotta, De Niro was one of the top 20 best middleweight boxers of all time.\nPrincipal photography.\nAccording to the sound mixer, Michael Evje, the film began shooting at the Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium on April 16, 1979. Grips hung huge curtains of black duvetyne on all four sides of the ring area to contain the artificial smoke used extensively for visual effect.\nOn May 7, the production moved to the Culver City studio, Stage 3, and filmed there until the middle of June. Scorsese made it clear during filming that he did not appreciate the traditional way of showing fights from the spectators' view. He insisted that one camera operated by the Director of Photography, Michael Chapman, would be placed inside of the ring, as he would play the role of an opponent keeping out of the way of other fighters, so that viewers could see the emotions of the fighters, including those of Jake.\nThe precise moves of the boxers were to be done as dance routines from the information of a book about dance instructors in the mode of Arthur Murray. A punching bag in the middle of the ring was used by De Niro between takes before he aggressively came straight on to do the next scene. The initial five-week schedule for the shooting of the boxing scenes took longer than expected, putting Scorsese under pressure.\nAccording to Scorsese, production of the film was closed for nearly four months with the entire crew being paid, so that De Niro could go on a binge-eating trip around northern Italy and France. When he arrived in the United States, his weight had increased from 145 to 215\u00a0pounds (66 to 97\u00a0kg). The scenes with the heftier Jake LaMotta\u2014which include announcing his retirement from boxing and LaMotta in a Florida cell\u2014were completed seven-to-eight weeks later when approaching Christmas 1979, so as not to aggravate the health issues that were affecting De Niro's posture, breathing and talking.\nAccording to Evje, Jake's nightclub sequence was filmed in a closed San Pedro club on December 3. The jail cell head-banging scene was shot on a constructed set, with De Niro asking for minimal crew to be present. There was not even a boom operator present.\nThe final sequence, in which Jake LaMotta is in front of his mirror, was filmed on the last day of shooting, requiring 19 takes, with only the 13th being used for the film. Scorsese wanted to have an atmosphere that would be so cold that the words would have an impact as he tries to come to terms with his relationship with his brother.\nPost-production.\nThe editing of \"Raging Bull\" began when production was temporarily put on hold and was completed in 1980. Scorsese worked with the editor Thelma Schoonmaker to achieve a final cut of the film. Their main decision was to abandon Schrader's idea of LaMotta's nightclub act interweaving with the flashback of his youth, and instead followed the lines of a single flashback, in which only scenes of LaMotta practicing his stand-up would remain bookending the film.\nA sound mix arranged by Frank Warner was a delicate process that took six months. According to Scorsese, the sound on \"Raging Bull\" was difficult because each punch, camera shot and flash bulb would be different. Also, there was the issue of trying to balance the quality between scenes featuring dialogue and those involving boxing (which were done in Dolby Stereo). \"Raging Bull\" went through a test screening in front of a small audience including the chief executives of United Artists, Steven Bach and Andy Albeck. The screening was shown at the M-G-M screening room in New York in July 1980. Albeck praised Scorsese by calling him a \"true artist\".\nAccording to the producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, matters were made worse when United Artists decided not to distribute the film but no other studios were interested when they attempted to sell the rights. Scorsese made no secret that \"Raging Bull\" would be his \"Hollywood swan song\" and he took unusual care of its rights during post-production. Scorsese threatened to remove his credit from the film if he was not allowed to sort a reel that obscured the name of a whisky brand (Cutty Sark) that was heard in a scene. The work was completed four days shy of the premiere.\nIn 2012, \"Raging Bull\" was voted by the Motion Picture Editors Guild as the best-edited film in history.\nCopyright litigation.\nPaula Petrella, heir to Frank Petrello, whose works were allegedly sources for the film, filed for copyright infringement in 2009 based on MGM's 1991 copyright renewal of the film. In 2014, the Supreme Court held, in \"Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.\", that Petrella's suit survived MGM's defense of \"laches\", the legal doctrine that protects defendants from unreasonable delays by potential plaintiffs. The case was remanded to lower courts, meaning that Petrella could receive a decision on the merits of her claim. MGM settled with Petrella in 2015.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe brew of violence and anger, combined with the lack of a proper advertising campaign, led to the film's lukewarm box-office intake of $23\u00a0million, compared to its $18\u00a0million budget. By the time it left theaters, it earned $10.1\u00a0million in theatrical rentals (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024). Scorsese became concerned for his future, and worried that producers and studios may refuse to finance his films. According to Box Office Mojo, the film grossed $23,383,987 in domestic theaters (equivalent to $ in 2024).\nCritical response.\nWhen it premiered in New York City on November 14, 1980, the release of \"Raging Bull\" was met with polarized reviews, but the film would receive widespread critical acclaim, and is widely regarded as one of Scorsese's best works.\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 9.00/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Arguably Martin Scorsese's and Robert De Niro's finest film, \"Raging Bull\" is often painful to watch, but it's a searing, powerful work about an unsympathetic hero.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, gave it a score of 90 out of 100, based on 28 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on a scale of A+ to F.\nJack Kroll of \"Newsweek\" called \"Raging Bull\" the \"best movie of the year\".\nCritic for \"The New Yorker\", Pauline Kael described the film not as a biographical film about a boxer, but as a \"biography of the \"genre\" of prize fighting\" further saying the film is \"tabloid grand opera\" and \"overripe, ready for canonization\" in which Scorsese puts his \"unmediated obsessions on the screen.\" \nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" said that Scorsese \"has made his most ambitious film as well as his finest\", and went on to praise Moriarty's debut performance, saying, \"Either she is one of the film finds of the decade or Mr. Scorsese is Svengali. Perhaps both.\"\n\"Time\" praised De Niro's performance because \"much of \"Raging Bull\" exists because of the possibilities it offers De Niro to display his own explosive art\".\nSteven Jenkins from the British Film Institute's (BFI) magazine \"Monthly Film Journal\" said that \"\"Raging Bull\" may prove to be Scorsese's finest achievement to date\".\nAccolades.\nThe Oscars were held the day after President Ronald Reagan was shot by John Hinckley, who did it as an attempt to impress Jodie Foster, who played a child prostitute in another of Scorsese's famous films, \"Taxi Driver\" (which also starred De Niro). Out of fear of being attacked, Scorsese went to the ceremony with FBI bodyguards disguised as guests who escorted him before the announcement of the Academy Award for Best Picture was made (the winner being Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\").\nThe Los Angeles Film Critics Association voted \"Raging Bull\" the best film of 1980, and De Niro best actor. The National Board of Review also voted De Niro best actor and Pesci best supporting actor. The Berlin International Film Festival chose \"Raging Bull\" to open the festival in 1981.\nThe 2012 Parajanov-Vartanov Institute Award honored screenwriter Mardik Martin \"for the mastery of his pen on iconic American films\" \"Mean Streets\" and \"Raging Bull\".\nLegacy.\nBy the end of the 1980s, \"Raging Bull\" had cemented its reputation as a modern classic. It was voted the best film of the 1980s in numerous critics' polls, and is regularly pointed to as both Scorsese's best film and one of the finest American films ever made. Several prominent critics, among them Roger Ebert, declared the film to be an instant classic and the consummation of Scorsese's earlier promise. Ebert proclaimed it the best film of the 1980s, and one of the ten greatest films of all time. The film has been deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1990.\n\"Raging Bull\" was listed by \"Time\" magazine as one of the \"All-TIME 100 Movies\". \"Variety\" magazine ranked the film number 39 on their list of the 50 greatest movies. \"Raging Bull\" is fifth on \"Entertainment Weekly's\" list of the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. The film tied with \"The Bicycle Thieves\" and \"Vertigo\" at number 6 on \"Sight &amp; Sound\"'s 2002 poll of the greatest movies. When \"Sight &amp; Sound\"'s directors' and critics' lists from that year are combined, \"Raging Bull\" gets the most votes of any movie that has been produced since 1975. In 2002, Film4 held a poll of the 100 Greatest Movies, on which \"Raging Bull\" was voted in at number 20. \"Halliwell's Film Guide\", a British film guide, placed \"Raging Bull\" seventh in a poll naming their selection for the \"Top 1,000 Movies\". \"TV Guide\" also included the film on their list of the 50 best movies. \"Movieline\" magazine included the film on its list of the 100 best movies. Leonard Maltin included \"Raging Bull\" on his \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\" list. \"Video Detective\" also included the film on its list of the top 100 movies of all time. Roger Ebert named \"Robert De Niro's transformation from sleek boxer to paunchy nightclub owner in \"Raging Bull\"\" as one of the \"100 Greatest Movie Moments\". The National Society of Film Critics ranked it #75 on their \"100 Essential Films\" list. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked it #6 on their list of the \"100 Maverick Movies in the Last 100 Years\".\nA 1997 readers poll conducted by the \"L.A. Daily News\" ranked the film #64 on a list of the greatest American movies. The Writers Guild of America named the film as the 76th best screenplay of all time. \"Raging Bull\" is #7 on \"Time Out Film Guide's\" \"Centenary Top 100\" list, and it also tied at #16 (with \"Lawrence of Arabia\") on their 1998 readers poll. In 2008, \"Empire\" magazine held a poll of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\", taking votes from 10,000 readers, 150 film makers, and 50 film critics in which \"Raging Bull\" was placed at number 11. It was also placed on a similar list of 1000 movies by \"The New York Times\". In 2010, \"Total Film\" selected the film as one of \"The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time\". FilmSite.org, a subsidiary of American Movie Classics, placed \"Raging Bull\" on their list of the 100 greatest movies. Additionally, Films101.com ranked the film as the 17th best movie of all time in a list of the 10,790 most notable.\nIn 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership. In the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" polls, it was ranked the 53rd-greatest film ever made in the critics' poll and 12th in the directors' poll. Contemporaries of Scorsese, like Francis Ford Coppola, have included it routinely in their lists for favorite films of all time. In 2015, \"Raging Bull\" ranked 29th on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.\nSoundtrack.\nMartin Scorsese decided to assemble a soundtrack made of music that was popular at the time using his personal collection of 78s. With the help of Robbie Robertson, the songs were carefully chosen so they would be the ones that a person would hear on the radio, at the pool or in bars and clubs which reflected the mood of that particular era. Some lyrics from songs would also be slipped into some dialogue. The Intermezzo from \"Cavalleria rusticana\" by Italian composer Pietro Mascagni would serve as the main theme to \"Raging Bull\" after a successful try-out by Scorsese and the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, over the film's opening titles. Two other Mascagni pieces were used in the film: the Barcarolle from \"Silvano\", and the Intermezzo (\"Ratcliff's Dream\") from \"Guglielmo Ratcliff\". A two-CD soundtrack was released in 2005, long after the film was released, because of earlier difficulties obtaining rights for many of the songs, which Scorsese selected from his childhood memories growing up in New York.\nDispute over sequel.\nIn 2006, \"Variety\" reported that Sunset Pictures was developing a combination sequel and prequel film entitled \"Raging Bull II: Continuing the Story of Jake LaMotta\", chronicling LaMotta's life before and after the events of the original film, as told in the memoir of the same name. Filming began on June 15, 2012, with William Forsythe as the older LaMotta and Mojean Aria as the younger version (before the events of the first film). The film, directed by Martin Guigui, also stars Joe Mantegna, Tom Sizemore, Penelope Ann Miller, Natasha Henstridge, Alicia Witt, Ray Wise, Harry Hamlin, and James Russo as Rocky Graziano. In July 2012, MGM, owners of United Artists, filed a lawsuit against LaMotta and the producers of the new film to block it from being released. MGM argued that they had the rights to make any authorized sequel to the original book, tracing their claim back to an agreement LaMotta and co-author Peter Savage made with Chartoff-Winkler, producers of the original film. MGM argued that the defendants were publicly claiming the film to be a sequel to the original film, which they said could \"tarnish\" the original film's reputation. In August 2012, the suit was settled, with producers of the new film retitling it \"The Bronx Bull\" and agreeing not to market it as a sequel to \"Raging Bull\". The film was released in 2016.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Romans conquered most of these territories in the time of the Republic, and it was ruled by emperors following Octavian's assumption of power in 27 BC. Over the 4th century AD, the empire split into western and eastern halves. The western empire collapsed in 476 AD, while the eastern empire endured until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.\nBy 100 BC, the city of Rome had expanded its rule from the Italian peninsula to most of the Mediterranean and beyond. However, it was severely destabilised by civil wars and political conflicts, which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power () and the new title of \"Augustus\", marking his accession as the first Roman emperor. The vast Roman territories were organized into senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates.\nThe first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (lit.\u2009'Roman Peace'). Rome reached its greatest territorial extent under Trajan (r.\u200998\u00a0\u2013\u00a0117\u00a0AD), but a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus (r.\u2009180\u00a0\u2013\u00a0192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a 49-year crisis that threatened its existence due to civil war, plagues and barbarian invasions. The Gallic and Palmyrene empires broke away from the state and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire, which was later reunified under Aurelian (r.\u2009270\u00a0\u2013\u00a0275). The civil wars ended with the victory of Diocletian (r.\u2009284\u00a0\u2013\u00a0305), who set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West. Constantine the Great (r.\u2009306\u00a0\u2013\u00a0337), the first Christian emperor, moved the imperial seat from Rome to Byzantium in 330, and renamed it Constantinople. The Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire. With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 by Odoacer, the Western Empire finally collapsed. The Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital, until the city's fall in 1453.\nDue to the Empire's extent and endurance, its institutions and culture had a lasting influence on the development of language, religion, art, architecture, literature, philosophy, law, and forms of government across its territories. Latin evolved into the Romance languages while Medieval Greek became the language of the East. The Empire's adoption of Christianity resulted in the formation of medieval Christendom. Roman and Greek art had a profound impact on the Italian Renaissance. Rome's architectural tradition served as the basis for Romanesque, Renaissance, and Neoclassical architecture, influencing Islamic architecture. The rediscovery of classical science and technology (which formed the basis for Islamic science) in medieval Europe contributed to the Scientific Renaissance and Scientific Revolution. Many modern legal systems, such as the Napoleonic Code, descend from Roman law. Rome's republican institutions have influenced the Italian city-state republics of the medieval period, the early United States, and modern democratic republics.\nHistory.\nTransition from Republic to Empire.\nRome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC. The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of self-ruled towns (with varying degrees of independence from the Senate) and provinces administered by military commanders. It was governed by annually elected magistrates (Roman consuls above all) in conjunction with the Senate. The 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors. The consuls' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of \"imperium\", meaning \"command\" (typically in a military sense). Occasionally, successful consuls or generals were given the honorary title \"imperator\" (commander); this is the origin of the word \"emperor\", since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors.\nRome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies, and civil wars from the late second century BC (see Crisis of the Roman Republic) while greatly extending its power beyond Italy. In 44 BC Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated by a faction that opposed his concentration of power. This faction was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by Mark Antony and Caesar's adopted son Octavian. Antony and Octavian divided the Roman world between them, but this did not last long. Octavian's forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate gave him the title \"Augustus\" (\"venerated\") and made him \"princeps\" (\"foremost\") with proconsular \"imperium\", thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history. Although the republic stood in name, Augustus had all meaningful authority. During his 40-year rule, a new constitutional order emerged so that, upon his death, Tiberius would succeed him as the new \"de facto\" monarch.\n\"Pax Romana\".\nThe 200 years that began with Augustus's rule are traditionally regarded as the \"Pax Romana\" (\"Roman Peace\"). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down \"mercilessly and swiftly\". The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs. The Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors\u2014Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero\u2014before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as the victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, followed by the Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty which produced the \"Five Good Emperors\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.\nAmong the so-called \u201cFive Good Emperors,\u201d Hadrian (r. 117\u2013138) is particularly noted for consolidating the empire\u2019s frontiers and embarking on ambitious building projects throughout the provinces. In Judaea, which had long been the center of Jewish national and religious life, his reign marked a decisive turning point. After earlier Jewish resistance to Roman rule, Hadrian visited the region in 129/130 CE and refounded Jerusalem as the Roman colony Aelia Capitolina, naming it after his family (Aelius) and the Capitoline Triad. The refoundation overlaid the destroyed Jewish city with a new Roman urban plan, and included the construction of a Temple to Jupiter on the site of the former Jewish Temple. Later tradition and archaeological evidence also indicate a Temple of Venus near the site of the Holy Sepulchre.\nHadrian\u2019s measures, combined with restrictions on Jewish practices, helped spark the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132\u2013135 CE). After crushing the uprising, Roman forces expelled most Jews from Jerusalem, barring their entry except on certain days, and rebuilt the city as a statement of imperial power and domination. Most scholars consider Hadrianic Aelia to have been unwalled, with free-standing gate complexes (such as the northern gate beneath today\u2019s Damascus Gate) rather than a continuous defensive circuit.\nTransition from classical to late antiquity.\nIn the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio, the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\", a comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the Empire's decline.\nIn 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. The Severan dynasty was tumultuous; an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution and, following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and plague. In defining historical epochs, this crisis sometimes marks the transition from Classical to Late Antiquity. Aurelian (r.\u2009270\u00a0\u2013\u00a0275) stabilised the empire militarily and Diocletian reorganised and restored much of it in 285. Diocletian's reign brought the empire's most concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity, the \"Great Persecution\".\nDiocletian divided the empire into four regions, each ruled by a separate tetrarch. Confident that he fixed the disorder plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, but the Tetrarchy collapsed shortly after. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the Eastern Empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the empire was divided along an east\u2013west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. Julian, who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 after making Christianity the state religion.\nFall in the West and survival in the East.\nThe Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century. The Romans fought off all invaders, most famously Attila, but the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself. Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer.\nOdoacer ended the Western Empire by declaring Zeno sole emperor and placing himself as Zeno's nominal subordinate. In reality, Italy was ruled by Odoacer alone. The Eastern Roman Empire, called the Byzantine Empire by later historians, continued until the reign of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Roman emperor. He died in battle in 1453 against Mehmed II and his Ottoman forces during the siege of Constantinople. Mehmed II adopted the title of \"caesar\" in an attempt to claim a connection to the former Empire. His claim was soon recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but not by European monarchs.\nGeography and demography.\nThe Roman Empire was one of the largest in history, with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Latin phrase \"imperium sine fine\" (\"empire without end\") expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In Virgil's \"Aeneid\", limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by Jupiter. This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century. In addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example cutting down entire forests.\nRoman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic, though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century, when Roman control in Europe, Africa, and Asia was strengthened. Under Augustus, a \"global map of the known world\" was displayed for the first time in public at Rome, coinciding with the creation of the most comprehensive political geography that survives from antiquity, the \"Geography\" of Strabo. When Augustus died, the account of his achievements (\"Res Gestae\") prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of the Empire. Geography alongside meticulous written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration.\nThe Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan (r.\u200998\u00a0\u2013\u00a0117), encompassing 5 million km2. The traditional population estimate of 55\u201360 million inhabitants accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world's total population and made it the most populous unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century. Recent demographic studies have argued for a population peak from 70 million to more than 100 million. Each of the three largest cities in the Empire\u2014Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch\u2014was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century.\nAs the historian Christopher Kelly described it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Then the empire stretched from Hadrian's Wall in drizzle-soaked northern England to the sun-baked banks of the Euphrates in Syria; from the great Rhine\u2013Danube river system, which snaked across the fertile, flat lands of Europe from the Low Countries to the Black Sea, to the rich plains of the North African coast and the luxuriant gash of the Nile Valley in Egypt. The empire completely circled the Mediterranean\u00a0... referred to by its conquerors as \"mare nostrum\"\u2014'our sea'.\nTrajan's successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (\"fines\") were marked, and the frontiers (\"limites\") patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort. In the eastern provinces, rural administration often relied on inscribed boundary stones to demarcate land and regulate taxation.\nLanguages.\nLatin and Greek were the main languages of the Empire, but the Empire was deliberately multilingual. Andrew Wallace-Hadrill says \"The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood\". At the start of the Empire, knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military, government, or law. Bilingual inscriptions indicate the everyday interpenetration of the two languages.\nLatin and Greek's mutual linguistic and cultural influence is a complex topic. Latin words incorporated into Greek were very common by the early imperial era, especially for military, administration, and trade and commerce matters. Greek grammar, literature, poetry and philosophy shaped Latin language and culture.\nThere was never a legal requirement for Latin in the Empire, but it represented a certain status. High standards of Latin, \"Latinitas\", started with the advent of Latin literature. Due to the flexible language policy of the Empire, a natural competition of language emerged that spurred \"Latinitas\", to defend Latin against the stronger cultural influence of Greek. Over time Latin usage was used to project power and a higher social class. Most of the emperors were bilingual but had a preference for Latin in the public sphere for political reasons, a \"rule\" that first started during the Punic Wars. Different emperors up until Justinian would attempt to require the use of Latin in various sections of the administration but there is no evidence that a linguistic imperialism existed during the early Empire.\nAfter all freeborn inhabitants were universally enfranchised in 212, many Roman citizens lacked a knowledge of Latin. The wide use of Koine Greek was what enabled the spread of Christianity and reflects its role as the lingua franca of the Mediterranean during the time of the Empire. Following Diocletian's reforms in the 3rd century CE, there was a decline in the knowledge of Greek in the west. Spoken Latin later fragmented into the incipient romance languages in the 7th century CE following the collapse of the Empire's west.\nThe dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite obscures the continuity of other spoken languages within the Empire. Latin, referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin, gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages. References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages, particularly in Egypt with Coptic, and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman jurists also show a concern for local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding of laws and oaths. In Africa, Libyco-Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions into the 2nd century. In Syria, Palmyrene soldiers used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, an exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military. The last reference to Gaulish was between 560 and 575. The emergent Gallo-Romance languages would then be shaped by Gaulish. Proto-Basque or Aquitanian evolved with Latin loan words to modern Basque. The Thracian language, as were several now-extinct languages in Anatolia, are attested in Imperial-era inscriptions.\nSociety.\nThe Empire was multicultural, with \"astonishing cohesive capacity\" to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples. Public monuments and communal spaces open to all\u2014such as forums, amphitheatres, racetracks and baths\u2014helped foster a sense of \"Romanness\".\nRoman society had multiple, overlapping social hierarchies. The civil war preceding Augustus caused upheaval, but did not effect an immediate redistribution of wealth and social power. From the perspective of the lower classes, a peak was merely added to the social pyramid. Personal relationships\u2014patronage, friendship (\"amicitia\"), family, marriage\u2014continued to influence politics. By the time of Nero, however, it was not unusual to find a former slave who was richer than a freeborn citizen, or an equestrian who exercised greater power than a senator.\nThe blurring of the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility, both upward and downward, to a greater extent than all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (\"collegia\" and \"sodalitates\"): professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing troupes, and burial societies.\nLegal status.\nAccording to the jurist Gaius, the essential distinction in the Roman \"law of persons\" was that all humans were either free (\"liberi\") or slaves (\"servi\"). The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship. Most citizens held limited rights (such as the \"ius Latinum\", \"Latin right\"), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by non-citizens. Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, were \"peregrini\", non-Romans. In 212, the \"Constitutio Antoniniana\" extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. This legal egalitarianism required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and non-citizens.\nWomen in Roman law.\nFreeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase \"ex duobus civibus Romanis natos\" (\"children born of two Roman citizens\"). A Roman woman kept her own family name (\"nomen\") for life. Children most often took the father's name, with some exceptions. Women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could hold considerable fortunes.\nThe archaic \"manus\" marriage in which the woman was subject to her husband's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father's legal authority, even though she moved into her husband's home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated. This arrangement was a factor in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed compared to many other cultures up to the modern period: although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in daily life, and her husband had no legal power over her. Although it was a point of pride to be a \"one-man woman\" (\"univira\") who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to divorce, nor to speedy remarriage after being widowed or divorced. Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will. A mother's right to own and dispose of property, including setting the terms of her will, gave her enormous influence over her sons into adulthood.\nAs part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order, moral legislation attempted to regulate conduct as a means of promoting \"family values\". Adultery was criminalized, and defined broadly as an illicit sex act (\"stuprum\") between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. That is, a double standard was in place: a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery if he had sex with a prostitute or person of marginalized status. Childbearing was encouraged: a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honours and greater legal freedom (the \"ius trium liberorum\").\nSlaves and the law.\nAt the time of Augustus, as many as 35% of the people in Roman Italy were slaves, making Rome one of five historical \"slave societies\" in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy. In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants; the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour. Agriculture and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves. Outside Italy, slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20% of the population, sparse in Roman Egypt but more concentrated in some Greek areas. Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces. Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries, it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 6th and 7th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy.\nLaws pertaining to slavery were \"extremely intricate\". Slaves were considered property and had no legal personhood. They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens, sexual exploitation, torture, and summary execution. A slave could not as a matter of law be raped; a slave's rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the Aquilian Law. Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called \"conubium\", but their unions were sometimes recognized. Technically, a slave could not own property, but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual fund (\"peculium\") that he could use, depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave acting as the master of others. Talented slaves might accumulate a large enough \"peculium\" to justify their freedom, or be manumitted for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law (\"Lex Fufia Caninia\") limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.\nFollowing the Servile Wars of the Republic, legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups, and for hunting down fugitive slaves. Over time slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as prostitutes in ancient Rome were often slaves. The burgeoning trade in eunuchs in the late 1st century prompted legislation that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will \"for lust or gain\".\nRoman slavery was not based on race. Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Foreign slaves had higher mortality and lower birth rates than natives and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).\nDuring the period of republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war, and the conquest of Greece brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves. Slaves were also traded in markets and sometimes sold by pirates. Infant abandonment and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources. \"Vernae\", by contrast, were \"homegrown\" slaves born to female slaves within the household, estate or farm. Although they had no special legal status, an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his \"vernae\" faced social disapproval, as they were considered part of the family household and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family.\nFreedmen.\nRome differed from Greek city-states in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship. After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom (\"libertas\"), including the right to vote. His former master became his patron (\"patronus\"): the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other. During the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law. The rise of successful freedmen\u2014through political influence or wealth\u2014is a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by .\nCensus rank.\nThe Latin word \"ordo\" (plural \"ordines\") is translated variously and inexactly into English as \"class, order, rank\". One purpose of the Roman census was to determine the \"ordo\" to which an individual belonged. Two of the highest \"ordines\" in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian. Outside Rome, cities or colonies were led by decurions, also known as \"curiales.\"\n\"Senator\" was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome; an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an executive magistrate. A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million \"sestertii\". Not all men who qualified for the \"ordo senatorius\" chose to take a Senate seat, which required legal domicile at Rome. Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600-member body by appointment. A senator's son belonged to the \"ordo senatorius\", but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate. A senator could be removed for violating moral standards.\nIn the time of Nero, senators were still primarily from Italy, with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian. The first senator from the easternmost province, Cappadocia, was admitted under Marcus Aurelius. By the Severan dynasty (193\u2013235), Italians made up less than half the Senate. During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland (\"patria\").\nSenators were the traditional governing class who rose through the \"cursus honorum\", the political career track, but equestrians often possessed greater wealth and political power. Membership in the equestrian order was based on property; in Rome's early days, \"equites\" or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors, but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire. A census valuation of 400,000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian. The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified, and in 14 AD, a thousand equestrians were registered at C\u00e1diz and Padua alone. Equestrians rose through a military career track (\"tres militiae\") to become highly placed prefects and procurators within the Imperial administration.\nThe rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the early Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later European nobility, a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands. Admission to the higher \"ordines\" brought distinction and privileges, but also responsibilities. In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services (\"munera\"). Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures. Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged to return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.\nIn the later Empire, the \"dignitas\" (\"worth, esteem\") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as \"vir illustris\" (\"illustrious man\"). The appellation \"clarissimus\" (Greek \"lamprotatos\") was used to designate the \"dignitas\" of certain senators and their immediate family, including women. \"Grades\" of equestrian status proliferated.\nUnequal justice.\nAs the republican principle of citizens' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours (\"honestiores\") and humbler folk (\"humiliores\"). In general, \"honestiores\" were the members of the three higher \"orders\", along with certain military officers. The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed, particularly within the justice system. Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative \"worth\" (\"dignitas\") of the defendant: an \"honestior\" could pay a fine for a crime for which an \"humilior\" might receive a scourging.\nExecution, which was an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic, could be quick and relatively painless for \"honestiores\", while \"humiliores\" might suffer the kinds of torturous death previously reserved for slaves, such as crucifixion and condemnation to the beasts. In the early Empire, those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as \"honestiores\", especially if they declined to fulfil religious responsibilities, and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of martyrdom.\nGovernment and military.\nThe three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government, the military, and the provincial government. The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens, agricultural fields, and religious sites. The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone. Cooperation with local elites was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue. The Romans often exploited internal political divisions.\nCommunities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence incentivized compliance. Roman government was thus limited, but efficient in its use of available resources.\nCentral government.\nThe Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with divinely sanctioned authority (\"auctoritas\"). The rite of apotheosis (also called \"consecratio\") signified the deceased emperor's deification. The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of powers from several republican offices. The emperor made himself the central religious authority as \"pontifex maximus\", and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.\nThe emperor was the ultimate authority in policy- and decision-making, but in the early Principate, he was expected to be accessible and deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council (\"consilium\") became subject to official appointment for greater transparency. Though the Senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the Antonine dynasty, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the \"consilium\". The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions.\nAccess to the emperor might be gained at the daily reception (\"salutatio\"), a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their approval or displeasure as a group at games. By the 4th century, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions. Although the Senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor, it retained its symbolic political centrality. The Senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor employed senators as legates (\"legati\"): generals, diplomats, and administrators.\nThe practical source of an emperor's power and authority was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual oath of loyalty to the emperor. Most emperors chose a successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive without the allegiance of the Praetorian Guard and the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the \"donativum\", a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.\nMilitary.\nAfter the Punic Wars, the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves. The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of conscript citizens defended the homeland against a specific threat. The Romans expanded their war machine by \"organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army\". By Imperial times, military service was a full-time career. The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of Romanization.\nThe primary mission of the military of the early empire was to preserve the Pax Romana. The three major divisions of the military were:\nThrough his military reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus regularized the legion. A legion was organized into ten cohorts, each of which comprised six centuries, with a century further made up of ten squads (\"contubernia\"); the exact size of the Imperial legion, which was likely determined by logistics, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280. After Germanic tribes wiped out three legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, the number of legions was increased from 25 to around 30. The army had about 300,000 soldiers in the 1st century, and under 400,000 in the 2nd, \"significantly smaller\" than the collective armed forces of the conquered territories. No more than 2% of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army. Augustus also created the Praetorian Guard: nine cohorts, ostensibly to maintain the public peace, which were garrisoned in Italy. Better paid than the legionaries, the Praetorians served only sixteen years.\nThe \"auxilia\" were recruited from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with Roman citizenship, also extended to their sons. According to Tacitus there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries\u2014thus, around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments. The Roman cavalry of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic, Hispanic or Germanic areas. Several aspects of training and equipment derived from the Celts.\nThe Roman navy not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions but also in the protection of the frontiers along the rivers Rhine and Danube. Another duty was protecting maritime trade against pirates. It patrolled the Mediterranean, parts of the North Atlantic coasts, and the Black Sea. Nevertheless, the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch.\nProvincial government.\nAn annexed territory became a Roman province in three steps: making a register of cities, taking a census, and surveying the land. Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the central government sent out around 160 officials annually to govern outside Italy. Among these officials were the Roman governors: magistrates elected at Rome who in the name of the Roman people governed senatorial provinces; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their \"imperium\" on behalf of the emperor in imperial provinces, most notably Roman Egypt. A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties. His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants (\"apparitores\"), including lictors, heralds, messengers, scribes, and bodyguards; legates, both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends who accompanied him unofficially.\nOther officials were appointed as supervisors of government finances. Separating fiscal responsibility from justice and administration was a reform of the Imperial era, to avoid provincial governors and tax farmers exploiting local populations for personal gain. Equestrian procurators, whose authority was originally \"extra-judicial and extra-constitutional\", managed both state-owned property and the personal property of the emperor (\"res privata\"). Because Roman government officials were few, a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity.\nIn the High Empire, Italy was legally distinguished from the provinces, and along with some favored provincial communities, enjoyed immunity from the property tax and poll tax. However, under the Emperor Diocletian, Italy lost these privileges and was subdivided into provinces.\nLaw.\nRoman courts held original jurisdiction over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire, but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces. Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had well-established law codes and juridical procedures. Generally, it was Roman policy to respect the \"mos regionis\" (\"regional tradition\" or \"law of the land\") and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability. The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying \"ius gentium\", the \"law of nations\" or international law regarded as common and customary. If provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom, Roman courts heard appeals, and the emperor held final decision-making authority.\nIn the West, law had been administered on a highly localized or tribal basis, and private property rights may have been a novelty of the Roman era, particularly among Celts. Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro-Roman elite. The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law, replacing local law codes that had applied to non-citizens. Diocletian's efforts to stabilize the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century included two major compilations of law in four years, the \"Codex Gregorianus\" and the \"Codex Hermogenianus\", to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards.\nThe pervasiveness of Roman law throughout Western Europe enormously influenced the Western legal tradition, reflected by continued use of Latin legal terminology in modern law.\nTaxation.\nTaxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of its gross product. The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5%. The tax code was \"bewildering\" in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes, some paid in cash and some in kind. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as fisheries; they might be temporary. Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military, and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty. In-kind taxes were accepted from less-monetized areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.\nThe primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land, construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity. Tax obligations were determined by the census: each head of household provided a headcount of his household, as well as an accounting of his property. A major source of indirect-tax revenue was the \"portoria\", customs and tolls on trade, including among provinces. Towards the end of his reign, Augustus instituted a 4% tax on the sale of slaves, which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers, who responded by raising their prices. An owner who manumitted a slave paid a \"freedom tax\", calculated at 5% of value. An inheritance tax of 5% was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone outside their immediate family. Revenues from the estate tax and from an auction tax went towards the veterans' pension fund (\"aerarium militare\").\nLow taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the \"super-rich\", but in the later period, the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.\nEconomy.\nThe Empire is best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of \"political capitalism\" in which the state regulated commerce to assure its own revenues. Economic growth, though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization. Territorial conquests permitted a large-scale reorganization of land use that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization, particularly in north Africa. Some cities were known for particular industries. The scale of urban building indicates a significant construction industry. Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of economic rationalism, and the Empire was highly monetized. Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity, transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly, and trade routes connected regional economies. The supply contracts for the army drew on local suppliers near the base (\"castrum\"), throughout the province, and across provincial borders.\nEconomic historians vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product during the Principate. In the sample years of 14, 100, and 150 AD, estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 \"HS\". The GDP per capita of Italy is estimated as 40 to 66% higher than in the rest of the Empire, due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income.\nEconomic dynamism resulted in social mobility. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, wealth requirements for rank indicate a strong tendency towards plutocracy. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in grand estates or townhouses, luxury items, public entertainments, funerary monuments, and religious dedications. Guilds (\"collegia\") and corporations (\"corpora\") provided support for individuals to succeed through networking. \"There can be little doubt that the lower classes of ... provincial towns of the Roman Empire enjoyed a high standard of living not equaled again in Western Europe until the 19th century\". Households in the top 1.5% of income distribution captured about 20% of income. The \"vast majority\" produced more than half of the total income, but lived near subsistence.\nCurrency and banking.\nThe early Empire was monetized to a near-universal extent, using money to state prices and debts. Augustus established a practical three-tier currency system that Romans used in their daily lives: gold coins (\"aureus\") for major purchases and wealth storage, silver coins (\"denarius\") that workers earned and used to pay taxes, and bronze/brass coins, especially the brass \"sestertius\" and \"dupondius\", along with the copper \"as\" and smaller denominations, that people used for everyday shopping and small transactions. Most accounts, rents, and public fees were reckoned in sesterces (\"HS\"), even when payment arrived as denarii, aurei, or the bronze pieces converted at the fixed ratios of one aureus to twenty-five denarii, one denarius to four sesterces, and one sesterce to four asses. Because the bronzes circulated by face value rather than metal content, Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins rather than weighing them, and bullion or ingots were rarely treated as \"pecunia\" (\"money\") outside frontier contexts. This reliance on token bronzes underpinned the fiduciary character of Roman coinage and contributed to the debasement of the silver denominations in the later Empire, even as standardized money promoted trade, market integration, and a substantial money supply for commerce and saving.\nRome had no central bank, and regulation of the banking system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits. A typical bank had fairly limited capital, and often only one principal. Seneca assumes that anyone involved in Roman commerce needs access to credit. A professional deposit banker received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers. The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands. Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked documentary transactions, the system of banks throughout the Empire permitted the exchange of large sums without physically transferring coins, in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, in 33 AD; generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers. The central government itself did not borrow money, and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves.\nEmperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties debased the currency, particularly the \"denarius\", under the pressures of meeting military payrolls. Sudden inflation under Commodus damaged the credit market. In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century\u2014such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies\u2014greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector. Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency, general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian, and bankers lost confidence in coins. Despite Diocletian's introduction of the gold \"solidus\" and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.\nMining and metallurgy.\nThe main mining regions of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula (silver, copper, lead, iron and gold); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin). Intensive large-scale mining\u2014of alluvial deposits, and by means of open-cast mining and underground mining\u2014took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production.\nHydraulic mining allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500\u00a0tonnes. Copper and lead production levels were unmatched until the Industrial Revolution. At its peak around the mid-2nd century, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000\u00a0t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800\u00a0AD. As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over prehistoric levels during the Imperial era and dropped thereafter.\nTransportation and communication.\nThe Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean, which they called \"our sea\" (\"Mare Nostrum\"). Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as major rivers. Transport by water was preferred where possible, as moving commodities by land was more difficult. Vehicles, wheels, and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers.\nLand transport utilized the advanced system of Roman roads, called \"viae\". These roads were primarily built for military purposes, but also served commercial ends. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included the provision of personnel, animals, or vehicles for the \"cursus publicus\", the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles, and tended to grow into villages or trading posts. A \"mansio\" (plural \"mansiones\") was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the \"cursus publicus\". The distance between \"mansiones\" was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day. Carts were usually pulled by mules, travelling about 4\u00a0mph.\nTrade and commodities.\nRoman provinces traded among themselves, but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as China and India. Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middlemen along the Silk Road; Indian trade also occurred by sea from Egyptian ports. The main commodity was grain. Also traded were olive oil, foodstuffs, \"garum\" (fish sauce), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, pottery, glassware, marble, papyrus, spices and \"materia medica\", ivory, pearls, and gemstones. Though most provinces could produce wine, regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central trade good.\nLabour and occupations.\nInscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii. Professional associations or trade guilds (\"collegia\") are attested for a wide range of occupations, some quite specialized.\nWork performed by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; imperial or public service; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided much of the labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills. The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in Italian industrial farming (\"latifundia\"), these may have been mostly slaves, but elsewhere slave farm labour was probably less important.\nTextile and clothing production was a major source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded and products were often named for peoples or towns, like a fashion \"label\". Better ready-to-wear was exported by local businessmen (\"negotiatores\" or \"mercatores\"). Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents, by \"vestiarii\" (clothing dealers), or peddled by itinerant merchants. The fullers (\"fullones\") and dye workers (\"coloratores\") had their own guilds. \"Centonarii\" were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into pieced goods.\nArchitecture and engineering.\nThe chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch, vault, and dome. Some Roman structures still stand today, due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete. Roman temples developed Etruscan and Greek forms, with some distinctive elements. Roman roads are considered the most advanced built until the early 19th century.\nRoman bridges were among the first large and lasting bridges, built from stone (and in most cases concrete) with the arch as the basic structure. The largest Roman bridge was Trajan's bridge over the lower Danube, constructed by Apollodorus of Damascus, which remained for over a millennium the longest bridge to have been built. The Romans built many dams and reservoirs for water collection, such as the Subiaco Dams, two of which fed the Anio Novus, one of the largest aqueducts of Rome.\nThe Romans constructed numerous aqueducts. \"De aquaeductu\", a treatise by Frontinus, who served as water commissioner, reflects the administrative importance placed on the water supply. Masonry channels carried water along a precise gradient, using gravity alone. It was then collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains, baths, toilets, or industrial sites. The main aqueducts in Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia. The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120\u00a0km away along a route of more than 336\u00a0km. Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance, and to a technological standard not equalled until modern times. The Romans also used aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire.\nInsulated glazing (or \"double glazing\") was used in the construction of public baths. Elite housing in cooler climates might have hypocausts, a form of central heating. The Romans were the first culture to assemble all essential components of the much later steam engine: the crank and connecting rod system, Hero's aeolipile (generating steam power), the cylinder and piston (in metal force pumps), non-return valves (in water pumps), and gearing (in water mills and clocks).\nDaily life.\nCity and country.\nThe city was viewed as fostering civilization by being \"properly designed, ordered, and adorned\". Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods \"(vici)\" administered at the local level with police and firefighting services. A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the Campus Martius, an open area outside the city centre: the Altar of Augustan Peace () was located there, as was an obelisk imported from Egypt that formed the pointer (\"gnomon\") of a horologium. With its public gardens, the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit.\nCity planning and urban lifestyles was influenced by the Greeks early on, and in the Eastern Empire, Roman rule shaped the development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa tailored city planning and architecture to imperial ideals, while expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In areas inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of preexisting walled settlements known as \"oppida\". Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic coastal cities.\nThe network of cities (, \"municipia\", \"civitates\" or in Greek terms \"poleis\") was a primary cohesive force during the Pax Romana. Romans of the 1st and 2nd centuries were encouraged to \"inculcate the habits of peacetime\". As the classicist Clifford Ando noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Most of the cultural appurtenances popularly associated with imperial culture\u2014public cult and its games and civic banquets, competitions for artists, speakers, and athletes, as well as the funding of the great majority of public buildings and public display of art\u2014were financed by private individuals, whose expenditures in this regard helped to justify their economic power and legal and provincial privileges.\nIn the city of Rome, most people lived in multistory apartment buildings (\"insulae\") that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities\u2014such as baths (\"thermae\"), toilets with running water (\"latrinae\"), basins or elaborate fountains (\"nymphea\") delivering fresh water, and large-scale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combat\u2014were aimed primarily at the common people.\nThe public baths served hygienic, social and cultural functions. Bathing was the focus of daily socializing. Roman baths were distinguished by a series of rooms that offered communal bathing in three temperatures, with amenities that might include an exercise room, sauna, exfoliation spa, ball court, or outdoor swimming pool. Baths had hypocaust heating: the floors were suspended over hot-air channels. Public baths were part of urban culture throughout the provinces, but in the late 4th century, individual tubs began to replace communal bathing. Christians were advised to go to the baths only for hygiene.\nRich families from Rome usually had two or more houses: a townhouse (\"domus\") and at least one luxury home (\"villa\") outside the city. The \"domus\" was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (\"balneum\"), but it was not a place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods show a higher concentration of such houses, they were not segregated enclaves. The \"domus\" was meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the \"paterfamilias\" (head of household) met with clients every morning. It was a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces were often rented out as shops (\"tabernae\"). In addition to a kitchen garden\u2014windowboxes might substitute in the \"insulae\"\u2014townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden.\nThe villa by contrast was an escape from the city, and in literature represents a lifestyle that balances intellectual and artistic interests (\"otium\") with an appreciation of nature and agriculture. Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista, carefully framed by the architectural design.\nAugustus' programme of urban renewal, and the growth of Rome's population to as many as one million, was accompanied by nostalgia for rural life. Poetry idealized the lives of farmers and shepherds. Interior decorating often featured painted gardens, fountains, landscapes, vegetative ornament, and animals, rendered accurately enough to be identified by species. On a more practical level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the priority of land use. Larger farms (\"latifundia\") achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another.\nMaintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (Cura Annonae) to citizens who registered for it (about 200,000\u2013250,000 adult males in Rome). The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on estates. The grain dole also had symbolic value: it affirmed the emperor's position as universal benefactor, and the right of citizens to share in \"the fruits of conquest\". The \"annona\", public facilities, and spectacular entertainments mitigated the otherwise dreary living conditions of lower-class Romans, and kept social unrest in check. The satirist Juvenal, however, saw \"bread and circuses\" (\"panem et circenses\") as emblematic of the loss of republican political liberty:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The public has long since cast off its cares: the people that once bestowed commands, consulships, legions and all else, now meddles no more and longs eagerly for just two things: bread and circuses.\nHealth and disease.\nEpidemics were common in the ancient world, and occasional pandemics in the Empire killed millions. The Roman population was unhealthy. About 20 percent\u2014a large percentage by ancient standards\u2014lived in cities, Rome being the largest. The cities were a \"demographic sink\": the death rate exceeded the birth rate and constant immigration was necessary to maintain the population. Average lifespan is estimated at the mid-twenties, and perhaps more than half of children died before reaching adulthood. Dense urban populations and poor sanitation contributed to disease. Land and sea connections facilitated and sped the transfer of infectious diseases across the empire's territories. The rich were not immune; only two of emperor Marcus Aurelius's fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood.\nThe importance of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as Galen (2nd century). Views on nutrition were influenced by beliefs like humoral theory. A good indicator of nutrition and disease burden is average height: the average Roman was shorter in stature than the population of pre-Roman Italian societies and medieval Europe.\nFood and dining.\nMost apartments in Rome lacked kitchens, though a charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery. Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls (\"tabernae\", \"cauponae\", \"popinae\", \"thermopolia\"). Carryout and restaurants were for the lower classes; fine dining appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a chef (\"archimagirus\") and kitchen staff, or banquets hosted by social clubs (\"collegia\").\nMost Romans consumed at least 70% of their daily calories in the form of cereals and legumes. \"Puls\" (pottage) was considered the food of the Romans, and could be elaborated to produce dishes similar to polenta or risotto. Urban populations and the military preferred bread. By the reign of Aurelian, the state had begun to distribute the \"annona\" as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories, and added olive oil, wine, and pork to the dole.\nRoman literature focuses on the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (\"cena\") had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (\"triclinium\") furnished with couches. By the late Republic, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men. The poet Martial describes a dinner, beginning with the \"gustatio\" (\"tasting\" or \"appetizer\") salad. The main course was kid, beans, greens, a chicken, and leftover ham, followed by a dessert of fruit and wine. Roman \"foodies\" indulged in wild game, fowl such as peacock and flamingo, large fish (mullet was especially prized), and shellfish. Luxury ingredients were imported from the far reaches of empire. A book-length collection of Roman recipes is attributed to Apicius, a name for several figures in antiquity that became synonymous with \"gourmet\".\nRefined cuisine could be moralized as a sign of either civilized progress or decadent decline. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce\u2014cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit\u2014were considered more civilized foods than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism. Some philosophers and Christians resisted the demands of the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished and trade routes were disrupted; the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple and virtuous.\nSpectacles.\nWhen Juvenal complained that the Roman people had exchanged their political liberty for \"bread and circuses\", he was referring to the state-provided grain dole and the \"circenses\", events held in the entertainment venue called a \"circus\". The largest such venue in Rome was the Circus Maximus, the setting of horse races, chariot races, the equestrian Troy Game, staged beast hunts (\"venationes\"), athletic contests, gladiator combat, and historical re-enactments. From earliest times, several religious festivals had featured games (\"ludi\"), primarily horse and chariot races (\"ludi circenses\"). The races retained religious significance in connection with agriculture, initiation, and the cycle of birth and death.\nUnder Augustus, public entertainments were presented on 77 days of the year; by the reign of Marcus Aurelius, this had expanded to 135. Circus games were preceded by an elaborate parade (\"pompa circensis\") that ended at the venue. Competitive events were held also in smaller venues such as the amphitheatre, which became the characteristic Roman spectacle venue, and stadium. Greek-style athletics included footraces, boxing, wrestling, and the pancratium. Aquatic displays, such as the mock sea battle (\"naumachia\") and a form of \"water ballet\", were presented in engineered pools. State-supported theatrical events (\"ludi scaenici\") took place on temple steps or in grand stone theatres, or in the smaller enclosed theatre called an \"odeon\".\nCircuses were the largest structure regularly built in the Roman world. The Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the Colosseum, became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome. Many Roman amphitheatres, circuses and theatres built in cities outside Italy are visible as ruins today. The local ruling elite were responsible for sponsoring spectacles and arena events, which both enhanced their status and drained their resources. The physical arrangement of the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor in his opulent box; senators and equestrians in reserved advantageous seats; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites of social and political protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in 532.\nThe chariot teams were known by the colours they wore, with the two main teams being the Blues and the Greens. Fan loyalty was fierce and at times erupted into sports riots. Racing was perilous, but charioteers were among the most celebrated and well-compensated athletes. Circuses were designed to ensure that no team had an unfair advantage and to minimize collisions (\"naufragia\"), which were nonetheless frequent and satisfying to the crowd. The races retained a magical aura through their early association with chthonic rituals: circus images were considered protective or lucky, curse tablets have been found buried at the site of racetracks, and charioteers were often suspected of sorcery. Chariot racing continued into the Byzantine period under imperial sponsorship, but the decline of cities in the 6th and 7th centuries led to its eventual demise.\nThe Romans thought gladiator contests had originated with funeral games and sacrifices. Some of the earliest styles of gladiator fighting had ethnic designations such as \"Thracian\" or \"Gallic\". The staged combats were considered , \"services, offerings, benefactions\", initially distinct from the festival games (\"ludi\"). To mark the opening of the Colosseum, Titus presented 100 days of arena events, with 3,000 gladiators competing on a single day. Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics, wall paintings, lamps, and in graffiti. Gladiators were trained combatants who might be slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a necessary or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training was costly and time-consuming. By contrast, \"noxii\" were convicts sentenced to the arena with little or no training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival; physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects.\nModern scholars have found the pleasure Romans took in the \"theatre of life and death\" difficult to understand. Pliny the Younger rationalized gladiator spectacles as good for the people, \"to inspire them to face honourable wounds and despise death, by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory\". Some Romans such as Seneca were critical of the brutal spectacles, but found virtue in the courage and dignity of the defeated fighter\u2014an attitude that finds its fullest expression with the Christians martyred in the arena. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice. Even martyr literature, however, offers \"detailed, indeed luxuriant, descriptions of bodily suffering\", and became a popular genre at times indistinguishable from fiction.\nRecreation.\nThe singular \"ludus\", \"play, game, sport, training\", had a wide range of meanings such as \"word play\", \"theatrical performance\", \"board game\", \"primary school\", and even \"gladiator training school\" (as in \"Ludus Magnus\"). Activities for children and young people in the Empire included hoop rolling and knucklebones (\"astragali\" or \"jacks\"). Girls had dolls made of wood, terracotta, and especially bone and ivory. Ball games include trigon and harpastum. People of all ages played board games, including \"latrunculi\" (\"Raiders\") and \"XII scripta\" (\"Twelve Marks\"). A game referred to as \"alea\" (dice) or \"tabula\" (the board) may have been similar to backgammon. Dicing as a form of gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the festival of the Saturnalia.\nAfter adolescence, most physical training for males was of a military nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men learned horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage Greek-style athletic games. Some women trained as gymnasts and dancers, and a rare few as female gladiators. The \"Bikini Girls\" mosaic shows young women engaging in routines comparable to rhythmic gymnastics. Women were encouraged to maintain health through activities such as playing ball, swimming, walking, or reading aloud (as a breathing exercise).\nClothing.\nIn a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order. There is little direct evidence of how Romans dressed in daily life, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles are rare.\nThe toga was the distinctive national garment of the male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political or court business and religious rites. It was a \"vast expanse\" of semi-circular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance. The drapery became more intricate and structured over time. The \"toga praetexta\", with a purple or purplish-red stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age, curule magistrates, and state priests. Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga (\"toga picta\").\nOrdinary clothing was dark or colourful. The basic garment for all Romans, regardless of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic, with length differing by wearer. The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades; finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man of the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (\"clavi\") woven vertically: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic. Common male attire also included cloaks, and in some regions, trousers. In the 2nd century, emperors and elite men are often portrayed wearing the pallium, an originally Greek mantle; women are also portrayed in the pallium. Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians, in contrast to the toga, and for educated people.\nRoman clothing styles changed over time. In the Dominate, clothing worn by both soldiers and bureaucrats became highly decorated with geometrical patterns, stylized plant motifs, and in more elaborate examples, human or animal figures. Courtiers of the later Empire wore elaborate silk robes. The militarization of Roman society, and the waning of urban life, affected fashion: heavy military-style belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers, and the toga was abandoned, replaced by the pallium as a garment embodying social unity.\nArts.\nGreek art had a profound influence on Roman art. Public art\u2014including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins\u2014is often analysed for historical or ideological significance. In the private sphere, artistic objects were made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce. The wealthy advertised their appreciation of culture through artwork and decorative arts in their homes. Despite the value placed on art, even famous artists were of low social status, partly as they worked with their hands.\nPortraiture.\nPortraiture, which survives mainly in sculpture, was the most copious form of imperial art. Portraits during the Augustan period utilize classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. Republican portraits were characterized by verism, but as early as the 2nd century BC, Greek heroic nudity was adopted for conquering generals. Imperial portrait sculptures may model a mature head atop a youthful nude or semi-nude body with perfect musculature. Clothed in the toga or military regalia, the body communicates rank or role, not individual characteristics.\nPortraiture in painting is represented primarily by the Fayum mummy portraits, which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with realistic painting. Marble portrait sculpture were painted, but traces have rarely survived.\nSculpture and sarcophagi.\nExamples of Roman sculpture survive abundantly, though often in damaged or fragmentary condition, including freestanding statuary in marble, bronze and terracotta, and reliefs from public buildings and monuments. Niches in amphitheatres were originally filled with statues, as were formal gardens. Temples housed cult images of deities, often by famed sculptors.\nElaborately carved marble and limestone sarcophagi are characteristic of the 2nd to 4th centuries. Sarcophagus relief has been called the \"richest single source of Roman iconography\", depicting mythological scenes or Jewish/Christian imagery as well as the deceased's life.\nPainting.\nInitial Roman painting drew from Etruscan and Greek models and techniques. Examples of Roman paintings can be found in palaces, catacombs and villas. Much of what is known of Roman painting is from the interior decoration of private homes, particularly as preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius. In addition to decorative borders and panels with geometric or vegetative motifs, wall painting depicts scenes from mythology and theatre, landscapes and gardens, spectacles, everyday life, and erotic art.\nMosaic.\nMosaics are among the most enduring of Roman decorative arts, and are found on floors and other architectural features. The most common is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces \"(tesserae)\" of materials such as stone and glass. \"Opus sectile\" is a related technique in which flat stone, usually coloured marble, is cut precisely into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed. This more difficult technique became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 4th century (e.g. the Basilica of Junius Bassus).\nFigurative mosaics share many themes with painting, and in some cases use almost identical compositions. Geometric patterns and mythological scenes occur throughout the Empire. In North Africa, a particularly rich source of mosaics, homeowners often chose scenes of life on their estates, hunting, agriculture, and local wildlife. Plentiful and major examples of Roman mosaics come also from present-day Turkey (particularly the (Antioch mosaics), Italy, southern France, Spain, and Portugal.\nDecorative arts.\nDecorative arts for luxury consumers included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. Pottery manufacturing was economically important, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (\"terra sigillata\") that was a major trade good in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century, Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.\nPerforming arts.\nIn Roman tradition, borrowed from the Greeks, literary theatre was performed by all-male troupes that used face masks with exaggerated facial expressions to portray emotion. Female roles were played by men in drag (\"travesti\"). Roman literary theatre tradition is represented in Latin literature by the tragedies of Seneca, for example.\nMore popular than literary theatre was the genre-defying \"mimus\" theatre, which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation, risqu\u00e9 language and sex scenes, action sequences, and political satire, along with dance, juggling, acrobatics, tightrope walking, striptease, and dancing bears. Unlike literary theatre, \"mimus\" was played without masks, and encouraged stylistic realism. Female roles were performed by women. \"Mimus\" was related to \"pantomimus\", an early form of story ballet that contained no spoken dialogue but rather a sung libretto, often mythological, either tragic or comic.\nAlthough sometimes regarded as foreign, music and dance existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the \"tibia\", a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices. Song \"(carmen)\" was integral to almost every social occasion. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos. Various woodwinds and \"brass\" instruments were played, as were stringed instruments such as the \"cithara\", and percussion. The \"cornu\", a long tubular metal wind instrument, was used for military signals and on parade. These instruments spread throughout the provinces and are widely depicted in Roman art. The hydraulic pipe organ \"(hydraulis)\" was \"one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity\", and accompanied gladiator games and events in the amphitheatre. Although certain dances were seen at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was embedded in religious rituals of archaic Rome. Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the mystery religions, particularly the cults of Cybele and Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.\nLike gladiators, entertainers were legally \"infames\", technically free but little better than slaves. \"Stars\", however, could enjoy considerable wealth and celebrity, and mingled socially and often sexually with the elite. Performers supported each other by forming guilds, and several memorials for theatre members survive. Theatre and dance were often condemned by Christian polemicists in the later Empire.\nLiteracy, books, and education.\nEstimates of the average literacy rate range from 5 to over 30%. The Roman obsession with documents and inscriptions indicates the value placed on the written word. Laws and edicts were posted as well as read out. Illiterate Roman subjects could have a government scribe (\"scriba\") read or write their official documents for them. The military produced extensive written records.\nNumeracy was necessary for commerce. Slaves were numerate and literate in significant numbers; some were highly educated. Graffiti and low-quality inscriptions with misspellings and solecisms indicate casual literacy among non-elites.\nThe Romans had an extensive priestly archive, and inscriptions appear throughout the Empire in connection with votives dedicated by ordinary people, as well as \"magic spells\" (e.g. the Greek Magical Papyri).\nBooks were expensive, since each copy had to be written out on a papyrus roll (\"volumen\") by scribes. The codex\u2014pages bound to a spine\u2014was still a novelty in the 1st century, but by the end of the 3rd century was replacing the \"volumen\". Commercial book production was established by the late Republic, and by the 1st century certain neighbourhoods of Rome and Western provincial cities were known for their bookshops. The quality of editing varied wildly, and plagiarism or forgery were common, since there was no copyright law.\nCollectors amassed personal libraries, and a fine library was part of the cultivated leisure (\"otium\") associated with the villa lifestyle. Significant collections might attract \"in-house\" scholars, and an individual benefactor might endow a community with a library (as Pliny the Younger did in Comum). Imperial libraries were open to users on a limited basis, and represented a literary canon. Books considered subversive might be publicly burned, and Domitian crucified copyists for reproducing works deemed treasonous.\nLiterary texts were often shared aloud at meals or with reading groups. Public readings (\"recitationes\") expanded from the 1st through the 3rd century, giving rise to \"consumer literature\" for entertainment. Illustrated books, including erotica, were popular, but are poorly represented by extant fragments.\nLiteracy began to decline during the Crisis of the Third Century. The emperor Julian banned Christians from teaching the classical curriculum, but the Church Fathers and other Christians adopted Latin and Greek literature, philosophy and science in biblical interpretation. As the Western Roman Empire declined, reading became rarer even for those within the Church hierarchy, although it continued in the Byzantine Empire.\nEducation.\nTraditional Roman education was moral and practical. Stories were meant to instil Roman values (\"mores maiorum\"). Parents were expected to act as role models, and working parents passed their skills to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships. Young children were attended by a pedagogue, usually a Greek slave or former slave, who kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behaviour, attended class and helped with tutoring.\nFormal education was available only to families who could pay for it; lack of state support contributed to low literacy. Primary education in reading, writing, and arithmetic might take place at home if parents hired or bought a teacher. Other children attended \"public\" schools organized by a schoolmaster (\"ludimagister\") paid by parents. \"Vernae\" (homeborn slave children) might share in-home or public schooling. Boys and girls received primary education generally from ages 7 to 12, but classes were not segregated by grade or age. Most schools employed corporal punishment. For the socially ambitious, education in Greek as well as Latin was necessary. Schools became more numerous during the Empire, increasing educational opportunities.\nAt the age of 14, upperclass males made their rite of passage into adulthood, and began to learn leadership roles through mentoring from a senior family member or family friend. Higher education was provided by \"grammatici\" or \"rhetores\". The \"grammaticus\" or \"grammarian\" taught mainly Greek and Latin literature, with history, geography, philosophy or mathematics treated as explications of the text. With the rise of Augustus, contemporary Latin authors such as Virgil and Livy also became part of the curriculum. The \"rhetor\" was a teacher of oratory or public speaking. The art of speaking (\"ars dicendi\") was highly prized, and \"eloquentia\" (\"speaking ability, eloquence\") was considered the \"glue\" of civilized society. Rhetoric was not so much a body of knowledge (though it required a command of the literary canon) as it was a mode of expression that distinguished those who held social power. The ancient model of rhetorical training\u2014\"restraint, coolness under pressure, modesty, and good humour\"\u2014endured into the 18th century as a Western educational ideal.\nIn Latin, \"illiteratus\" could mean both \"unable to read and write\" and \"lacking in cultural awareness or sophistication\". Higher education promoted career advancement. Urban elites throughout the Empire shared a literary culture imbued with Greek educational ideals (\"paideia\"). Hellenistic cities sponsored schools of higher learning to express cultural achievement. Young Roman men often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training. On the Hellenistic model, Vespasian endowed chairs of grammar, Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy at Rome, and gave secondary teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties. In the Eastern Empire, Berytus (present-day Beirut) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its school of Roman law. The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic (1st\u20133rd century AD) promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social, educational, and esthetic values.\nLiterate women ranged from cultured aristocrats to girls trained to be calligraphers and scribes. The ideal woman in Augustan love poetry was educated and well-versed in the arts. Education seems to have been standard for daughters of the senatorial and equestrian orders. An educated wife was an asset for the socially ambitious household.\nLiterature.\nLiterature under Augustus, along with that of the Republic, has been viewed as the \"Golden Age\" of Latin literature, embodying classical ideals. The three most influential Classical Latin poets\u2014Virgil, Horace, and Ovid\u2014belong to this period. Virgil's \"Aeneid\" was a national epic in the manner of the Homeric epics of Greece. Horace perfected the use of Greek lyric metres in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of Augustan morality, contributing to his exile. Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" wove together Greco-Roman mythology; his versions of Greek myths became a primary source of later classical mythology, and his work was hugely influential on medieval literature. The early Principate produced satirists such as Persius and Juvenal.\nThe mid-1st through mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the \"Silver Age\" of Latin literature. The three leading writers\u2014Seneca, Lucan, and Petronius\u2014committed suicide after incurring Nero's displeasure. Epigrammatist and social observer Martial and the epic poet Statius, whose poetry collection \"Silvae\" influenced Renaissance literature, wrote during the reign of Domitian. Other authors of the Silver Age included Pliny the Elder, author of the encyclopedic \"Natural History\"; his nephew, Pliny the Younger; and the historian Tacitus.\nThe principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the historian Livy, whose account of Rome's founding became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. \"The Twelve Caesars\" by Suetonius is a primary source for imperial biography. Among Imperial historians who wrote in Greek are Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Josephus, and Cassius Dio. Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer Plutarch, the geographer Strabo, and the rhetorician and satirist Lucian.\nFrom the 2nd to the 4th centuries, Christian authors were in active dialogue with the classical tradition. Tertullian was one of the earliest prose authors with a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective. In the late 4th century, Jerome produced the Latin translation of the Bible that became authoritative as the Vulgate. Around that same time, Augustine wrote \"The City of God against the Pagans\", considered \"a masterpiece of Western culture\".\nIn contrast to the unity of Classical Latin, the literary esthetic of late antiquity has a tessellated quality. A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century, with the \"Saturnalia\" of Macrobius and \"The Marriage of Philology and Mercury\" of Martianus Capella. Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius, Prudentius, Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.\nReligion.\nThe Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success to their collective piety (\"pietas\") and good relations with the gods (\"pax deorum\"). The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest kings of Rome was the foundation of the \"mos maiorum\", \"the way of the ancestors\", central to Roman identity.\nRoman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of \"do ut des\", \"I give that you might give\". Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine to offer prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances; as many as 135 days were devoted to religious festivals and games (\"ludi\").\nIn the wake of the Republic's collapse, state religion adapted to support the new regime. Augustus justified one-man rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform. Public vows now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called \"emperor worship\" expanded on a grand scale the traditional veneration of the ancestral dead and of the \"Genius\", the divine tutelary of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (\"divus\") by vote of the Senate. The Roman imperial cult, influenced by Hellenistic ruler cult, became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as Najran, in present-day Saudi Arabia. Rejection of the state religion became tantamount to treason.\nThe Romans are known for the great number of deities they honoured. As the Romans extended their territories, their general policy was to promote stability among diverse peoples by absorbing local deities and cults rather than eradicating them, building temples that framed local theology within Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous syncretic or reinterpreted gods were cultivated, among them cults of Cybele, Isis, Epona, and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue.\nMystery religions, which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice, practiced in addition to one's family rites and public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, which conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"magic\", conspiracy, and subversive activity. Thus, sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists. In Gaul, the power of the druids was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. However, Celtic traditions were reinterpreted within the context of Imperial theology, and a new Gallo-Roman religion coalesced; its capital at the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity. The monotheistic rigour of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and granting of special exemptions. Tertullian noted that Judaism, unlike Christianity, was considered a \"religio licita\", \"legitimate religion\". The Jewish\u2013Roman wars resulted from political as well as religious conflicts; the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD led to the sacking of the Second Temple and the dispersal of Jewish political power (see Jewish diaspora).\nChristianity emerged in Roman Judaea as a Jewish religious sect in the 1st century and gradually spread out of Jerusalem throughout the Empire and beyond. Imperially authorized persecutions were limited and sporadic, with martyrdoms occurring most often under the authority of local officials. Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD\u00a064, the emperor attempted to deflect blame from himself onto the Christians. A major persecution occurred under the emperor Domitian and a persecution in 177 took place at Lugdunum, the Gallo-Roman religious capital. A letter from Pliny the Younger, governor of Bithynia, describes his persecution and executions of Christians. The Decian persecution of 246\u2013251 seriously threatened the Christian Church, but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance. Diocletian undertook the most severe persecution of Christians, from 303 to 311.\nFrom the 2nd century onward, the Church Fathers condemned the diverse religions practiced throughout the Empire as \"pagan\". In the early 4th century, Constantine I became the first emperor to convert to Christianity. He supported the Church financially and made laws that favored it, but the new religion was already successful, having moved from less than 50,000 to over a million adherents between 150 and 250. Constantine and his successors banned public sacrifice while tolerating other traditional practices. Constantine never engaged in a purge, there were no \"pagan martyrs\" during his reign, and people who had not converted to Christianity remained in important positions at court. Julian attempted to revive traditional public sacrifice and Hellenistic religion, but met Christian resistance and lack of popular support.\nChristians of the 4th century believed the conversion of Constantine showed that Christianity had triumphed over paganism (in Heaven) and little further action besides such rhetoric was necessary. Thus, their focus shifted towards heresy. According to Peter Brown, \"In most areas, polytheists were not molested, and apart from a few ugly incidents of local violence, Jewish communities also enjoyed a century of stable, even privileged, existence\". There were anti-pagan laws, but they were not generally enforced; through the 6th century, centers of paganism existed in Athens, Gaza, Alexandria, and elsewhere.\nAccording to recent Jewish scholarship, toleration of the Jews was maintained under Christian emperors. This did not extend to heretics: Theodosius I made multiple laws and acted against alternate forms of Christianity, and heretics were persecuted and killed by both the government and the church throughout Late Antiquity. Non-Christians were not persecuted until the 6th century. Rome's original religious hierarchy and ritual influenced Christian forms, and many pre-Christian practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.\nLegacy.\nSeveral states claimed to be the Roman Empire's successor. The Holy Roman Empire was established in 800 when Pope Leo\u00a0III crowned Charlemagne as Roman emperor. The Russian Tsardom, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's Orthodox Christian tradition, counted itself the Third Rome (Constantinople having been the second), in accordance with the concept of translatio imperii. The last Eastern Roman titular, Andreas Palaiologos, sold the title of Emperor of Constantinople to Charles VIII of France; upon Charles' death, Palaiologos reclaimed the title and on his death granted it to Ferdinand and Isabella and their successors, who never used it. When the Ottomans, who based their state on the Byzantine model, took Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed\u00a0II established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire. He even launched an invasion of Otranto with the purpose of re-uniting the Empire, which was aborted by his death. In the medieval West, \"Roman\" came to mean the church and the Catholic Pope. The Greek form Romaioi remained attached to the Greek-speaking Christian population of the Byzantine Empire and is still used by Greeks.\nThe Roman Empire's control of the Italian Peninsula influenced Italian nationalism and the unification of Italy (\"Risorgimento\") in 1861. In the United States, the founders saw Athenian democracy and Roman republicanism as models for the mixed constitution, but regarded the emperor as a figure of tyranny.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nstyle=\"width:100%\""}

Home to 591,882 inhabitants (as of 2025), the city accounts for a third of Latvia's total population. The population of Riga metropolitan area, which stretches beyond the city limits, is estimated at 847,162 (as of 2025). The city lies on the Gulf of Riga at the mouth of the Daugava river where it meets the Baltic Sea. Riga's territory covers and lies above sea level on a flat and sandy plain.\nRiga was founded in 1201, and is a former Hanseatic League member. Riga's historical centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, noted for its Art Nouveau/Jugendstil architecture and 19th century wooden architecture. Riga was the European Capital of Culture in 2014, along with Ume\u00e5 in Sweden. Riga hosted the 2006 NATO Summit, the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, the 2013 World Women's Curling Championship, and the IIHF Men's World Ice Hockey Championships in 2006, 2021, and 2023. It is home to the European Union's office of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). In 2017, it was named as the European Region of Gastronomy.\nIn 2019, Riga received over 1.4\u00a0million foreign visitors. The city is served by Riga International Airport, the largest and busiest airport in the Baltic States. Riga is a member of Eurocities, the Union of the Baltic Cities (UBC), and Union of Capitals of the European Union (UCEU).\nEtymology.\nThe precise origin of the name is unknown; however, there are numerous and speculative theories for the origin of the name \"Riga\":\nNonetheless, the most reliably documented explanation is the affirmation by German historian Dionysius Fabricius (1610) that Riga's name comes from its already established role in trade: \"Riga obtained its name from the buildings or warehouses found in great number along the banks of the Duna, which the Livs in their own language are accustomed to call Riae\". The \"j\" in Latvian hardened to a \"g\" in German. English geographer Richard Hakluyt (1589) corroborates this account, calling Riga as \"Rie\", as pronounced in Old Latvian. This is further supported by the fact that Riga is called \"Riia\" in Estonian (a language closely related to Livonian).\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n Archbishopric of Riga (vassal state of the Holy Roman Empire) 1201\u20131561 Imperial Free City 1561\u20131582 Swedish Empire 1629\u20131721 Russian Empire 1721\u20131917 German Empire 1917\u20131918 Republic of Latvia 1918\u20131940 Latvian SSR 1940\u20131941 Nazi Germany 1941\u20131944 Latvian SSR 1944\u20131990 Republic of Latvia 1990\u2013present\nFounding.\nThe river Daugava has been a trade route since antiquity, part of the Vikings' Dvina\u2013Dnieper navigation route to Byzantium. A sheltered natural harbor upriver from the mouth of the Daugava\u2014the site of today's Riga\u2014has been recorded, as \"Duna Urbs\", as early as the 2nd century. It was settled by the Livs, a Finnic tribe.\nRiga began to develop as a centre of Viking trade during the early Middle Ages. Riga's inhabitants engaged mainly in fishing, animal husbandry, and trading, later developing crafts, including bone, wood, amber, and iron.\nThe \"Livonian Chronicle of Henry\" testifies to Riga having long been a trading centre by the 12th century, referring to it as (ancient port), and describes dwellings and warehouses used to store mostly flax, and hides. German traders began visiting Riga, establishing a nearby outpost in 1158.\nAlong with German traders the monk Meinhard of Segeberg arrived to convert the Livonian pagans to Christianity. Catholic and Orthodox Christianity had already arrived in Latvia more than a century earlier, and many Latvians had been baptized. Meinhard settled among the Livs, building a castle and church at Uexk\u00fcll (now known as Ik\u0161\u0137ile), upstream from Riga, and established his bishopric there. The Livs, however, continued to practice paganism and Meinhard died in Uexk\u00fcll in 1196, having failed in his mission. In 1198, the Bishop Berthold arrived with a contingent of crusaders and commenced a campaign of forced Christianization. Berthold died soon afterwards and his forces were defeated.\nThe Church mobilized to avenge this defeat. Pope Innocent III issued a bull declaring a crusade against the Livonians. Bishop Albert was proclaimed Bishop of Livonia by his uncle Hartwig of Uthlede, Prince-Archbishop of Bremen and Hamburg in 1199. Albert landed in Riga in 1200 with 23 ships and 500 Westphalian crusaders. In 1201, he transferred the seat of the Livonian bishopric from Uexk\u00fcll to Riga, extorting agreement to do this from the elders of Riga by force.\nUnder Bishop Albert.\nThe year 1201 also marked the first arrival of German merchants in Novgorod, via the Dvina. To defend territory and trade, Albert established the Order of Livonian Brothers of the Sword in 1202, which was open to nobles and merchants.\nThe Christianisation of the Livs continued. In 1207, Albert started to fortify the town. King Philip invested Albert with Livonia as a fief and principality of the Holy Roman Empire. To promote a permanent military presence, territorial ownership was divided between the Church and the \"Order\", with the Church taking Riga and two-thirds of all lands conquered and granting the \"Order\" a third. Until then, it had been customary for crusaders to serve for a year and then return home.\nAlbert had ensured Riga's commercial future by obtaining papal bulls which decreed that all German merchants had to carry on their Baltic trade through Riga. In 1211, Riga minted its first coinage, and Albert laid the cornerstone for the Riga Dom. Riga was not yet secure as an alliance of tribes failed to take Riga. In 1212, Albert led a campaign to compel Polotsk to grant German merchants free river passage. Polotsk conceded Kukenois (Koknese) and Jersika to Albert, also ending the Livs' tribute to Polotsk.\nRiga's merchant citizenry chafed and sought greater autonomy from the Church. In 1221, they acquired the right to independently self-administer Riga and adopted a city constitution.\nThat same year Albert was compelled to recognise Danish rule over lands they had conquered in Estonia and Livonia. Albert had sought the aid of King Valdemar of Denmark to protect Riga and Livonian lands against Liv insurrection when reinforcements could not reach Riga. The Danes landed in Livonia, built a fortress at Reval (Tallinn) and set about conquering Estonian and Livonian lands. The Germans attempted, but failed, to assassinate Valdemar. Albert was able to reach an accommodation with them a year later, however, and in 1222 Valdemar returned all Livonian lands and possessions to Albert's control.\nAlbert's difficulties with Riga's citizenry continued; with papal intervention, a settlement was reached in 1225 whereby they no longer had to pay tax to the Bishop of Riga, and Riga's citizens acquired the right to elect their magistrates and town councillors. In 1226, Albert consecrated the Dom Cathedral, built St. James's Church, (now a cathedral) and founded a parochial school at the Church of St. George.\nIn 1227, Albert conquered Oesel and the city of Riga concluded a treaty with the Principality of Smolensk giving Polotsk to Riga.\nAlbert died in January 1229. He failed in his aspiration to be anointed archbishop but the German hegemony he established over the Livonia would last for seven centuries.\nHanseatic League.\nIn 1282, Riga became a member of the Hanseatic League. The Hansa was instrumental in giving Riga economic and political stability, thus providing the city with a strong foundation which endured the political conflagrations that were to come, down to modern times.\nHoly Roman Empire, Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Swedish and Russian Empires.\nAs the influence of the Hanseatic League waned, Riga became the object of foreign military, political, religious and economic aspirations. Riga accepted the Reformation in 1522, ending the power of the archbishops. In 1524, iconoclasts during iconoclast riots targeted a statue of the Virgin Mary in the cathedral to make a statement against religious icons. It was accused of being a witch, and given a trial by water in the Daugava river. The statue floated, so it was denounced as a witch and burnt at Kubsberg. With the demise of the Livonian Order (1561) during the Livonian War, Riga for twenty years had the status of a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire before it came under the influence of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Treaty of Drohiczyn, which ended the war for Riga in 1581. In 1621, during the Polish\u2013Swedish War (1621\u20131625), Riga and the outlying fortress of Daugavgr\u012bva came under the rule of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, who intervened in the Thirty Years' War not only for political and economic gain but also in favour of German Lutheran Protestantism. During the Russo-Swedish War (1656\u20131658), Riga withstood a siege by Russian forces.\nRiga remained one of the largest cities under the Swedish crown until 1710, a period during which the city retained a great deal of autonomous self-government. In July 1701, during the opening phase of the Great Northern War, the \"Crossing of the D\u00fcna\" took place nearby, resulting in a victory for king Charles XII of Sweden. Between November 1709 and June 1710, however, the Russians under Tsar Peter the Great besieged and captured Riga, which was at the time struck by a plague. Along with the other Livonian towns and gentry, Riga capitulated to Russia, but largely retained their privileges. Riga was made the capital of the Governorate of Riga (later, Livonia). Sweden's northern dominance had ended, and Russia's emergence as the strongest Northern power was formalised through the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. At the beginning of the 20th century Riga was the largest timber export port in the Russian Empire and ranked the 3rd according to the external trade volume.\nDuring these many centuries of war and changes of power in the Baltic, and despite demographic changes, the Baltic Germans in Riga had maintained a dominant position. By 1867, Riga's population was 42.9% German. Riga employed German as its official language of administration until the installation of Russian in 1891 as the official language in the Baltic provinces, as part of the policy of Russification of the non-Russian-speaking territories of the Russian Empire, including Congress Poland, Finland and the Baltics, undertaken by Tsar Alexander III. More and more Latvians started moving to the city during the mid-19th century. The rise of a Latvian bourgeoisie made Riga a centre of the Latvian National Awakening with the founding of the Riga Latvian Association in 1868 and the organisation of the first national song festival in 1873. In 1897, Riga was the sixth largest city in the Russian Empire. The nationalist movement of the Neo-Latvians was followed by the socialist New Current during the city's rapid industrialisation, culminating in the 1905 Revolution led by the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party.\nWorld War I.\nThe 20th century brought World War I and the impact of the Russian Revolution of 1917 to Riga. As a result of the battle of Jugla, the German army marched into Riga on 3 September 1917. On 3 March 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed, giving the Baltic countries to Germany. Because of the armistice with Germany of 11 November 1918, Germany had to renounce that treaty, as did Russia, leaving Latvia and the other Baltic States in a position to claim independence. Latvia, with Riga as its capital city, thus declared its independence on 18 November 1918. Between World War I and World War II (1918\u20131940), Riga and Latvia shifted their focus from Russia to the countries of Western Europe. The United Kingdom and Germany replaced Russia as Latvia's major trade partners. The majority of the Baltic Germans were resettled in late 1939, prior to the occupation of Estonia and Latvia by the Soviet Union in June 1940.\nWorld War II and Soviet era.\nDuring World War II, Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940 and then was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941\u20131944. On 17 June 1940, the Soviet forces invaded Latvia occupying bridges, post/telephone, telegraph, and broadcasting offices. Three days later, Latvian president K\u0101rlis Ulmanis was forced to approve a pro-Soviet government which had taken office. On 14\u201315 July, rigged elections were held in Latvia and the other Baltic states, The ballots held the following instructions: \"Only the list of the Latvian Working People's Bloc must be deposited in the ballot box. The ballot must be deposited without any changes.\" The alleged voter activity index was 97.6%. Most notably, the complete election results were published in Moscow 12 hours before the election closed. Soviet electoral documents found later substantiated that the results were completely fabricated. The Soviet authorities, having regained control over Riga and Latvia imposed a regime of terror, opening the headquarters of the KGB, massive deportations started. Hundreds of men were arrested, including leaders of the former Latvian government. The most notorious deportation, the June deportation, took place on 13 and 14 June 1941, estimated at 15,600 men, women, and children, and including 20% of Latvia's last legal government. Similar deportations were repeated after the end of World War II. The building of the KGB located at 61 Br\u012bv\u012bbas iela, known as 'the corner house', is now a museum. Stalin's deportations also included thousands of Latvian Jews. The mass deportation totalled 131,500 across the Baltics.\nDuring the Nazi occupation, the Jewish community was forced into the Riga Ghetto and a Nazi concentration camp was constructed in Kaiserwald. On 25 October 1941, the Nazis relocated all Jews from Riga and the vicinity to the ghetto. Most of Latvia's Jews (about 24,000) were killed on 30 November and 8 December 1941 in the Rumbula massacre. By the end of the war, the remaining Baltic Germans were expelled to Germany.\nThe Soviet Red Army reconquered Riga on 13 October 1944. In the following years the massive influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel, and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. Microdistricts of the large multi-storied housing blocks were built to house immigrant workers.\nBy the end of World War II, Riga's historical centre was heavily damaged from constant bombing. After the war, huge efforts were made to reconstruct and renovate most of the famous buildings that had been part of the skyline of the city before the war. Such buildings were, amongst others, St. Peter's Church which lost its wooden tower after a fire caused by the Wehrmacht (renovated in 1954). Another example is the House of the Blackheads, completely destroyed, its ruins subsequently demolished; a facsimile was constructed in 1995.\nIn 1989, the percentage of Latvians in Riga had fallen to 36.5%.\n21st century.\nIn 2004, the arrival of low-cost airlines resulted in cheaper flights from other European cities such as London and Berlin, and consequently a substantial increase in numbers of tourists.\nOn 21 November 2013, the roof of a supermarket collapsed in Zolit\u016bde, one of the neighbourhoods of the city, possibly as a result of the weight of materials used in the construction of a garden on the roof. Fifty-four people were killed. Latvian President Andris B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161 described the disaster as \"a large-scale murder of many defenceless people\".\nRiga was the European Capital of Culture in 2014. During Latvia's Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2015, the 4th Eastern Partnership Summit took place in Riga.\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Saeima voted to suspend the functioning of a section of an agreement between Latvia and Russia regarding the preservation of memorial structures on 12 May, in the next day the Riga City Council also voted to demolish the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders. On 20 May, a rally called \"Getting Rid of Soviet Heritage\" took place in Riga to call for removing Soviet monuments in Latvia, it was attended by approximately 5,000 people. The demolition began 22 August 2022 and on 25 August 2022, the obelisk was toppled. In 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the street on which the Embassy of the Russian Federation is located was renamed \"Independent Ukraine Street\".\nDespite legal changes, problems have arisen in the city in relation to large construction and reconstruction projects with developers increasingly looking for opportunities to use underground spaces. While this opens up the possibility for new archaeological research to be undertaken, it is decreasing in situ archaeological preservation.\nGeography.\nRiga is one of the largest cities in the three Baltic states: (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia). Riga is home to approximately one tenth of the three Baltic countries' combined population.\nAdministrative divisions.\nRiga's administrative divisions consist of six administrative entities: Central, Kurzeme and Northern districts and the Latgale, Vidzeme and Zemgale suburbs. Three entities were established on 1 September 1941, and the other three were established in October 1969. There are no official lower-level administrative units, but the Riga City Council Development Agency is working on a plan, which officially makes Riga consist of 58 neighbourhoods. The current names were confirmed on 28 December 1990.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Riga is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfb\"). The coldest months are January and February, when the average temperature is but temperatures as low as can be observed almost every year on the coldest days. The proximity of the sea causes frequent autumn rains and fogs. Continuous snow cover may last eighty days. The summers in Riga are mild and rainy with an average temperature of , while the temperature on the hottest days can exceed .\nGovernment.\nThe head of the city government in Riga is the mayor, or officially the Chairman of the Riga City Council. The mayor is elected by the city council. The mayor is assisted by one or more Vice Mayors (deputy mayors).\nThe current mayor is Vilnis \u0136irsis, who was elected on 17 August 2023 from New Unity, with support from \"Coalition for Cooperation\", consisting of New Unity, National Alliance/Latvian Regional Alliance (NA/LRA), Code for Riga, Honor to server Riga and For Latvia's Development factions.\nThe city council is a democratically elected institution and is the final decision-making authority in the city. The Council consists of 60 members or deputies who are elected every four years. The Presidium of the Riga City Council consists of the Chairman of the Riga City Council and the representatives delegated by the political parties or party blocks elected to the City Council. From February to October 2020, the offices of the Mayor and Vice Mayors were suspended and the council itself had been dissolved and replaced by an interim administration of representatives from three governmental ministries until snap elections were held in 2020.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWith 591,882 inhabitants in 2025, Riga is one of the largest cities in the Baltic states, though its population has decreased from just over 900,000 in 1991 and the population of Vilnius has just outnumbered that of Riga. Notable causes include emigration and low birth rates. According to the 2022 data, ethnic Latvians made up 47.4% of the population of Riga. Russians formed 35.7%, Belarusians 3.6%, Ukrainians 3.5%, Poles 1.7%, other ethnicities consisted 8.2%. By comparison, 63.0% of Latvia's total population was ethnically Latvian, 24.2% Russian, 3.1% Belarusian, 2.2% Ukrainian, 1.9% Polish, 1.1% are Lithuanian and the rest of other origins.\nIn contrast, just five years before the Soviet occupation of Latvia, according to the 1935 Census, when the population of Riga was 385,063 inhabitants, ethnic Latvians made up 63% of the city's population. In addition, Jews formed 11.3%, Germans 10%, Russians 7.4% and Poles 4.1%, other enthicities consisted 4.2%.\nUpon the restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991, Soviet-era immigrants (and any of their offspring born before 1991) were not automatically granted Latvian citizenship because they had migrated to the territory of Latvia during the years of Soviet occupation. The proportion of ethnic Latvians in Riga increased from 36.5% in 1989 to 47.4% in 2022. In contrast, the percentage of Russians fell from 47.3% to 35.7% in the same time period. In 2022 citizens of Latvia made up 79.0%, non-citizens 15.3% and citizens of other countries 5.6% of the population of Riga.\nEconomy.\nRiga is one of the key economic and financial centres of the Baltic states. Roughly half of all the jobs in Latvia are in Riga and the city generates more than 50% of Latvia's GDP as well as around half of Latvia's exports. The city boasts a diversified economy with strengths in information and communication technologies, global business services, manufacturing and a dynamic startup ecosystem. The biggest exporters are in wood products, IT, food and beverage manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, transport and metallurgy. Tourism is also a large industry in Riga and after a slowdown during the global economic recessions of the late 2000s, grew 22% in 2011 alone.\nThe city benefits from strong transport links, including Riga International Airport, and an active seaport. The forthcoming Rail Baltica project is expected to further enhance Riga's connectivity and integration into the European transport network, with the potential to reinforce its position as a strategic centre for trade in Northern Europe.\nThe Freeport of Riga is one of the largest in the Baltics. It handled a record 41.8 million tons of cargo in 2014 and completed a new development on Krievu Sala in 2018, with the aim of moving the port away from the central parts of the city. However, its cargo turnover had been reduced by a half by 2024, in large part due to decreased trade with Russia after the outbreak of Russo-Ukrainian War and the sanctions imposed in response to it.\nRiga was intended to become the global financial centre in the former Soviet Union. One bank, which provided high levels of secrecy for its customers, promoted itself as \"We are closer than Switzerland!\" (). On 28 July 1995, twenty Latvian banks with assistance of persons from the Paris Stock Exchange organised the Riga Stock Exchange which was the first Latvian stock exchange in Riga.\nTourism.\nRiga is one the leading travel destinations in the Baltic region in terms of overnight stays by foreign visitors. In 2024, the city welcomed over 1.1 million international tourists.\nSummer remains the peak season for tourism in Riga, however, it\u2019s also seeing a growing influx of visitors in December, largely due to the city's transformation into a festive destination during the holiday season. The Riga Christmas Market, located in the Old Town of Riga, serves as a key attraction during the Christmas period.\nThe most popular attractions include the Riga Zoo, House of the Blackheads, Riga Central Market, the Latvian National Museum of Art and the Latvian National Museum of Natural History, as well as its historic Old Town and the Art Nouveau architecture found in high concentration the centre of the city.\nIn addition to leisure tourism, Riga serves as a significant venue for international trade fairs and exhibitions. The city hosts a variety of annual events across sectors such as technology, agriculture, and business.\nCulture.\nMe\u017eaparks Great Bandstand.\nThe Me\u017eaparks Great Bandstand (Latvian: Me\u017eaparka Liel\u0101 estr\u0101de) is an open-air bandstand in Me\u017eaparks park. The Bandstand is the place where the Latvian Song and Dance Festival, one of the largest amateur choral and dancing events in the world and part of UNESCO Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity list, takes places every five years.\nWorld Choir Games.\nRiga hosted the biannual 2014 World Choir Games from 9 to 19 July 2014 which coincided with the city being named European Capital of Culture for 2014. The event, organised by the choral foundation, Interkultur, takes place at various host cities every two years and was originally known as the \"Choir Olympics\". The event regularly sees over 15,000 choristers in over 300 choirs from over 60 nations compete for gold, silver and bronze medals in over 20 categories. The competition is further divided into a Champions Competition and an Open Competition to allow choirs from all backgrounds to enter. Choral workshops and festivals are also witnessed in the host cities and are usually open to the public.\nFood.\nAs a modern European capital, Riga offers a diverse selection of restaurants, from traditional Latvian cuisine to various international influences. Its fine dining establishments also include two Michelin-starred restaurants. Additionally, the city organizes Riga Restaurant Weeks in both spring and autumn, during which participating restaurants offer specially curated menus.\nMusic and nightlife.\nPositivus Festival, the largest music festival in the Baltics, takes place in Lucavsala, after relocating from the coastal town of Salacgr\u012bva in 2022. Since then, it has featured performances by local and international artists like A$AP Rocky, Megan Thee Stallion, Sam Smith and Jamie XX.\nThe nightlife in Riga is scattered around various locations \u2013 the biggest concentration of bars and nightclubs, mostly oriented on tourists, can be found in the Old Town, but many popular establishments can be found in various parts of Central Riga and beyond, in areas such as Avoti, Teika, \u0100genskalns and others, as well as in creative quarters, for example Tallinas Kvart\u0101ls or Bri\u0101na Kvart\u0101ls.\nArchitecture.\nThe radio and TV tower of Riga is the tallest structure in Latvia and the Baltic States, and one of the tallest in the European Union, reaching . Riga centre also has many great examples of Gothic revival architecture, such as the Kalpaka Boulevard Library, and a bevy of Art Nouveau architecture, as well as a medieval old town.\nArt Nouveau.\nRiga has one of the largest collections of Art Nouveau buildings in the world, with at least 800 buildings. This is due to the fact that at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, when Art Nouveau was at the height of its popularity, Riga experienced an unprecedented financial and demographic boom. In the period from 1857 its population grew from 282,000 (256,200 in Riga itself and another 26,200 inhabitants beyond the city limits in the patrimonial district and military townlet of Ust-Dvinsk) to 472,100 in 1913. The middle class of Riga used their acquired wealth to build imposing apartment blocks outside the former city walls. Local architects, mostly graduates of Riga Technical University, adopted current European movements and in particular Art Nouveau. Between 1910 and 1913, between 300 and 500 new buildings were built each year in Riga, many of them in Art Nouveau style and most of them outside the old town.\nSports.\nRiga has a rich basketball history. In 1937, as the defending champions, in hosted the second edition of the EuroBasket tournament. In the 1950s, R\u012bgas ASK became the best club in the Soviet Union and also in Europe, winning the first three editions of the European Cup for Men's Champions Clubs from 1958 to 1960.\nIn 1960, ASK was not the only team from Riga to take the European crown. TTT Riga clinched their first title in the European Cup for Women's Champion Clubs, turning Riga into the capital city of European basketball because for the first and, to date, only time in the history of European basketball, clubs from the same city were concurrent European men's and women's club champions.\nRiga hosted one of the groups for EuroBasket 2015, and will host again for the third time in 2025, this time also hosting the knockout phase and the final. It also hosted the women\u2019s Eurobasket tournament in 2009.\nThe city also hosted the Men's Ice Hockey World Championships in 2006, 2021 and 2023.\nDissolved Football Clubs\n* Skonto FC \u2013 Skonto FC was a football club established in 1991. The club won fourteen successive Latvian Higher League titles. For a long time it provided the core of the Latvian national football team. Following financial problems, the club was demoted to the Latvian First League in 2016 and went bankrupt in December of that year and subsequently dissolved.\n* JFK Olimps \u2013 JFK Olimps played in the top division of Latvian football. The club was founded in 2005 and dissolved in 2012. According to a study from January 2011, the club was the youngest team in Europe, with an average age of 19.02 years.\nSports events.\nThe Riga Marathon, held annually in May, is one of the biggest sporting events in the country. In 2025 it recorded 40,122 participants from 109 countries around the world. The city has also hosted many notable one-off sports events, listed below.\nTransport.\nRiga, with its central geographic position and concentration of population, has always been the infrastructural hub of Latvia. Several national roads begin in Riga, and European route E22 crosses Riga from the east and west, while the Via Baltica crosses Riga from the south and north.\nAs a city situated by a river, Riga also has several bridges. The oldest-standing bridge is the Railway Bridge, which is also the only railroad-carrying bridge in Riga. The Stone Bridge (\"Akmens tilts\") connects Old Riga and P\u0101rdaugava; the Island Bridge (\"Salu tilts\") connects Maskavas For\u0161tate and P\u0101rdaugava via Za\u0137usala; and the Shroud Bridge (\"Van\u0161u tilts\") connects Old Riga and P\u0101rdaugava via \u0136\u012bpsala. In 2008, the first stage of the new Southern Bridge (\"Dienvidu tilts\") route across the Daugava was completed, and was opened to traffic on 17 November.\nThe Southern Bridge was the biggest construction project in the Baltic states in 20 years, and its purpose was to reduce traffic congestion in the city centre. Another major construction project is the planned Riga Northern transport corridor; its first segment detailed project was completed in 2015.\nThe Freeport of Riga facilitates cargo and passenger traffic by sea. Sea ferries connect Riga Passenger Terminal to Stockholm operated by Tallink.\nRiga has one active airport that serves commercial airlines\u2014the Riga International Airport (RIX), built in 1973. It is the primary hub of AirBaltic and a base for RyanAir. Renovation and modernisation of the airport was completed in 2001, coinciding with the 800th anniversary of the city. In 2006, a new terminal extension was opened. Extension of the runway was completed in October 2008, and the airport is now able to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A340, Boeing 747, 757, 767 and 777. Another terminal extension is under construction as of 2014[ [update]]. The annual number of passengers has grown from 310,000 in 1993 to 4.7\u00a0million in 2014, making Riga International Airport the largest in the Baltic States. A new multi-modal hub is planned around the airport with a Rail Baltica station and airport city development planned.\nThe former international airport of Riga, Spilve Airport, located from Riga city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation. Riga was also home to a military air base during the Cold War\u2014Rumbula Air Base.\nPublic transport in the city is provided by R\u012bgas Satiksme which operates a large number of trams, buses and trolleybuses on an extensive network of routes across the city. In addition, up until 2012 many private owners operated minibus services, after which the City Council established the unified transport company \"R\u012bgas mikroautobusu satiksme\", establishing a monopoly over the service.\nRiga International Coach Terminal provides domestic and international connections by coach.\nAs the population of Riga city started to approach 1 million people in the 1980s, the city became eligible (under the Soviet standards of the time) for the construction of a subway system Riga Metro, which would have been paid for by the Soviet government. However, the widespread protests from the public put an end to this plan, and the population decline from the 1990s onwards has made it irrelevant.\nRiga is connected to the rest of Latvia by domestic trains operated by the national carrier Passenger Train, whose headquarters are in Riga. The main railway station is the Riga Central Station. It has stops for public transport along the streets Satekles iela, 13. janv\u0101ra iela Marijas iela, and Mer\u0137e\u013ca iela. There are also international rail services to Lithuania and Estonia. A TEN-T project called Rail Baltica envisages building a high-speed railway line via Riga connecting Tallinn to Warsaw using standard gauge, is expected to be put into operation in 2030. Latvian Railways ( or \"LDz\") operates the Latvian Rail History Museum in Riga.\nUniversities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nRiga is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRiga also cooperates with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The terms and are respectively used in German in reference to empires and kingdoms. In English usage, the term \"the Reich\" often refers to Nazi Germany, also called \"the Third Reich\".\nThe term (sometimes translated to \"German Empire\") continued to be used even after the collapse of the German Empire and the abolition of the monarchy in 1918. There was no emperor, but many Germans had imperialistic ambitions. According to historian Richard J. Evans:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The continued use of the term \"German Empire\", , by the Weimar Republic ... conjured up an image among educated Germans that resonated far beyond the institutional structures Bismarck created: the successor to the Roman Empire; the vision of God's Empire here on earth; the universality of its claim to suzerainty; and in a more prosaic but no less powerful sense, the concept of a German state that would include all German speakers in central Europe\u2014\"one People, one Reich, one Leader\", as the Nazi slogan was to put it.\nThe term is used for historical empires in general, such as the Roman Empire (), Persian Empire (), and both the Tsardom of Russia and the Russian Empire (, literally \"Tsars' realm\"). , the name used for Austria today, is composed of and which, literally translated, means \"Eastern Realm\".

The terms \"First Reich\" and \"Second Reich\" are not used by historians, and the term \"Fourth Reich\" is mainly used in fiction and political humor, although it is also used by those who subscribe to neo-Nazism.\nEtymology.\nThe term is derived from the Germanic word which generally means \"\", but in German, it is typically used to designate a kingdom or an empire, especially the Roman Empire. The terms (, 'Imperium') and ('Imperial realm') are used in German to more specifically define an empire ruled by an emperor.\n is comparable in meaning and development (as well as descending from the same Proto-Indo-European root) to the English word \"realm\" (via French 'kingdom' from Latin 'royal').\nThe German noun \"Reich\" is derived from , which together with its cognates in , , and is derived from a Common Germanic .\nThe English noun survives only in the compounds \"bishopric\" and \"archbishopric\".\nThe German adjective , on the other hand, has an exact cognate in English rich. Both the noun () and the adjective () are derivations based on the Common Germanic \"ruler, king\", reflected in Gothic as , glossing \"leader, ruler, chieftain\".\nIt is probable that the Germanic word was not inherited from pre-Proto-Germanic, but rather loaned from Celtic (i.e. Gaulish \"r\u012bx\", Welsh , both meaning 'king') at an early time.\nThe word has many cognates outside of Germanic and Celtic, notably and .

The common contemporary Latin legal term used in documents of the Holy Roman Empire was for a long time \"regnum\" (\"rule, domain, empire\", such as in \"Regnum Francorum\" for the Frankish Kingdom) before \"imperium\" was in fact adopted, the latter first attested in 1157, whereas the parallel use of \"regnum\" never fell out of use during the Middle Ages.\nModern age.\nAt the beginning of the modern age, some circles redubbed the HRE into the \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" (\"\"), a symptom of the formation of a German nation state as opposed to the multinational state the Empire was throughout its history.\nResistance against the French Revolution with its concept of the state brought a new movement to create a German \"ethnical state\", especially after the Napoleonic Wars. Ideal for this state was the Holy Roman Empire; the legend arose that Germany were \"un-defeated when unified\", especially after the Franco-Prussian War (\"\", lit. \"German-French war\"). Before that, the German question ruptured this \"German unity\" after the 1848 Revolution before it was achieved, however; Austria-Hungary as a multinational state could not become part of the new \"German empire\", and nationality conflicts in Prussia with the Prussian Poles arose (\"We can never be Germans \u2013 Prussians, every time!\").\nThe advent of national feeling and the movement to create an ethnically German Empire did lead directly to nationalism in 1871. Ethnic minorities declined since the beginning of the modern age; the Polabs, Sorbs and even the once important Low Germans had to assimilate themselves. This marked the transition between Antijudaism, where converted Jews were accepted as full citizens (in theory), to Antisemitism, where Jews were thought to be from a different ethnicity that could never become German. Apart from all those ethnic minorities being de facto extinct, even today the era of national feeling is taught in history in German schools as an important stepping-stone on the road to a German nation.\nGerman Reich.\nIn the case of the Hohenzollern Empire (1871\u20131918), the official name of the country was (\"German Realm\"), because under the Constitution of the German Empire, it was legally a confederation of German states under the permanent presidency of the King of Prussia. The constitution granted the King of Prussia the title of \"German Emperor\" (\"Deutscher Kaiser\"), but this referred to the German nation rather than directly to the \"state\" of Germany.\nThe exact translation of the term \"German Empire\" would be . This name was sometimes used informally for Germany between 1871 and 1918, but it was disliked by the first German Emperor, Wilhelm I, and never became official.\nThe unified Germany which arose under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1871 was the first entity that was officially called in German \"\". remained the official name of Germany until 1945, although these years saw three very different political systems more commonly referred to in English as: \"the German Empire\" (1871\u20131918), the Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933; this term is a post-World War II coinage not used at the time), and Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945).\nDuring the Weimar Republic.\nAfter 1918 \"Reich\" was usually not translated as \"Empire\" in English-speaking countries, and the title was instead simply used in its original German. During the Weimar Republic the term ' and the prefix ' referred not to the idea of empire but rather to the institutions, officials, affairs etc. of the whole country as opposed to those of one of its constituent federal states ('), in the same way that the terms ' (federation) and \"\" (federal) are used in Germany today, and comparable to \"The Crown\" in Commonwealth countries and \"The Union\" in the United States.\nDuring the Nazi period.\nThe Nazis sought to legitimize their power historiographically by portraying their ascendancy to rule as the direct continuation of an ancient German past. They adopted the term \"\" (\"Third Empire\" \u2013 usually rendered in English in the partial translation \"the Third \"Reich\"\"), first used in a 1923 book entitled \"Das Dritte Reich\" by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, that counted the medieval Holy Roman Empire (which nominally survived until the 19th century) as the first and the 1871\u20131918 monarchy as the second, which was then to be followed by a \"reinvigorated\" third one. The Nazis ignored the previous 1918\u20131933 Weimar period, which they denounced as a historical aberration, contemptuously referring to it as \"the System\". In the summer of 1939, the Nazis themselves actually banned the continued use of the term in the press, ordering it to use expressions such as \"Nationalsozialistisches Deutschland\" (\"National Socialist Germany\"), \"Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich\" (\"Greater German Reich\"), or simply \"Deutsches Reich\" (German Reich) to refer to the German state instead. It was Adolf Hitler's personal desire that \"Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich\" and \"nationalsozialistischer Staat\" (\"[the] National Socialist State\") would be used in place of \"Drittes Reich\". \"Reichskanzlei Berchtesgaden\" (\"Reich Chancellery Berchtesgaden\"), another nickname of the regime (named after the eponymous town located in the vicinity of Hitler's mountain residence where he spent much of his time in office) was also banned at the same time, despite the fact that a sub-section of the Chancellery was in fact installed there to serve Hitler's needs.\nAlthough the term \"Third Reich\" is still commonly used in reference to the Nazi dictatorship, historians avoid using the terms \"First Reich\" and \"Second Reich\", which are seldom found outside Nazi propaganda. During and following the \"Anschluss\" (annexation) of Austria in 1938, Nazi propaganda also used the political slogan \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein F\u00fchrer\" (\"One nation, one \"Reich\", one leader\"), in order to enforce pan-German sentiment. The term ' (\"old Reich\"; cf. French \"ancien regime\" for monarchical France) is sometimes used to refer to the Holy Roman Empire. The term ' was also used after the Anschluss to denote Germany with its pre-1938 post-World War I borders. Another name that was popular during this period was the term \"Tausendj\u00e4hriges Reich\" (\"Thousand-Year Reich\"), the millennial connotations of which suggested that Nazi Germany would last a thousand years.\nThe Nazis also spoke of enlarging the then-established Greater German Reich into a \"Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation\" (\"Gro\u00dfgermanisches Reich Deutscher Nation\") by gradually and directly annexing all of the historically Germanic countries and regions of Europe into the Nazi state (Flanders, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden etc.).\nPossible negative connotations in modern usage.\nA number of previously neutral words which were used by the Nazis later took on negative connotations in German (e.g. ' or '); while in many contexts ' is not one of them (\"Frankreich\", France; \"R\u00f6misches Reich\", Roman Empire; \"\u00d6sterreich\", Austria), it can imply German imperialism or strong nationalism if it is used to describe a political or governmental entity. ' has thus not been used in official terminology since 1945, though it is still found in the name of the Reichstag building, which since 1999 has housed the German federal parliament, the Bundestag. The decision not to rename the Reichstag building was taken only after long debate in the Bundestag; even then, it is described officially as \"\" (Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag). As seen in this example, the term \"Bund\" (federation) has replaced \"Reich\" in the names of various state institutions such as the army (\"Bundeswehr\"). The term \"Reichstag\" also remains in use in the German language as the term for the parliaments of some foreign monarchies, such as Sweden's Riksdag and Japan's pre-war Imperial Diet.\nLimited usage in the railway system of the German Democratic Republic.\nThe exception is that during the Cold War, the East German railway incongruously continued to use the name \"Deutsche Reichsbahn\" (German Reich Railways), which had been the name of the national railway during the Weimar Republic and the Nazi era. Even after German reunification in October 1990, the Reichsbahn continued to exist for over three years as the operator of the railroad in eastern Germany, ending finally on 1 January 1994 when the Reichsbahn and the western Deutsche Bundesbahn were merged to form the unified state-owned enterprise Deutsche Bahn AG.\nUsage in related languages.\nIn Scandinavian languages.\nThe cognate of the word Reich is used in all Scandinavian languages with the identical meaning, i.e. \"realm\". It is spelled ' in Danish and older Norwegian (before the 1907 spelling reform) and ' in Swedish and modern Norwegian. The word is traditionally used for sovereign entities, generally simply means \"country\" or \"nation\" (in the sense of a sovereign state) and does not have any special or political connotations. It does not imply any particular form of government, but it implies that the entity is both of a certain size and of a certain standing, like the Scandinavian kingdoms themselves; hence the word might be considered exaggerated for very small states like a city-state. Its use as a stand-alone word is more widespread than in contemporary German, but most often, it refers to the three Scandinavian states themselves and certain historical empires, like the Roman Empire. The standard word for a \"country\" is usually \"land\", and there are many other words used to refer to countries.\nThe word is part of the official names of Denmark, Norway and Sweden in the form of , , and , all meaning kingdom, or literally the \"realm of a king\" (a kingdom can also be called in Danish and Norwegian and or in Swedish, direct cognates of the English word). Two regions in Norway that were petty kingdoms before the unification of Norway around 900 AD have retained the word in the names (see Ringerike and Romerike). The word is also used in \"\", with the current spelling , the name of Sweden in Swedish. Thus in the official name of Sweden, , the word appears twice.\nThe derived prefix (Danish and pre-1907 Norwegian) and (Swedish and Norwegian) and implies nationwide or under central jurisdiction. Examples include and , names for a national road in Swedish and Norwegian. It is also present in the names of numerous institutions in all the Scandinavian countries, such as (the agency responsible for oversight of the state finances in Denmark) and (commonly known as just ), the central bank of Sweden. It is also used in words such as (Danish), (Swedish) and (Norwegian), relating to foreign countries and other things from abroad. The opposite word is //, meaning domestic.\nThe adjective form of the word, in Danish and in Swedish/Norwegian, means \"rich\" like in other Germanic languages.\nRijk/ryk.\n is the Dutch and the Afrikaans and Frisian equivalent of the German word .\nIn a political sense in the Netherlands and Belgium, the word often connotes a connection with the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Belgium as opposed to the European part of the Netherlands or the provincial or municipal governments. The is the executive body of the Netherlands' government and the that of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a similar distinction is found in (laws) versus (kingdom laws) or the now-abolished (lit.\u2009'guard of the realm') for the Belgian Gendarmerie. The word can also be found in institutions like the Rijkswaterstaat, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu and Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. The German way of applying is largely followed in Dutch, resulting in (France), (Austria) and the historical and for the Persian and Roman Empires respectively. \nIn colloquial speech, usually means working for the central government rather than the provincial or municipal government, much as Americans refer to the \"federal\" government.\nIn Afrikaans, refers to rulership and area of governance (mostly a kingdom), but in a modern sense, the term is used in a much more figurative sense (e.g. 'the Heavenly Kingdom', China), as the sphere under one's control or influence:\nAs in German, the adjective / also means \"rich\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25520", "revid": "40943757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25520", "title": "Reggae", "text": "Music genre\nReggae () is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also refers to the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. The 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \"Do the Reggay\" was the first popular song to use the word \"reggae\", effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience.\nOrigins and influences.\nReggae developed from earlier Jamaican genres including mento, ska, and rocksteady, and is rooted in traditional drumming styles such as Kumina, Pukkumina, Revival Zion, Nyabinghi, and burru. It incorporates elements of rhythm and blues, jazz, calypso, mento (a rural folk form that served as dance music and an alternative to church singing), and traditional African folk rhythms.\nMusical characteristics.\nReggae is distinguished by a slower tempo than ska or rocksteady, a strong emphasis on the downbeat in the drum and bass, and short, staccato guitar or piano chords on the offbeat. The bass guitar plays a central role, with a thick, heavy tone and the high frequencies reduced to accentuate the low end. Call-and-response patterns are common, and the rhythm section often uses the bass as a percussion instrument, a feature carried over from rocksteady. Notable rhythm players include Jackie Jackson, Carlton Barrett, Lloyd Brevett, Paul Douglas, Lloyd Knibb, Winston Grennan, Sly Dunbar, and Anthony \"Benbow\" Creary.\nVocals are often delivered in Jamaican Patois, Jamaican English, or Iyaric. Lyrical themes range from political and social commentary to religion, love, and leisure activities.\nCultural connections.\nReggae is closely associated with Rastafari, an Afrocentric religion that emerged in Jamaica in the 1930s promoting pan-Africanism. From the 1970s onwards, its international success helped to spread Rastafarian beliefs, with musicians often seen as cultural messengers and agents of change.\nGlobal spread.\nReggae has reached audiences worldwide, often fusing with other genres and incorporating local instruments. In Latin America, reggae en Espa\u00f1ol originated in Panama before spreading to Venezuela and across South America. In the United Kingdom, Caribbean music, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, spawning several subgenres and fusions, with many reggae artists beginning their careers there. European musicians have also drawn heavily on Jamaican and Caribbean traditions. In Africa, the genre's profile was boosted by the visit of Bob Marley to Zimbabwe in 1980.\nEtymology.\nThe 1967 edition of the \"Dictionary of Jamaican English\" lists \"reggae\" as \"a recently estab. sp. for \"rege\"\", as in \"rege-rege\", a word that can mean either \"rags, ragged clothing\" or \"a quarrel, a row\". \"Reggae\" as a musical term first appeared in print with the 1968 rocksteady hit \"Do the Reggay\" by the Maytals which named the genre.\nReggae historian Steve Barrow credits Clancy Eccles with altering the Jamaican patois word \"streggae\" (loose woman) into \"reggae\". However, Toots Hibbert said:\nThere's a word we used to use in Jamaica called \"streggae\". If a girl is walking and the guys look at her and say \"Man, she's streggae\" it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, \"OK man, let's do the reggay.\" It was just something that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing \"Do the reggay, do the reggay\" and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.\nBob Marley said that the word \"reggae\" came from a Spanish term for \"the king's music\". The liner notes of \"To the King\", a compilation of Christian gospel reggae, suggest that the word \"reggae\" was derived from the Latin meaning 'to the king'.\nHistory.\nPrecursors.\nReggae's direct origins are in the ska and rocksteady of 1960s Jamaica, strongly influenced by traditional Caribbean mento and calypso music, as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues. Ska was originally a generic title for Jamaican music recorded between 1961 and 1967 and emerged from Jamaican R&amp;B, which was based largely on American R&amp;B and doo-wop. Rastafari entered some countries primarily through reggae music; thus, the movement in these places is more stamped by its origins in reggae music and social milieu. The Rastafari movement was a significant influence on reggae, with Rasta drummers like Count Ossie taking part in seminal recordings. One of the predecessors of reggae drumming is the Nyabinghi rhythm, a style of ritual drumming performed as a communal meditative practice in Rastafarian culture.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, phonograph records became of central importance to the Jamaican music industry, playing a significant cultural and economic role in the development of reggae music. \"In the early 1950s, Jamaican entrepreneurs began issuing 78s\" but this format would soon be superseded by the 7\" single, first released in 1949. In 1951 the first recordings of mento music were released as singles and showcased two styles of mento: an acoustic rural style, and a jazzy pop style. Other 7\" singles to appear in Jamaica around this time were covers of popular American R&amp;B hits, made by Kingston sound system operators to be played at public dances. Meanwhile, Jamaican expatriates started issuing 45s on small independent labels in the United Kingdom, many mastered directly from Jamaican 45s.\nSka arose in Jamaican studios in the late 1950s, developing from this mix of American R&amp;B, mento and calypso music. Notable for its jazz-influenced horn riffs, ska is characterized by a quarter note walking bass line, guitar and piano offbeats, and a drum pattern with cross-stick snare and bass drum on the backbeat and open hi-hat on the offbeats. When Jamaica gained independence in 1962, ska became the music of choice for young Jamaicans seeking music that was their own. Ska also became popular among mods in Britain.\nIn the mid-1960s, ska gave rise to rocksteady, a genre slower than ska featuring more romantic lyrics and less prominent horns. Theories abound as to why Jamaican musicians slowed the ska tempo to create rocksteady; one is that the singer Hopeton Lewis was unable to sing his hit song \"Take It Easy\" at a ska tempo. The name \"rocksteady\" was codified after the release of a single by Alton Ellis. Many rocksteady rhythms later were used as the basis of reggae recordings, whose slower tempos allowed for the \"double skank\" guitar strokes on the offbeat.\nEmergence in Jamaica.\nReggae developed from ska and rocksteady in the late 1960s. Larry And Alvin's \"Nanny Goat\" and the Beltones' \"No More Heartaches\" were among the songs in the genre. The beat was distinctive from rocksteady in that it dropped any of the pretensions to the smooth, soulful sound that characterized slick American R&amp;B, and instead was closer in kinship to US southern funk, being heavily dependent on the rhythm section to drive it along. Reggae's great advantage was its almost limitless flexibility: from the early, jerky sound of Lee Perry's \"People Funny Boy\", to the uptown sounds of Third World's \"Now That We've Found Love\", it was an enormous leap through the years and styles, yet both are instantly recognizable as reggae. The shift from rocksteady to reggae was illustrated by the organ shuffle pioneered by Jamaican musicians like Jackie Mittoo and Winston Wright and featured in transitional singles \"Say What You're Saying\" (1968) by Eric \"Monty\" Morris and \"People Funny Boy\" (1968) by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry.\nEarly 1968 was when the first \"bona fide\" reggae records were released: \"Nanny Goat\" by Larry Marshall and \"No More Heartaches\" by the Beltones. That same year, the newest Jamaican sound began to spawn big-name imitators in other countries. American artist Johnny Nash's 1968 hit \"Hold Me Tight\" has been credited with first putting reggae in the American listener charts. Around the same time, reggae influences were starting to surface in rock and pop music; one example is 1968's \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" by the Beatles.\nThe Wailers, a band started by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer in 1963, is perhaps the most recognized band that made the transition through all three stages of early Jamaican popular music: ska, rocksteady and reggae. Over a dozen Wailers songs are based on or use a line from Jamaican mento songs. Other significant ska artists who made the leap to reggae include Prince Buster, Desmond Dekker, Ken Boothe, and Millie Small, best known for her 1964 blue-beat/ska cover version of \"My Boy Lollipop\" which was a smash hit internationally.\nNotable Jamaican producers influential in the development of ska into rocksteady and reggae include: Coxsone Dodd, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Leslie Kong, Duke Reid, Joe Gibbs and King Tubby. Chris Blackwell, who founded Island Records in Jamaica in 1960, relocated to England in 1962, where he continued to promote Jamaican music. He formed a partnership with Lee Gopthal's Trojan Records in 1968, which released reggae in the UK until bought by Saga records in 1974.\nInternational popularity.\nReggae's influence bubbled to the top of the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts in late 1972. First Three Dog Night hit No. 1 in September with a cover of the Maytones' version of \"Black and White\". Then Johnny Nash was at No. 1 for four weeks in November with \"I Can See Clearly Now\". Paul Simon's single \"Mother And Child Reunion\" \u2013 a track which he recorded in Kingston, Jamaica with Jimmy Cliff's backing group \u2013 was ranked by Billboard as the No. 57 song of 1972.\nIn 1972, the film \"The Harder They Come\" starring Jimmy Cliff was released and introduced Jamaican music to cinema audiences outside Jamaica. Though the film achieved cult status, its limited appeal meant that it had a smaller impact than Eric Clapton's 1974 cover of Bob Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" which made it onto the playlists of mainstream rock and pop radio stations worldwide. However, the film's hit soundtrack, which debuted in North America in February 1973, is considered to have \"brought reggae to the world.\" In addition, Clapton's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" used modern rock production and recording techniques and faithfully retained most of the original reggae elements; it was a breakthrough pastiche devoid of any parody and played an important part in bringing the music of Bob Marley to a wider rock audience. However, the film's hit soundtrack, which debuted in North America in February 1973, is considered to have \"brought reggae to the world.\" By the mid-1970s, authentic reggae dub plates and specials were getting some exposure in the UK on John Peel's radio show, who promoted the genre for the rest of his career. Around the same time, British filmmaker Jeremy Marre documented the Jamaican music scene in \"Roots Rock Reggae\", capturing the heyday of Roots reggae.\nWhile the quality of Reggae records produced in Jamaica took a turn for the worse following the oil crisis of the 1970s, reggae produced elsewhere began to flourish. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the UK punk rock scene flourished, and reggae was a notable influence. The DJ Don Letts would play reggae and punk tracks at clubs such as The Roxy. Punk bands such as the Clash, the Ruts, the Members, the Police and the Slits played many reggae-influenced songs. Around the same time, reggae music took a new path in the UK; one that was created by the multiracial makeup of England's inner cities and exemplified by groups like Steel Pulse, Aswad and UB40, as well as artists such as Smiley Culture and Carroll Thompson. The Jamaican ghetto themes in the lyrics were replaced with UK inner city themes, and Jamaican patois became intermingled with Cockney slang. In South London around this time, a new subgenre of lovers rock, was being created. Unlike the Jamaican music of the same name which was mainly dominated by male artists such as Gregory Isaacs, the South London genre was led by female singers like Thompson and Janet Kay. The UK Lovers Rock had a softer and more commercial sound. Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include Third World, Black Uhuru and Sugar Minott. The Grammy Awards introduced the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album category in 1985.\nWomen also play a role in the reggae music industry personnel such as Olivia Grange, president of Specs-Shang Musik; Trish Farrell, president of Island/Jamaica; Lisa Cortes, president of Loose Cannon; Jamaican-American Sharon Gordon, who has worked in the independent reggae music industry.\nReggae heritage.\nJamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding made February 2008 the first annual Reggae Month in Jamaica. To celebrate, the Recording Industry Association of Jamaica (RIAJam) held its first Reggae Academy Awards on 24 February 2008. In addition, Reggae Month included a six-day Global Reggae conference, a reggae film festival, two radio station award functions, and a concert tribute to the late Dennis Brown, who Bob Marley cited as his favorite singer. On the business side, RIAJam held events focused on reggae's employment opportunities and potential international revenue. . Reggae Month 2019 in Jamaica was welcomed with multiple events ranging from corporate reggae functions to major celebrations in honour of Bob Marley's Birthday on 6 February to a tribute concert in honour of Dennis Brown on 24 February along with a sold-out concert by 2019 Reggae Grammy nominated artiste Protoje for his A Matter of Time Live held at Hope Gardens in Kingston on 23 February.\nIn November 2018 \"reggae music of Jamaica\" was added to the UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity the decision recognised reggae's \"contribution to international discourse on issues of injustice, resistance, love and humanity underscores the dynamics of the element as being at once cerebral, socio-political, sensual and spiritual.\"\nCod reggae.\nThe term cod reggae is popularly used to describe reggae done by non-Caribbean people, often in a disparaging manner because of perceived inauthenticity. Boy George has been described as \"one of the great cod reggae artists of all time.\"\nMusical characteristics.\nStylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues (R&amp;B), jazz, mento, calypso, African, and Latin American music, as well as other genres. Reggae scenes consist of two guitars, one for rhythm and one for lead\u2014drums, congas, and keyboards, with a couple of vocalists.\nReggae is played in time; its repeating patterns of alternating stronger and weaker beats do not lend themselves to other time signatures such as . One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure, often referred to as the skank.\nThis rhythmic pattern accents the second and fourth beats in each bar and combines with the drum's emphasis on beat three to create a unique sense of phrasing. The reggae offbeat can be counted so that it falls between each count as an \"and\" (example: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ... , etc.) or counted as a half-time feel at twice the tempo so it falls on beats 2 and 4. This is in contrast to the way most other popular genres focus on beat one, the \"downbeat\".\nThe tempo of reggae is usually slower than ska or rocksteady. The slower tempo, the guitar/piano offbeats, the emphasis on the third beat, and the use of syncopated, melodic bass lines differentiate reggae from other music, although other musical styles have incorporated some of these innovations.\nDrums and other percussion.\nReggae drummers often involved these three tips for other reggae performers: (1) go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, (2) use any available material to stuff the bass drum so that it tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy thud, and (3) go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the hi-hat for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents.\nGuitars.\nThe guitar in reggae usually plays on the off beat of the rhythm. So if one is counting in time and counting \"1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ...\", one would play a downstroke on the \"and\" part of the beat. A musical figure known as skank or the 'bang\" has a very dampened, short and scratchy chop sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following eighth-note beats on the up-stroke. An example is the intro to \"Stir It Up\" by the Wailers. Artist and producer Derrick Harriott says, \"What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it.\"\nKeyboards.\nThe reggae organ-shuffle is unique to reggae. In the original version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove that was used in the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument.\nHorns.\nThe three-piece horn section, consisting of trumpet, trombone, and saxophone, creates harmonies that are distinctive of reggae music. Dub horn sections found with artists like John Brown's Body create a soundscape that is unmistakable.\nVocals.\nLyrical themes.\nReggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Many early reggae bands covered Motown or Atlantic soul and funk songs. Some reggae lyrics attempt to raise the political consciousness of the audience, such as by criticizing materialism, or by informing the listener about controversial subjects such as apartheid. Many reggae songs promote the use of cannabis (also known as \"herb\", \"ganja\", or \"sinsemilla\"), considered a sacrament in the Rastafari movement. There are many artists who utilize religious themes in their music \u2013 whether it be discussing a specific religious topic, or simply giving praise to God (Jah). Other common socio-political topics in reggae songs include black nationalism, anti-racism, anti-colonialism, anti-capitalism and criticism of political systems and \"Babylon\".\nIn recent years, Jamaican (and non-Jamaican) reggae musicians have used more positive themes in reggae music. The music is widely considered a treasured cultural export for Jamaica, so musicians who still desire progress for their island nation have begun focusing on themes of hopefulness, faith, and love. For elementary children, reggae songs such as \"Give a Little Love\", \"One Love\", or \"Three Little Birds\", all written by Bob Marley, can be sung and enjoyed for their optimism and cheerful lyrics.\nCriticism of dancehall and reggae lyrics.\nSome dancehall and ragga artists have been criticised for homophobia, including threats of violence. Buju Banton's song \"Boom Bye-Bye\" states that gays \"haffi dead\" (have to die). Other notable dancehall artists who have been accused of homophobia include Elephant Man, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man. The controversy surrounding anti-gay lyrics has led to the cancellation of UK tours by Beenie Man and Sizzla. Toronto, Canada has also seen the cancellation of concerts due to artists such as Elephant Man and Sizzla refusing to conform to similar censorship pressures.\nAfter lobbying from the Stop Murder Music coalition, the dancehall music industry agreed in 2005 to stop releasing songs that promote hatred and violence against gay people. In June 2007, Beenie Man, Sizzla and Capleton signed up to the Reggae Compassionate Act, in a deal brokered with top dancehall promoters and Stop Murder Music activists. They renounced homophobia and agreed to \"not make statements or perform songs that incite hatred or violence against anyone from any community\". Five artists targeted by the anti-homophobia campaign did not sign up to the act, including Elephant Man, TOK, Bounty Killa and Vybz Kartel. Buju Banton and Beenie Man both gained positive press coverage around the world for publicly renouncing homophobia by signing the Reggae Compassion Act. However, both of these artists have since denied any involvement in anti-homophobia work and both deny having signed any such act.\nGlobal significance.\nReggae has spread to many countries around the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres. In November 2018 UNESCO added the \"reggae music of Jamaica\" to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nAmericas.\nReggae en Espa\u00f1ol spread from mainland South American Caribbean from Venezuela and Guyana to the rest of South America. It does not have any specific characteristics other than being sung in Spanish, usually by artists of Latin American origin. Samba reggae originated in Brazil as a blend of samba with Jamaican reggae. Reggae also has a presence in Veracruz, Mexico. The most notable Jarocho reggae group being Los Aguas Aguas from Xalapa. Some of the most popular reggae groups across Latin America come from the Southern Cone, such as the Chilean band Gondwana, and the Argentinian band Los Cafres. The Puerto Rican band Cultura Prof\u00e9tica is also widely recognized in the region. Hispanic reggae includes three elements: the incorporation of the Spanish language; the use of translations and versions based on known riddims and background music; and regional consciousness. It is a medium of rebellious contestation rising from the underground. Hispanic reggae is related to rap, sharing characteristics that can be found not only in the social conditions in which they developed in the region but also in the characteristics of social sectors and classes that welcome them.\nBrazilian samba-reggae utilized themes such as the civil rights movement and the Black Soul movement, and especially the Jamaican independence movement since the 1960s and its messages in reggae and Rastafari. Thus, the sudden popularity of reggae music and musicians in Bahia, Brazil, was not the result of the effects of the transnational music industry, but of the need to establish cultural and political links with black communities across the Americas that had faced and were facing similar sociopolitical situations.\nMusically, it was the bloco afro Olodum and its lead percussionist, Neguinho do Samba, that began to combine the basic samba beat of the blocos with merengue, salsa, and reggae rhythms and debuted their experimentations in the carnival of 1986. The new (drumming patterns) were labeled \"samba-reggae\" and consisted basically of a pattern in which the surdo bass drums (four of them at minimum) divided themselves into four or five interlocking parts.\nIn the state of Maranh\u00e3o, in northeastern Brazil, reggae is a very popular genre. S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, the state capital, is known as the Brazilian Jamaica. The city has more than 200 , the name given to sound teams formed by DJs and sound systems with dozens of powerful amplifiers stacked. Reggae in Maranh\u00e3o has its own characteristics, such as melody and dance style, as well as having its own radio and television programs. In 2018, the Reggae Museum of Maranh\u00e3o was inaugurated, the second reggae museum in the world (after Jamaica), with the objective of preserving the state's reggae cultural history.\nIn the United States, bands like Rebelution, Slightly Stoopid, Dirty Heads, and Iration are the leading bands in a growing genre. Other bands like The Movement, The Elovaters, Artikal Sound \nSystem, Soja, Fortunate Youth, Hirie, Common Kings and Tribal Seeds have enthusiastic followings and typically provide a fantastic experience opening for more established acts or in early sets at larger reggae festivals. The live experience is a major part of the American Reggae world and the presence of so many emerging bands to combine with established international acts has allowed the movement to grow in recent years. \nThe American reggae scene is heavily centred in Southern California, with large scenes also in New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Miami, and Honolulu. For decades, Hawaiian reggae has had a big following on the Hawaiian islands and the West coast of the US. On the east coast upstate NY has seen a rise in original roots reggae bands such as Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad and John Brown's Body who were inspired by Jamaican reggae bands that performed in the area in the 1980s and 1990s. Matisyahu gained prominence by blending traditional Jewish themes with reggae. Compounding his use of the hazzan style, Matisyahu's lyrics are mostly English with more than occasional use of Hebrew and Yiddish. There is a large Caribbean presence in Toronto and Montreal, Canada, with English and French influences on the reggae genre. Canadian band Magic!'s 2013 single \"Rude\" was an international hit.\nIn 2017, Toots and the Maytals became the second reggae-based group to ever perform at the Coachella festival, after Chronixx in 2016.\nEurope.\nThe UK was a primary destination for Caribbean people looking to emigrate as early as the 1950s. Because of this, Caribbean music in the United Kingdom, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is lovers rock, but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like drum and bass and dubstep. The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK is the root of the larger European scene that exists today. Many of the world's most famous reggae artists began their careers in UK. Singer and Grammy Award-winning reggae artist Maxi Priest began his career with seminal British sound system Saxon Studio International.\nThree reggae-tinged singles from the Police's 1978 debut album, \"Outlandos d'Amour\", laid down the template for the basic structure of a lot of rock/reggae songwriting: a reggae-infused verse containing upstrokes on guitar or keyboards and a more aggressive, on-the-beat punk/rock attack during the chorus. The end of the 1970s featured a ska revival in the UK. By the end of the 1970s, a revival movement had begun in England, with such bands as the Specials, Madness, the (English) Beat, and the Selecter. The Specials' leader and keyboardist, Jerry Dammers, founded the 2 Tone record label, which released albums from the aforementioned racially integrated groups and was instrumental in creating a new social and cultural awareness. The 2 Tone movement referenced reggae's godfathers, popular styles (including the genre's faster and more dance-oriented precursors, ska and rocksteady), and previous modes of dress (such as black suits and porkpie hats) but updated the sound with a faster tempo, more guitar, and more attitude.\nBirmingham based reggae/pop music band UB40 were main contributors to the British reggae scene throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The achieved international success with hits such as \"Red Red Wine\", \"Kingston Town\" and \"(I Can't Help) Falling in Love with You.\"\nOther UK-based artists that had international impact include Aswad, Misty in Roots, Steel Pulse, Janet Kay, Tippa Irie, Smiley Culture and more recently Bitty McLean. There have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe, whose music and vocal styles are almost identical to contemporary Jamaican music. The best examples might be Alborosie (Italy) and Gentleman (Germany). Both Gentleman and Alborosie have had a significant chart impact in Jamaica, unlike many European artists. They have both recorded and released music in Jamaica for Jamaican labels and producers and are popular artists, likely to appear on many riddims. Alborosie has lived in Jamaica since the late 1990s and has recorded at Bob Marley's famous Tuff Gong Studios. Since the early 1990s, several Italian reggae bands have emerged, including Africa Unite, Gaudi, Reggae National Tickets, Sud Sound System, Pitura Freska and B.R. Stylers.\nReggae appeared on the Yugoslav popular music scene in the late 1970s, through sporadic songs by various rock acts, most prominently by new wave bands Haustor, \u0160arlo Akrobata, Aerodrom, Laboratorija Zvuka, Piloti, Zana, Du Du A and Grupa I. In the mid-1980s appeared Del Arno Band, often considered the first Yugoslav band whose sound was primarily reggae-oriented, remaining one of the most notable reggae acts in the region of former Yugoslavia.\nThe first homegrown Polish reggae bands started in the 1980s with groups like Izrael. Singer and songwriter Alexander Barykin was considered the father of Russian reggae. In Sweden, Uppsala Reggae Festival attracts attendees from across Northern Europe and features Swedish reggae bands such as Rootv\u00e4lta and Svenska Akademien as well as many popular Jamaican artists. Summerjam, Europe's biggest reggae festival, takes place in Cologne, Germany, and sees crowds of 25,000 or more. Rototom Sunsplash, a week-long festival which used to take place in Osoppo, Italy, until 2009, is now held in Benicassim, Spain, and gathers up to 150,000 visitors every year.\nIn Iceland reggae band Hj\u00e1lmar is well established having released six CDs in Iceland. They were the first reggae band in Iceland, but few Icelandic artists had written songs in the reggae style before their arrival on the Icelandic music scene. The Icelandic reggae scene is expanding and growing at a fast rate. RVK Soundsystem is the first Icelandic sound system, counting five DJs. They hold reggae nights in Reykjav\u00edk every month at clubs Hemmi og Valdi and more recently in Faktor\u00fd as the crowd has grown so much.\nIn Germany, the three successful Reggae Summerjam open-air festivals were crucial parts of the renaissance of Caribbean music in Germany but in 1990, conflict broke out between the two main German promoters who had cooperated so well during the previous seasons. With a lot of infighting and personal quarrels, each of them pursued his own preparations for a big summer festival. The result was that two open-air events look place on the same day.\nThe 1990 Reggae Summerjam was staged as usual, but for only one day. The event took place at the Lorelei Rock amphitheater, with artists like Mad Professor's Ariwa Posse with Macka B and Kofi, Mutabaruka, the Mighty Diamonds, the Twinkle Brothers, Manu Dibango and Fela Kuti.\nThe other, ex-partner of the once-united promoters succeeded in bringing the original Sunsplash package to Germany for the first time. Close to the Main River in the little village of Gemaunden deep in rural south-central Germany, they staged a two-day festival that drew a bigger crowd. About 10,000 people came from all over the country as well as from neighboring states like trance and, for the first time, East Germany to see the lineup of top reggae artists.\nAfrica.\nReggae in Africa was much boosted by the visit of Bob Marley to Zimbabwe on Independence Day 18 April 1980. Nigerian reggae had developed in the 1970s with artists such as Majek Fashek proving popular. In South Africa, reggae music has played a unifying role amongst cultural groups in Cape Town. During the years of Apartheid, the music bonded people from all demographic groups. Lucky Dube recorded 25 albums, fusing reggae with Mbaqanga. The Marcus Garvey Rasta camp in Phillipi is regarded by many to be the reggae and Rastafari center of Cape Town. Reggae bands play regularly at community centres such as the Zolani center in Nyanga.\nIn Uganda musician Papa Cidy is very popular. Arthur Lutta is also a Ugandan gospel reggae drummer known for his reggae style drumming. In Ethiopia, Dub Colossus and Invisible System emerged in 2008 sharing core members, and have received wide acclaim. In Mali, Askia Modibo fuses reggae with Malian music. In Malawi, Black Missionaries produced nine albums. In Ivory Coast a country where reggae music is extremely popular, Tiken Jah Fakoly fuses reggae with traditional music. Alpha Blondy from Ivory Coast sings reggae with religious lyrics. In Sudan, beats, drums and bass guitar from reggae have been adopted by local music. Reggae is very popular there among generations from young to old; some spiritual (religious) groups grow dreadlocks and feature reggae beats in their chants.\nAsia.\nIn the Philippines, several bands and sound systems play reggae and dancehall music. Their music is called Pinoy reggae. Japanese reggae emerged in the early 1980s. Reggae is becoming more prevalent in Thailand as well. Reggae music is quite popular in Sri Lanka. Aside from the reggae music and Rastafari influences seen ever more on Thailand's islands and beaches, a true reggae sub-culture is taking root in Thailand's cities and towns. Many Thai artists, such as Job 2 Do, keep the tradition of reggae music and ideals alive in Thailand.\nFamous Indian singer Kailash Kher and music producer Clinton Cerejo created \"Kalapi\", a rare fusion piece of reggae and Indian music for Coke Studio India. Other than this high-profile piece, reggae is confined to a small, emerging scene in India. Reggae Rajahs are a reggae and bass music sound system crew based out of New Delhi, India. They are the first Jamaican style sound system in India and creators of Goa Sunsplash Festival. Thaikkudam Bridge, a neo-Indian band based in Kerala, India, is known for introducing reggae into Indian regional blues.\nAustralia and the Pacific.\nReggae in Australia originated in the 1980s. Australian reggae groups include Sticky Fingers, Blue King Brown and Astronomy Class.\nBy the end of the 1980s, the local music scene in Hawaii was dominated by Jawaiian music, a local form of reggae.\nNew Zealand reggae was heavily inspired by Bob Marley's 1979 tour of the country and early reggae groups such as Herbs. The genre has seen many bands like Fat Freddy's Drop, Salmonella Dub, the Black Seeds and Katchafire emerging in more recent times, often involving fusion with electronica.\nIn 2017 the first-ever chart dedicated to reggae and dancehall music was established in Australia by radio presenter DJ Ragz, music producer DJ Wade and Dancehall Reggae Australia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Early 19th century methods of this type evolved into the electrical telegraph networks of the mid-to-late 19th century.\nRadio relay leagues.\nRadio amateurs have been early in arranging relay leagues, as is reflected in the name of the organization of American Radio Relay League (ARRL).\nRadio amateur message relay operations were originally conducted in the first two decades of the 20th century using Morse code via spark-gap transmitters. As vacuum tubes became affordable, operations shifted to more efficient manual telegraphy transmitters, referred to as \"CW\" (Continuous wave). Messages were relayed station-to-station, typically involving four or more re-transmission cycles to cover the continental United States, in an organized system of amateur radio networks. After World War II, voice and radioteletype implementations of the message relay system were employed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25522", "revid": "18731412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25522", "title": "History of radio", "text": "The history of radio had many contributors, beginning with the scientific discovery of electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) in the late 1800s, followed by technological development of improved devices for producing and receiving transmissions.\nRadio was at first employed for \"wireless telegraphy\", using on-off signalling such as Morse code, initially for private point-to-point communication. The invention in the early 1900s of devices capable of audio transmissions greatly increased its utility, most prominently with the introduction of broadcasting to a widespread, non-technical, audience.\nDiscovery.\nIn an 1864 presentation, published in 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed theories of electromagnetism and mathematical proofs demonstrating that light, radio and x-rays were all types of electromagnetic waves propagating through free space.\nBetween 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published the results of experiments wherein he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves (radio waves) through the air, proving Maxwell's electromagnetic theory.\nExploration of optical qualities.\nAfter their discovery, many scientists and inventors experimented with transmitting and detecting \"Hertzian waves\" (it would take almost 20 years for the term \"radio\" to be universally adopted for this type of electromagnetic radiation). Maxwell's theory showing that light and Hertzian electromagnetic waves were the same phenomenon at different wavelengths led \"Maxwellian\" scientists such as John Perry, Frederick Thomas Trouton and Alexander Trotter to assume they would be analogous to optical light.\nFollowing Hertz's untimely death in 1894, British physicist and writer Oliver Lodge presented a widely covered lecture on Hertzian waves at the Royal Institution on June 1 of the same year. Lodge focused on the optical qualities of the waves and demonstrated how to transmit and detect them (using an improved variation of French physicist \u00c9douard Branly's detector Lodge named the \"coherer\"). Lodge further expanded on Hertz's experiments showing how these new waves exhibited like light refraction, diffraction, polarization, interference and standing waves, confirming that Hertz' waves and light waves were both forms of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves. During part of the demonstration the waves were sent from the neighboring Clarendon Laboratory building, and received by an apparatus in the lecture theater.\nAfter Lodge's demonstrations researchers pushed their experiments further down the electromagnetic spectrum towards visible light to further explore the quasioptical nature at these wavelengths. Oliver Lodge and Augusto Righi experimented with 1.5 and 12\u00a0GHz microwaves respectively, generated by small metal ball spark resonators. Russian physicist Pyotr Lebedev in 1895 conducted experiments in the 50\u00a0GHz (6\u00a0millimeter) range. Bengali Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose conducted experiments at wavelengths of 60\u00a0GHz (5\u00a0millimeter) and invented waveguides, horn antennas, and semiconductor crystal detectors for use in his experiments. He would later write an essay, \"Adrisya Alok\" (\"Invisible Light\") on how in November 1895 he conducted a public demonstration at the Town Hall of Kolkata, India using millimeter-range-wavelength microwaves to trigger detectors that ignited gunpowder and rang a bell at a distance.\nProposed applications.\nBetween 1890 and 1892 physicists such as John Perry, Frederick Thomas Trouton and William Crookes proposed electromagnetic or Hertzian waves as a navigation aid or means of communication, with Crookes writing on the possibilities of wireless telegraphy based on Hertzian waves in 1892. Among physicists, what were perceived as technical limitations to using these new waves, such as delicate equipment, the need for large amounts of power to transmit over limited ranges, and their similarity to already existing optical light transmitting devices, led them to a belief that applications were very limited. The Serbian American engineer Nikola Tesla considered Hertzian waves relatively useless for long range transmission since \"light\" could not transmit further than the line of sight. There was speculation that this fog and stormy weather penetrating \"invisible light\" could be used in maritime applications such as lighthouses. The London journal \"The Electrician\" (December 1895) commented on Bose's achievements, saying \"we may in time see the whole system of coast lighting throughout the navigable world revolutionized by an Indian Bengali scientist working single-handedly in our Presidency College Laboratory.\"\nIn 1895, adapting the techniques presented in Lodge's published lectures, Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov built a lightning detector that used a coherer-based radio receiver. He presented it to the Russian Physical and Chemical Society on May 7, 1895.\nMarconi and radio telegraphy.\nIn 1894, the young Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began working on the idea of building long-distance wireless transmission systems based on the use of Hertzian waves (radio waves), a line of inquiry that he noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing. Marconi read through the literature and used the ideas of others who were experimenting with radio waves but did a great deal to develop devices such as portable transmitters and receiver systems that could work over long distances, turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment into a useful communication system. By August 1895, Marconi was field testing his system but even with improvements he was only able to transmit signals up to one-half mile, a distance Oliver Lodge had predicted in 1894 as the maximum transmission distance for radio waves. Marconi raised the height of his antenna and hit upon the idea of grounding his transmitter and receiver. With these improvements the system was capable of transmitting signals up to and over hills. This apparatus proved to be the first engineering-complete, commercially successful radio transmission system and Marconi went on to file British patent GB189612039A, \"Improvements in transmitting electrical impulses and signals and in apparatus there-for\", in 1896. This patent was granted in the UK on 2 July 1897.\nNautical and transatlantic transmissions.\nIn 1897, Marconi established a radio station on the Isle of Wight, England and opened his \"wireless\" factory in the former silk-works at Hall Street, Chelmsford, England, in 1898, employing around 60 people.\nOn 12 December 1901, using a kite-supported antenna for reception\u2014signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall, Marconi transmitted a message across the Atlantic Ocean to Signal Hill in St. John's, Newfoundland.\nMarconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907 between Clifden, Ireland, and Glace Bay, but even after this the company struggled for many years to provide reliable communication to others.\nMarconi's apparatus is also credited with saving the 700 people who survived the tragic \"Titanic\" disaster.\nAudio transmission.\nIn the late 1890s, Canadian-American inventor Reginald Fessenden came to the conclusion that he could develop a far more efficient system than the spark-gap transmitter and coherer receiver combination. To this end he worked on developing a high-speed alternator (referred to as \"an alternating-current dynamo\") that generated \"pure sine waves\" and produced \"a continuous train of radiant waves of substantially uniform strength\", or, in modern terminology, a continuous-wave (CW) transmitter. While working for the United States Weather Bureau on Cobb Island, Maryland, Fessenden researched using this setup for audio transmissions via radio. By the fall of 1900, he successfully transmitted speech over a distance of about 1.6 kilometers (one mile), which appears to have been the first successful audio transmission using radio signals. Although successful, the sound transmitted was far too distorted to be commercially practical. According to some sources, notably Fessenden's wife Helen's biography, on Christmas Eve 1906, Reginald Fessenden used an Alexanderson alternator and rotary spark-gap transmitter to make the first radio audio broadcast, from Brant Rock, Massachusetts. Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing \"O Holy Night\" on the violin and reading a passage from the Bible.\nAround the same time American inventor Lee de Forest experimented with an arc transmitter, which unlike the discontinuous pulses produced by spark transmitters, created a steady \"continuous wave\" signal that could be used for amplitude modulated (AM) audio transmissions. In February 1907 he transmitted electronic telharmonium music from his laboratory station in New York City. This was followed by tests that included, in the fall, Eugenia Farrar singing \"I Love You Truly\". In July 1907 he made ship-to-shore transmissions by radiotelephone\u2014race reports for the Annual Inter-Lakes Yachting Association (I-LYA) Regatta held on Lake Erie\u2014which were sent from the steam yacht \"Thelma\" to his assistant, Frank E. Butler, located in the Fox's Dock Pavilion on South Bass Island.\nBroadcasting.\nThe Dutch company \"Nederlandsche Radio-Industrie\" and its owner-engineer, Hanso Idzerda, made its first regular entertainment radio broadcast over station PCGG from its workshop in The Hague on 6 November 1919. The company manufactured both transmitters and receivers. Its popular program was broadcast four nights per week using narrow-band FM transmissions on 670 metres (448\u00a0kHz), until 1924 when the company ran into financial trouble.\nRegular entertainment broadcasts began in Argentina, pioneered by Enrique Tel\u00e9maco Susini and his associates. At 9 pm on August 27, 1920, Sociedad Radio Argentina aired a live performance of Richard Wagner's opera \"Parsifal\" from the Coliseo Theater in downtown Buenos Aires. Only about twenty homes in the city had receivers to tune in to this program.\nOn 31 August 1920 the \"Detroit News\" began publicized daily news and entertainment \"Detroit News Radiophone\" broadcasts, originally as licensed amateur station 8MK, then later as WBL and WWJ in Detroit, Michigan.\nUnion College in Schenectady, New York began broadcasting on October 14, 1920, over 2ADD, an amateur station licensed to Wendell King, an African-American student at the school. Broadcasts included a series of Thursday night concerts initially heard within a radius and later for a radius.\nIn 1922 regular audio broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the Marconi Research Centre 2MT at Writtle near Chelmsford, England.\nWavelength and frequency.\nIn early radio, and to a limited extent much later, the transmission signal of the radio station was specified in meters, referring to the wavelength, the length of the radio wave. This is the origin of the terms long wave, medium wave, and short wave radio. Portions of the radio spectrum reserved for specific purposes were often referred to by wavelength: the 40-meter band, used for amateur radio, for example. The relation between wavelength and frequency is reciprocal: the higher the frequency, the shorter the wave, and vice versa.\nAs equipment progressed, precise frequency control became possible; early stations often did not have a precise frequency, as it was affected by the temperature of the equipment, among other factors. Identifying a radio signal by its frequency rather than its length proved much more practical and useful, and starting in the 1920s this became the usual method of identifying a signal, especially in the United States. Frequencies specified in number of cycles per second (kilocycles, megacycles) were replaced by the more specific designation of hertz (cycles per second) about 1965.\nRadio companies.\nBritish Marconi.\nUsing various patents, the British Marconi company was established in 1897 by Guglielmo Marconi and began communication between coast radio stations and ships at sea. A year after, in 1898, they successfully introduced their first radio station in Chelmsford. This company, along with its subsidiaries Canadian Marconi and American Marconi, had a stranglehold on ship-to-shore communication. It operated much the way American Telephone and Telegraph operated until 1983, owning all of its equipment and refusing to communicate with non-Marconi equipped ships. Many inventions improved the quality of radio, and amateurs experimented with the uses of radio, thus planting the first seeds of broadcasting.\nTelefunken.\nThe company Telefunken was founded on May 27, 1903, as \"Telefunken society for wireless telefon\" of Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) and the Allgemeine Elektrizit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft (\"General Electricity Company\") as joint undertakings for radio engineering in Berlin. It continued as a joint venture of AEG and Siemens AG, until Siemens left in 1941. In 1911, Kaiser Wilhelm II sent Telefunken engineers to West Sayville, New York to erect three 600-foot (180-m) radio towers there. Nikola Tesla assisted in the construction. A similar station was erected in Nauen, creating the only wireless communication between North America and Europe.\nTechnological development.\nAmplitude-modulated (AM).\nThe invention of amplitude-modulated (AM) radio, which allows more closely spaced stations to simultaneously send signals (as opposed to spark-gap radio, where each transmission occupies a wide bandwidth) is attributed to Reginald Fessenden, Valdemar Poulsen and Lee de Forest.\nCrystal set receivers.\nThe most common type of receiver before vacuum tubes was the crystal set, although some early radios used some type of amplification through electric current or battery. Inventions of the triode amplifier, motor\u2013generator, and detector enabled audio radio. The use of amplitude modulation (AM), by which soundwaves can be transmitted over a continuous-wave radio signal of narrow bandwidth (as opposed to spark-gap radio, which sent rapid strings of damped-wave pulses that consumed much bandwidth and were only suitable for Morse-code telegraphy) was pioneered by Fessenden, Poulsen and Lee de Forest.\nThe art and science of crystal sets is still pursued as a hobby in the form of simple un-amplified radios that 'runs on nothing, forever'. They are used as a teaching tool by groups such as the Boy Scouts of America to introduce youngsters to electronics and radio. As the only energy available is that gathered by the antenna system, loudness is necessarily limited.\nVacuum tubes.\nDuring the mid-1920s, amplifying vacuum tubes revolutionized radio receivers and transmitters. John Ambrose Fleming developed a vacuum tube diode. Lee de Forest placed a screen, added a \"grid\" electrode, creating the triode.\nEarly radios ran the entire power of the transmitter through a carbon microphone. In the 1920s, the Westinghouse company bought Lee de Forest's and Edwin Armstrong's patent. During the mid-1920s, Amplifying vacuum tubes revolutionized radio receivers and transmitters. Westinghouse engineers developed a more modern vacuum tube.\nThe first radios still required batteries, but in 1926 the \"battery eliminator\" was introduced to the market. This tube technology allowed radios to be powered through the grid instead. They still required batteries to heat up the vacuum-tube filaments, but after the invention of indirectly heated vacuum tubes, the first completely battery free radios became available in 1927.\nIn 1929 a new screen grid tube called UY-224 was introduced, an amplifier designed to operate directly on alternating current.\nA problem with the early radios was fading stations and fluctuating volume. The invention of the superheterodyne receiver solved this problem, and the first radios with a heterodyne radio receiver went for sale in 1924. But it was costly, and the technology was shelved while waiting for the technology to mature, and in 1929 the Radiola 66 and Radiola 67 went for sale.\nLoudspeakers.\nIn the early days one had to use headphones to listen to radio. Later loudspeakers in the form of a horn of the type used by phonographs, equipped with a telephone receiver, became available. But the sound quality was poor. In 1926 the first radios with electrodynamic loudspeakers went for sale, which improved the quality significantly. At first the loudspeakers were separated from the radio, but soon radios would come with a built-in loudspeaker.\nOther inventions related to sound included the automatic volume control (AVC), first commercially available in 1928. In 1930 a tone control knob was added to the radios. This allowed listeners to improve imperfect broadcasting.\nThe magnetic cartridge, which was introduced in the mid 20's, greatly improved the broadcasting of music. When playing music from a phonograph before the magnetic cartridge, a microphone had to be placed close to a horn loudspeaker. The invention allowed the electric signals to be amplified and then fed directly to the broadcast transmitter.\nTransistor technology.\nFollowing development of transistor technology, bipolar junction transistors led to the development of the transistor radio. In 1954, the Regency company introduced a pocket transistor radio, the TR-1, powered by a \"standard 22.5 V Battery.\" In 1955, the newly formed Sony company introduced its first transistorized radio, the TR-55. It was small enough to fit in a vest pocket, powered by a small battery. It was durable, because it had no vacuum tubes to burn out. In 1957, Sony introduced the TR-63, the first mass-produced transistor radio, leading to the mass-market penetration of transistor radios. Over the next 20 years, transistors replaced tubes almost completely except for high-power transmitters.\nBy the mid-1960s, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) were using metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in their consumer products, including FM radio, television and amplifiers. Metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) provided a practical and economic solution for radio technology, and was used in mobile radio systems by the early 1970s.\nIntegrated circuit.\nThe first integrated circuit (IC) radio, P1740 by General Electric, became available in 1966.\nCar radio.\nThe first car radio was introduced in 1922, but it was so large that it took up too much space in the car. The first commercial car radio that could easily be installed in most cars went for sale in 1930.\nRadio telex.\nTelegraphy did not go away on radio. Instead, the degree of automation increased. On land-lines in the 1930s, teletypewriters automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse-code dialing to automate routing, a service called telex. For thirty years, telex was the cheapest form of long-distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel. For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents.\nTelex systems were adapted to short-wave radio by sending tones over single sideband. CCITT R.44 (the most advanced pure-telex standard) incorporated character-level error detection and retransmission as well as automated encoding and routing. For many years, telex-on-radio (TOR) was the only reliable way to reach some third-world countries. TOR remains reliable, though less-expensive forms of e-mail are displacing it. Many national telecom companies historically ran nearly pure telex networks for their governments, and they ran many of these links over short wave radio.\nDocuments including maps and photographs went by radiofax, or wireless photoradiogram, invented in 1924 by Richard H. Ranger of Radio Corporation of America (RCA). This method prospered in the mid-20th century and faded late in the century.\nRadio navigation.\nOne of the first developments in the early 20th century was that aircraft used commercial AM radio stations for navigation, AM stations are still marked on U.S. aviation charts. Radio navigation played an important role during war time, especially in World War II. Before the discovery of the crystal oscillator, radio navigation had many limits. However, as radio technology expanding, navigation is easier to use, and it provides a better position. Although there are many advantages, the radio navigation systems often comes with complex equipment such as the radio compass receiver, compass indicator, or the radar plan position indicator. All of these require users to obtain certain knowledge.\nIn the 1960s VOR systems became widespread. In the 1970s, LORAN became the premier radio navigation system. Soon, the US Navy experimented with satellite navigation. In 1987, the Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation of satellites was launched; it was followed by other GNSS systems like Glonass, BeiDou and Galileo.\nFM.\nIn 1933, FM radio was patented by inventor Edwin H. Armstrong. FM uses frequency modulation of the radio wave to reduce static and interference from electrical equipment and the atmosphere. In 1937, W1XOJ, the first experimental FM radio station after Armstrong's W2XMN in Alpine, New Jersey, was granted a construction permit by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\nFM in Europe.\nAfter World War II, FM radio broadcasting was introduced in Germany. At a meeting in Copenhagen in 1948, a new wavelength plan was set up for Europe. Because of the recent war, Germany (which did not exist as a state and so was not invited) was only given a small number of medium-wave frequencies, which were not very good for broadcasting. For this reason Germany began broadcasting on UKW (\"Ultrakurzwelle\", i.e. ultra short wave, nowadays called VHF) which was not covered by the Copenhagen plan. After some amplitude modulation experience with VHF, it was realized that FM radio was a much better alternative for VHF radio than AM. Because of this history, FM radio is still referred to as \"UKW Radio\" in Germany. Other European nations followed a bit later, when the superior sound quality of FM and the ability to run many more local stations because of the more limited range of VHF broadcasts were realized.\nTelevision.\nIn the 1930s, regular analog television broadcasting began in some parts of Europe and North America. By the end of the decade there were roughly 25,000 all-electronic television receivers in existence worldwide, the majority of them in the UK. In the US, Armstrong's FM system was designated by the FCC to transmit and receive television sound.\nColor television.\nBy 1963, color television was being broadcast commercially (though not all broadcasts or programs were in color), and the first (radio) communication satellite, \"Telstar\", was launched. In the 1970s,\nMobile phones.\nIn 1947 AT&amp;T commercialized the Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis in 1946, AT&amp;T then introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time. Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing US$15 per month, plus $0.30\u20130.40 per local call, equivalent to (in 2012 US dollars) about $176 per month and $3.50\u20134.75 per call. The Advanced Mobile Phone System analog mobile phone system, developed by Bell Labs, was introduced in the Americas in 1978, gave much more capacity. It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s.\nThe development of metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) technology, information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications. The Advanced Mobile Phone System analog mobile phone system, developed by Bell Labs and introduced in the Americas in 1978, gave much more capacity. It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s.\nBroadcast and copyright.\nThe British government and the state-owned postal services found themselves under massive pressure from the wireless industry (including telegraphy) and early radio adopters to open up to the new medium. In an internal confidential report from February 25, 1924, the \"Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee\" stated:\n\"We have been asked 'to consider and advise on the policy to be adopted as regards the Imperial Wireless Services so as to protect and facilitate public interest.' It was impressed upon us that the question was urgent. We did not feel called upon to explore the past or to comment on the delays which have occurred in the building of the Empire Wireless Chain. We concentrated our attention on essential matters, examining and considering the facts and circumstances which have a direct bearing on policy and the condition which safeguard public interests.\"\nWhen radio was introduced in the early 1920s, many predicted it would kill the phonograph record industry. Radio was a free medium for the public to hear music for which they would normally pay. While some companies saw radio as a new avenue for promotion, others feared it would cut into profits from record sales and live performances. Many record companies would not license their records to be played over the radio, and had their major stars sign agreements that they would not perform on radio broadcasts.\nIndeed, the music recording industry had a severe drop in profits after the introduction of the radio. For a while, it appeared as though radio was a definite threat to the record industry. Radio ownership grew from two out of five homes in 1931 to four out of five homes in 1938. Meanwhile, record sales fell from $75 million in 1929 to $26 million in 1938 (with a low point of $5 million in 1933), though the economics of the situation were also affected by the Great Depression.\nThe copyright owners were concerned that they would see no gain from the popularity of radio and the 'free' music it provided. What they needed to make this new medium work for them already existed in previous copyright law. The copyright holder for a song had control over all public performances 'for profit.' The problem now was proving that the radio industry, which was just figuring out for itself how to make money from advertising and currently offered free music to anyone with a receiver, was making a profit from the songs.\nThe test case was against Bamberger's Department Store in Newark, New Jersey in 1922. The store was broadcasting music from its store on the radio station WOR. No advertisements were heard, except at the beginning of the broadcast which announced \"L. Bamberger and Co., One of America's Great Stores, Newark, New Jersey.\" It was determined through this and previous cases (such as the lawsuit against Shanley's Restaurant) that Bamberger was using the songs for commercial gain, thus making it a public performance for profit, which meant the copyright owners were due payment.\nWith this ruling the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) began collecting licensing fees from radio stations in 1923. The beginning sum was $250 for all music protected under ASCAP, but for larger stations the price soon ballooned to $5,000. Edward Samuels reports in his book \"The Illustrated Story of Copyright\" that \"radio and TV licensing represents the single greatest source of revenue for ASCAP and its composers [\u2026] and [a]n average member of ASCAP gets about $150\u2013$200 per work per year, or about $5,000-$6,000 for all of a member's compositions.\" Not long after the Bamberger ruling, ASCAP had to once again defend their right to charge fees, in 1924. The Dill Radio Bill would have allowed radio stations to play music without paying and licensing fees to ASCAP or any other music-licensing corporations. The bill did not pass.\nRegulations of radio stations in the U.S.\nWireless Ship Act of 1910.\nRadio technology was first used for ships to communicate at sea. To ensure safety, the Wireless Ship Act of 1910 marks the first time the U.S. government implies regulations on radio systems on ships. This act requires ships to have a radio system with a professional operator if they want to travel more than 200 miles offshore or have more than 50 people on board. However, this act had many flaws including the competition of radio operators including the two majors company (British and American Marconi). They tended to delay communication for ships that used their competitor's system. This contributed to the tragic incident of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.\nRadio Act of 1912.\nIn 1912, distress calls to aid the sinking \"Titanic\" were met with a large amount of interfering radio traffic, severely hampering the rescue effort. Subsequently, the US government passed the Radio Act of 1912 to help mitigate the repeat of such a tragedy. The act helps distinguish between normal radio traffic and (primarily maritime) emergency communication, and specifies the role of government during such an emergency.\nThe Radio Act of 1927.\nThe Radio Act of 1927 gave the Federal Radio Commission the power to grant and deny licenses, and to assign frequencies and power levels for each licensee. In 1928 it began requiring licenses of existing stations and setting controls on who could broadcast from where on what frequency and at what power. Some stations could not obtain a license and ceased operations. In section 29, the Radio Act of 1927 mentioned that the content of the broadcast should be freely present, and the government cannot interfere with this.\nThe Communications Act of 1934.\nThe introduction of the Communications Act of 1934 led to the establishment of the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC). The FCC's responsibility is to control the industry including \"telephone, telegraph, and radio communications.\" Under this Act, all carriers have to keep records of authorized interference and unauthorized interference. This Act also supports the President in time of war. If the government needs to use the communication facilities in time of war, they are allowed to.\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996.\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 was the first significant overhaul in over 60 years amending the work of the Communications Act of 1934. Coming only two dozen years after the breakup of AT&amp;T, the act sets out to move telecommunications into a state of competition with their markets and the networks they are a part of. Up to this point the effects of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 have been seen, but some of the changes the Act set out to fix are still ongoing problems, such as being unable to create an open competitive market.\nLicensed commercial public radio stations.\nThe question of the 'first' publicly targeted licensed radio station in the U.S. has more than one answer and depends on semantics. Settlement of this 'first' question may hang largely upon what constitutes 'regular' programming\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25523", "revid": "262666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25523", "title": "Richard Feynman", "text": "American theoretical physicist (1918\u20131988)\nRichard Phillips Feynman (; May 11, 1918 \u2013 February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist. He is best known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, and in particle physics, for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga.\nFeynman developed a pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams and is widely used. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal \"Physics World\", he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.\nHe assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to the wider public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with having pioneered the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.\nFeynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a talk on top-down nanotechnology, \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\" (1959) and the three-volumes of his undergraduate lectures, \"The Feynman Lectures on Physics\" (1961\u20131964). He delivered lectures for lay audiences, recorded in \"The Character of Physical Law\" (1965) and ' (1985). Feynman also became known through his autobiographical books \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\" (1985) and \"What Do You Care What Other People Think?\" (1988), and books written about him such as \"Tuva or Bust!\" by Ralph Leighton and the biography ' by James Gleick.\nEarly life.\nFeynman was born on May 11, 1918, in New York City, to Lucille (n\u00e9e\u00a0Phillips), a homemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman, a sales manager. Feynman's father was born into a Jewish family in Minsk, Russian Empire, and immigrated with his parents to the United States at the age of five. Feynman's mother was born in the United States into a Jewish family. Lucille's father had emigrated from Poland, and her mother also came from a family of Polish immigrants. She trained as a primary school teacher but married Melville in 1917, before taking up a profession. Richard was a late talker and did not speak until after his third birthday. As an adult, he spoke with a New York accent strong enough to be perceived as an affectation or exaggeration, so much so that his friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feynman spoke like a \"bum\".\nThe young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his mother, he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering, maintained an experimental laboratory in his home, and delighted in repairing radios. This radio repairing was probably the first job Feynman had, and during this time he showed early signs of an aptitude for his later career in theoretical physics, when he would analyze the issues theoretically and arrive at the solutions. When he was in grade school, he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day running errands.\nWhen Richard was five, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, Henry Phillips, who died at age four weeks. Four years later, Richard's sister Joan was born and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens. Though separated by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, and they both shared a curiosity about the world. Though their mother thought women lacked the capacity to understand such things, Richard encouraged Joan's interest in astronomy, taking her to see the aurora borealis in Far Rockaway. As an astrophysicist, Joan would help to explain what caused the northern lights.\nReligion.\nFeynman's parents were both from Jewish families, and his family went to the synagogue every Friday. However, by his youth, Feynman described himself as an \"avowed atheist\". Many years later, in a letter to Tina Levitan, declining a request for information for her book on Jewish Nobel Prize winners, he stated, \"To select, for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory\", adding, \"at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views, but I also stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way 'the chosen people'\".\nLater in life, during a visit to the Jewish Theological Seminary, Feynman encountered the Talmud for the first time. He saw that it contained the original text in a little square on each page, and surrounding it were commentaries written over time by different people. In this way, the Talmud had evolved, and everything that was discussed was carefully recorded. Despite being impressed, Feynman was disappointed with the lack of interest in nature and the outside world expressed by the rabbis, who cared about only those questions which arise from the Talmud.\nEducation.\nFeynman attended Far Rockaway High School, which was also attended by fellow Nobel laureates Burton Richter and Baruch Samuel Blumberg. Upon starting high school, Feynman was quickly promoted to a higher math class. An IQ test administered in high school estimated his IQ at 125\u2014high but \"merely respectable\", according to biographer James Gleick. His sister Joan, who scored one point higher, later jokingly claimed to an interviewer that she was smarter. Years later he declined to join Mensa International, saying that his IQ was too low.\nWhen Feynman was 15, he taught himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, infinite series, analytic geometry, and both differential and integral calculus. Before entering college, he was experimenting with mathematical topics such as the half-derivative using his own notation. He created special symbols for logarithm, sine, cosine and tangent functions so they did not look like three variables multiplied together, and for the derivative, to remove the temptation of canceling out the formula_1's in formula_2. A member of the Arista Honor Society, in his last year in high school he won the New York University Math Championship. His habit of direct characterization sometimes rattled more conventional thinkers; for example, one of his questions, when learning feline anatomy, was \"Do you have a map of the cat?\" (referring to an anatomical chart).\nFeynman applied to Columbia University but was not accepted because of its quota for the number of Jews admitted. Instead, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. Although he originally majored in mathematics, he later switched to electrical engineering, as he considered mathematics to be too abstract. Noticing that he \"had gone too far\", he then switched to physics, which he claimed was \"somewhere in between\". As an undergraduate, he published two papers in the \"Physical Review\". One of these, which was co-written with Manuel Vallarta, was titled \"The Scattering of Cosmic Rays by the Stars of a Galaxy\". &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Vallarta let his student in on a secret of mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 publishing: the senior scientist's name comes first. Feynman had his revenge a few years later, when Heisenberg concluded an entire book on cosmic rays with the phrase: \"such an effect is not to be expected according to Vallarta and Feynman\". When they next met, Feynman asked gleefully whether Vallarta had seen Heisenberg's book. Vallarta knew why Feynman was grinning. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"You're the last word in cosmic rays.\"\nThe other was his senior thesis, on \"Forces in Molecules\", based on a topic assigned by John C. Slater, who was sufficiently impressed by the paper to have it published. Its main result is known as the Hellmann\u2013Feynman theorem.\nIn 1939, Feynman received a bachelor's degree and was named a Putnam Fellow. He attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams to Princeton University in physics\u2014an unprecedented feat\u2014and an outstanding score in mathematics, but did poorly on the history and English portions. The head of the physics department there, Henry D. Smyth, had another concern, writing to Philip M. Morse to ask: \"Is Feynman Jewish? We have no definite rule against Jews but have to keep their proportion in our department reasonably small because of the difficulty of placing them.\" Morse conceded that Feynman was indeed Jewish, but reassured Smyth that Feynman's \"physiognomy and manner, however, show no trace of this characteristic\".\nAttendees at Feynman's first seminar, which was on the classical version of the Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory, included Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, and John von Neumann. Pauli made the prescient comment that the theory would be extremely difficult to quantize, and Einstein said that one might try to apply this method to gravity in general relativity, which Sir Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar did much later as the Hoyle\u2013Narlikar theory of gravity. Feynman received a PhD from Princeton in 1942; his thesis advisor was John Archibald Wheeler. In his doctoral thesis titled \"The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics\", Feynman applied the principle of stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics, inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, and laid the groundwork for the path integral formulation and Feynman diagrams. A key insight was that positrons behaved like electrons moving backwards in time. James Gleick wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This was Richard Feynman nearing the crest of his powers. At twenty-three\u00a0... there may now have been no physicist on earth who could match his exuberant command over the native materials of theoretical science. It was not just a facility at mathematics (though it had become clear\u00a0... that the mathematical machinery emerging in the Wheeler\u2013Feynman collaboration was beyond Wheeler's own ability). Feynman seemed to possess a frightening ease with the substance behind the equations, like Einstein at the same age, like the Soviet physicist Lev Landau\u2014but few others. \nOne of the conditions of Feynman's scholarship to Princeton was that he could not be married; nevertheless, he continued to see his high school sweetheart, Arline Greenbaum, and was determined to marry her once he had been awarded his PhD despite the knowledge that she was seriously ill with tuberculosis. This was an incurable disease at the time, and she was not expected to live more than two years. On June 29, 1942, they took the ferry to Staten Island, where they were married in the city office. The ceremony was attended by neither family nor friends and was witnessed by a pair of strangers. Feynman could kiss Arline only on the cheek. After the ceremony he took her to Deborah Hospital, where he visited her on weekends.\nManhattan Project.\nIn 1941, with World War II occurring in Europe but the United States not yet at war, Feynman spent the summer working on ballistics problems at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of what would become the Manhattan Project. At the time, Feynman had not earned a graduate degree. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, intended to electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the calutron that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled to determine whether it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.\nAt this juncture, in early 1943, Robert Oppenheimer was establishing the Los Alamos Laboratory, a secret laboratory on a mesa in New Mexico where atomic bombs would be designed and built. An offer was made to the Princeton team to be redeployed there. \"Like a bunch of professional soldiers,\" Wilson later recalled, \"we signed up, en masse, to go to Los Alamos.\" Oppenheimer recruited many young physicists, including Feynman, who he telephoned long distance from Chicago to inform that he had found a Presbyterian sanatorium in Albuquerque, New Mexico for Arline. They were among the first to depart for New Mexico, leaving on a train on March 28, 1943. The railroad supplied Arline with a wheelchair, and Feynman paid extra for a private room for her. There they spent their wedding anniversary.\nAt Los Alamos, Feynman was assigned to Hans Bethe's Theoretical (T) Division, and impressed Bethe enough to be made a group leader. He and Bethe developed the Bethe\u2013Feynman formula for calculating the yield of a fission bomb, which built upon previous work by Robert Serber. As a junior physicist, he was not central to the project. He administered the computation group of human computers in the theoretical division. With Stanley Frankel and Nicholas Metropolis, he assisted in establishing a system for using IBM punched cards for computation. He invented a new method of computing logarithms that he later used on the Connection Machine. An avid drummer, Feynman figured out how to get the machine to click in musical rhythms. Other work at Los Alamos included calculating neutron equations for the Los Alamos \"Water Boiler\", a small nuclear reactor, to measure how close an assembly of fissile material was to criticality.\nOn completing this work, Feynman was sent to the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the Manhattan Project had its uranium enrichment facilities. He aided the engineers there in devising safety procedures for material storage so that criticality accidents could be avoided, especially when enriched uranium came into contact with water, which acted as a neutron moderator. He insisted on giving the rank and file a lecture on nuclear physics so that they would realize the dangers. He explained that while any amount of unenriched uranium could be safely stored, the enriched uranium had to be carefully handled. He developed a series of safety recommendations for the various grades of enrichments. He was told that if the people at Oak Ridge gave him any difficulty with his proposals, he was to inform them that Los Alamos \"could not be responsible for their safety otherwise\".\nReturning to Los Alamos, Feynman was put in charge of the group responsible for the theoretical work and calculations on the proposed uranium hydride bomb, which ultimately proved to be infeasible. He was sought out by physicist Niels Bohr for one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr's thinking. He said he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties. Perhaps because of this, Bohr never warmed to Feynman. Feynman impressed Oppenheimer, who wrote in a letter to the University of California's physics department chairman, Raymond T. Birge, in November 1943 that Feynman was \"by all odds the most brilliant young physicist here, and everyone knows this.\"\nAt Los Alamos, which was isolated for security, Feynman amused himself by investigating the combination locks on the cabinets and desks of physicists. He often found that they left the lock combinations on the factory settings, wrote the combinations down, or used easily guessable combinations like dates. He found one cabinet's combination by trying numbers he thought a physicist might use (it proved to be 27\u201318\u201328 after the base of natural logarithms, \"e\" = 2.71828 ...), and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept research notes all had the same combination. He left notes in the cabinets as a prank, spooking his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy had gained access to them.\nFeynman's $380 () monthly salary was about half the amount needed for his modest living expenses and Arline's medical bills, and they were forced to dip into her $3,300 () in savings. On weekends he borrowed a car from his friend Klaus Fuchs to drive to Albuquerque to see Arline. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs mentioned Feynman's safe-cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque; Fuchs himself later confessed to spying for the Soviet Union. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman, particularly in view of Feynman's Q clearance.\nInformed that Arline was dying, Feynman drove to Albuquerque and sat with her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He then immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation. The immense brightness of the explosion made him duck to the truck's floor, where he saw a temporary \"purple splotch\" afterimage.\nCornell (1945\u20131949).\nFeynman nominally held an appointment at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison as an assistant professor of physics, but was on unpaid leave during his involvement in the Manhattan Project. In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, \"It's great to be back at the only university that ever had the good sense to fire me.\"\nAs early as October 30, 1943, Bethe had written to the chairman of the physics department of his university, Cornell, to recommend that Feynman be hired. On February 28, 1944, this was endorsed by Robert Bacher, also from Cornell, and one of the most senior scientists at Los Alamos. This led to an offer being made in August 1944, which Feynman accepted. Oppenheimer had hoped to recruit Feynman to the University of California, but Birge was reluctant. He made Feynman an offer in May 1945, but Feynman turned it down. Cornell matched its salary offer of $3,900 () per annum. Feynman became one of the first of the Los Alamos Laboratory's group leaders to depart, leaving for Ithaca, New York, in October 1945.\nBecause Feynman was no longer working at the Los Alamos Laboratory, he was no longer exempt from the draft. At his induction physical, Army psychiatrists diagnosed Feynman as suffering from a mental illness and the Army gave him a 4-F exemption on mental grounds. His father died suddenly on October 8, 1946, and Feynman suffered from depression. On October 17, 1946, he wrote a letter to Arline, expressing his deep love and heartbreak. The letter was sealed and only opened after his death. \"Please excuse my not mailing this,\" the letter concluded, \"but I don't know your new address.\" Unable to focus on research problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. He read the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and tried unsuccessfully to use them to formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize\u2013winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.\nFeynman was not the only frustrated theoretical physicist in the early post-war years. Quantum electrodynamics suffered from infinite integrals in perturbation theory. These were clear mathematical flaws in the theory, which Feynman and Wheeler had tried, unsuccessfully, to work around. \"Theoreticians\", noted Murray Gell-Mann, \"were in disgrace\". In June 1947, leading American physicists met at the Shelter Island Conference. For Feynman, it was his \"first big conference with big men\u00a0... I had never gone to one like this one in peacetime.\" The problems plaguing quantum electrodynamics were discussed, but the theoreticians were completely overshadowed by the achievements of the experimentalists, who reported the discovery of the Lamb shift, the measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron, and Robert Marshak's two-meson hypothesis.\nBethe took the lead from the work of Hans Kramers, and derived a renormalized non-relativistic quantum equation for the Lamb shift. The next step was to create a relativistic version. Feynman thought that he could do this, but when he went back to Bethe with his solution, it did not converge. Feynman carefully worked through the problem again, applying the path integral formulation that he had used in his thesis. Like Bethe, he made the integral finite by applying a cut-off term. The result corresponded to Bethe's version. Feynman presented his work to his peers at the Pocono Conference in 1948. It did not go well. Julian Schwinger gave a long presentation of his work in quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman then offered his version, entitled \"Alternative Formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics\". The unfamiliar Feynman diagrams, used for the first time, puzzled the audience. Feynman failed to get his point across, and Paul Dirac, Edward Teller and Niels Bohr all raised objections.\nTo Freeman Dyson, one thing at least was clear: Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman understood what they were talking about even if no one else did, but had not published anything. He was convinced that Feynman's formulation was easier to understand, and ultimately managed to convince Oppenheimer that this was the case. Dyson published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman's that told how to implement renormalization. Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in the \"Physical Review\" in a series of papers over three years. His 1948 papers on \"A Relativistic Cut-Off for Classical Electrodynamics\" attempted to explain what he had been unable to get across at Pocono. His 1949 paper on \"The Theory of Positrons\" addressed the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and Dirac equation, and introduced what is now called the Feynman propagator. Finally, in papers on the \"Mathematical Formulation of the Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Interaction\" in 1950 and \"An Operator Calculus Having Applications in Quantum Electrodynamics\" in 1951, he developed the mathematical basis of his ideas, derived familiar formulae and advanced new ones.\nWhile papers by others initially cited Schwinger, papers citing Feynman and employing Feynman diagrams appeared in 1950, and soon became prevalent. Students learned and used the powerful new tool that Feynman had created. Computer programs were later written to evaluate Feynman diagrams, enabling physicists to use quantum field theory to make high-precision predictions. Marc Kac adapted Feynman's technique of summing over possible histories of a particle to the study of parabolic partial differential equations, yielding what is now known as the Feynman\u2013Kac formula, the use of which extends beyond physics to many applications of stochastic processes. To Schwinger, however, the Feynman diagram was \"pedagogy, not physics\".\nLooking back on this period, Feynman would reflect fondly on his time at the Telluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as \"a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains\". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that \"it's there that I did the fundamental work\" for which he won the Nobel Prize.\nHowever, Feynman was also reported to have been quite restless during his time at Cornell. By 1949, as the period was coming to a close, he had never settled into a particular house or apartment, moving instead between guest houses or student residences. While he did spend some time living with various married friends, these situations were reported to frequently end because the \"arrangements became sexually volatile\". The renowned 31 year old was known to frequently pursue his married female friends, undergraduate girls and women, and to hire sex workers, which would sour many of his friendships. Additionally, Feynman was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather or feeling as though he lived in the shadow of Hans Bethe while at Cornell.\nBrazil (1949\u20131952).\nFeynman spent several weeks in Rio de Janeiro in July 1949. That year, the Soviet Union detonated its first atomic bomb, generating concerns about espionage. Fuchs was arrested as a Soviet spy in 1950 and the FBI questioned Bethe about Feynman's loyalty. Physicist David Bohm was arrested on December 4, 1950, and emigrated to Brazil in October 1951. Because of the fears of a nuclear war, a girlfriend told Feynman that he should also consider moving to South America. He had a sabbatical coming for 1951\u20131952, and elected to spend it in Brazil, where he gave courses at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas F\u00edsicas.\nIn Brazil, Feynman was impressed with \"samba\" music, and learned to play the , a metal percussion instrument based on a frying pan. He was an enthusiastic amateur player of bongo and conga drums and often played them in the pit orchestra in musicals. He spent time in Rio with his friend Bohm, but Bohm could not convince Feynman to investigate Bohm's ideas on physics.\nCaltech and later years (1952\u20131978).\nPersonal and political life.\nFeynman did not return to Cornell. Bacher, who had been instrumental in bringing Feynman to Cornell, had lured him to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Part of the deal was that he could spend his first year on sabbatical in Brazil. He had become smitten by Mary Louise Bell from Neodesha, Kansas. They had met in a cafeteria in Cornell, where she had studied the history of Mexican art and textiles. She later followed him to Caltech, where he gave a lecture. While he was in Brazil, she taught classes on the history of furniture and interiors at Michigan State University. He proposed to her by mail from Rio de Janeiro, and they married in Boise, Idaho, on June 28, 1952, shortly after he returned. They frequently quarreled and she was frightened by what she described as \"a violent temper\". Their politics were different; although he registered and voted as a Republican, she was more conservative, and her opinion on the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing (\"Where there's smoke there's fire\") offended him. They separated on May 20, 1956. An interlocutory decree of divorce was entered on June 19, 1956, on the grounds of \"extreme cruelty\". The divorce became final on May 5, 1958.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... the appointee's wife was granted a divorce from him because of appointee's constantly working calculus problems in his head as soon as awake, while driving car, sitting in living room, and so forth, and that his one hobby was playing his African drums. His ex-wife reportedly testified that on several occasions when she unwittingly disturbed either his calculus or his drums he flew into a violent rage, during which time he choked her, threw pieces of bric-a-brac about and smashed the furniture ...\u2014\u200a\nIn the wake of the 1957 Sputnik crisis, the U.S. government's interest in science rose for a time. Feynman was considered for a seat on the President's Science Advisory Committee, but was not appointed. At this time, the FBI interviewed a woman close to Feynman, possibly his ex-wife Bell, who sent a written statement to J. Edgar Hoover on August 8, 1958:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe U.S. government nevertheless sent Feynman to Geneva for the September 1958 Atoms for Peace Conference. On the beach at Lake Geneva, he met Gweneth Howarth, who was from Ripponden, West Yorkshire, and working in Switzerland as an \"au pair\". Feynman's love life had been turbulent since his divorce; his previous girlfriend had walked off with his Albert Einstein Award medal and, on the advice of an earlier girlfriend, had feigned pregnancy and extorted him into paying for an abortion, then used the money to buy furniture. When Feynman found that Howarth was being paid only $25 a month, he offered her $20 (equivalent to $202 in 2022) a week to be his live-in maid. Feynman knew that this sort of behavior was illegal under the Mann Act, so he had a friend, Matthew Sands, act as her sponsor. Howarth pointed out that she already had two boyfriends, but decided to take Feynman up on his offer, and arrived in Altadena, California, in June 1959. She made a point of dating other men, but Feynman proposed in early 1960. They were married on September 24, 1960, at the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. They had a son, Carl, in 1962, and adopted a daughter, Michelle, in 1968. Besides their home in Altadena, they had a beach house in Baja California, purchased with the money from Feynman's Nobel Prize.\nAllegations of sexism.\nThere were protests over his alleged sexism at Caltech in 1968, and again in 1972. Protesters \"objected to his use of sexist stories about 'lady drivers' and clueless women in his lectures.\" Feynman recalled protesters entering a hall and picketing a lecture he was about to make in San Francisco, calling him a \"sexist pig\". He later reflected on the incident claiming that it prompted him to address the protesters, saying that \"women do indeed suffer prejudice and discrimination in physics, and your presence here today serves to remind us of these difficulties and the need to remedy them\".\nIn his 1985 memoir, \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\", he recalled holding meetings in strip clubs, drawing naked portraits of his female students while lecturing at Caltech, and pretending to be an undergraduate to deceive younger women into sleeping with him.\nFeynman diagram van.\nIn 1975, in Long Beach, California, Feynman bought a Dodge Tradesman Maxivan with a bronze-khaki exterior and yellow-green interior, with custom Feynman diagram exterior murals. After Feynman's death, Gweneth sold the van for $1 to one of Feynman's friends, film producer Ralph Leighton, who later put it into storage, where it began to rust. In 2012, video game designer Seamus Blackley, a father of the Xbox, bought the van. \"Qantum\" was the license plate ID.\nPhysics.\nAt Caltech, Feynman investigated the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, where helium seems to display a complete lack of viscosity when flowing. Feynman provided a quantum-mechanical explanation for the Soviet physicist Lev Landau's theory of superfluidity. Applying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to the question showed that the superfluid was displaying quantum mechanical behavior observable on a macroscopic scale. This helped with the problem of superconductivity, but the solution eluded Feynman. It was solved with the BCS theory of superconductivity, proposed by John Bardeen, Leon Neil Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer in 1957.\nFeynman, inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, laid the groundwork for the path integral formulation and Feynman diagrams.\nWith Murray Gell-Mann, Feynman developed a model of weak decay, which showed that the current coupling in the process is a combination of vector and axial currents (an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron, a proton, and an antineutrino). Although E. C. George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman's collaboration with Gell-Mann was seen as seminal because the weak interaction was neatly described by the vector and axial currents. It thus combined the 1933 beta decay theory of Enrico Fermi with an explanation of parity violation.\nFeynman attempted an explanation, called the parton model, of the strong interactions governing nucleon scattering. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles; the statistics of the omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.\nThe SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.\nAfter the success of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned to quantum gravity. By analogy with the photon, which has spin 1, he investigated the consequences of a free massless spin 2 field and derived the Einstein field equation of general relativity, but little more. The computational device that Feynman discovered then for gravity, \"ghosts\", which are \"particles\" in the interior of his diagrams that have the \"wrong\" connection between spin and statistics, have proved invaluable in explaining the quantum particle behavior of the Yang\u2013Mills theories, for example, quantum chromodynamics and the electro-weak theory. He did work on all four of the fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetic, the weak force, the strong force and gravity. John and Mary Gribbin state in their book on Feynman that \"Nobody else has made such influential contributions to the investigation of all four of the interactions\".\nPartly as a way to bring publicity to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by William McLellan and the other by Tom Newman.\nFeynman was also interested in the relationship between physics and computation. He was also one of the first scientists to conceive the possibility of quantum computers. In the 1980s he began to spend his summers working at Thinking Machines Corporation, helping to build some of the first parallel supercomputers and considering the construction of quantum computers.\nBetween 1984 and 1986, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, which has led to a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (variational perturbation theory) and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination of critical exponents measured in satellite experiments. At Caltech, he once chalked \"What I cannot create I do not understand\" on his blackboard.\nMachine technology.\nFeynman had studied the ideas of John von Neumann while researching quantum field theory. His most famous lecture on the subject was delivered in 1959 at the California Institute of Technology, published under the title \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\" a year later. In this lecture he theorized on future opportunities for designing miniaturized machines, which could build smaller reproductions of themselves. This lecture is frequently cited in technical literature on microtechnology, and nanotechnology.\nFeynman also suggested that it should be possible, in principle, to make nanoscale machines that \"arrange the atoms the way we want\" and do chemical synthesis by mechanical manipulation.\nHe also presented the possibility of \"swallowing the doctor\", an idea that he credited in the essay to his friend and graduate student Albert Hibbs. This concept involved building a tiny, swallowable surgical robot.\nPedagogy.\nIn the early 1960s, Feynman acceded to a request to \"spruce up\" the teaching of undergraduates at the California Institute of Technology, also called Caltech. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that later became \"The Feynman Lectures on Physics\". Accounts vary about how successful the original lectures were. Feynman's own preface, written just after an exam on which the students did poorly, was somewhat pessimistic. His colleagues David L. Goodstein and Gerry Neugebauer said later that the intended audience of first-year students found the material intimidating while older students and faculty found it inspirational, so the lecture hall remained full even as the first-year students dropped away. In contrast, physicist Matthew Sands recalled the student attendance as being typical for a large lecture course.\nConverting the lectures into books occupied Matthew Sands and Robert B. Leighton as part-time co-authors for several years. Feynman suggested that the book cover should have a picture of a drum with mathematical diagrams about vibrations drawn upon it, in order to illustrate the application of mathematics to understanding the world. Instead, the publishers gave the books plain red covers, though they included a picture of Feynman playing drums in the foreword. Even though the books were not adopted by universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics.\nMany of Feynman's lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including \"The Character of Physical Law\", \"\", \"Statistical Mechanics\", \"Lectures on Gravitation\", and the \"Feynman Lectures on Computation\".\nFeynman wrote about his experiences teaching physics undergraduates in Brazil. The students' studying habits and the Portuguese language textbooks were so devoid of any context or applications for their information that, in Feynman's opinion, the students were not learning physics at all. At the end of the year, Feynman was invited to give a lecture on his teaching experiences, and he agreed to do so, provided he could speak frankly, which he did.\nFeynman opposed rote learning, or unthinking memorization, as well as other teaching methods that emphasized form over function. In his mind, \"clear thinking\" and \"clear presentation\" were fundamental prerequisites for his attention. It could be perilous even to approach him unprepared, and he did not forget fools and pretenders.\nIn 1964, he served on the California State Curriculum Commission, which was responsible for approving textbooks to be used by schools in California. He was not impressed with what he found. Many of the mathematics texts covered subjects of use only to pure mathematicians as part of the \"New Math\". Elementary students were taught about sets, but: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It will perhaps surprise most people who have studied these textbooks to discover that the symbol \u222a or \u2229 representing union and intersection of sets and the special use of the brackets { } and so forth, all the elaborate notation for sets that is given in these books, almost never appear in any writings in theoretical physics, in engineering, in business arithmetic, computer design, or other places where mathematics is being used. I see no need or reason for this all to be explained or to be taught in school. It is not a useful way to express one's self. It is not a cogent and simple way. It is claimed to be precise, but precise for what purpose?\nIn April 1966, Feynman delivered an address to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth\u2014creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate \"ab initio\", from experience, what the true situation was\u2014this was science.\nIn 1974, Feynman delivered the Caltech commencement address on the topic of \"cargo cult science\", which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience due to a lack of \"a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty\" on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself\u2014and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.\"\nFeynman served as doctoral advisor to 30 students.\nCase before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nIn 1977, Feynman supported his English literature colleague Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, and filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after she was refused tenure in 1974. The EEOC ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that La Belle had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side, but he had gotten to know La Belle and liked and admired her.\n\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\".\nIn the 1960s, Feynman began thinking of writing an autobiography, and he began granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Ralph transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\" and became a best-seller.\nGell-Mann was upset by Feynman's account in the book of the weak interaction work, and threatened to sue, resulting in a correction being inserted in later editions. This incident was just the latest provocation in decades of bad feeling between the two scientists. Gell-Mann often expressed frustration at the attention Feynman received; he remarked: \"[Feynman] was a great scientist, but he spent a great deal of his effort generating anecdotes about himself.\"\nFeynman has been criticized for a chapter in the book entitled \"You Just \"Ask\" Them?\", where he describes how he learned to seduce women at a bar he went to in the summer of 1946. A mentor taught him to ask a woman if she would sleep with him before buying her anything. He describes seeing women at the bar as \"bitches\" in his thoughts, and tells a story of how he told a woman named Ann that she was \"worse than a whore\" after Ann persuaded him to buy her sandwiches by telling him he could eat them at her place, but then, after he bought them, saying they actually could not eat together because another man was coming over. Later on that same evening, Ann returned to the bar to take Feynman to her place. Feynman states at the end of the chapter that this behavior was not typical of him: \"So it worked even with an ordinary girl! But no matter how effective the lesson was, I never really used it after that. I didn't enjoy doing it that way. But it was interesting to know that things worked much differently from how I was brought up.\"\n\"Challenger\" disaster.\nFeynman played an important role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the 1986 Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster. He had been reluctant to participate, but was persuaded by advice from his wife. Feynman clashed several times with commission chairman William P. Rogers. During a break in one hearing, Rogers told commission member Neil Armstrong, \"Feynman is becoming a pain in the ass.\"\nDuring a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.\nFeynman devoted the latter half of his 1988 book \"What Do You Care What Other People Think?\" to his experience on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 probability of a catastrophic failure aboard the Shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the probability of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management's estimate of the reliability of the Space Shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), \"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.\"\nRecognition and awards.\nThe first public recognition of Feynman's work came in 1954, when Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) notified him that he had won the Albert Einstein Award, which was worth $15,000 and came with a gold medal. Because of Strauss's actions in stripping Oppenheimer of his security clearance, Feynman was reluctant to accept the award, but Isidor Isaac Rabi cautioned him: \"You should never turn a man's generosity as a sword against him. Any virtue that a man has, even if he has many vices, should not be used as a tool against him.\" It was followed by the AEC's Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1962. Schwinger, Tomonaga and Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles\". He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1965, received the Oersted Medal in 1972, and the National Medal of Science in 1979. He was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, but ultimately resigned and is no longer listed by them. Schwinger called him \"an honest man, the outstanding intuitionist of our age, and a prime example of what may lie in store for anyone who dares follow the beat of a different drum.\"\nDeath.\nIn 1978, Feynman sought medical treatment for abdominal pains and was diagnosed with liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer. Surgeons removed a \"very large\" tumor that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. In 1986, doctors discovered another cancer, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February 3, 1988. A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Feynman's wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine watched over him during the final days of his life until he died on February 15, 1988.\nWhen Feynman was nearing death, he asked his friend and colleague Danny Hillis why Hillis appeared so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon. Hillis quotes Feynman as replying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Yeah,\" he sighed, \"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think. [...] When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\"\nNear the end of his life, Feynman attempted to visit the Tuvan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) in the Soviet Union, a dream thwarted by Cold War bureaucratic issues. The letter from the Soviet government authorizing the trip was not received until the day after he died. His daughter Michelle later made the journey. Ralph Leighton chronicled the attempt in \"Tuva or Bust!\", published in 1991.\nHis burial was at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in Altadena, California. His last words were \"This dying is boring\" in reference to the extended coma that preceded his death.\nPopular legacy.\nAspects of Feynman's life have been portrayed in various media. Feynman was portrayed by Matthew Broderick in the 1996 biopic \"Infinity\". Actor Alan Alda commissioned playwright Peter Parnell to write a two-character play about a fictional day in the life of Feynman set two years before Feynman's death. The play, \"QED\", premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 2001 and was later presented at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on Broadway, with both productions starring Alda as Richard Feynman. Real Time Opera premiered its opera \"Feynman\" at the Norfolk (Connecticut) Chamber Music Festival in June 2005. In 2011, Feynman was the subject of a biographical graphic novel entitled simply \"Feynman\", written by Jim Ottaviani and illustrated by Leland Myrick. In 2013, Feynman's role on the Rogers Commission was dramatized by the BBC in \"The Challenger\" (US title: \"The Challenger Disaster\"), with William Hurt playing Feynman. In 2016, Oscar Isaac performed a public reading of Feynman's 1946 love letter to the late Arline. In the 2023 American film \"Oppenheimer\", directed by Christopher Nolan and based on \"American Prometheus\", Feynman is portrayed by actor Jack Quaid.\nOn May 4, 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the \"American Scientists\" commemorative set of four 37-cent stamps in several configurations. The scientists depicted were Richard Feynman, John von Neumann, Barbara McClintock, and Josiah Willard Gibbs. Feynman's stamp features a photograph of Feynman in his thirties and eight small Feynman diagrams. The stamps were designed by Victor Stabin under the artistic direction of Carl T. Herrman. The main building for the Computing Division at Fermilab is named the \"Feynman Computing Center\" in his honor, as is the Richard P. Feynman Center for Innovation at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Two photographs of Feynman were used in Apple Computer's \"Think Different\" advertising campaign, which launched in 1997. Sheldon Cooper, a fictional theoretical physicist from the television series \"The Big Bang Theory\", was depicted as a Feynman fan, even emulating him by playing the bongo drums. On January 27, 2016, co-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates wrote an article describing Feynman's talents as a teacher (\"The Best Teacher I Never Had\"), which inspired Gates to create Project Tuva to place the videos of Feynman's Messenger Lectures, \"The Character of Physical Law\", on a website for public viewing. In 2015, Gates made a video in response to Caltech's request for thoughts on Feynman for the 50th anniversary of Feynman's 1965 Nobel Prize, on why he thought Feynman was special.\nWorks.\nTextbooks and lecture notes.\n\"The Feynman Lectures on Physics\" is perhaps his most accessible work for anyone with an interest in physics, compiled from lectures to Caltech undergraduates in 1961\u20131964. As news of the lectures' lucidity grew, professional physicists and graduate students began to drop in to listen. Co-authors Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, colleagues of Feynman, edited and illustrated them into book form. The work has endured and is useful to this day. They were edited and supplemented in 2005 with \"Feynman's Tips on Physics: A Problem-Solving Supplement to the Feynman Lectures on Physics\" by Michael Gottlieb and Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), with support from Kip Thorne and other physicists.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25524", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25524", "title": "Research", "text": "Systematic study undertaken to increase knowledge\nResearch is creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge. It involves the collection, organization, and analysis of evidence to increase understanding of a topic, characterized by a particular attentiveness to controlling sources of bias and error. These activities are characterized by accounting and controlling for biases. A research project may be an expansion of past work in the field. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole.\nThe primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, and the research and development (R&amp;D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.\nA researcher is a person who conducts research, especially in order to discover new information or to reach a new understanding. In order to be a social researcher or a social scientist, one should have enormous knowledge of subjects related to social science that they are specialized in. Similarly, in order to be a natural science researcher, the person should have knowledge of fields related to natural science (physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, zoology and so on). Professional associations provide one pathway to mature in the research profession.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"research\" is derived from the Middle French \"recherche\", which means \"to go about seeking\", the term itself being derived from the Old French term \"recerchier\", a compound word from \"re-\" + \"cerchier\", or \"sercher\", meaning 'search'. The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.\nDefinitions.\nResearch has been defined in a number of different ways, and while there are similarities, there does not appear to be a single, all-encompassing definition that is embraced by all who engage in it.\nResearch, in its simplest terms, is searching for knowledge and searching for truth. In a formal sense, it is a systematic study of a problem attacked by a deliberately chosen strategy, which starts with choosing an approach to preparing a blueprint (design) and acting upon it in terms of designing research hypotheses, choosing methods and techniques, selecting or developing data collection tools, processing the data, interpretation, and ending with presenting solution(s) of the problem.\nAnother definition of research is given by John W. Creswell, who states that \"research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue\". It consists of three steps: pose a question, collect data to answer the question, and present an answer to the question.\nThe Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research more generally to also include studying already existing knowledge: \"studious inquiry or examination; \"especially\": investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws\".\nForms of research.\nOriginal research.\nOriginal research, also called primary research, is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review, or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a primary-source character. The purpose of the original research is to produce new knowledge rather than present the existing knowledge in a new form (e.g., summarized or classified). Original research can take various forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to. In experimental work, it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject(s), e.g., in the laboratory or in the field, documents the methodology, results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In analytical work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced or a new way of approaching an existing problem. In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the researcher.\nThe degree of originality of the research is among the major criteria for articles to be published in academic journals and usually established by means of peer review. Graduate students are commonly required to perform original research as part of a dissertation.\nScientific research.\nScientific research is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing curiosity. This research provides scientific information and theories for the explanation of the nature and the properties of the world. It makes practical applications possible. Scientific research may be funded by public authorities, charitable organizations, and private organizations. Scientific research can be subdivided by discipline.\nGenerally, research is understood to follow a certain structural process. Though the order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following steps are usually part of most formal research, both basic and applied:\nA common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven (see, rather, null hypothesis). Generally, a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment. If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see falsifiability). However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis. This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations. In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true.\nA useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified. As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction. In this case, a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it. Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables.\nResearch in the humanities.\nResearch in the humanities involves different methods such as for example hermeneutics and semiotics. Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead, explore the issues and details that surround it. Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural, or ethnic. An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in historical method. Historians use primary sources and other evidence to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past. Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities, without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these. These studies may be qualitative or quantitative, and can use a variety of approaches, such as queer theory or feminist theory.\nArtistic research.\nArtistic research, also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.\nThe controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines. One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept subjectivity as opposed to the classical scientific methods. As such, it is similar to the social sciences in using qualitative research and intersubjectivity as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis.\nArtistic research has been defined by the School of Dance and Circus (Dans och Cirkush\u00f6gskolan, DOCH), Stockholm in the following manner \u2013 \"Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines. It is based on artistic practices, methods, and criticality. Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context.\" Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts. A simpler understanding by Julian Klein defines artistic research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception. For a survey of the central problematics of today's artistic research, see Giaco Schiesser.\nAccording to artist Hakan Topal, in artistic research, \"perhaps more so than other disciplines, intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities\". Most writers, whether of fiction or non-fiction books, also have to do research to support their creative work. This may be factual, historical, or background research. Background research could include, for example, geographical or procedural research.\nThe Society for Artistic Research (SAR) publishes the triannual \"Journal for Artistic Research\" (\"JAR\"), an international, online, open access, and peer-reviewed journal for the identification, publication, and dissemination of artistic research and its methodologies, from all arts disciplines and it runs the \"Research Catalogue\" (RC), a searchable, documentary database of artistic research, to which anyone can contribute.\nPatricia Leavy addresses eight arts-based research (ABR) genres: narrative inquiry, fiction-based research, poetry, music, dance, theatre, film, and visual art.\nIn 2016, the European League of Institutes of the Arts launched \"The Florence Principles' on the Doctorate in the Arts\". The Florence Principles relating to the Salzburg Principles and the Salzburg Recommendations of the European University Association name seven points of attention to specify the Doctorate / PhD in the Arts compared to a scientific doctorate / PhD. The Florence Principles have been endorsed and are supported also by AEC, CILECT, CUMULUS and SAR.\nHistorical research.\nThe historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use historical sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis. This includes lower criticism and sensual criticism. Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following concepts are part of most formal historical research:\nSteps in conducting research.\nResearch is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research. The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results. The major steps in conducting research are:\nThe steps generally represent the overall process; however, they should be viewed as an ever-changing iterative process rather than a fixed set of steps. Most research begins with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study. The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often, a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified. A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question. The research question may be parallel to the hypothesis. The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested. The researcher(s) collects data to test the hypothesis. The researcher(s) then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods, engaging in what is known as empirical research. The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis are then reported and evaluated. At the end, the researcher may discuss avenues for further research. However, some researchers advocate for the reverse approach: starting with articulating findings and discussion of them, moving \"up\" to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review. The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry, research questions, research method, relevant research literature, and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted.\nRudolph Rummel says, \"... no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive. It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results.\"\nPlato in Meno talks about an inherent difficulty, if not a paradox, of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way, \"If you know what you're searching for, why do you search for it?! [i.e., you have already found it] If you don't know what you're searching for, what are you searching for?!\"\nResearch methods.\nThe goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue. This process takes three main forms (although, as previously discussed, the boundaries between them may be obscure):\nThere are two major types of empirical research design: qualitative research and quantitative research. Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer:\nQualitative research\nQualitative research refers to much more subjective non-quantitative, use different methods of collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting data for meanings, definitions, characteristics, symbols metaphors of things. Qualitative research further classified into the following types: \"Ethnography:\" This research mainly focus on culture of group of people which includes share attributes, language, practices, structure, value, norms and material things, evaluate human lifestyle. Ethno: people, Grapho: to write, this disciple may include ethnic groups, ethno genesis, composition, resettlement and social welfare characteristics. \"Phenomenology\": It is very powerful strategy for demonstrating methodology to health professions education as well as best suited for exploring challenging problems in health professions educations. In addition, PMP researcher Mandy Sha argued that a project management approach is necessary to control the scope, schedule, and cost related to qualitative research design, participant recruitment, data collection, reporting, as well as stakeholder engagement.\nQuantitative research\nQuantitative research involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships, by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing statistical methods. The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive). Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables. Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of positivism.\nThe quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories. These methods produce results that can be summarized, compared, and generalized to larger populations if the data are collected using proper sampling and data collection strategies. Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest.\nIf the research question is about people, participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments (this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment). If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable. If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population, the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants.\nIn either qualitative or quantitative research, the researcher(s) may collect primary or secondary data. Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires. Secondary data is data that already exists, such as census data, which can be re-used for the research. It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible.\nMixed-method research, i.e. research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common. This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer. For example, a researcher may choose to conduct a qualitative study and follow it up with a quantitative study to gain additional insights.\nBig data has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection; furthermore, methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed.\nNon-empirical research\nNon-empirical (theoretical) research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation. As such, non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source. This, however, does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge. Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach. Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science. Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained; then theoretical research tries to explain them, and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses; these hypotheses are then tested empirically, giving more observations that may need further explanation; and so on. See Scientific method.\nA simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge; another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge. Much of cosmological research is theoretical in nature. Mathematics research does not rely on externally available data; rather, it seeks to prove theorems about mathematical objects.\nProblems in research.\nMetascience.\nMetascience is the study of research through the use of research methods. Also known as \"research on research\", it aims to reduce waste and increase the quality of research in all fields. Meta-research concerns itself with the detection of bias, methodological flaws, and other errors and inefficiencies. Among the finding of meta-research is a low rates of reproducibility across a large number of fields.\nNon-western methods.\nIn many disciplines, Western methods of conducting research are predominant. Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study. The increasing participation of indigenous peoples as researchers has brought increased attention to the scientific lacuna in culturally sensitive methods of data collection. Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies. For example, \"Hua Oranga\" was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in M\u0101ori populations, and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the M\u0101ori people \u2013 \"taha wairua (the spiritual dimension), taha hinengaro (the mental dimension), taha tinana (the physical dimension), and taha whanau (the family dimension)\".\nEven though Western dominance seems to be prominent in research, some scholars, such as Simon Marginson, argue for \"the need [for] a plural university world\". Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model.\nThis could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West. Focused on emphasizing educational achievement, East Asian cultures, mainly in China and South Korea, have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion. In contrast, in the Western academic world, notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States, funding cuts for university research have occurred, which some say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research.\nLanguage.\nResearch is often biased in the languages that are preferred (linguicism) and the geographic locations where research occurs.\nPeriphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and linguicism in research and academic publication. As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English, multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals. Multilingual scholars' influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference. Patterns of geographic bias also show a relationship with linguicism: countries whose official languages are French or Arabic are far less likely to be the focus of single-country studies than countries with different official languages. Within Africa, English-speaking countries are more represented than other countries.\nGeneralizability.\nGeneralization is the process of more broadly applying the valid results of one study. Studies with a narrow scope can result in a lack of generalizability, meaning that the results may not be applicable to other populations or regions. In comparative politics, this can result from using a single-country study, rather than a study design that uses data from multiple countries. Despite the issue of generalizability, single-country studies have risen in prevalence since the late 2000s.\nFor comparative politics, Western countries are over-represented in single-country studies, with heavy emphasis on Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Since 2000, Latin American countries have become more popular in single-country studies. In contrast, countries in Oceania and the Caribbean are the focus of very few studies.\nPublication peer review.\nPeer review is a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility. In academia, scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication. Usually, the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view, and this is usually done free of charge. The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review. It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe.\nOpen research.\nThe open research, open science and open access movements assume that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a \"public domain\", that of \"humanity\". This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation. For instance, most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships. There is alleged to be a double standard in the Western knowledge system. On the one hand, \"digital right management\" used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy, while simultaneously when similar functions are used by cultural groups (i.e. indigenous communities) this is denounced as \"access control\" and reprehended as censorship.\nProfessionalisation.\nIn several national and private academic systems, the professionalisation of research has resulted in formal job titles.\nIn Russia.\nIn present-day Russia, and some other countries of the former Soviet Union, the term \"researcher\" (, \"nauchny sotrudnik\") has been used both as a generic term for a person who has been carrying out scientific research, and as a job position within the frameworks of the Academy of Sciences, universities, and in other research-oriented establishments.\nThe following ranks are known:\nPublishing.\nAcademic publishing is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to peer review the work and make it available for a wider audience. The system varies widely by field and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form. These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine.\nMost established academic fields have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication, though many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields, from the print to the electronic format. A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently. It has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its procedures to prevent the publication of unproven findings. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is open access. There are two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication, and self-archiving, where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web.\nResearch statistics and funding.\nMost funding for scientific research comes from three major sources: corporate research and development departments; private foundations; and government research councils such as the National Institutes of Health in the US and the Medical Research Council in the UK. These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors. Many senior researchers (such as group leaders) spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research but also as a source of merit. The Social Psychology Network provides a comprehensive list of U.S. Government and private foundation funding sources.\nThe total number of researchers (full-time equivalents) per million inhabitants for individual countries is shown in the following table.\nResearch expenditure by type of research as a share of GDP for individual countries is shown in the following table.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25525", "revid": "49952372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25525", "title": "Ren\u00e9 Descartes", "text": "French philosopher (1596\u20131650)\nRen\u00e9 Descartes ( , ; 31 March 1596 \u2013 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, scientist, and mathematician, widely considered a seminal figure in the emergence of modern philosophy and science. Mathematics was paramount to his method of inquiry, and he connected the previously separate fields of geometry and algebra into analytic geometry.\nRefusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the \"Passions of the Soul\", an early modern treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic \"as if no one had written on these matters before.\" His best known philosophical statement is \"\" (\"I think, therefore I am,\" ).\nDescartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy, and he is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to epistemology in the 17th century. He was one of the key figures in the Scientific Revolution, and his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" and other philosophical works continue to be studied. His influence in mathematics is equally apparent, being the namesake of the Cartesian coordinate system. Descartes is also credited as the father of analytic geometry, which facilitated the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nRen\u00e9 Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine, Province of Touraine (now Descartes, Indre-et-Loire), France, on 31 March 1596. In May 1597, his mother Jeanne Brochard, died a few days after giving birth to a still-born child. Descartes's father, Joachim, was a member of the Parlement of Rennes at Rennes. Ren\u00e9 lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic, the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots. In 1607, late because of his fragile health, he entered the Jesuit Coll\u00e8ge Royal Henry-Le-Grand at La Fl\u00e8che, where he was introduced to mathematics and physics. After graduation in 1614, he studied for two years (1615\u201316) at the University of Poitiers, earning a \"Baccalaur\u00e9at\" and \"Licence\" in canon and civil law in 1616, in accordance with his father's wishes that he should become a lawyer. From there, he moved to Paris.\nArmy service.\nIn accordance with his ambition to become a professional military officer in 1618, Descartes joined, as a mercenary, the Protestant Dutch States Army in Breda under the command of Maurice of Nassau, and undertook a formal study of military engineering, as established by Simon Stevin. Descartes, therefore, received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics. In this way, he became acquainted with Isaac Beeckman, the principal of a Dordrecht school, for whom he wrote the \"Compendium of Music\" (written 1618, published 1650).\nWhile in the service of the Catholic Duke Maximilian of Bavaria from 1619, Descartes was present at the Battle of the White Mountain near Prague, in November 1620.\nAccording to Adrien Baillet, on the night of 10\u201311 November 1619 (St. Martin's Day), while stationed in Neuburg an der Donau, Descartes shut himself in a room with an \"oven\" (probably a cocklestove) to escape the cold. While within, he had three dreams, and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. However, it is speculated that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome. Upon exiting, he had formulated analytic geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life's work.\nCareer.\nFrance.\nIn 1620, Descartes left the army. He visited Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years, he spent time in Paris. It was there that he composed his first essay on method: \"Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii\" (\"Rules for the Direction of the Mind\"). He arrived in La Haye in 1623, selling all of his property to invest in bonds, which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life. Descartes was present at the siege of La Rochelle by Cardinal Richelieu in 1627 as an observer. There, he was interested in the physical properties of the great dike that Richelieu was building and studied mathematically everything he saw during the siege. He also met French mathematician Girard Desargues. In the autumn of that year, in the residence of the papal nuncio Guidi di Bagno, where he came with Mersenne and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist, Nicolas de Villiers, Sieur de Chandoux, on the principles of a supposed new philosophy, Cardinal B\u00e9rulle urged him to write an exposition of his new philosophy in some location beyond the reach of the Inquisition.\nNetherlands.\nDescartes returned to the Dutch Republic in 1628. In April 1629, he joined the University of Franeker, studying under Adriaan Metius, either living with a Catholic family or renting the Sjaerdemaslot. The next year, under the name \"Poitevin\", he enrolled at Leiden University, which at the time was a Protestant University. He studied both mathematics with Jacobus Golius, who confronted him with Pappus's hexagon theorem, and astronomy with Martin Hortensius. In October 1630, he had a falling-out with Beeckman, whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas. In Amsterdam, he had a relationship with a servant girl, Helena Jans van der Strom, with whom he had a daughter, Francine, who was born in 1635 in Deventer. She was baptized a Protestant and died of scarlet fever at the age of 5.\nUnlike many moralists of the time, Descartes did not deprecate the passions but instead defended them; he wept upon Francine's death in 1640. According to a 2018 biography by Jason Porterfield, \"Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man.\" Russell Shorto speculates that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes's work, changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.\nDespite frequent moves, he wrote all of his major work during his 20-plus years in the Netherlands, initiating a revolution in mathematics and philosophy. In 1633, Galileo was condemned by the Italian Inquisition, and Descartes abandoned plans to publish \"Treatise on the World\", his work of the previous four years. Nevertheless, in 1637, he published parts of this work in three essays: \"Les M\u00e9t\u00e9ores\" (The Meteors), \"La Dioptrique\" (Dioptrics) and \"La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\" (\"Geometry\"), preceded by an introduction, his famous \"Discours de la m\u00e9thode\" (\"Discourse on the Method\"). In it, Descartes lays out four rules of thought, meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt.\nIn \"La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\", Descartes exploited the discoveries he made with Pierre de Fermat. This later became known as Cartesian geometry.\nDescartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641, he published a metaphysics treatise, \"Meditationes de Prima Philosophia\" (\"Meditations on First Philosophy\"), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed in 1644 by \"Principia Philosophiae\" (\"Principles of Philosophy\"), which was dedicated to Sophia of Hanover, a kind of synthesis of the \"Discourse on the Method\" and \"Meditations on First Philosophy\".\nIn 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht, and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague, then eventually to the north of Amsterdam, ultimately settling in Egmond-Binnen.\nBetween 1643 and 1649 Descartes lived with his girlfriend at Egmond-Binnen in an inn. Descartes became friendly with Anthony Studler van Zurck, lord of Bergen, and participated in the design of his mansion and estate. He also met Dirck Rembrantsz van Nierop, a mathematician and surveyor. He was so impressed by Van Nierop's knowledge that he even brought him to the attention of Constantijn Huygens and Frans van Schooten.\nDescartes began (through Alfonso Polloti, an Italian general in Dutch service) a six-year correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects. Connected with this correspondence, in 1649 he published \"Les Passions de l'\u00e2me\" (\"The Passions of the Soul\"), which he dedicated to the Princess. A French translation of \"Principia Philosophiae\", prepared by Abbot Claude Picot, was published in 1647. This edition was also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth. In the preface to the French edition, Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom. He identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth, better and more secure, consisting in the search for first causes.\nSweden.\nBy 1649, Descartes had become one of Europe's most famous philosophers and scientists. That year, Queen Christina of Sweden invited him to her court to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love. Descartes accepted, and moved to the Swedish Empire in the middle of winter. Christina was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish \"The Passions of the Soul\".\nHe was a guest at the house of Pierre Chanut, living on V\u00e4sterl\u00e5nggatan, less than 500 meters from Castle Tre Kronor in Stockholm. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a Torricellian mercury barometer. Challenging Blaise Pascal, Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if atmospheric pressure could be used in forecasting the weather.\nDeath.\nDescartes arranged to tutor Queen Christina after her birthday, three times weekly at 5 a.m. in her cold and draughty castle. However, by 15 January 1650 the Queen had actually met with Descartes only four or five times. It soon became clear they did not like each other, as she did not care for his mechanical philosophy, nor did he share her interest in Ancient Greek language and literature. On 1 February 1650, he contracted pneumonia and died on 11 February at Chanut.\nAccording to Chanut, the cause of death was pneumonia, but peripneumonia according to Christina's physician Johann van Wullen, who was not allowed to bleed him. (The winter seems to have been mild, except for the second half of January which was harsh as described by Descartes himself; however, \"this remark was probably intended to be as much Descartes's take on the intellectual climate as it was about the weather.\")\n has questioned this account, based on a letter by the Doctor van Wullen; however, Descartes had refused his treatment, and more arguments against its veracity have been raised since.\nHis last words were reported to have been:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My soul, though has long been held captive. The hour has now come for thee to quit thy prison, to leave the trammels of this body. Then to this separation with joy and courage!\nAs a Catholic in a Protestant nation, he was interred in the churchyard of what was to become Adolf Fredrik Church in Stockholm, where mainly orphans had been buried. His manuscripts came into the possession of Claude Clerselier, Chanut's brother-in-law, and \"a devout Catholic who has begun the process of turning Descartes into a saint by cutting, adding and publishing his letters selectively.\" In 1663, the Pope placed Descartes's works on the \"Index of Prohibited Books\". In 1666, sixteen years after his death, his remains were taken to France and buried in Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont. In 1671, Louis XIV prohibited all lectures in Cartesianism. Although the National Convention in 1792 had planned to transfer his remains to the Panth\u00e9on, he was reburied in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s in 1819, missing a finger and the skull. His alleged skull is in the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris, but some 2020 researches confirm that it may be a forgery. The original skull was probably divided into pieces in Sweden and given to private collectors; one of those pieces arrived at the University of Lund in 1691, where it is still preserved.\nPhilosophical work.\nIn his \"Discourse on the Method\", he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this, he employed a method called hyperbolic or metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as methodological skepticism or Cartesian doubt: he rejected any ideas that can be doubted and then re-established them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge. He relates this to architecture: the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings. To Descartes, Aristotle's foundationalism was incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism.\nInitially, Descartes arrives at only a single first principle: he thinks. This is expressed in the Latin phrase in \"the Discourse on Method\" \"Cogito, ergo sum\" (English: \"I think, therefore I am\"), originally written in French, \"Je pense, donc je suis.\" Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. \"The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist.\" These two first principles\u2014I think and I exist\u2014were later confirmed by Descartes's clear and distinct perception (delineated in his Third Meditation from \"The Meditations\"): as he clearly and distinctly perceives these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.\nDescartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks, but perceiving his body through the use of the senses is an unreliable evidence. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a \"thinking thing\". Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines \"thought\" (\"cogitatio\") as \"what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it\". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately conscious. He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from dreams, and that one's mind cannot have been \"hijacked\" by an evil demon placing an illusory external world before one's senses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.\nIn this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding perception as unreliable and, instead, admitting only deduction as a method.\nMind\u2013body dualism.\nDescartes, influenced by the automatons on display at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris, investigated the connection between mind and body, and how they interact. His main influences for dualism were theology and physics. The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes's signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced. Known as Cartesian dualism (or mind\u2013body dualism), his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent Western philosophies. In \"Meditations on First Philosophy\", Descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of God and the distinction between the human soul and the body. Humans are a union of mind and body; thus Descartes's dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined. While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of \"modes\", which are the ways in which substances exist. In \"Principles of Philosophy\", Descartes explained, \"we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance\". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction, which Descartes explained as follows:\nThe intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.\nAccording to Descartes, two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus, Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans, and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another. He argued that the great differences between body (an extended thing) and mind (an un-extended, immaterial thing) make the two ontologically distinct. According to Descartes's indivisibility argument, the mind is utterly indivisible: because \"when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete.\"\nMoreover, in The \"Meditations\", Descartes discusses a piece of wax and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism: that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances\u2014the mind or soul defined as thinking, and the body defined as matter and unthinking. The Aristotelian philosophy of Descartes's day held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological. Everything that happened, be it the motion of the stars or the growth of a tree, was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the \"final cause\", and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes's theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of Kepler and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and \"final causes\" in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes's dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or \"res extensa\") in favor of the mind (or \"res cogitans\"). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern physics, it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the soul.\nDescartes's dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was, according to Descartes, a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In The \"Meditations\", Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of \"accidents\". But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:\nNature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.\nDescartes's discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy: What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person? Therefore, Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the mind\u2013body problem for many years after Descartes's death. Descartes argued the theory of innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God. It was this theory of innate knowledge that was later combated by philosopher John Locke (1632\u20131704), an empiricist.\nPhysiology and psychology.\nIn \"The Passions of the Soul\", published in 1649, Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the pineal gland as connector. Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.\nDescartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events, which influenced 19th-century reflex theory. He argued that external motions, such as touch and sound, reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. For example, heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn, animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire. Through this chain of reactions, the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.\nAbove all, he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was divine, thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes's writings went on to form the basis for theories on emotions and how cognitive evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed the brain resembled a working machine and that mathematics, and mechanics could explain complicated processes in it.\nOn animals.\nIt is generally accepted that Descartes had denied that animals had reason or intelligence, as historians have generally reduced Descartes's interpretation of animals to a comparison to machines. At a deeper reading, however, questions surface and his interpretation appears more complex: he argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions, but these could be explained mechanistically, that is, without any appeals to souls. A more attentive investigation of Descartes's study of animals, and their variety, reveals his attention to animal behaviour, an unexpected outcome of his mechanical interpretation. Whereas humans had a soul, or mind, and were able to feel pain and anxiety, animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety. If animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage, but the innate state needed for them to suffer was absent. Although Descartes's views were not universally accepted, they became prominent in Europe and North America, allowing humans to treat animals with impunity. The view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely machines allowed for the maltreatment of animals, and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the 19th century. The publications of Charles Darwin would eventually erode the Cartesian view of animals. Darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species suggested the possibility of animal suffering.\nMoral philosophy.\nFor Descartes, ethics was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics. In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind\u2013body dualism, and defends free will. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that individuals should seek, and virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide their actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge and mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, and as a result wrote his work \"The Passions of the Soul\", that contains a study of the psychosomatic processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions. His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers, and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be, specifically how it should invoke emotion.\nThe moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his \"Discourse on the Method\", he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. Those maxims are known as his .\nGod.\nIn the third and fifth \"Meditation\", Descartes offers proofs of a benevolent God (the trademark argument and the ontological argument respectively). Descartes has faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, since he believed that God provided him with a working mind and sensory system and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction and perception. Regarding epistemology, therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a conception of foundationalism and the possibility that reason is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, however, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.\nDescartes invokes his causal adequacy principle to support his trademark argument for the existence of God, quoting Lucretius in defence: \"Ex nihilo nihil fit\", meaning \"Nothing comes from nothing\" (Lucretius). The argument is \"that our idea of perfection is related to its perfect origin (God), just as a stamp or trademark is left in an article of workmanship by its maker.\" In the fifth Meditation, Descartes presents a version of the ontological argument which is founded on the possibility of thinking the \"idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite,\" and suggests that \"of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct.\"\nDescartes' attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. Pascal regarded Descartes's views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of deism: \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God,\" while a contemporary, Martin Schoock, accused him of atheist beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his \"Meditations\". The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.\nDescartes also wrote a response to external world skepticism. Through this method of skepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory perceptions come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to argue that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the \"propensity\" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true \"substance\". But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.\nDescartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, he replied, \"I do not take it upon myself to try to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God.\"\nMathematics.\n\"x\" for unknown; exponential notation.\nDescartes \"invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\", and knowns by \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\"\". He also \"pioneered the standard notation\" that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 2 used in x2 to indicate x squared.\nAnalytic geometry.\nOne of Descartes's most enduring legacies was his development \u2013 together with Pierre de Fermat \u2013 of Cartesian or analytic geometry, which uses algebra to describe geometry; the Cartesian coordinate system is named after him. Descartes' work on geometry was written to demonstrate its application to correct reasoning he discussed in the \"Discourse on the Method\", which consists of reasoning based on self-evident principles. He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in the system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities. \nBoth Descartes and Fermat were inspired by the works of the Ancient Greek mathematicians Pappus of Alexandria and Apollonius of Perga, especially by their techniques of analysis. Crucial for their work was also the symbolic algebra of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te . The step that their predecessors failed to take was using coordinates to study the relationship between geometry and algebra. \nEuropean mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as Pacioli, Cardano, Tartaglia and Ferrari. Equations of degree higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity \"a2\" could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te, who insisted that a second power must represent an area.\nAlthough Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in envisioning a more general science of algebra or \"universal mathematics\", as a precursor to symbolic logic, that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.\nInfluence on Newton's mathematics.\nIt is often said that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Isaac Newton. Descartes's influence extended not directly from his original French edition of \"La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\", however, but rather from Frans van Schooten's expanded second Latin edition of the work. Newton continued Descartes's work on cubic equations, which freed the subject from the fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables.\nThe basis of calculus.\nDescartes's work provided the basis for the calculus developed by Leibniz and Newton, who applied the infinitesimal calculus to the tangent line problem, thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics. His rule of signs is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.\nPhysics.\nMechanics.\nMechanical philosophy.\nThe beginning of Descartes's interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician Isaac Beeckman, whom he met in 1618, and who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as mechanical philosophy. With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometric physics. It is said that they met when both were looking at a placard that was set up in the Breda marketplace, detailing a mathematical problem to be solved. Descartes asked Beeckman to translate the problem from Dutch to French. In their following meetings Beeckman interested Descartes in his corpuscularian approach to mechanical theory, and convinced him to devote his studies to a mathematical approach to nature. In 1628, Beeckman also introduced him to many of Galileo's ideas. Together, they worked on free fall, catenaries, conic sections, and fluid statics. Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics.\nDescartes's mechanical attempt to study nature reveals success and shortcomings. He managed to explain rather well the functioning of so-called inert phenomena, such as the rainbow, the phenomenon of mock suns, the movement of planets and comets, as well as the differentiation of metals, stones and minerals. This experimental work with metals and inert bodies reveals a different Descartes, investigating nature by means of observations and the uses of microscopes. But there is more, as Descartes tried to explain in the mecahnical terms of his philosophy living nature too - namely, plants and animals. This part shows the complexity of his philosophical programme, but also the most fascinating. On the one hand, Descartes managed to lay the ground for a modern medicine, while on the other hand he failed to establish an overall science of nature. Recently, historians have recognized the importance of Descartes's scientific enterprise in his philosophical work.\nAnticipating the concept of work.\nAlthough the concept of work (in physics) was not formally used until 1826, similar concepts existed before then. In 1637, Descartes wrote: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lifting 100 lb one foot twice over is the same as lifting 200 lb one foot, or 100 lb two feet.\nConservation of motion.\nIn \"Principles of Philosophy\" (\"Principia Philosophiae\") from 1644 Descartes outlined his views on the universe. In it he describes his three laws of motion. (Newton's own laws of motion would later be modeled on Descartes's exposition.) Descartes defined \"quantity of motion\" (\"Latin: quantitas motus\") as the product of size and speed, and claimed that the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If x is twice the size of y, and is moving half as fast, then there's the same amount of motion in each.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[God] created matter, along with its motion ... merely by letting things run their course, he preserves the same amount of motion ... as he put there in the beginning.Descartes had discovered an early form of the law of conservation of momentum. He envisioned quantity of motion as pertaining to motion in a straight line, as opposed to perfect circular motion, as Galileo had envisioned it. Descartes's discovery should not be seen as the modern law of conservation of momentum, since it had no concept of mass as distinct from weight or size, and since he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved.\nDescartes's vortex theory of planetary motion was later rejected by Newton in favor of his law of universal gravitation, and most of the second book of Newton's \"Principia\" is devoted to his counterargument.\nMagnetism.\nDescartes proposed a theory to explain magnetism and explain the observation in \"De Magnete\" by William Gilbert. Descartes considered that 'effluvia' were emitted by a magnet, the effluvia rarefied the air creating pressure differences, and thus forces.\nGlass science.\nIn 1644, Descartes provides one of the earliest microscopic theories of glass. He considered that glass was formed by particles frozen in motion after heated. He also provides one of the earliest understanding of the role of stress and its relief by annealing.\nOptics.\nDescartes also made contributions to the field of optics. He showed by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes's law in France, or more commonly Snell's law elsewhere) that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42\u00b0). He also independently discovered the law of reflection, and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.\nMeteorology.\nWithin \"Discourse on the Method\", there is an appendix in which Descartes discusses his theories on meteorology known as \"Les M\u00e9t\u00e9ores\". He first proposed the idea that the elements were made up of small particles that join together imperfectly, thus leaving small spaces in between. These spaces were then filled with smaller much quicker \"subtile matter\". These particles were different based on what element they constructed, for example, Descartes believed that particles of water were \"like little eels, which, though they join and twist around each other, do not, for all that, ever knot or hook together in such a way that they cannot easily be separated.\" In contrast, the particles that made up the more solid material, were constructed in a way that generated irregular shapes. The size of the particle also matters; if the particle was smaller, not only was it faster and constantly moving, it was more easily agitated by the larger particles, which were slow but had more force. The different qualities, such as combinations and shapes, gave rise to different secondary qualities of materials, such as temperature. This first idea is the basis for the rest of Descartes's theory on meteorology.\nWhile rejecting most of Aristotle's theories on meteorology, he still kept some of the terminology that Aristotle used such as vapors and exhalations. These \"vapors\" would be drawn into the sky by the sun from \"terrestrial substances\" and would generate wind. Descartes also theorized that falling clouds would displace the air below them, also generating wind. Falling clouds could also generate thunder. He theorized that when a cloud rests above another cloud and the air around the top cloud is hot, it condenses the vapor around the top cloud, and causes the particles to fall. When the particles falling from the top cloud collided with the bottom cloud's particles it would create thunder. He compared his theory on thunder to his theory on avalanches. Descartes believed that the booming sound that avalanches created, was due to snow that was heated, and therefore heavier, falling onto the snow that was below it. This theory was supported by experience: \"It follows that one can understand why it thunders more rarely in winter than in summer; for then not enough heat reaches the highest clouds, in order to break them up.\"\nAnother theory that Descartes had was on the production of lightning. Descartes believed that lightning was caused by exhalations trapped between the two colliding clouds. He believed that in order to make these exhalations viable to produce lightning, they had to be made \"fine and inflammable\" by hot and dry weather. Whenever the clouds would collide, it would cause them to ignite, creating lightning; if the cloud above was heavier than the bottom cloud, it would also produce thunder.\nDescartes also believed that clouds were made up of drops of water and ice, and believed that rain would fall whenever the air could no longer support them. It would fall as snow if the air was not warm enough to melt the raindrops. And hail was when the cloud drops would melt, and then freeze again because cold air would refreeze them.\nDescartes did not use mathematics or instruments (as there were not any at the time) to back up his theories on Meteorology and instead used qualitative reasoning in order to deduce his hypothesis.\nHistorical impact.\nEmancipation from Church doctrine.\nDescartes has often been dubbed the father of modern Western philosophy, the thinker whose approaches have profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for modernity. The first two of his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\", those that formulate the famous methodic doubt, represent the portion of Descartes's writings that most influenced modern thinking. It has been argued that Descartes himself did not realize the extent of this revolutionary move. In shifting the debate from \"what is true\" to \"of what can I be certain?\", Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity (even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God)\u2014while the traditional concept of \"truth\" implies an external authority, \"certainty\" instead relies on the judgment of the individual.\nIn an anthropocentric revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an emancipated being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that contributed to the basis of the Modern Era, the repercussions of which are still being felt: the emancipation of humanity from Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand. In modernity, the guarantor of truth is not God anymore but human beings, each of whom is a \"self-conscious shaper and guarantor\" of their own reality. In that way, each person is turned into a reasoning adult, a subject and agent, as opposed to a child obedient to God. This change in perspective was characteristic of the shift from the Christian medieval period to the modern period, a shift that had been anticipated in other fields, and which was now being formulated in the field of philosophy by Descartes.\nThis anthropocentric perspective of Descartes's work, establishing human reason as autonomous, provided the basis for the Enlightenment's emancipation from God and the Church. According to Martin Heidegger, the perspective of Descartes's work also provided the basis for all subsequent anthropology. Descartes's philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern anthropocentrism and subjectivism.\nReception.\nThe \"Discourse\" appeared during Descartes's lifetime in a single edition of 500 copies, 200 of which were set aside for the author. Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of The \"Meditations\", which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartes's death. A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was, however, eagerly sought out by Europe's scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes.\nAlthough Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy (Henricus Regius, 1598\u20131679), Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht, was condemned by the Rector of the university, Gijsbert Voet (Voetius), for teaching Descartes's physics.\nAccording to philosophy professor John Cottingham, Descartes's \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" is considered to be \"one of the key texts of Western philosophy\". Cottingham said that the \"Meditations\" is the \"most widely studied of all Descartes' writings\". According to author Anthony Gottlieb, one of the reasons Descartes and Thomas Hobbes continue to be debated in the second decade of the twenty-first century, is that they still have something to say to us that remains relevant on questions such as, \"What does the advance of science entail for our understanding of ourselves and our ideas of God?\" and \"How is government to deal with religious diversity?\"\nBibliography.\nWritings.\nIn January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through Google. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by Haverford College in Haverford, Pennsylvania. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.\nCollected editions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly editions of specific works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCollected English translations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranslation of single works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Romansh has been recognized as a national language of Switzerland since 1938, and as an official language in correspondence with Romansh-speaking citizens since 1996, along with German, French, and Italian. It also has official status in the canton of the Grisons alongside German and Italian and is used as the medium of instruction in schools in Romansh-speaking areas. It is sometimes grouped by linguists with Ladin and Friulian as the Rhaeto-Romance languages, though this is disputed.\nRomansh is one of the descendant languages of the spoken Latin language of the Roman Empire, which by the 5th century AD replaced the Celtic and Raetic languages previously spoken in the area. Romansh retains a small number of words from these languages. Romansh has also been strongly influenced by German in vocabulary and morphosyntax. The language gradually retreated to its current area over the centuries, being replaced in other areas by Alemannic and Bavarian dialects. The earliest writing identified as Romansh dates from the 10th or 11th century, although major works did not appear until the 16th century, when several regional written varieties began to develop. During the 19th century the area where the language was spoken declined due to the industrialization of Switzerland, but the Romansh speakers had a literary revival and started a language movement dedicated to halting the decline of their language.\nIn the 2000 Swiss census, 35,095 people (of whom 27,038 live in the canton of the Grisons) indicated Romansh as the language of \"best command\", and 61,815 as a \"regularly spoken\" language. In 2010, Switzerland switched to a yearly system of assessment that uses a combination of municipal citizen records and a limited number of surveys. In 2019, 40,074 Swiss residents primarily spoke Romansh; in 2017, 28,698 inhabitants of the canton of the Grisons (14.7% of the population) used it as their main language.\nRomansh is divided into five different regional dialect groups (Sursilvan, Vallader, Put\u00e8r, Surmiran, and Sutsilvan), each with its own standardized written language. In addition, a pan-regional variety called Rumantsch Grischun was introduced in 1982, which is controversial among Romansh speakers.\nLinguistic classification.\nRomansh is a Romance language descending from Vulgar Latin, the spoken language of the Roman Empire. Among the Romance languages, Romansh stands out because of its peripheral location. This has resulted in several archaic features. Another distinguishing feature is the centuries-long language contact with German, which is most noticeable in the vocabulary and to a lesser extent the syntax of Romansh. Romansh belongs to the Gallo-Romance branch of the Romance languages, which includes languages such as French, Occitan, and Lombard. The main feature placing Romansh within the Gallo-Romance languages is the fronting of Latin to or , as seen in Latin \"wall\", which is or in Romansh.\nThe main features distinguishing Romansh from the Gallo-Italic languages to the south, and placing it closer to Ladin, Friulian and Franco-Provencal, are:\nAnother defining feature of the Romansh language is the use of unstressed vowels. All unstressed vowels except disappeared.\nWhether or not Romansh, Friulan, and Ladin should compose a separate \"Rhaeto-Romance\" subgroup within Gallo-Romance is an unresolved issue, known as the . Some linguists posit that these languages are descended from a common language, which was fractured geographically through the spread of German and Italian. The Italian linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli first made the claim in 1873. The other position holds that any similarities between these three languages can be explained through their relative geographic isolation, which shielded them from certain linguistic changes. By contrast, the Gallo-Italic varieties of Northern Italy were more open to linguistic influences from the South. Linguists who take this position often point out that the similarities between the languages are comparatively few. This position was first introduced by the Italian dialectologist Carlo Battisti.\nThis linguistic dispute became politically relevant for the Italian irredentist movement. Italian nationalists interpreted Battisti's hypothesis as implying that Romansh, Friulan, and Ladin were not separate Romance languages but rather Italian dialects. They used this hypothesis as an argument to claim the territories for Italy where these languages were spoken. From a sociolinguistic perspective, however, this question is largely irrelevant. The speakers of Romansh have always identified as speaking a language distinct from both Italian and other Romance varieties. Furthermore, unlike Friulian, Ladin, or Lombard, Romansh is located north of the German-Italian linguistic border, and German has influenced the language much more than Italian has.\nDialects.\nRomansh comprises a group of closely related dialects, which are most commonly divided into five different varieties, each of which has developed a standardized form. These regional standards are referred to as \"idioms\" in Romansh to distinguish them from the local vernaculars, which are referred to as \"dialects\". These dialects form a dialect continuum without clear-cut divisions. Historically a continuous speech area, this continuum has now been ruptured by the spread of German, so that Romansh is now geographically divided into at least two non-adjacent parts.\nAside from these five major dialects, two additional varieties are often distinguished. One is the dialect of the Val M\u00fcstair, which is closely related to Vallader but often separately referred to as \"Jauer\" (Romansh: \"jauer\"; derived from the personal pronoun \"jau\" \"I\", i.e. \"the \"jau\"-sayers\"). Less commonly distinguished is the dialect of Tujetsch and the Val Medel, which is markedly different from Sursilvan and is referred to as \"Tuatschin\".\nAdditionally, the standardized variety Rumantsch Grischun, intended for pan-regional use, was introduced in 1982. The dialect of the Val Bregaglia is usually considered a variety of Lombard, and speakers use Italian as their written language, even though the dialect shares many features with the neighboring Put\u00e8r dialect of Romansh.\nAs these varieties form a continuum with small transitions from each village to the next, there is no straightforward internal grouping of the Romansh dialects. The Romansh language area can be described best as consisting of two widely divergent varieties, Sursilvan in the west and the dialects of the Engadine in the east, with Sutsilvan and Surmiran forming a transition zone between them. The Engadinese varieties \"Put\u00e8r\" and \"Vallader\" are often referred to as one specific variety known as \"Ladin\" (Ladin, Sursilvan, Surmiran, and Rumantsch Grischun: ; Sutsilvan: \"ladegn\"), which is not to be confused with the closely related language in Italy's Dolomite mountains also known as Ladin. Sutsilvan and Surmiran are sometimes grouped together as Central Romansh (rm. \"Grischun central\"), and then grouped together with Sursilvan as \"Rhenish Romansh\" (in German, \"Rheinischromanisch\").\nOne feature that separates the Rhenish varieties from Ladin is the retention of the rounded front vowels and (written \"\u00fc\" and \"\u00f6\") in Ladin, which have been unrounded in the other dialects, as in Ladin , Sursilvan , Surmiran \"meir\" \"wall\" or Ladin to Rhenish \"cheese\". Another is the development of Latin -CT-, which has developed into /t\u0255/ in the Rhenish varieties as in \"d\u00e9tg\" \"said\" or \"fatg\" \"did\", while developing into /t/ in Ladin (\"dit\" and \"fat\"). A feature separating Sursilvan from Central Romansh, however, involves the extent of palatalization of Latin /k/ in front of /a/, which is rare in Sursilvan but common in the other varieties: Sursilvan , Sutsilvan \"tgea\", Surmiran \"tgesa\", Put\u00e8r , and Vallader \"house\". Overall, however, the Central Romansh varieties do not share many unique features, but rather connect Sursilvan and Ladin through a succession of numerous small differences from one village to the next.\nThe dialects of Romansh are not always mutually comprehensible. Speakers of Sursilvan and Ladin, in particular, are usually unable to understand each other initially. Because speakers usually identify themselves primarily with their regional dialect, many do not take the effort to attempt to understand unfamiliar dialects, and prefer to speak Swiss German with speakers of other varieties. A common Romansh identity is not widespread outside intellectual circles, even though this has been changing among the younger generation.\nHistory.\nOrigins and development until modern times.\nRomansh originates from the spoken Latin brought to the region by Roman soldiers, merchants, and officials following the conquest of the modern-day Grisons area by the Romans in 15\u00a0BC. Before that, the inhabitants spoke Celtic and Raetic languages, with Raetic apparently being spoken mainly in the Lower Engadine valley. Traces of these languages survive mainly in toponyms, including village names such as Tschlin, Scuol, Savognin, Glion, Breil/Brigels, Brienz/Brinzauls, Purtenza, and Trun. Additionally, a small number of pre-Latin words have survived in Romansh, mainly concerning animals, plants, and geological features unique to the Alps, such as \"camutsch\" \"chamois\" and \"grava\" \"scree\".\nIt is unknown how rapidly the Celtic and Raetic inhabitants were Romanized following the conquest of Raetia. Some linguists assume that the area was rapidly Romanized following the Roman conquest, whereas others think that this process did not end until the 4th or 5th century, when more thoroughly Romanized Celts from farther north fled south to avoid invasions by Germanic tribes. The process was certainly complete and the pre-Roman languages extinct by the 5th\u20136th century, when Raetia became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom. Around 537\u00a0AD, the Ostrogoths handed over the province of Raetia Prima to the Frankish Empire, which continued to have local rulers administering the so-called Duchy of Chur. However, after the death of the last Victorid ruler, Bishop Tello, around 765\u00a0AD, Charlemagne assigned a Germanic duke to administer the region. Additionally, the Diocese of Chur was transferred by the (pre-Schism) Roman Catholic Church from the Archdiocese of Milan to the Diocese of Mainz in 843\u00a0AD. The combined effect was a cultural reorientation towards the German-speaking north, especially as the ruling \u00e9lite now comprised almost entirely speakers of German.\nAt the time, Romansh was spoken over a much wider area, stretching north into the present-day cantons of Glarus and St. Gallen, to the Walensee in the northwest, and R\u00fcthi and the Alpine Rhine Valley in the northeast. In the east, parts of modern-day Vorarlberg were Romansh-speaking, as were parts of Tyrol. The northern areas, called Lower Raetia, became German-speaking by the 12th century; and by the 15th century, the Rhine Valley of St. Gallen and the areas around the Walensee were entirely German-speaking. This language shift was a long, drawn-out process, with larger, central towns adopting German first, while the more peripheral areas around them remained Romansh-speaking longer. The shift to German was caused in particular by the influence of the local German-speaking \u00e9lites and by German-speaking immigrants from the north, with the lower and rural classes retaining Romansh longer.\nIn addition, beginning around 1270, the German-speaking Walser began settling in sparsely populated or uninhabited areas within the Romansh-speaking heartland. The Walser sometimes expanded into Romansh-speaking areas from their original settlements, which then often became German-speaking, such as Davos, Schanfigg, the Pr\u00e4ttigau, Schams, and Valendas, which became German-speaking by the 14th century. In rare cases, these Walser settlements were eventually assimilated by their Romansh-speaking neighbors; for instance, Oberhalbstein, Medel, and Tujetsch in the Surselva region.\nThe Germanization of Chur had particularly long-term consequences. Even though the city had long before ceased to be a cultural center of Romansh, the spoken language of the capital of the Diocese of Chur continued to be Romansh until the 15th century. After a fire in 1465 which virtually destroyed the city, many German-speaking artisans who had been called in to help repair the damage settled there, causing German to become the majority language. In a chronicle written in 1571\u201372, Durich Chiampell mentions that Romansh was still spoken in Chur roughly a hundred years before, but had since then rapidly given way to German and was now not much appreciated by the inhabitants of the city. Many linguists regard the loss of Chur to German as a crucial event. According to Sylvia Osswald, for example, it occurred precisely at a time when the introduction of the printing press could have led to the adoption of the Romansh dialect of the capital as a common written language for all Romansh speakers. Other linguists such as Jachen Curdin Arquint remain skeptical of this view, however, and assume that the various Romansh-speaking regions would still have developed their own separate written standards.\nInstead, several regional written varieties of Romansh began appearing during the 16th century. Gian Travers wrote the first surviving work in Romansh, the \"Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da M\u00fcs\", in the Put\u00e8r dialect. This epic poem, written in 1527, describes the first Musso war, in which Travers himself had taken part. Travers also translated numerous biblical plays into Romansh, though only the titles survive for many of them. Another early writer, Giachem Bifrun, who also wrote in Put\u00e8r, penned the first printed book in Romansh, a catechism published in 1552. In 1560 he published a translation of the New Testament: \"L'g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ\".\nTwo years later, in 1562, another writer from the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, published the \"Cudesch da Psalms\", a collection of church songs in the Vallader dialect. These early works are generally well written and show that the authors had a large amount of Romansh vocabulary at their disposal, contrary to what one might expect of the first pieces of writing in a language. Because of this, the linguist Ricarda Liver assumes that these written works built on an earlier, pre-literature tradition of using Romansh in administrative and legal situations, of which no evidence survives. In their prefaces, the authors themselves often mention the novelty of writing Romansh, and discuss an apparently common prejudice that Romansh was a language that could not be written.\nThe first writing in the Sursilvan and Sutsilvan dialects appears in the 17th century. As in the Engadine, these early works usually focused on religious themes, in particular the struggles between Protestants and Counter-Reformers. Daniel Bonifaci produced the first surviving work in this category, the catechism \"Curt mussameint dels principals punctgs della Christianevla Religiun\", published in 1601 in the Sutsilvan dialect. A second edition, published in 1615, is closer to Sursilvan, however, and writings in Sutsilvan do not appear again until the 20th century. In 1611, (\"The true joys of young people\"), a series of religious instructions for Protestant youths, was published by Steffan Gabriel. Four years later, in 1615, a Catholic catechism, \"Curt Mussament\", was published in response, written by Gion Antoni Calvenzano. The first translation of the New Testament into Sursilvan was published in 1648 by the son of Steffan Gabriel, Luci Gabriel.\nThe first complete translation of the Bible, the \"Bibla da Cuera\", was published between 1717 and 1719. The Sursilvan dialect thus had two separate written varieties, one used by the Protestants with its cultural center around Ilanz, and a Catholic variety with the Disentis Abbey as its center. The Engadine dialect was also written in two varieties: Put\u00e8r in the Upper Valley and Vallader in the Lower Valley. The Sutsilvan areas either used the Protestant variety of Sursilvan, or simply used German as their main written language. The Surmiran region began developing its own variety in the early 18th century, with a catechism being published in 1703, though either the Catholic variety of Sursilvan or Put\u00e8r was more commonly used there until the 20th century.\nIn the 16th century, the language border between Romansh and German largely stabilized, and it remained almost unchanged until the late 19th century. During this period, only isolated areas became German-speaking, mainly a few villages around Thusis and the village of Samnaun. In the case of Samnaun, the inhabitants adopted the Bavarian dialect of neighboring Tyrol, making Samnaun the only municipality of Switzerland where a Bavarian dialect is spoken. The Vinschgau in South Tyrol was still Romansh-speaking in the 17th century, after which it became entirely German-speaking because of the Counter-Reformation denunciation of Romansh as a \"Protestant language\".\nRomansh during the 19th and 20th centuries.\nWith the Act of Mediation, the Grisons became a canton of Switzerland in 1803. The constitution of the canton dates from 1892. When the Grisons became part of Switzerland in 1803, it had a population of roughly 73,000, of whom around 36,600 were Romansh speakers\u2014many of them monolingual\u2014living mostly within the Romansh-speaking valleys. The language border with German, which had mostly been stable since the 16th century, now began moving again as more and more villages shifted to German. One cause was the admission of Grisons as a Swiss canton, which brought Romansh-speakers into more frequent contact with German-speakers. Another factor was the increased power of the central government of the Grisons, which had always used German as its administrative language. In addition, many Romansh-speakers migrated to the larger cities, which were German-speaking, while speakers of German settled in Romansh villages. Moreover, economic changes meant that the Romansh-speaking villages, which had mostly been self-sufficient, engaged in more frequent commerce with German-speaking regions. Also, improvements in the infrastructure made travel and contact with other regions much easier than it had been.\nFinally, the rise of tourism made knowledge of German an economic necessity in many areas, while the agricultural sector, which had been a traditional domain of Romansh, became less important. All this meant that knowledge of German became more and more of a necessity for Romansh speakers and that German became more and more a part of daily life. For the most part, German was seen not as a threat but rather as an important asset for communicating outside one's home region. The common people frequently demanded better access to learning German. When public schools began to appear, many municipalities decided to adopt German as the medium of instruction, as in the case of Ilanz, where German became the language of schooling in 1833, when the town was still largely Romansh-speaking.\nSome people even welcomed the disappearance of Romansh, in particular among progressives. In their eyes, Romansh was an obstacle to the economic and intellectual development of the Romansh people. For instance, the priest Heinrich Bansi from Ardez wrote in 1797: \"The biggest obstacle to the moral and economical improvement of these regions is the language of the people, Ladin [...] The German language could certainly be introduced with ease into the Engadine, as soon as one could convince the people of the immense advantages of it\". Others, however, saw Romansh as an economic asset, since it gave the Romansh an advantage when learning other Romance languages. In 1807, for example, the priest Mattli Conrad wrote an article listing the advantages and disadvantages of Romansh: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Romansh language is an immense advantage in learning so much more rapidly the languages derived from Latin of France, Italy, Spain etc, as can be seen with the Romansh youth, which travels to these countries and learns their language with ease. [...] We live in between an Italian and a German people. How practical is it, when one can learn the languages of both without effort?\u2014\u200a\nIn response, the editor of the newspaper added that:\nAccording to the testimony of experienced and vigilant language teachers, while the one who is born Romansh can easily learn to understand these languages and make himself understood in them, he has great difficulties in learning them properly, since precisely because of the similarity, he mixes them so easily with his own bastardized language. [...] in any case, the conveniences named should hold no weight against all the disadvantages that come from such an isolated and uneducated language.\nAccording to Mathias Kundert, this quote is a good example of the attitude of many German-speakers towards Romansh at the time. According to Mathias Kundert, while there was never a plan to Germanize the Romansh areas of Grisons, many German-speaking groups wished that the entire canton would become German-speaking. They were careful, however, to avoid any drastic measures to that extent, in order not to antagonize the influential Romansh minority.\nThe decline of Romansh over the 20th century can be seen through the results of the Swiss censuses. The decline in percentages is only partially due to the Germanization of Romansh areas, since the Romansh-speaking valleys always had a lower overall population growth than other parts of the canton.\nStarting in the mid-19th century, however, a revival movement began, often called the \"Rhaeto-Romansh renaissance\". This movement involved an increased cultural activity, as well as the foundation of several organizations dedicated to protecting the Romansh language. In 1863, the first of several attempts was made to found an association for all Romansh regions, which eventually led to the foundation of the in 1885. In 1919, the Lia Rumantscha was founded to serve as an umbrella organization for the various regional language societies. Additionally, the role of Romansh in schooling was strengthened, with the first Romansh school books being published in the 1830s and 1840s. Initially, these were merely translations of the German editions, but by the end of the 19th century teaching materials were introduced which took the local Romansh culture into consideration. Additionally, Romansh was introduced as a subject in teacher's college in 1860 and was recognized as an official language by the canton in 1880.\nAround the same time, grammar and spelling guidelines began to be developed for the regional written dialects. One of the earliest was the by Zaccaria Pallioppi, published in 1857. For Sursilvan, a first attempt to standardize the written language was the by Baseli Carigiet, published in 1858, followed by a Sursilvan-German dictionary in 1882, and the \"Normas ortografias\" by Giachen Caspar Muoth in 1888. Neither of these guidelines managed to gather much support. At the same time, the Canton published school books in its own variety. Sursilvan was then definitely standardized through the works of Gion Cahannes, who published \"Grammatica Romontscha per Surselva e Sutselva\" in 1924, followed by \"Entruidament devart nossa ortografia\" in 1927. The Surmiran dialect had its own norms established in 1903, when the Canton agreed to finance the school book \"Codesch da lectura per las scolas primaras de Surmeir\", though a definite guideline, the \"Normas ortograficas per igl rumantsch da Surmeir\", was not published until 1939. In the meantime, the norms of Pallioppi had come under criticism in the Engadine due to the strong influence of Italian in them. This led to an orthographic reform which was concluded by 1928, when the by Cristoffel Bardola was published. A separate written variety for Sutsilvan was developed in 1944 by Giuseppe Gangale.\nAround 1880, the entire Romansh-speaking area still formed a continuous geographical unit. But by the end of the century, the so-called \"Central-Grisons language bridge\" began to disappear. From Thusis, which had become German-speaking in the 16th/17th century, the Heinzenberg and Domleschg valleys were gradually Germanized over the next decades. Around the turn of the century, the inner Heinzenberg and Cazis became German-speaking, followed by Rothenbrunnen, Rodels, Almens, and Pratval, splitting the Romansh area into two geographically non-connected parts. In the 1920s and 1930s the rest of the villages in the valley became mainly German-speaking, sealing the split.\nIn order to halt the decline of Romansh, the Lia Rumantscha began establishing Romansh day care schools, called , beginning in the 1940s with the aim of reintroducing Romansh to children. Although the had some success \u2013 of the ten villages where Scoletas were established, the children began speaking Romansh amongst themselves in four, with the children in four others acquiring at least some knowledge of Romansh \u2013 the program ultimately failed to preserve the language in the valley.\nA key factor was the disinterest of the parents, whose main motivation for sending their children to the Scoletas appears to have been that they were looked after for a few hours and given a meal every day, rather than an interest in preserving Romansh. The other factor was that after entering primary school, the children received a few hours a week of Romansh instruction at best. As a result, the last Scoletas were closed in the 1960s with the exception of Pr\u00e4z, where the Scoleta remained open until 1979.\nIn other areas, such as the Engadine and the Surselva, where the pressure of German was equally strong, Romansh was maintained much better and remained a commonly spoken language. According to the linguist Mathias Kundert, one important factor was the different social prestige of Romansh. In the Heinzenberg and Domleschg valleys, the elite had been German-speaking for centuries, so that German was associated with power and education, even though most people did not speak it, whereas Romansh was associated with peasant life. In the Engadine and the Surselva by contrast, the elite was itself Romansh-speaking, so that Romansh there was \"not only the language spoken to children and cows, but also that of the village notable, the priest, and the teacher.\" Additionally, Romansh schools had been common for several years before German had become a necessity, so that Romansh was firmly established as a medium of education.\nLikewise, in the Upper Engadine, where factors such as increased mobility and immigration by German speakers were even stronger, Romansh was more firmly established as a language of education and administration, so that the language was maintained to a much greater extent. In the Central Grisons, by contrast, German had been a central part of schooling since the beginning, and virtually all schools switched entirely to German as the language of instruction by 1900, with children in many schools being punished for speaking Romansh well into the 1930s.\nRumantsch Grischun.\nEarly attempts to create a unified written language for Romansh include the \"Romonsch fusionau\" of Gion Antoni B\u00fchler in 1867 and the \"Interrumantsch\" by Leza Uffer in 1958. Neither was able to gain much support, and their creators were largely the only ones actively using them. In the meantime, the Romansh movement sought to promote the different regional varieties while promoting a gradual convergence of the five varieties, called the \"avischinaziun\". In 1982, however, the then secretary of the Lia Rumantscha, a sociolinguist named Bernard Cathomas, launched a project for designing a pan-regional variety. The linguist Heinrich Schmid presented to the Lia Rumantscha the same year the rules and directives for this standard language under the name Rumantsch Grischun (Rumantsch Grischun: \"rumantsch grischun\"). Schmid's approach consisted of creating a language as equally acceptable as possible to speakers of the different dialects, by choosing those forms which were found in a majority of the three strongest varieties: Sursilvan, Vallader, and Surmiran (Puter has more speakers than Surmiran but is spoken by a lower percentage of the population in its area). The elaboration of the new standard was endorsed by the Swiss National Fund and carried out by a team of young Romansh linguists under the guidance of Georges Darms and Anna-Alice Dazzi-Gross.\nThe Lia Rumantscha then began introducing Rumantsch Grischun to the public, announcing that it would be chiefly introduced into domains where only German was being used, such as official forms and documents, billboards, and commercials. In 1984, the assembly of delegates of the head organization Lia Rumantscha decided to use the new standard language when addressing all Romansh-speaking areas of the Grisons. From the very start, Rumansh Grischun has been implemented only on the basis of a decision of the particular institutions. In 1986, the federal administration began to use Rumantsch Grischun for single texts. The same year, however, several influential figures began to criticize the introduction of Rumantsch Grischun. Donat Cadruvi, at the time the president of the cantonal government, claimed that the Lia Rumantscha was trying to force the issue. Romansh writer Theo Candinas also called for a public debate on the issue, calling Rumantsch Grischun a \"plague\" and \"death blow\" to Romansh and its introduction a \"Romansh Kristallnacht\", thus launching a highly emotional and bitter debate which would continue for several years. The following year, Candinas published another article titled \"Rubadurs Garmadis\" in which he compared the proponents of Rumantsch Grischun to Nazi thugs raiding a Romansh village and desecrating, destroying, and burning the Romansh cultural heritage.\nThe proponents responded by labeling the opponents as a small group of archconservative and narrow-minded Sursilvans and CVP politicians among other things. The debate was characterized by a heavy use of metaphors, with opponents describing Rumantsch Grischun as a \"test-tube baby\" or \"castrated language\". They argued that it was an artificial and infertile creation which lacked a heart and soul, in contrast to the traditional dialects. On the other side, proponents called on the Romansh people to nurture the \"new-born\" to allow it to grow, with Romansh writer Ursicin Derungs calling Rumantsch Grischun a \"lungatg virginal\" \"virgin language\" that now had to be seduced and turned into a blossoming woman.\nThe opposition to Rumantsch Grischun also became clear in the Swiss census of 1990, in which certain municipalities refused to distribute questionnaires in Rumantsch Grischun, requesting the German version instead. Following a survey on the opinion of the Romansh population on the issue, the government of the Grisons decided in 1996 that Rumantsch Grischun would be used when addressing all Romansh speakers, but the regional varieties could continue to be used when addressing a single region or municipality. In schools, Rumantsch Grischun was not to replace the regional dialects but only be taught passively.\nThe compromise was largely accepted by both sides. A further recommendation in 1999, known as the \"Haltinger concept\", also proposed that the regional varieties should remain the basis of the Romansh schools, with Rumantsch Grischun being introduced in middle school and secondary school.\nThe government of the Grisons then took steps to strengthen the role of Rumantsch Grischun as an official language. Since the cantonal constitution explicitly named Sursilvan and Engadinese as the languages of ballots, a referendum was launched to amend the relevant article. In the referendum, which took place on June 10, 2001, 65% voted in favor of naming Rumantsch Grischun the only official Romansh variety of the Canton. Opponents of Rumantsch Grischun such as Renata Coray and Matthias Gr\u00fcnert argue, however, that if only those municipalities with at least 30% Romansh speakers were considered, the referendum would have been rejected by 51%, with an even larger margin if only those with at least 50% Romansh speakers were considered. They thus interpret the results as the Romansh minority having been overruled by the German-speaking majority of the canton.\nA major change in policy came in 2003, when the cantonal government proposed a number of spending cuts, including a proposal according to which new Romansh teaching materials would not be published except in Rumantsch Grischun from 2006 onwards, the logical result of which would be to abolish the regional varieties as languages of instruction. The cantonal parliament passed the measure in August 2003, even advancing the deadline to 2005. The decision was met by strong opposition, in particular in the Engadine, where teachers collected over 4,300 signatures opposing the measure, followed by a second petition signed by around 180 Romansh writers and cultural figures, including many who were supportive of Rumantsch Grischun but opposed its introduction as a language of instruction.\nOpponents argued that Romansh culture and identity was transmitted through the regional varieties and not through Rumantsch Grischun and that Rumantsch Grischun would serve to weaken rather than strengthen Romansh, possibly leading to a switch to German-language schools and a swift Germanization of Romansh areas.\nThe cantonal government refused to debate the issue again, instead deciding on a three-step plan in December 2004 to introduce Rumantsch Grischun as the language of schooling, allowing the municipalities to choose when they would make the switch. The decision not to publish any new teaching materials in the regional varieties was not overturned at this point, however, raising the question of what would happen in those municipalities that refused to introduce Rumantsch Grischun at all, since the language of schooling is decided by the municipalities themselves in the Grisons.\nThe teachers of the Engadine in particular were outraged over the decision, but those in the Surmeir were mostly satisfied. Few opinions were heard from the Surselva, which was interpreted either as support or resignation, depending on the viewpoint of the observer.\nIn 2007\u20132008, 23 so called \"pioneer-municipalities\" (Lantsch/Lenz, Brienz/Brinzauls, Tiefencastel, Alvaschein, Mon, Stierva, Salouf, Cunter, Riom-Parsonz, Savognin, Tinizong-Rona, Mulegns, Sur, Marmorera, Falera, Laax, Trin, M\u00fcstair, Santa Maria Val M\u00fcstair, Valchava, Fuldera, Tschierv and L\u00fc) introduced Rumantsch Grischun as the language of instruction in 1st grade, followed by an additional 11 (Ilanz, Schnaus, Flond, Schluein, Pitasch, Riein, Sevgein, Castrisch, Surcuolm, Luven and Duvin) the following year and another 6 (Sagogn, Rueun, Siat, Pigniu, Waltensburg/Vuorz and Andiast) in 2009\u20132010. However, other municipalities, including the entire Engadine valley and most of the Surselva, continued to use their regional variety. The cantonal government aimed to introduce Rumantsch Grischun as the sole language of instruction in Romansh schools by 2020.\nIn early 2011, a group of opponents in the Surselva and the Engadine founded the association Pro Idioms, demanding the overturning of the government decision of 2003 and launching numerous local initiatives to return to the regional varieties as the language of instruction. In April 2011, Riein became the first municipality to vote to return to teaching in Sursilvan, followed by an additional 4 in December, and a further 10 in early 2012, including Val M\u00fcstair (returning to Vallader), which had been the first to introduce Rumantsch Grischun. As of September 2013, all those municipalities in the Surselva which had switched to Rumantsch Grischun had decided to return to teaching in Sursilvan, with the exception of Pitasch, which, followed later.\nSupporters of Rumantsch Grischun then announced that they would take the issue to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland and announced their intention to launch a cantonal referendum to enshrine Rumantsch Grischun as the language of instruction.\nThe Lia Rumantscha opposes these moves and now supports a model of coexistence in which Rumantsch Grischun will supplement but not replace the regional varieties in school. It cites the need for keeping linguistic peace among Romansh speakers, as it says that the decades-long debate over the issue has torn friends and even families apart. The canton's 2003 decision not to finance school books in the regional varieties was overturned in December 2011.\nRumantsch Grischun is still a project in progress. At the start of 2014, it was in use as a school language in the central part of the Grisons and in the bilingual classes in the region of Chur. It was taught in upper-secondary schools, in the university of teacher education in Chur and at the universities of Z\u00fcrich and Fribourg, along with the Romansh idioms. It remains an official and administrative language in the Swiss Confederation and the Canton of the Grisons as well as in public and private institutions for all kinds of texts intended for the whole Romansh-speaking territory.\nUntil 2021, Surmiran was the only regional variety that was not taught in schools, as all the Surmiran-writing municipalities had switched to Rumantsch Grischun. However, referendums in Surses, Lantsch/Lenz and Albula/Alvra in 2020 led to the return to Surmiran as the language of instruction in the entire Surmiran-writing area, beginning with those pupils who started school in 2021. The only primary schools that will continue teaching in Rumantsch Grischun are the bilingual Romansh/German schools in the cantonal capital of Chur, which is located in a German-speaking area, and in Trin and Domat/Ems, where the local dialects are Sutsilvan but Sursilvan has traditionally been used as the written language.\nRumantsch Grischun is read in the news of Radiotelevisiun Svizra Rumantscha and written in the daily newspaper \"La Quotidiana\", along with the Romansh idioms. Thanks to many new texts in a wide variety of political and social functions, the Romansh vocabulary has been decisively broadened.\nThe \"Pledari Grond\" German\u2013Rumantsch Grischun dictionary, with more than 215\u00a0000 entries, is the most comprehensive collection of Romansh words, which can also be used in the idioms with the necessary phonetic shifts. The signatories of \"Pro Rumantsch\" stress that Romansh needs both the idioms and Rumantsch Grischun if it is to improve its chances in today's communication society. There also exist individual dictionaries for each of the different idioms: Sursilvan, Vallader, Puter, Surmiran, and Sutsilvan. As well, the \"Pledari Grond\" dictionary links to several texts on the grammar of Vallader, Puter, and Rumantsch Grischun.\nOfficial status in Switzerland and language politics.\nIn Switzerland, official language use is governed by the \"territorial principle\": Cantonal law determines which of the four national languages enjoys official status in which part of the territory. Only the federal administration is officially quadrilingual. Romansh is an official language at the federal level, one of the three official languages of the Canton of the Grisons, and is a working language in various districts and numerous municipalities within the canton.\nOfficial status at the federal level.\nThe first Swiss constitution of 1848, as well as the subsequent revision of 1872, made no mention of Romansh, which at the time was not a working language of the Canton of the Grisons either. The federal government did finance a translation of the constitution into the two Romansh varieties Sursilvan and Vallader in 1872, noting, however, that these did not carry the force of law. Romansh became a national language of Switzerland in 1938, following a referendum. A distinction was introduced between \"national languages\" and \"official languages\". The status of a national language was largely symbolic, whereas only official languages were to be used in official documents, a status reserved for German, French, and Italian. The recognition of Romansh as the fourth national language is best seen within the context of the \"Spiritual defence\" preceding World War II, which aimed to underline the special status of Switzerland as a multinational country. Additionally, this was supposed to discredit the efforts of Italian nationalists to claim Romansh as a dialect of Italian and establish a claim to parts of the Grisons. The Romansh language movement led by the Lia Rumantscha was mostly satisfied with the status as a national but not official language. Their aims at the time were to secure a symbolic \"right of residence\" for Romansh, and not actual use in official documents.\nThis status did have disadvantages. For instance, official name registers and property titles had to be in German, French, or Italian. This meant that Romansh-speaking parents were often forced to register their children under German or Italian versions of their Romansh names. As late as 1984, the Canton of the Grisons was ordered not to make entries into its corporate registry in Romansh. The Swiss National Bank first planned to include Romansh on its bills in 1956, when a new series was introduced. Due to disputes within the Lia Rumantscha over whether the bills were to feature the Sursilvan version \" or the Vallader version \", the bills eventually featured the Italian version twice, alongside French and German. When new bills were again introduced in 1976/77, a Romansh version was added by finding a compromise between the two largest varieties Sursilvan and Vallader, which read \"\", while the numbers on the bills were printed in Surmiran.\nFollowing a referendum on March 10, 1996, Romansh was recognized as a partial official language of Switzerland alongside German, French, and Italian in article 70 of the federal constitution. According to the article, German, French, Italian, and Romansh are national languages of Switzerland. The official languages are declared to be German, French, and Italian, and Romansh is an official language for correspondence with Romansh-speaking people. This means that in principle, it is possible to address the federal administration in Romansh and receive an answer in the same language. More precisely, under section 2.6.3 of the Federal Act on the National Languages and Understanding between the Linguistic Communities, Romansh speakers may address the administration in any variety of Romansh, though they will receive a response in Rumantsch Grischun.\nIn what the Federal Culture Office itself admits is \"more a placatory and symbolic use\" of Romansh, the federal authorities occasionally translate some official texts into Romansh. In general, though, demand for Romansh-language services is low because, according to the Federal Culture Office, Romansh speakers may either dislike the official Rumantsch Grischun idiom or prefer to use German in the first place, as most are perfectly bilingual. Without a unified standard language, the status of an official language of the Swiss Confederation would not have been conferred to Romansh. It takes time and needs to be promoted to get implemented in this new function.\nThe Swiss Armed Forces attempted to introduce Romansh as an official language of command between 1988 and 1992. Attempts were made to form four entirely Romansh-speaking companies, but these efforts were abandoned in 1992 due to a lack of sufficient Romansh-speaking non-commissioned officers. Official use of Romansh as a language of command was discontinued in 1995 as part of a reform of the Swiss military.\nOfficial status in the canton of the Grisons.\nThe Grisons is the only canton of Switzerland where Romansh is recognized as an official language. The only working language of the Three Leagues was German until 1794, when the assembly of the leagues declared German, Italian, Sursilvan, and Ladin (Put\u00e8r and Vallader) to have equal official standing. No explicit mention of any official language was made in the cantonal constitutions of 1803, 1814, and 1854. The constitution of 1880 declared that \"The three languages of the Canton are guaranteed as national languages, without specifying anywhere which three languages are meant. The new cantonal constitution of 2004 recognizes German, Italian, and Romansh as equal national and official languages of the canton. The canton used the Romansh varieties Sursilvan and Vallader up until 1997, when Rumantsch Grischun was added and use of Sursilvan and Vallader was discontinued in 2001.\nThis means that any citizen of the canton may request service and official documents such as ballots in their language of choice, that all three languages may be used in court, and that a member of the cantonal parliament is free to use any of the three languages. Since 1991, all official texts of the cantonal parliament must be translated into Romansh and offices of the cantonal government must include signage in all three languages. In practice, the role of Romansh within the cantonal administration is limited and often symbolic and the working language is mainly German. This is usually justified by cantonal officials on the grounds that all Romansh speakers are perfectly bilingual and able to understand and speak German. Up until the 1980s it was usually seen as a provocation when a deputy in the cantonal parliament used Romansh during a speech.\nCantonal law leaves it to the districts and municipalities to specify their own language of administration and schooling. According to Article 3 of the cantonal constitution, however, the municipalities are to \"take into consideration the traditional linguistic composition and respect the autochthonous linguistic minorities\". This means that the language area of Romansh has never officially been defined, and that any municipality is free to change its official language. In 2003, Romansh was the sole official language in 56 municipalities of the Grisons, and 19 were bilingual in their administrative business. In practice, even those municipalities which only recognize Romansh as an official working language, readily offer services in German as well. Additionally, since the working language of the canton is mainly German and many official publications of the canton are available only in German, it is virtually impossible for a municipal administration to operate only in Romansh.\nRomansh in education.\nWithin the Romansh-speaking areas, three different types of educational models can be found: Romansh schools, bilingual schools, and German schools with Romansh as a subject.\nIn the Romansh schools, Romansh is the primary language of instruction during the first 3\u20136 years of the nine years of compulsory schooling, and German during the last 3\u20139 years. Due to this, this school type is often called the \"so-called Romansh school\". In practice, the amount of Romansh schooling varies between half and 4/5 of the compulsory school term, often depending on how many Romansh-speaking teachers are available. This \"so-called Romansh school\" was found in 82 municipalities of the Grisons as of 2001. The bilingual school was found only in Samedan, Pontresina, and Ilanz/Schnaus. In 15 municipalities, German was the sole medium of instruction as of 2001, with Romansh being taught as a subject.\nOutside of areas where Romansh is traditionally spoken, Romansh is not offered as a subject and as of 2001, 17 municipalities within the historical language area of Romansh do not teach Romansh as a subject. On the secondary level, the language of instruction is mainly German, with Romansh as a subject in Romansh-speaking regions.\nOutside of the traditional Romansh-speaking areas, the capital of the Grisons, Chur, runs a bilingual Romansh-German elementary school.\nOn the tertiary level, the University of Fribourg offers Bachelor- and Master programs for Romansh language and literature. The Romansh department there has been in existence since 1991. The University of Z\u00fcrich also maintains a partial chair for Romansh language and literature together with the ETH Z\u00fcrich since 1985.\nGeographic distribution.\nThough Romansh was spoken as far north as Lake Constance in the early Middle Ages, the language area of Romansh is today limited to parts of the canton of the Grisons; the last areas outside the canton to speak Romansh, the Vinschgau in South Tyrol, became German-speaking in the 17th century. Inside the Grisons, the language borders largely stabilized in the 16th century and remained almost unchanged until the 19th century. This language area is often called the \"Traditional Romansh-speaking territory\", a term introduced by the statistician Jean-Jacques Furer based on the results of the Swiss censusses. Furer defines this language area as those municipalities in which a majority declared Romansh as their mother tongue in any of the first four Swiss censuses between 1860 and 1888. In addition, he includes F\u00fcrstenau. This represented 121 municipalities at the time, corresponding to 116 present-day municipalities. The villages of Samnaun, Sils im Domleschg, Masein, and Urmein, which were still Romansh-speaking in the 17th century, had lost their Romansh majority by 1860, and are not included in this definition. This historical definition of the language area has been taken up in many subsequent publications, but the Swiss Federal Statistical Office for instance defines the language area of Romansh as those municipalities, where a majority declared to habitually use Romansh in the census of 2000.\nThe presence of Romansh within its traditional language area varies from region to region. In 2000, 66 municipalities still had a Romansh majority, an additional 32 had at least 20% who declared Romansh as their language of best command or as a habitually spoken language, while Romansh is either extinct or spoken only by a small minority in the remaining 18 municipalities within the traditional language area. In the Surselva region, it is the habitually spoken language of 78.5% and the language of best command of 66%. In the Sutselva region by contrast, Romansh is extinct or spoken only by a small number of older people, with the exception of Schams, where it is still transmitted to children and where some villages still have a Romansh majority, notably in the vicinity of the Schamserberg. In the Surmiran region, it is the main language in the Surses region, but no longer widely spoken in the Albula Valley.\nIn the Upper Engadine valley, it is a habitually spoken language for 30.8% and the language of best command for 13%. However, most children still acquire Romansh through the school system, which has retained Romansh as the primary language of instruction, even though Swiss German is more widely spoken inside the home. In the Lower Engadine, Romansh speakers form the majority in virtually all municipalities, with 60.4% declaring Romansh as their language of best command in 2000, and 77.4% declaring it as a habitually spoken language.\nOutside of the traditional Romansh language area, Romansh is spoken by the so-called \"Romansh diaspora\", meaning people who have moved out of the Romansh-speaking valleys. A significant number are found in the capital of Grisons, Chur, as well as in Swiss cities outside of Grisons.\nCurrent distribution.\nThe current situation of Romansh is quite well researched. The number of speakers is known through the Swiss censuses, with the most recent having taken place in 2000, in addition to surveys by the Radio e Televisiun Rumantscha. The quantitative data from these surveys was summed up by statistician Jean-Jacques Furer in 2005. In addition, linguist Regula Cathomas performed a detailed survey of everyday language use, published in 2008.\nVirtually all Romansh-speakers today are bilingual in Romansh and German. Whereas monolingual Romansh were still common at the beginning of the twentieth century, they are now found only among pre-school children. As Romansh linguist Ricarda Liver wrote in 1999:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whereas the clich\u00e9 of the bearded, sock-knitting Alpine shepherd who speaks and understands only Romansh, may still have been a reality here and there fifty years ago, there are nowadays no adult Romansh who do not possess a bilingual competence\u2014\u200a\nThe language situation today consists of a complex relationship between several diglossia, since there is a functional distribution within Romansh itself between the local dialect, the regional standard variety, and nowadays the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun as well; and German is also acquired in two varieties: Swiss German and Standard German. Additionally, in Val M\u00fcstair many people also speak Bavarian German as a second language. Aside from German, many Romansh also speak additional languages, such as French, Italian, or English, learned at school or acquired through direct contact.\nThe Swiss census of 1990 and 2000 asked for the \"language of best command\" as well as for the languages habitually used in the family, at work, and in school. Previous censuses had asked only for the \"mother tongue\". In 1990, Romansh was named as the \"language of best command\" by 39,632 people, with a decrease to 35,095 in 2000. As a family language, Romansh is more widespread, with 55,707 having named it in 1990, and 49,134 in 2000. As a language used at work, Romansh was more widely used in 2000 with 20,327 responses than in 1990 with 17,753, as it was as a language used at school, with 6,411 naming it in 2000 as compared to 5,331 in 1990. Overall, a total of 60,561 people reported that they used Romansch of some sort on a habitual basis, representing 0.83% of the Swiss population. As the language of best command, Romansh comes in 11th in Switzerland with 0.74%, with the non-national languages Serbian, Croatian, Albanian, Portuguese, Spanish, English, and Turkish all having more speakers than Romansh.\nIn the entire canton of the Grisons, where about two-thirds of all speakers live, roughly a sixth report it as the language of best command (29,679 in 1990 and 27,038 in 2000). As a family language it was used by 19.5% in 2000 (33,707), as a language used on the job by 17.3% (15,715), and as a school language by 23.3% (5,940). Overall, 21.5% (40,168) of the population of the Grisons reported to be speaking Romansh habitually in 2000. Within the traditional Romansh-speaking areas, where 56.1% (33,991) of all speakers lived in 2000, it is the majority language in 66 municipalities.\nThe status of Romansh differs widely within this traditional area. Whereas in some areas Romansh is used by virtually the entire population, in others the only speakers are people who have moved there from elsewhere. Overall, Romansh dominates in most of the Surselva and the Lower Engadine as well as parts of the Surses, whereas German is the dominant daily language in most other areas, though Romansh is often still used and transmitted in a limited manner regardless.\nIn general, Romansh is the dominant language in most of the Surselva. In the western areas, the Cadi and the Lumnezia, it is the language of a vast majority, with around 80% naming it as their language of best command, and it often being a daily language for virtually the entire population. In the eastern areas of the Gruob around Ilanz, German is significantly more dominant in daily life, though most people still use Romansh regularly. Romansh is still acquired by most children in the Cadi and Gruob even in villages where Romansh speakers are in the minority, since it is usually the language of instruction in primary education there. Even in villages where Romansh dominates, newcomers rarely learn Romansh, as Sursilvan speakers quickly accommodate by switching to German, so that there is often little opportunity to practice Romansh even when people are willing to learn it. Some pressure is often exerted by children, who will sometimes speak Romansh even with their non-Romansh-speaking parents.\nIn the Imboden District by contrast, it is only used habitually by 22%, and is the language of best command for only 9.9%. Even within this district, the presence of Romansh varies, with 41.3% in Trin reporting to speak it habitually. In the Sutselva, the local Romansh dialects are extinct in most villages, with a few elder speakers remaining in places such as Pr\u00e4z, Scharans, Feldis/Veulden, and Scheid, though passive knowledge is slightly more common. Some municipalities still offer Romansh as a foreign language subject in school, though it is often under pressure of being replaced by Italian. The notably exception is Schams, where it is still regularly transmitted to children and where the language of instruction is Romansh. In the Surmeir region, it is still the dominant everyday language in the Surses, but has mostly disappeared from the Albula Valley. The highest proportion of habitual speakers is found in Salouf with 86.3%, the lowest in Obervaz with 18.9%. In these areas, many Romansh speakers only speak German with their spouses as an accommodation or because of a habit, though they sometimes speak Romansh to their children. In most cases, this is not because of a will to preserve the language, but because of other reasons such as Romansh having been their own childhood language or a belief that their children will later find it easier to learn additional languages.\nIn the Upper Engadine, it is used habitually by 30.8% and the language of best command for 13%, with only S-chanf having a Romansh majority. Even though the main every-day and family language is German, Romansh is not in imminent danger of disappearing in the Upper Engadine, due to the strong emotional attachment to the language and in particular the Romansh-language school, which means that a Romansh-speaking core always exists in some form. Romansh is often a sign of being one of the locals, and used to distinguish oneself from tourists or temporary residents, so that outsiders will sometimes acquire Romansh in order to fit in. In the Lower Engadine by contrast, Romansh is the majority language virtually everywhere, with over 80% reporting it as a habitually spoken language in most villages. The status of Romansh is even stronger in the Val M\u00fcstair, where 86.4% report to speak it habitually, and 74.1% as their language of best command. In the Lower Engadine, outsiders are generally expected to learn Romansh if they wish to be integrated into the local community and take part in social life. In addition, there is often pressure from inside the family to learn Romansh.\nOverall, Jean-Jacques Furer concludes that the shrinkage of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh is still very much alive, a fact that is obvious in those areas where it retains a strong presence, such as most parts of the Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding generation will be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become fewer and fewer with each generation. He also concludes that there are still enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.\nPhonology.\nRomansh has up to 26 consonant phonemes. Two are found only in some varieties, and one is found only in loanwords borrowed from German.\nNotes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^1 in only some dialects, notably Surmiran, and only word-final as in \"bread\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^2 often transcribed as the palatal stops and in broad transcriptions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^3 in only some dialects, notably Put\u00e8r, and only word-finally as in , \"friend\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^4 occurs only in German loanwords such as \"crook\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^5 also pronounced in some dialects of Sursilvan.\nThe voiced obstruents are fully voiced in Romansh, in contrast to Swiss German with which Romansh is in extensive contact, and voiceless obstruents are non-aspirated. Voiced obstruents are devoiced word-finally, however, as in \"boy\" &gt; , \"warm\" &gt; , \"blood\" &gt; , or \"key\" &gt; .\nThe vowel inventory varies somewhat between dialects, as the front rounded vowels and are found only in Put\u00e8r and Vallader. They have historically been unrounded in the other varieties and are found only in recent loans from German there. They are not found in the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun either. The now nearly extinct Sutsilvan dialects of the Heinzenberg have as in \"plant\" or \"tree\", but this is etymologically unrelated to the found in Put\u00e8r and Vallader. The exact realization of the phoneme varies from to depending on the dialect: / \"book\". It is regarded as either a marginal phoneme or not a separate phoneme from by some linguists.\nWord stress generally falls either on the last or the penult syllable of a word. Unstressed vowels are generally reduced to a schwa, whose exact pronunciation varies between or as in \"song\". Vowel length is predictable:\nThe number of diphthongs varies significantly between dialects. Sursilvan dialects contain eleven diphthongs and four triphthongs (, , , and ).\nOther dialects have different inventories; Put\u00e8r, for instance, lacks , , and as well as the triphthongs but has , which is missing in Sursilvan. A phenomenon known as \"hardened diphthongs\", in which the second vowel of a falling Diphthong is pronounced as , was once common in Put\u00e8r as well, but is nowadays limited to Surmiran: 'barely &gt; . \nOrthography.\nRomansh is written in the Latin alphabet, and mostly follows a phonemic orthography, with a high correspondence between letters and sounds. The orthography varies slightly depending on the variety.\nThe vowel inventories of the five regional written varieties differ widely (in particular in regards to diphthongs), and the pronunciation often differs depending on the dialect even within them. The orthography of Sutsilvan is particularly complex, allowing for different pronunciations of the vowels depending on the regional dialect, and is not treated in this table.\nMorphology.\nThe following description deals mainly with the Sursilvan dialect, which is the best-studied so far. The dialects Put\u00e8r and Vallader of the Engadine valley in particular diverge considerably from Sursilvan in many points. When possible, such differences are described.\nNouns are not inflected for case in Romansh; the grammatical category is expressed through word order instead. As in most other Romance languages, Romansh nouns belong to two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. A definite article (masc. or before a vowel; fem. ) is distinguished from an indefinite article (masc. , , or , depending on the dialect; fem. , , or ). The plural is usually formed by adding the suffix -s. In Sursilvan, masculine nouns are sometimes irregular, with the stem vowel alternating:\nA particularity of Romansh is the so-called \"collective plural\" to refer to a mass of things as a whole:\nAdjectives are inflected according to gender and number. Feminine forms are always regular, but the stem vowel sometimes alternates in the masculine forms:\nSursilvan also distinguishes an attributive and predicative form of adjectives in the singular. This is not found in some of the other dialects:\nThere are three singular and three plural pronouns in Romansh (Sursilvan forms shown below):\nThere is a T\u2013V distinction between familiar and polite . Put\u00e8r and Vallader distinguish between familiar and and polite / and /. Pronouns for the polite forms in Put\u00e8r and Vallader are always capitalized to distinguish them from third person pronouns: \"I know your sister\" and \"I know his/her sister\".\nThe 1st and 2nd person pronouns for a direct object have two distinct forms, with one occurring following the preposition : \"give me your book\".\nA particularity of Sursilvan is that reflexive verbs are all formed with the reflexive pronoun , which was originally only the third person pronoun:\nThe other Romansh dialects distinguish different reflexive pronouns.\nPossessive pronouns occur in a pronominal and a predicative form that differ only in the masculine form, however:\nThe feminine remains the same: \"her/his house\" \u2013 \"this house is hers/his\".\nThree different demonstrative pronouns , , and are distinguished: \"I trust that one, but not that other one\" or \"and the father, what is he going to say?\".\nVerb tenses are divided into synthetic forms (present, imperfect) and analytic forms (perfect, pluperfect, future, passive) distinguished by the grammatical moods indicative, subjunctive, conditional, and imperative. These are most common forms in Sursilvan:\nSyntax.\nThe syntax of Romansh has not been thoroughly investigated so far. Regular word order is subject\u2013verb\u2013object, but subject-auxiliary inversion occurs in several cases, placing the verb at the beginning of a sentence:\nThese features are in close concord with German syntax, which has likely reinforced them. However, this need not mean that they are due entirely to language contact. In fact, similar tendencies can be observed in Old French.\nA sentence is negated by adding a negative particle. In Sursilvan, this is , placed after the verb, while in other dialects such as Put\u00e8r and Vallader, it is , placed before the verb:\nA feature found only in Put\u00e8r and Vallader (as it is in Castilian Spanish) is the preposition of a direct object, when that direct object is a person or an animal, with , as in \"did you see Peter?\", \"I took the dog out for a walk\", but \"did you see the church?\".\nVocabulary.\nNo systematic synchronic description of Romansh vocabulary has been carried out so far. Existing studies usually approach the subject from a historical perspective, taking particular interest in pre-Roman substratum, archaic words preserved only in Romansh, or in loan words from German. A project to compile together all known historic and modern Romansh vocabulary is the Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun, first published in 1904, with the 13th edition currently in preparation.\nRaetic and Celtic.\nThe influence of the languages (Raetic and Celtic) spoken in Grisons before the arrival of the Romans is most obvious in placenames, which are often pre-Roman. Since very little is known about the Celtic language once spoken in Grisons, and almost nothing about Raetic, words or placenames thought to come from them are usually simply referred to as \"pre-Roman\". Apart from placenames, such words are found in landscape features, plant and animal names unique to the Alps, and tools and methods related to alpine transhumance. Such words include:\nLatin stock.\nLike all languages, Romansh has its own archaisms, that is, words derived from Latin that in most other Romance languages have fallen out of use or taken niche meanings. Examples include \"baselgia\" \"church\" (cf. Vegliote \"ba\u0161alka\", Romanian \"biseric\u0103\"), \"nuidis\" \"grudgingly, reluctantly\" (&lt; Latin \"invitus\"), \"urar\" \"to pray\" (cf. Portuguese \"orar\", Romanian \"a ura\" \u2018to wish\u2019), \"aura\" \"weather\" (cf. Old French \"ore\", Aromanian \"avr\u00ee\"), \"scheiver\" \"carnival\", \"cudesch\" \"book\", the last two of which are only found in Romansh. The non-Engadinese dialects retain \"anceiver\" ~ \"entschaiver\" \"to begin\", from Latin \"incipere\", otherwise found only in Romanian \"\u00eencepe\", whereas Surmiran and Engadinese (Put\u00e8r, Vallader) and all other Romance languages retain a reflex of Latin *\"cuminiti\u0101re\", e.g. Engadinese \"(s)cumanzar\", Italian \"cominciare\", French \"commencer\". Other examples are \"memia\" (adv.) \"too much\" from Latin \"nimia\" (adj., fem.) (otherwise only found in Old Occitan), \"vess\" \"difficult\" from Latin \"vix\" \"seldom\" (cf. Old Spanish \"ab\u00e9s\", Romanian \"abia\" &lt; \"ad vix\"), and Engadinese \"encleger\" \"to understand\" (vs. non-Engadinese \"capir\"), also found in Romanian \"\u00een\u021belege\" and Albanian \"(n)d\u00ebgjoj\", from Latin \"intellegere\". Some unique innovations include \"tedlar\" \"to listen\" from Latin \"titulare\" and \"patertgar\" \"to think\" from \"pertractare\".\nGermanic loanwords.\nAnother distinguishing characteristic of Romansh vocabulary is its numerous Germanic loanwords.\nSome Germanic loan words already entered the language in Late Antiquity or the Early Middle Ages, and they are often found in other Romance languages as well. Words more particular to Romansh include Surs./ Suts. \"tschadun\", Surm. \"sdom\"/\"sdong\", Engad. \"sdun\" \"spoon\", which is also found in Ladin as \"sciadon\" and Friulian as \"sed\u00f2n\" and is thought to go back to Ostrogothic *skeitho, and it was once probably common throughout Northern Italy. Another such early loan is \"bletsch\" \"wet\", which probably goes back to Old Frankish \"blettjan\" \"to squeeze\", from where French \"blesser\" \"to wound\" is also derived. The change in meaning probably occurred by the way of \"bruised fruit\", as is still found in French \"blet\". Early Germanic loans found more commonly in the other Romance languages includes Surs./Vall. \"blau\", Suts. \"blo\"/\"blova\", Surm. \"blo\"/\"blava\", Put. \"blov\" \"blue\", which is derived from Germanic \"blao\" and also found for instance in French as \"bleu\" and Italian as \"blu\".\nOthers were borrowed into Romansh during the Old High German period, such as \"glieud\" \"people\" from OHG \"liut\" or Surs. \"uaul\", Suts. \"g\u00f2ld\", Surm. \"g\u00f4t\", eng. \"god\" 'forest' from OHG \"wald\". Surs. \"baul\", Suts. \"b\u00f2ld\", Engad. \"bod\" 'soon, early, nearly' is likely derived from Middle High German \"bald, balde\" \"keen, fast\" as are Surs. \"nez\", Engad. \"n\u00fcz\" \"use\" from Middle High German \"nu(t)z\", or \"losch\" \"proud\" likely from Middle High German \"l\u00f4s\". Other examples include Surs. \"schuber\" \"clean\" from Swiss German \"suuber\", Surs. \"schumber\" \"drum\" from Swiss German or Middle High German \"sumber\", and Surs. \"schufar\" \"to drink greedily\" from Swiss German \"suufe\".\nSome words were adapted into Romansh through different dialects of German, such as the word for \"farmer\", borrowed as \"paur\" from Bavarian in Vallader and Put\u00e8r, but from Alemannic as \"pur\" in the other dialects.\nIn addition, many German words entered Romansh beginning in the 19th century, when numerous new objects and ideas were introduced. Romansh speakers often simply adopted the German words, such as \"il zug\" \"the train\" or \"il banhof\" \"the train station\". Language purists attempted to coin new Romansh words instead, which were occasionally successful in entering popular usage. Whereas \"il tren\" and \"la staziun\" managed to replace \"il zug\" and \"il banhof\", other German words have become established in Romansh usage, such as \"il schalter\" \"the switch\", \"il hebel\" \"the lever\", \"la schlagbohrmaschina\" \"the hammer drill\", or \"in schluc\" \"a sip\". Especially noticeable are interjections such as \"schon\", \"aber\" or \"halt\", which have become established in everyday language. In a few cases, there was a semantic shift, such as \"uaffen\", \"tool\", derived from \"Waffe\", \"weapon\".\nLanguage contact.\nRomansh speakers have been in close contact with speakers of German dialects such as Alemannic and Bavarian for centuries, as well as speakers of various Italian dialects and Standard German more recently. These languages have influenced Romansh, most strongly the vocabulary, whereas the German and Italian influences on morphology and syntax are much more limited. This means that despite German influence, Romansh has remained a Romance language in its core structure. Romansh linguist Ricarda Liver also notes that an influence of Swiss German on intonation is obvious, in particular in the Sursilvan dialect, even though this has so far not been linguistically studied. The influence of German is generally strongest in the Rhenish varieties Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, and Sursilvan, where French loanwords (frequently not borrowed directly but transmitted through German) are also more numerous. In the dialects of the Engadine, by contrast, the influence of Italian is stronger.\nIn the Engadinese written languages, Put\u00e8r and Vallader, Italian-influenced spellings, learned words, and derivations were previously abundant, for instance in Zaccaria Pallioppi's 1895 dictionary, but came under scrutiny at the start of the 20th century and were gradually eliminated from the written language. Following reforms of the written languages of the Engadine, many of these Italian words fell out of usage (such as \"contadin\" 'farmer' instead of \"paur\", \"nepotin\" 'nephew' rather than \"abiadi\", \"ogni\" 'everyone' instead of \"inmincha\", \"saimper\" 'always' instead of \"ad\u00fcna\", and \"abbastanza\" 'enough' instead of \"avuonda\"), while others persisted as synonyms of more traditional Ladin words (such as \"tribunal\" 'court' alongside \"drett\u00fcra\", \"chapir\" alongside \"incleger\", and \"testimoni\" 'witness' alongside \"perd\u00fctta\").\nAside from the written language, everyday Romansh was also influenced by Italian through the large number of emigrants, especially from the Engadine, to Italy, the so-called Randulin. These emigrants often returned with their Romansh speech influenced by Italian.\nGerman loanwords.\nGerman loanwords entered Romansh as early as the Old High German period in the Early Middle Ages, and German has remained an important source of vocabulary since. Many of these words have been in use in Romansh for long enough that German speakers no longer recognize them as German, and for morphological derivations of them to have appeared, in particular through the suffix \"-egiar ~ iar\", as in Surs. \"baghegiar\", sut. \"biagear\", Surm. \"biagier\", Put. \"biager\", Vall. \"bear\" \"to build\", derived from Middle High German \"b\u00fbwen\". Other examples include \"malegiar\" \"to paint\" (\u2190 \"malen\"), \"schenghegiar\" \"to give (a present)\" (\u2190 \"schenken\"), \"schazegiar\" \"to estimate\" (\u2190 \"sch\u00e4tzen\"), or Surs. \"betlegiar\" (sut. \"batlagear\", Surm./Put. \"batlager\", Vall. \"supetliar\") \"to beg\", derived from Swiss German \"bettle\" with the same meaning. Nouns derived from these verbs include \"maletg\" \"painting\", \"schenghetg\" \"gift\", \"schazetg\" \"estimation\", or \"bagetg\" \"building\". The adjective \"flissi\" \"hard-working\" has given rise to the noun \"flissiadad\" \"industriousness\". The word \"pur\" has given rise to derived words such as \"pura\" \"farmwife, female farmer\" or \"puranchel\" \"small-time farmer\", as has \"buob\" \"boy\" from Swiss German \"bueb\" \"boy\", with the derivations \"buoba\" \"girl\" and \"buobanaglia\" \"crowd of children\".\nItalian, Ladin and Gallo-italic loanwords.\nCommon nouns of Italian origin include \"resposta/risposta\" \"answer\", \"vista/vesta\" \"view\", \"proposta\" \"proposal\", \"surpresa/surpraisa\" \"surprise\", and \"offaisa/offesa\" \"insult\". In Ladin, many such nouns are borrowed or derived from Italian and end in \u2013a, whereas the same group of nouns in Sursilvan frequently ends in \u2013iun and where borrowed either from French or formed through analogy with Latin. Examples include \"pretensiun\" \"opinion, claim\" vs. \"pretaisa\", \"defensiun\" \"defense\" vs. \"defaisa\", or \"confirmaziun\" \"confirmation\" vs. \"conferma\".\nOther Italian words used throughout Romansh include the words for \"nail\", which are derived from Italian \"acuto\" \"sharp\", which has yielded Sur. \"guota\", Sut. \"guta\", Surm. \"gotta\", and Ladin \"guotta/aguotta\", whereas the Romansh word for \"sharp\" itself (Rhenish: \"git\", Ladin \"ag\u00fcz\") is derived from the same Latin source ACUTUM. Words from Lombard and Venetian related to crafts include Ladin \"marangun\" \"carpenter\" (\u2190 Venetian \"marangon\"), as opposed to \"lennari\" in other Romansh dialects, \"chazzoula\" \"trowel\" (\u2190 Lombard \"cazzola\"), or \"filad\u00e8\" \"spinning wheel\" (\u2190 Lombard \"filadel\"). Other words include culinary items such as \"macaruns\" \"macaroni\" (\u2190 \"maccheroni\"); \"tschiculatta/tschugalata\" \"chocolate\" (\u2190 \"cioccolata\" or Lombard \"ciculata/cicolata\"), Ladin and Surmiran \"limun/limung\" \"lemon\" as opposed to Sursilvan \"citrona\" (\u2190 \"limone\"), \"giabus/baguos\" \"cabbage\" (\u2190 Lombard \"gab\u00fcs\"), \"chanella/canella\" \"cinnamon\" (\u2190 \"cannella\"). In Sursilvan, the word \"ogna\" \"flat cake\" can be found, which is derived from Italian \"lasagna\", with the initial \"las-\" having been mistaken for the plural article, and the vowel having been adapted to Sursilvan sound patterns through analogy with words such as \"muntogna\" \"mountain\". Others are words for animals such as \"lodola\" \"lark\" (\u2190 \"lodola\") or \"randulina\" \"swallow\" (\u2190 Lombard \"randulina\"), as well as Ladin \"scarafagi/scarvatg\" \"beetle\" (\u2190 \"scarafaggio\"). Other Italian words include \"impostas\" \"taxes\" (\u2190 \"imposte\"; as opposed to Rhenish \"taglia\"), \"radunanza/radunonza\" \"assembly\" (\u2190 \"radunanza\"), Ladin \"ravarenda\" \"(Protestant) priest\" (\u2190 \"reverendo\"), \"bambin\" \"Christmas child (giftbringer)\" (\u2190 \"Ges\u00f9 Bambino\"), \"marchadant/marcadont\" \"merchant\" (\u2190 \"mercatante\") or \"butia/buteia\" \"shop\" (\u2190 \"bottega\").\nIn Ladin, Italian borrowings also include words groups not usually borrowed readily. Examples include pronouns such as \"qualchosa\" \"something\" (\u2190 \"qualcosa\"), \"listess\" \"the same one\" (\u2190 Lombard or Venetian \"l'istess\"), adverbs such as \"apunta\" \"exactly\" (\u2190 \"appunto\"), \"magara/magari\" \"fairly/quite\" (\u2190 \"magari\"), prepositions like \"d\u00fcrant/duront\" \"during\" (\u2190 \"durante\") and \"malgr\u00e0/malgrad\" \"despite\" (\u2190 \"malgrado\"), and conjunctions such as \"per\u00f2\" \"but\" (\u2190 \"per\u00f2\") and \"fin cha\" 'until' (\u2190 \"finch\u00e9\"). Most of these are confined to Ladin, with some exceptions such as Sursilvan \"magari\", \"duront\", and \"malgrad\".\nGermanic calques.\nAside from outright loanwords, the German influence on Romansh often takes the form of calques, where Romanic vocabulary has taken on the meaning of German words, summed up by Italian dialectologist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli in 1880 as \"\" (\"Roman body and German soul\"). The earliest examples go back to Carolingian times and show the influence of Germanic law. Such words include \"statute\", a derivation of the verb (from Latin * \"to sit\") as an analogy to Middle High German or Surs./sut./Surm. , Put. , Vall. \"marriage\", derived from Latin (accusative singular of \"law\"), with the meaning of Middle High German . A more recent example of a loan translation is the verb \"to betray\", which has taken on the additional meaning of German of \"to give away\" as in \"to give away a secret\", originally covered by the verb .\nParticularly common are combinations of verbs with locative adverbs, such as \"to accompany\" (literally \"to come with\"), \"to come back\", \"to participate\" (literally \"to do with\"), \"to agree on\" (literally \"to do down\"), or \"to fail\" (literally \"to fall through\"). Whereas such verbs also occur sporadically in other Romance languages as in French \"to take along\" or Italian \"to go away\", the large number in Romansh suggests an influence of German, where this pattern is common. However, prepositional verbs are also common in the (Romance) Lombard language spoken in the bordering Swiss and Italian regions. The verbs \"to participate\" or \"to fail\" for example, are direct equivalents of German (from \"with\" and \"to do\") and (from \"through\" and \"to fall\").\nLess integrated into the Romansh verbal system are constructions following the pattern of (\"doing the\") + a German infinitive. Examples include \"to solder\", \"to season\", or \"to miss, to feel the absence of\".\nGerman also often serves as a model for the creation of new words. An example is Surs. \"vacuum cleaner\", a compound of \"to suck\" and \"dust\", following the model of German \u2013 the Italian word, possibly being itself a calque on the German word. The Engadinese dialects on the other hand have adopted from Italian , which, however, does not mean \"vacuum cleaner\". A skyscraper, which is a direct loan translation from English in many Romance languages (as in French , Italian ), is a loan translation of German (literally \"cloud-scraper\") in Sursilvan: (from \"to scratch\" and \"clouds\"). The Engadinese varieties again follow the Italian pattern of (from \"sky\"). A more recent word is \"the cell phone number\", which follows the word order of Swiss German , and is found alongside .\nExamples of idiomatic expressions include Surs. , Engad. , a direct translation of German , literally meaning \"to hand a basket\", but used in the sense of \"turning down a marriage proposal\" or , a loan translation of the German expression , literally meaning \"to be sausage to someone\" but meaning \"not cared about, to be unimportant\".\nMorphosyntax.\nApart from vocabulary, the influence of German is noticeable in grammatical constructions, which are sometimes closer to German than to other Romance languages.\nFor instance, Romansh is the only Romance language in which indirect speech is formed using the subjunctive mood, as in Sursilvan , Put\u00e8r , \"He says that he is sick\", as compared to Italian or French . Ricarda Liver attributes this to the influence of German. Limited to Sursilvan is the insertion of entire phrases between auxiliary verbs and participles as in \"Mariano Tschuor has spoken with Augustin Beeli\" as compared to Engadinese \"Rudolf Gasser has spoken with Gion Peider Mischol\".\nIn contemporary spoken language, adjective forms are often not distinguished from adverbs, as in Sursilvan \"I am going directly\", rather than . This usage is rare in most other Romance languages with a few sporadic exceptions as in French or Italian \"speak aloud\", and the common usage in colloquial Romansh is likely an influence from German.\nEspecially noticeable and often criticized by language purists are particles such as , , , , , or , which have become an integral part of everyday Romansh speech, especially in Sursilvan.\nNegation was originally formed by a double negative in all Romansh dialects. Today, this usage is limited to Surmiran as in \"I do not know\" (it has also been included in panregional Rumantsch Grischun). While the first particle was lost in Sursilvan, where negation is now formed only with as in , the Ladin varieties lost the second particle , apparently under the influence of Italian, as in Put\u00e9r .\nRomansh influences on German.\nThe influence of Romansh on the local vernacular German has not been studied as thoroughly as vice versa. Apart from place names throughout the former speech area of Romansh, only a handful of Romansh words have become part of wider German usage. Such words include \"glacier\" or \"marmot\" (derived from Romansh ), as well as culinary items such as Maluns or Capuns. The Romansh influence is much stronger in the German dialects of Grisons. It is sometimes controversially suspected that the pronunciation or in words such as and , as opposed to in other Swiss German dialects ( and ), is an influence of Romansh.\nIn morphosyntax, the use of the auxiliary verb \"to come\" as opposed to \"will\" in phrases such as (\"put on warm clothes, otherwise you will get sick\") in Grisons-German is sometimes attributed to Romansh, as well as the lack of a distinction between the accusative and dative case in some Grisons-German dialects and the word order in phrases such as (\"I would ask someone who knows\"). In addition, some words, neuter in most dialects of German, are masculine in Grisons-German. Examples include \"the bread\" or \"the money\". Common words of Romansh origin in Grisons-German include \"bridegroom\" and \"bride\", \"cart used for moving dung\", and \"container made of wood\". In areas where Romansh either is still spoken or has disappeared recently, Romansh words are even more common in the local dialects of German.\nAttitudes towards language contact.\nThe influence of German has been seen in different ways by linguists and language activists. The Italian dialectologist Ascoli for instance described Romansh as \"a body that has lost its soul and taken on an entirely foreign one in its place\" in the 1880s. This opinion was shared by many, who saw the influence of German as a threat to and corruption of Romansh, often referring to it as a disease infecting Romansh. This view was prevalent until after World War II, with many contemporary linguists and activists by contrast seeing these loan elements as completely natural and as an integral part of Romansh, which should be seen as an enrichment of the language. This position is currently held among others by the language activists Bernard Cathomas, Iso Camartin, or Alexi Decurtins, who argue for a relaxed attitude towards loan elements, which they point out are often among the most down-to-earth elements of the language, and that the dual nature of Romansh can also be seen as an advantage in being open to cultural elements from both sides. This position is also shared by several contemporary authors in particular from the Surselva, such as Arno Camenisch, who makes heavy use of Germanisms in his works.\nLiterature, music and media.\nRomansh had a rich oral tradition before the appearance of Romansh writing, but apart from songs such as the \"Canzun da Sontga Margriata\", virtually none of it survives. Prior to the 16th century, Romansh writings are known from only a few fragments, although the Swiss Literary Archives do have a number of collections of Romansh literature, spanning from the late 19th to the early 21st century.\nThe oldest known written records of Romansh dating from the period before 1500 are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe first substantial surviving work in Romansh is the \"Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da M\u00fcs\" written in the Put\u00e8r dialect in 1527 by Gian Travers. It is an epic poem describing the First Musso war which Travers himself had taken part in.\nSubsequent works usually have religious themes, including Bible translations, manuals for religious instructions, and biblical plays. In 1560, the first Romansh translation of the New Testament: \"L'g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ\" by Giachem Bifrun, was published. Two years later, in 1562, another writer from the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, published the \"Cudesch da Psalms\", a collection of Romansh church songs in the Vallader dialect. In the Sursilvan dialect, the first surviving works are also religious works such as catechism by Daniel Bonifaci, and in 1611 \"Ilg V\u00ear Sulaz da pievel giuvan\" (\"The true joys of young people\"), a series of religious instructions for Protestant youths was published by Steffan Gabriel. Four years later in 1615, a Catholic catechism \"Curt Mussament\" was published in response, written by Gion Antoni Calvenzano. The first translation of the New Testament into Sursilvan was published in 1648 by the son of Steffan Gabriel, Luci Gabriel. The first complete translation of the Bible, the \"Bibla da Cuera\" was published between 1717 and 1719.\nIn music, choirs have a long tradition in the Romansh-speaking areas. Apart from traditional music and song, Romansh is also used in contemporary pop or hip-hop music, some of which has become known outside the Romansh-speaking regions, for instance, in the Eurovision Song Contest 1989, Switzerland was represented by a Romansh song, \"Viver senza tei\". Since 2004, the hip-hop group Liricas Analas has become known even outside of Grisons through their Romansh songs. Other contemporary groups include the rock-band \"Passiunai\" with its lead singer Pascal Gamboni, or the rock/pop band The Capoonz. Composer Gion Antoni Derungs has written three operas with Romansh librettos: \"Il cerchel magic\" (1986), \"Il semiader\" (1998) and \"Tredeschin\" (2000).\nRomansh is used to varying extents in newspapers, the radio, and television. Radio and television broadcasts in Romansh are produced by the Radiotelevisiun Svizra Rumantscha, which is part of the Swiss public broadcasting company SRG SSR. The radio Radio Rumantsch broadcasts a 24-hour program including informational and music broadcasts. The broadcasters generally speak their own regional dialect on the air, which is considered a key factor in familiarizing Romansh speakers with the dialects outside their home region. News broadcasts are generally in the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun. The two local radio stations Radio Grischa and Radio Engiadina occasionally broadcast in Romansh, but primarily use German. The Televisiun Rumantscha airs regular broadcasts on SF 1, which are subtitled in German. Programs include the informational broadcast , which is broadcast daily from Monday to Friday. The children's show and the informational broadcast are aired on weekends. Additionally, the shows , , and others are broadcast during irregular intervals.\nThe Romansh newspapers used to be heavily fragmented by regions and dialects. The more long-lived newspapers included the \"Gasetta Romontscha\" in the Surselva, the \"F\u00f6gl Ladin\" in the Engadine, \"Casa Paterna/La Punt\" in the Sutselva, and \"La Pagina da Surmeir\" in the Surmeir. Due to financial difficulties, most of these merged into a pan-regional daily newspaper called \"La Quotidiana\" in 1997. This newspaper includes articles in all five dialects and in Rumantsch Grischun. Apart from \"La Quotidiana\", \"La Pagina da Surmeir\" continues to be published to a regional audience, and the \"Engadiner Post\" includes two pages in Romansh. A Romansh news agency, the Agentura da Novitads Rumantscha, has been in existence since 1997.\nSeveral Romansh-language magazines are also published regularly, including the youth magazine \"Punts\" and the yearly publications \"Calender Romontsch\" and \"Chalender Ladin\".\nIn September 2018, \"Amur senza fin\", the first-ever Romansh-language television film, debuted on Swiss national television.\nSample text.\nThe fable \"The Fox and the Crow\" by Aesop with a French version by Jean de La Fontaine; translated into the Dachsprache Rumantsch Grischun and all six dialects of Romansh: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and the similar-looking but noticeably different-sounding dialects Vallader and Jauer, as well as a translation into English.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He shoots, edits, produces, and scores many of his films in Mexico and in his home state of Texas. Rodriguez directed the 1992 action film \"El Mariachi\", which was a commercial success after grossing $2.6 million ($5.5 million in 2023 dollars) against a budget of $7,000 ($14,937 in 2023 dollars). The film spawned two sequels known collectively as the \"Mexico Trilogy\": \"Desperado\" (1995) and \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" (2003).\nRodriguez directed \"From Dusk till Dawn\" in 1996 and developed its (2014\u20132016). He co-directed the 2005 neo-noir crime thriller anthology \"Sin City\" (adapted from the graphic novel of the same name) and the 2014 sequel, \"\".\nHe is also the creator of the \"Spy Kids\" franchise, as well as \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D\" (2005), \"Planet Terror\" (2007), \"Machete\" (2010), \"We Can Be Heroes\" (2020), and also directed \"The Faculty\" (1998) and \"\" (2019).\nRodriguez is a close friend and frequent collaborator of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who founded the production company A Band Apart, of which Rodriguez was a member. In December 2013, Rodriguez launched his own cable television channel, El Rey.\nEarly life.\nRodriguez was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Mexican parents Rebecca (\"n\u00e9e\" Villegas), a nurse, and Cecilio G. Rodr\u00edguez, a salesman. He began his interest in film at age eleven, when his father bought one of the first VCRs, which came with a camera.\nWhile attending St. Anthony High School Seminary in San Antonio, Rodriguez was commissioned to videotape the school's football games. According to his sister, he was fired soon afterward as he had shot footage in a cinematic style, getting shots of parents' reactions and the ball traveling through the air instead of shooting the whole play. In high school, he met Carlos Gallardo; they both shot films on video throughout high school and college.\nRodriguez went to the College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin, where he also developed a love of cartooning. Not having grades high enough to be accepted into the school's film program, he created a daily comic strip entitled \"Los Hooligans.\" Many of the characters were based on his siblings \u2013 in particular, one of his sisters, Maricarmen. The comic ran for three years in the student newspaper \"The Daily Texan\", while Rodriguez continued to make short films.\nRodriguez shot action and horror short films on video and edited on two VCRs. In late 1990, his entry in a local film contest earned him a spot in the university's film program. There he made the award-winning 16\u00a0mm short \"Bedhead\" (1991). The film chronicles the amusing misadventures of a young girl whose older brother sports an incredibly tangled mess of hair which she detests. Even at this early stage, Rodriguez's trademark style began to emerge: quick cuts, intense zooms, and fast camera movements deployed with a sense of humor.\n\"Bedhead\" was recognized for excellence in the Black Maria Film Festival. It was selected by Film/Video Curator Sally Berger for the Black Maria 20th-anniversary retrospective at MoMA in 2006.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nThe short film \"Bedhead\" attracted enough attention to encourage him to seriously attempt a career as a filmmaker. He went on to shoot the action flick \"El Mariachi\" (1992) in Spanish; he shot it for around $7,000 with money raised by his friend Adrian Kano and from payments for his own participation in medical testing studies. During the process of these medical studies, he met Peter Marquardt, who went on to act in \"El Mariachi\". Rodriguez won the Audience Award for this film at the Sundance Film Festival in 1993. Intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, the film was \"cleaned up\" by Columbia Pictures with post-production work costing several hundred thousand dollars before it was distributed in the United States. Its promotion still advertised it as \"the movie made for $7,000\". Rodriguez described his experiences making the film in his book \"Rebel Without a Crew\" (1995).\nMainstream success.\n\"Desperado\" was a sequel to \"El Mariachi\" that starred Antonio Banderas and introduced Salma Hayek to international audiences as her English-language breakthrough role. Rodriguez went on to collaborate with Quentin Tarantino on the vampire thriller \"From Dusk till Dawn\" (also both co-producing its two sequels), and he wrote, directed, and produced the for his own cable network, El Rey. Rodriguez has also worked with Kevin Williamson, on the sci-fi thriller film \"The Faculty\".\nRodriguez, formerly a member of Writers Guild of America West, left and maintained financial core status in 2001.\nThat year, Rodriguez enjoyed his first Hollywood hit with \"Spy Kids\", which went on to become a movie franchise. A third \"mariachi\" film also appeared in late 2003, \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\", which completed the Mexico Trilogy (also called the Mariachi Trilogy). He operates a production company called Troublemaker Studios, formerly Los Hooligans Productions.\nRodriguez co-directed \"Sin City\" (2005), an adaptation of the comic books by Frank Miller; Quentin Tarantino guest-directed a scene. During production in 2004, Rodriguez insisted Miller be credited as co-director, because he considered the visual style of Miller's comic art to be just as important as his own in the film. However, the Directors Guild of America would not allow it, citing that only \"legitimate teams\", \"e.g.\", the Wachowskis, could share the director's credit. Rodriguez chose to resign from the DGA, stating, \"It was easier for me to quietly resign before shooting because otherwise I'd be forced to make compromises I was unwilling to make or set a precedent that might hurt the guild later on.\" By resigning from the DGA, Rodriguez was forced to relinquish his director's seat on the film \"John Carter of Mars\" for Paramount Pictures. Rodriguez had already signed on and had been announced as director of that film, planning to begin filming soon after completing \"Sin City\".\n\"Sin City\" was a critical hit in 2005 as well as a box office success, particularly for a hyperviolent comic book adaptation that did not have name recognition comparable to the \"X-Men\" or \"Spider-Man\". He has an interest in adapting all of Miller's \"Sin City\" comic books.\nRodriguez released \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" in 2005, a superhero-kid movie intended for the same younger audiences as his \"Spy Kids\" series. \"Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" was based on a story conceived by Rodriguez's 7-year-old son, Racer, who was given credit for the screenplay. The film grossed over $69\u00a0million worldwide at the box office.\nRodriguez wrote and directed the film \"Planet Terror\" as part of the double-bill release \"Grindhouse\" (2007). Quentin Tarantino directed \"Grindhouse\"'s other film.\nHe has a series of \"Ten Minute Film School\" segments on several of his DVD releases, showing aspiring filmmakers how to make good, profitable movies using inexpensive tactics. Starting with the \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" DVD, Rodriguez began creating a series called \"Ten Minute Cooking School\" in which he revealed his recipe for \"Puerco Pibil\" (based on Cochinita pibil, an old dish from Yucat\u00e1n), the same food Johnny Depp's character, Agent Sands, ate in the film. The popularity of this series led to the inclusion of another \"Cooking School\" on the two-disc version of the \"Sin City\" DVD where Rodriguez teaches the viewer how to make \"Sin City Breakfast Tacos\", a dish (made for his cast and crew during late-night shoots and editing sessions) utilizing his grandmother's tortilla recipe and different egg mixes for the filling. He had initially planned to release a third \"Cooking School\" with the DVD release of \"Planet Terror\" but then announced on the \"Film School\" segment of the DVD that he would put it on the \"Grindhouse\" DVD set instead. The Cooking School, titled \"Texas Barbecue...from the GRAVE!\", is a dish based on the \"secret barbecue recipe\" of JT Hague, Jeff Fahey's character in the film.\nRodriguez is a strong supporter of digital filmmaking, having been introduced to the practice by director George Lucas, who personally invited Rodriguez to use the digital cameras at Lucas's headquarters. He was presented with the Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking Award at the 2010 Austin Film Festival.\n\"Predators\".\nIn 2010, Rodriguez produced a new \"Predator\" sequel, entitled \"Predators\". This film's script was based on early drafts he had written after seeing the original. Rodriguez's ideas included a planet-sized game preserve and various creatures used by the Predators to hunt a group of abducted yet skilled humans. Opening to mostly positive reviews, the film fared reasonably well at the box office.\n\"Machete\".\n\"Machete\" is a feature film directed by Rodriguez and released in September 2010. It is an expansion of a fake trailer Rodriguez directed for the 2007 film \"Grindhouse\". It starred Danny Trejo as the title character. Trejo, Rodriguez's 2nd cousin, has worked with him in some of his other movies such as \"Desperado\", \"From Dusk till Dawn\", \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" and \"Spy Kids\", where Trejo first appeared as Machete. Although originally announced to be released direct-to-DVD as an extra on the \"Planet Terror\" DVD, the film was produced as a theatrical release.\nAccording to Rodriguez, the origins of the film go back to \"Desperado\". He says, \"When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.' So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature.\" In an interview with \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in \"Desperado\". \"So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, \"That's \"Machete\". He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.\" But I never got around to making it.\"\nRodriguez hoped to film \"Machete\" at the same time as \"\". Additionally, during Comic-Con International 2008, he took the time to speak about Machete, including such topics as: status, possible sequels after the release of Machete, and production priorities. It was also revealed that he has regularly pulled sequences from it for his other productions, including \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico. [\"Citation Needed] \"Machete\" was released in theaters September 3, 2010, in the U.S.\nOn May 5, 2010, Rodriguez responded to Arizona's controversial immigration law by releasing an \"illegal\" trailer on Ain't It Cool News. The fake trailer combined elements of the \"Machete\" trailer that appeared in \"Grindhouse\" with footage from the actual film, and implied that the film would be about Machete leading a revolt against anti-immigration politicians and border vigilantes. Several movie websites, including Internet Movie Database, reported that it was the official teaser for the film. However, Rodriguez later revealed the trailer to be a joke, explaining \"it was Cinco de Mayo and I had too much tequila.\"\nStreaming projects.\nIn May 2020, Rodriguez announced, via an Instagram post in which he posed with a puppet of Grogu, that he would direct an episode from the second season of the Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\", part of the \"Star Wars\" franchise. He also tweeted a video of himself on the set of the episode playing a guitar next to Grogu. Rodriguez was also an executive producer on \"The Book of Boba Fett\", a spin-off of \"The Mandalorian\" released in December 2021, where he also voiced Dokk Strassi and Mok Shaiz.\nIn 2020, Rodriguez wrote and directed \"We Can Be Heroes\", a \"Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" spinoff, which was released on December 25, 2020, on Netflix to mixed reviews.\nIn August 2021, Rodriguez had signed a two-year first-look deal with HBO and HBO Max.\nIn 2023, he released \"Spy Kids: Armageddon\" on Netflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\nUnrealized Projects.\nSince 1998, Rodriguez has owned the film rights to Mike Allred's off-beat comic \"Madman\". The two have hinted at the project being close to beginning on several occasions without anything coming of it. However, other projects have been completed first. (Allred was instrumental in connecting Rodriguez with Frank Miller, leading to the production of \"Sin City\".) In 2004, Allred, while promoting his comic book \"The Golden Plates\", announced that a screenplay by George Huang was near completion. Allred announced at the 2006 WonderCon that production would likely commence on \"Madman the Movie\" in 2006. Huang is friends with Rodriguez, who advised him to pursue filmmaking as a career when Rodriguez landed a deal with Columbia Pictures where Huang was an employee.\nIn May 2007, it was announced that Rodriguez had signed on to direct a remake of \"Barbarella\" for a 2008 release. At the 2007 Comic-Con convention, actress Rosario Dawson announced that because of \"Barbarella\", production of \"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For\" would be put on hold. She also announced that she would be playing an amazon in the Barbarella film. As of June 2008, plans to remake the film Barbarella with Rose McGowan as the lead have been delayed; the actress and director were instead remaking the film \"Red Sonja\".\nIn May 2008, Rodriguez was said to be shopping around a prison drama television series called \"Woman in Chains!\", with Rose McGowan being a possibility for a lead role. In May 2009, Rodriguez planned to produce a live-action remake of \"Fire and Ice\", a 1983 film collaboration between painter Frank Frazetta and animator Ralph Bakshi. The deal was closed shortly after Frazetta's death.\nIn 2011, Rodriguez announced at Comic-Con that he had purchased the film rights to \"Heavy Metal\" and planned to develop a new animated film at the new Quick Draw Studios.\nIn November 2015, it was announced that Rodriguez directed the film \"100 Years\", which would not be released until 2115.\nIn March 2017, it was announced that Rodriguez would direct a remake of the dystopian sci-fi action film \"Escape from New York\", with original director John Carpenter producing.\nBrass Knuckle Films.\nIn March 2025, Rodriguez announced a new company called Brass Knuckle Films at SXSW in Austin, Texas.\nThe studio is set to make 4 films, with Rodriguez directing at least 1 and serving as producer on the rest of the slate. Brass Knuckle Films is a unique approach to a studio as it invites the fans to be the investors. Investors also pitch their film ideas to Rodriguez for one of the films in the slate of films planned.\nAppearances.\nRodriguez has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss's 2016 book \"Tools of Titans\".\nPersonal life.\nRodriguez announced in April 2006 that he and his Venezuelan and American wife Elizabeth Avell\u00e1n, with whom he had five children, had separated after 16 years of marriage.\nHe reportedly had a \"dalliance\" with actress Rose McGowan during the shooting of \"Grindhouse\". In October 2007, \"Elle Magazine\" revealed that Rodriguez had cast McGowan in the title role in his remake of \"Barbarella\". They split up in October 2009.\nIn October 2010, he walked Alexa Vega (Carmen Cortez in \"Spy Kids\" series) down the aisle at her wedding to producer Sean Covel.\nIn March 2014, Rodriguez showed his collection of Frank Frazetta original paintings in Austin, Texas, during the SXSW festival.\nStyle.\nRodriguez not only has the credits of producing, directing and writing his films, he also frequently serves as editor, director of photography, camera operator, steadicam operator, composer, production designer, visual effects supervisor, and sound editor on his films. This has earned him the nickname of \"the one-man film crew\". He abbreviates his numerous roles in his film credits; \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\", for instance, is \"shot, chopped, and scored by Robert Rodriguez\", and \"Sin City\" is \"shot and cut by Robert Rodriguez\".\nHe calls his style of making movies \"Mariachi-style\" (in reference to his first feature film \"El Mariachi\") in which (according to the back cover of his book \"Rebel Without a Crew\") \"Creativity, not money, is used to solve problems.\" He prefers to work at night, spending his day-time hours with his kids, when they're home, and says that he believes many creative people are \"night people\".\nIn his 2006 book \"The DV Rebel's Guide\", Stu Maschwitz coined the term \"Robert Rodriguez list\", i.e. the filmmaker compiling a list of things they have access to like cool cars, apartments, horses, samurai swords and so on, and then writing the screenplay based on that list.\nRodriguez wrote a blurb for the book that stated:\nI'd been wanting to write a book for the new breed of digital filmmakers, but now I don't have to. My pal and fellow movie maker Stu Maschwitz has compressed years of experience into this thorough guide. Don't make a movie without reading this book!\nFilmography.\nDirected features.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInfluences.\nRobert Rodriguez has brought a number of his favorite and most influential directors on his television show, \"The Director's Chair\". Some of these directors included John Carpenter, Quentin Tarantino, and George Miller. \nRodriguez's favorite movie as a child was \"Escape to Witch Mountain\", and admits that film, alongside \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\", \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", various \"James Bond\" films and various Ray Harryhaussen films influenced and inspired him while he was working on the \"Spy Kids\" series.\nHe also said on IGN that children will support anything that is empowering to them, citing \"Home Alone\" and \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", saying \"You can't understand, 'Why do you like Power Rangers?' Well, it's empowerment, and children \u2013 especially younger children \u2013 they need their mom just to go to the mall, you know? They can't drive themselves wherever they want. So when they see kids being very empowered, flying around in jet packs, being proactive, it's empowering to them\".\nCollaborations.\nRodriguez has cast certain actors in more than one of his projects. Danny Trejo has appeared in ten of his projects, while Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Cheech Marin have all appeared in seven; Alexa PenaVega has appeared in six, and Jessica Alba, Daryl Sabara, Tom Savini, and Patricia Vonne have all appeared in five.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25531", "revid": "50849423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25531", "title": "Romantic comedy", "text": "Film genre\nRomantic comedy (commonly shortened to romcom or rom-com) is a sub-genre of comedy and romance fiction, focusing on lighthearted, humorous plot lines centered on romantic ideas, such as how love is able to surmount all obstacles. Romantic comedy evolved from Ancient Greek comedy, medieval romance, and 18th-century Restoration comedy, later developing into sub-genres like screwball comedies, career woman comedies, and 1950s sex comedies in Hollywood. \nA common convention in romantic comedies is the \"meet-cute\", a humorous or unexpected encounter that creates initial tension and sets up the romantic storyline.\nHistory.\nComedies, rooted in the fertility rites and satyr plays of ancient Greece, have often incorporated sexual or social elements.\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms\" defines romantic comedy as \"a general term for comedies that deal mainly with the follies and misunderstandings of young lovers, in a light\u2010hearted and happily concluded manner which usually avoids serious satire\". This reference states that the \"best\u2010known examples are Shakespeare's comedies of the late 1590s, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"Twelfth Night\", and \"As You Like It\" being the most purely romantic, while \"Much Ado About Nothing\" approaches the comedy of manners and \"The Merchant of Venice\" is closer to tragicomedy.\"\nIt was not until the development of the literary tradition of romantic love in the Western European medieval period, though, that \"romance\" came to refer to \"romantic love\" situations. They were previously referred to as the heroic adventures of medieval chivalric romance. Those adventures traditionally focused on a knight's feats on behalf of a lady, so the modern themes of love were quickly woven into them, as in Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes's \"Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart\".\nThe contemporary romantic comedy genre was shaped by 18th-century Restoration comedy and 19th-century romantic melodrama. Restoration comedies were typically comedies of manners that relied on knowledge of the complex social rules of high society, particularly related to navigating the marriage-market, an inherent feature of the plot in many of these plays, such as William Wycherley's \"The Country Wife\". While the melodramas of the Romantic period had little to do with comedy, they were hybrids incorporating elements of domestic and sentimental tragedies, pantomime \"with an emphasis on gesture, on the body, and the thrill of the chase,\" and other genres of expression such as songs and folk tales.\nIn the 20th century, as Hollywood grew, the romantic comedy in America mirrored other aspects of society in its rapid changes, developing many sub-genres through the decades. We can see this through the screwball comedy in response to the censorship of the Hays Code in the 1920s\u20131930s, the career woman comedy \n(such as George Stevens' \"Woman of the Year\", starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy) post-WWII, and the sex comedy made popular by Rock Hudson and Doris Day in the 1950s\u20131960s.\nEvolution.\nOver the years, romantic comedies have slowly been becoming more popular with both men and women. They have begun to spread out of their conventional and traditional structure into other territory and to explore more complex topics. These films still follow the typical plot of \"a light and humorous movie, play, etc., whose central plot is a happy love story\" but with more complexity. \nSome romantic comedies have adopted special circumstances for the main characters, as in \"Warm Bodies\" where the protagonist is a zombie who falls in love with a human girl after eating her boyfriend. The effect of their love towards each other is that it starts spreading to the other zombies and even starts to cure them. With the zombie cure, the two main characters can now be together since they do not have a barrier between them anymore. Another strange set of circumstances is in \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\" where the two protagonists are building a relationship while trying to make a pornographic film together. Both these films take the typical story arc and then add strange circumstances to add originality.\nOther romantic comedies flip the standard conventions of the romantic comedy genre. In films like \"500 Days of Summer\" the two main interests do not end up together, leaving the protagonist somewhat distraught. Other films, like \"Adam,\" have the two main interests to end up separated but still content and pursue other goals and love interests.\nSome romantic comedies use reversal of gender roles to add comedic effect, popular in screwball comedies. These films contain characters who possess qualities that diverge from the gender role that society has imposed upon them, as seen in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" in which the male protagonist is especially in touch with his emotions. It can also be seen in \"Made of Honor,\" in which the female bridesmaids are shown in a negative and somewhat masculine light to advance the likability of the male lead.\nOther remakes of romantic comedies involve similar elements, but they explore more adult themes such as marriage, responsibility, or even disability. Two films by Judd Apatow, \"This Is 40\" and \"Knocked Up\", deal with these issues. \"This Is 40\" chronicles the mid-life crisis of a couple entering their 40s and \"Knocked Up\" addresses unintended pregnancy and the ensuing assuming of responsibility. \"Silver Linings Playbook\" deals with mental illness and the courage to start a new relationship.\nAll of these go against the stereotype of what romantic comedy has become as a genre. Yet, the genre of romantic comedy is simply a structure, and all of these elements do not negate the fact that these films are still romantic comedies.\nContrived romantic encounters: the \"meet cute\".\nOne of the conventions of romantic comedy films is the entertainment factor in a contrived encounter of two potential romantic partners in unusual or comic circumstances, which film critics such as Roger Ebert or the Associated Press's Christy Lemire have called a \"meet-cute\" situation. During a \"meet-cute\", scriptwriters often create a sense of awkwardness between the two potential partners by depicting an initial clash of personalities or beliefs, an embarrassing situation, or by introducing a comical misunderstanding or mistaken identity situation. Sometimes, the term is used without a hyphen (a \"meet cute\"), or as a verb (\"to meet cute\").\nRoger Ebert describes the concept of a Meet Cute as \"when boy meets girl in a cute way\". As an example, he cites \"The Meet Cute in \"Lost and Found\" [which] has Jackson and Segal running their cars into each other in Switzerland. Once recovered, they Meet Cute again when they run into each other while on skis. Eventually, they fall in love.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25532", "revid": "50468286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25532", "title": "Renaissance", "text": "European cultural period of the 14th to 17th centuries\nThe Renaissance ( , ) is a period of history and a European cultural movement covering the 15th and 16th centuries. It marked the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity and was characterized by an effort to revive and surpass the ideas and achievements of classical antiquity. Associated with great social change in most fields and disciplines, including art, architecture, politics, literature, exploration and science, the Renaissance was first centered in the Republic of Florence, then spread to the rest of Italy and later throughout Europe. The term \"rinascita\" (\"rebirth\") first appeared in \"Lives of the Artists\" (c.\u20091550) by Giorgio Vasari, while the corresponding French word was adopted into English as the term for this period during the 1830s.\nThe Renaissance's intellectual basis was founded in its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that \"man is the measure of all things\". Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto.\nAs a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of literary Latin and an explosion of vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. It saw myriad artistic developments and contributions from such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term \"Renaissance man\". In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. The period also saw revolutions in other intellectual and social scientific pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field of accounting.\nPeriod.\nThe Renaissance period started during the crisis of the Late Middle Ages and conventionally ends with the waning of humanism, and the advents of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, and in art, the Baroque period. It had a different period and characteristics in different regions, such as the Italian Renaissance, the Northern Renaissance, the Spanish Renaissance, etc.\nIn addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a \"long Renaissance\" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.\nThe traditional view focuses more on the Renaissance's early modern aspects and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages.\nItalian Renaissance.\nThe beginnings of the period\u2014the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian Proto-Renaissance from around 1250 or 1300\u2014overlap considerably with the Late Middle Ages, conventionally dated to c.\u20091350\u20131500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either.\nThe Renaissance began in Florence, one of the many states of Italy. The Italian Renaissance concluded in 1527 when Holy Roman Emperor Charles V launched an assault on Rome during the war of the League of Cognac. Nevertheless, its impact endured in the art of renowned Italian painters like Tintoretto, Sofonisba Anguissola, and Paolo Veronese, who continued their work during the mid-to-late 16th century. \nVarious theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors, including Florence's social and civic peculiarities at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici, and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire. Other major centers were Venice, Genoa, Milan, Rome during the Renaissance Papacy, and Naples. From Italy, the Renaissance spread throughout Europe and also to American, African and Asian territories ruled by the European colonial powers of the time or where Christian missionaries were active.\nThe Renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and in line with general skepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the \"Renaissance\" and individual cultural heroes as \"Renaissance men\", questioning the usefulness of \"Renaissance\" as a term and as a historical delineation.\nSome observers have questioned whether the Renaissance was a cultural \"advance\" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians, especially of the \"longue dur\u00e9e\", have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras, which are linked, as Panofsky observed, \"by a thousand ties\".\nThe word has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the Carolingian Renaissance (8th and 9th centuries), Ottonian Renaissance (10th and 11th century), and the Renaissance of the 12th century.\nOverview.\nThe Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in art, architecture, philosophy, literature, music, science, technology, politics, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.\nRenaissance humanists such as Poggio Bracciolini sought out in Europe's monastic libraries the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of antiquity, while the fall of Constantinople (1453) generated a wave of \u00e9migr\u00e9 Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It was in their new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the Renaissance of the 12th century, who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural sciences, philosophy, and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.\nIn the revival of neoplatonism, Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity; on the contrary, many of the Renaissance's greatest works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. But a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life. In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars for the first time since late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus, helped pave the way for the Reformation.\nWell after the first artistic return to classicism had been exemplified in the sculpture of Nicola Pisano, Florentine painters led by Masaccio strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render perspective and light more naturally. Political philosophers, most famously Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote \"De hominis dignitate\" (\"Oration on the Dignity of Man\", 1486), a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith, and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of the printing press, this allowed many more people access to books, especially the Bible.\nIn all, the Renaissance can be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity and through novel approaches to thought. Political philosopher Hans Kohn describes it as an age where \"Men looked for new foundations\"; some like Erasmus and Thomas More envisioned new reformed spiritual foundations, others, in the words of Machiavelli, \"una lunga sperienza delle cose moderne ed una continua lezione delle antiche\" (a long experience with modern life and a continuous learning from antiquity).\nSociologist Rodney Stark plays down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolute monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city-republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented Commercial Revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.\nHistorian Leon Poliakov offers a critical view in his seminal study of European racist thought: \"The Aryan Myth\". According to Poliakov, the use of ethnic origin myths are first used by Renaissance humanists \"in the service of a new born chauvinism\".\nOrigins.\nMany argue that the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in Florence at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, in particular with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265\u20131321) and Petrarch (1304\u20131374), as well as the paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267\u20131337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance.\nYet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins. Peter Rietbergen posits that various influential Proto-Renaissance movements started from roughly 1300 onwards across many regions of Europe.\nLatin and Greek phases of Renaissance humanism.\nIn stark contrast to the High Middle Ages, when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331\u20131406), Niccol\u00f2 de' Niccoli (1364\u20131437), and Poggio Bracciolini (1380\u20131459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy, and Seneca. By the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.\nUnlike with Latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Western Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, mathematics, and philosophy had been studied since the High Middle Ages in Western Europe and in the Islamic Golden Age (normally in translation), but Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the Greek dramatists, Demosthenes and Thucydides) were not studied in either the Latin or medieval Islamic worlds; in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. Some argue that the Timurid Renaissance in Samarkand and Herat, whose magnificence toned with Florence as the center of a cultural rebirth, were linked to the Ottoman Empire, whose conquests led to the migration of Greek scholars to Italian cities. One of the greatest achievements of Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since late antiquity.\nMuslim logicians, most notably Avicenna and Averroes, had inherited Greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered Egypt and the Levant. Their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the Arab West into Iberia and Sicily, which became important centers for this transmission of ideas. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from Classical Arabic to Medieval Latin were established in Iberia, most notably the Toledo School of Translators. This work of translation from Islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history.\nThe movement to reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary, historical, oratorical, and theological texts back into the Western European curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from Coluccio Salutati to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar Manuel Chrysoloras (c. 1355\u20131415) to teach Greek in Florence. This legacy was continued by a number of expatriate Greek scholars, from Basilios Bessarion to Leo Allatius.\nSocial and political structures in Italy.\nThe unique political structures of Italy during the Late Middle Ages have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city-states and territories: the Neapolitans controlled the south, the Florentines and the Romans at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the north east. 15th-century Italy was one of the most urbanized areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.\nHistorian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner points out that Otto of Freising (c. 1114\u20131158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle \"The Allegory of Good and Bad Government\" by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (painted 1338\u20131340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406\u20131475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but \"the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time\".\nEven cities and states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their merchant republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.\nBlack Death.\nOne theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.\nThe plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1348. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.\nThe demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30\u201340% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.\nThe spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and congenital syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.\nThe Black Death caused greater upheaval to Florence's social and political structure than later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period. Formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.\nCultural conditions in Florence.\nIt has long been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not elsewhere in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Some historians have postulated that Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance as a result of luck, i.e., because \"Great Men\" were born there by chance: Leonardo, Botticelli and Michelangelo were all born in Tuscany. Arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these \"Great Men\" were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.\nLorenzo de' Medici (1449\u20131492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the Convent of San Donato in Scopeto in Florence.\nThe Renaissance was certainly underway before Lorenzo de' Medici came to power \u2013 indeed, before the Medici family itself achieved hegemony in Florentine society.\nCharacteristics.\nHumanism.\nIn some ways, Renaissance humanism was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, Renaissance humanists would study ancient texts in their original languages and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence. Humanist education was based on the programme of \"Studia Humanitatis\", the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy, and rhetoric. Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on \"a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome\". Above all, humanists asserted \"the genius of man\u00a0... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind\".\nHumanist scholars shaped the intellectual landscape throughout the early modern period. Political philosophers such as Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and Thomas More revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government, following the Islamic steps of Ibn Khaldun. Pico della Mirandola wrote the \"manifesto\" of the Renaissance, the \"Oration on the Dignity of Man\", a vibrant defence of thinking. Matteo Palmieri (1406\u20131475), another humanist, is most known for his work \"Della vita civile\" (\"On Civic Life\"; printed 1528), which advocated civic humanism, and for his influence in refining the Tuscan vernacular to the same level as Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially Cicero, who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also Quintilian. Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work \"La citt\u00e0 di vita\", but an earlier work, \"Della vita civile\", is more wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.\nThe humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the \"uomo universale\", an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.\nHumanism and libraries.\nA unique characteristic of some Renaissance libraries is that they were open to the public. These libraries were places where ideas were exchanged and where scholarship and reading were considered both pleasurable and beneficial to the mind and soul. As freethinking was a hallmark of the age, many libraries contained a wide range of writers. Classical texts could be found alongside humanist writings. These informal associations of intellectuals profoundly influenced Renaissance culture. An essential tool of Renaissance librarianship was the catalog that listed, described, and classified a library's books. Some of the richest \"bibliophiles\" built libraries as temples to books and knowledge. A number of libraries appeared as manifestations of immense wealth joined with a love of books. In some cases, cultivated library builders were also committed to offering others the opportunity to use their collections. Prominent aristocrats and princes of the Church created great libraries for the use of their courts, called \"court libraries\", and were housed in lavishly designed monumental buildings decorated with ornate woodwork, and the walls adorned with frescoes (Murray, Stuart A.P.).\nArt.\nRenaissance art marks a cultural rebirth at the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267\u20131337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377\u20131446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404\u20131472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.\nThe development of perspective was part of a wider trend toward realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.\nIn the Low Countries, a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van Eyck was particularly influential on the development of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation. Later, the work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.\nIn architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building the dome of Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.\nDuring the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an integrated system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan and Composite. These can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421\u20131440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.\nRenaissance artists were not pagans, although they admired antiquity and kept some ideas and symbols of the medieval past. Nicola Pisano (c. 1220 \u2013 c. 1278) imitated classical forms by portraying scenes from the Bible. His \"Annunciation\", from the Pisa Baptistry, demonstrates that classical models influenced Italian art before the Renaissance took root as a literary movement.\nNavigation and geography.\nDuring the Renaissance, extending from 1450 to 1650, every continent was visited and mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known as Antarctica. This development is depicted in the large world map \"Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula\" made by the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1648 to commemorate the Peace of Westphalia.\nIn 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain seeking a direct route to India of the Delhi Sultanate. He accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, but believed he had reached the East Indies. The science historian David Wootton argues that the discovery of continents that were completely unknown to the ancients had a profound impact on European intellectual life in the 16th century and was (along with the printing press) one of the two key catalysts for the Scientific Revolution. \nBetween 1519 and 1522, the Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition achieved the first circumnavigation of Earth in history, including the first crossing of the Pacific by a European expedition, revealing the vast scale of that ocean.\nBetween 1577 and 1580, Drake's Raiding Expedition achieved the second circumnavigation of Earth (carried out in a single expedition). Drake was also the first to complete a circumnavigation as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire voyage.\nIn 1606, the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon sailed from the East Indies in the Dutch East India Company ship Duyfken and landed in Australia. He charted about 300\u00a0km of the west coast of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. More than thirty Dutch expeditions followed, mapping sections of the north, west, and south coasts. In 1642\u20131643, Abel Tasman circumnavigated the continent, proving that it was not joined to the imagined south polar continent.\nBy 1650, Dutch cartographers had mapped most of the coastline of the continent, which they named New Holland, except the east coast which was charted in 1770 by James Cook.\nThe long-imagined south polar continent was eventually sighted in 1820. Throughout the Renaissance it had been known as Terra Australis, or 'Australia' for short. However, after that name was transferred to New Holland in the nineteenth century, the new name of 'Antarctica' was bestowed on the south polar continent.\nScience.\nThe rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of the printing press in about 1440 democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In the first period of the Italian Renaissance, humanists favored the study of humanities over natural philosophy or applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views of the universe. Writing around 1450, Nicholas of Cusa claimed that the universe must be infinite in extent and therefore devoid of a center.\nScience and art were intermingled in the early Renaissance, with polymath artists such as Leonardo da Vinci making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. Leonardo set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led Fritjof Capra to classify him as the \"father of modern science\". Other examples of Da Vinci's contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths, and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy, and mechanics.\nA suitable environment had developed to question classical scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) were found to not always match everyday observations. As the Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).\nCopernicus, in \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (\"On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres\"), posited that the Earth moved around the Sun. \"De humani corporis fabrica\" (\"On the Workings of the Human Body\") by Andreas Vesalius, gave a new confidence to the role of dissection, observation, and the mechanistic view of anatomy.\nApplied innovation extended to commerce. At the end of the 15th century, Luca Pacioli published the first work on bookkeeping, making him the founder of accounting.\nMusic.\nFrom this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Orlande de Lassus, Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria, and William Byrd.\nReligion.\nThe new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, especially in the Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Roman Catholic Church. However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Huldrych Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.\nThe Renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. The Late Middle Ages was a period of political intrigue surrounding the Papacy, culminating in the Western Schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true Bishop of Rome. While the schism was resolved by the Council of Constance (1414), a resulting reform movement known as Conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of Pope Alexander VI, who was accused variously of simony, nepotism, and fathering children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.\nChurchmen such as Erasmus and Luther proposed reform to the Church, often based on humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517, Luther published the \"Ninety-five Theses\", challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.\nPope Paul III came to the papal throne (1534\u20131549) after the sack of Rome in 1527, with uncertainties prevalent in the Catholic Church following the Reformation. Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) to Paul III, who became the grandfather of Alessandro Farnese, who had paintings by Titian, Michelangelo, and Raphael, as well as an important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the masterpiece of Giulio Clovio, arguably the last major illuminated manuscript, the \"Farnese Hours\".\nSelf-awareness.\nBy the 15th century, writers, artists, and architects in Italy were well aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as \"modi antichi\" (in the antique manner) or \"alle romana et alla antica\" (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to describe their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as \"antiqua\" (ancient) and to the Christian period as \"nova\" (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse. Leonardo Bruni was the first to use tripartite periodization in his \"History of the Florentine People\" (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in \"Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire\" (1439\u20131453).\nHumanist historians argued that contemporary scholarship restored direct links to the classical period, thus bypassing the Medieval period, which they then named for the first time the \"Middle Ages\". The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as \"media tempestas\" (middle times). The term \"rinascita\" (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in Giorgio Vasari's \"Lives of the Artists\", 1550, revised 1568. Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains Cimabue, Giotto, and Arnolfo di Cambio; the second phase contains Masaccio, Brunelleschi, and Donatello; the third centers on Leonardo da Vinci and culminates with Michelangelo. It was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.\nSpread.\nIn the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly from its birthplace in Florence to the rest of Italy and soon to the rest of Europe. The invention of the printing press by German printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.\nEngland.\nThe Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance. Many scholars see its beginnings in the early 16th century during the reign of Henry VIII.\nThe English Renaissance is different from the Italian Renaissance in several ways. The dominant art forms of the English Renaissance were literature and music, which had a rich flowering. Visual arts in the English Renaissance were much less significant than in the Italian Renaissance. The English Renaissance period in art began far later than the Italian, which had moved into Mannerism by the 1530s.\nIn literature the later part of the 16th century saw the flowering of Elizabethan literature, with poetry heavily influenced by Italian Renaissance literature but Elizabethan theatre a distinctive native style. Writers include William Shakespeare (1564\u20131616), Christopher Marlowe (1564\u20131593), Edmund Spenser (1552\u20131599), Sir Thomas More (1478\u20131535), and Sir Philip Sidney (1554\u20131586). English Renaissance music competed with that in Europe with composers such as Thomas Tallis (1505\u20131585), John Taverner (1490\u20131545), and William Byrd (1540\u20131623). Elizabethan architecture produced the large prodigy houses of courtiers, and in the next century Inigo Jones (1573\u20131652), who introduced Palladian architecture to England.\nElsewhere, Sir Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) was the pioneer of modern scientific thought, and is commonly regarded as one of the founders of the Scientific Revolution.\nFrance.\nThe word \"Renaissance\" is borrowed from the French language, where it means \"re-birth\". It was first used in the eighteenth century and was later popularized by French historian Jules Michelet (1798\u20131874) in his 1855 work, \"Histoire de France\" (History of France).\nIn 1495 the Italian Renaissance arrived in France, imported by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, Primaticcio, Rosso Fiorentino, Niccol\u00f2 dell'Abbate and Benvenuto Cellini and built ornate palaces at great expense, like the Palace of Fontainebleau and the castle of Chambord. Writers such as Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet and Fran\u00e7ois Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance. French Renaissance sculptors include Michel Colombe, Jean Goujon, Pierre Bontemps, Ligier Richier and Germain Pilon while important architects of the time were Pierre Lescot, who built the Henri II aisle of the Louvre, Philibert Delorme and Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau.\nIn 1533, a fourteen-year-old Catherine de' Medici (1519\u20131589), born in Florence to Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino and Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne, married Henry II of France, second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude. Though she became famous and infamous for her role in the French Wars of Religion, she made a direct contribution in bringing arts, sciences, and music (including the origins of ballet) to the French court from her native Florence.\nGermany.\nIn the second half of the 15th century, the Renaissance spirit spread to Germany and the Low Countries, where the development of the printing press (ca. 1450) and Renaissance artists such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471\u20131528) predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas of the country humanism became closely linked to the turmoil of the Reformation, and the art and writing of the German Renaissance frequently reflected this dispute. However, the Gothic style and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century. Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg (ruling 1493\u20131519) was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the Holy Roman Empire.\nHungary.\nAfter Italy, Hungary was the first European country where the Renaissance appeared. The Renaissance style came directly from Italy during the Quattrocento (1400s) to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks to the development of early Hungarian-Italian relationships \u2014 not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations\u00a0\u2013 growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason\u00a0\u2013 exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegr\u00e1d, Tata, and V\u00e1rpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pippo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.\nThe new Italian trend combined with existing national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the Florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vit\u00e9z J\u00e1nos, archbishop of Esztergom, one of the founders of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458\u20131490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.\nAfter the marriage in 1476 of King Matthias to Beatrice of Naples, Buda became one of the most important artistic centers of the Renaissance north of the Alps. The most important humanists living in Matthias' court were Antonio Bonfini and the famous Hungarian poet Janus Pannonius. Andr\u00e1s Hess set up a printing press in Buda in 1472. Matthias Corvinus's library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe's greatest collections of secular books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century. His library was second only in size to the Vatican Library. (However, the Vatican Library mainly contained Bibles and religious materials.) In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de' Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king. Corvinus's library is part of UNESCO World Heritage.\nMatthias started at least two major building projects. The works in Buda and Visegr\u00e1d began in about 1479. Two new wings and a hanging garden were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegr\u00e1d was rebuilt in Renaissance style. Matthias appointed the Italian Chimenti Camicia and the Dalmatian Giovanni Dalmata to direct these projects. Matthias commissioned the leading Italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor Benedetto da Majano and the painters Filippino Lippi and Andrea Mantegna worked for him. A copy of Mantegna's portrait of Matthias survived. Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer Aristotele Fioravanti to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier. He had new monasteries built in Late Gothic style for the Franciscans in Kolozsv\u00e1r, Szeged and Hunyad, and for the Paulines in Fej\u00e9regyh\u00e1za. In the spring of 1485, Leonardo da Vinci travelled to Hungary on behalf of Sforza to meet King Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a Madonna.\nMatthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them. The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars\u2014mostly Italian\u2014to settle in Buda. Antonio Bonfini, Pietro Ranzano, Bartolomeo Fonzio, and Francesco Bandini spent many years in Matthias's court. This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of Neoplatonism to Hungary. Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations. Martius Galeotti described him as \"king and astrologer\", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias \"never did anything without consulting the stars\". Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, Johannes Regiomontanus and Marcin Bylica, set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes. Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by Christopher Columbus to Matthias.\nOther important figures of Hungarian Renaissance include B\u00e1lint Balassi (poet), Sebesty\u00e9n Tin\u00f3di Lantos (poet), B\u00e1lint Bakfark (composer and lutenist), and Master MS (fresco painter).\nLow Countries.\nCulture in the Netherlands at the end of the 15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance through trade via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe. In science, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator's map assisted explorers and navigators. In art, Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting ranged from the strange work of Hieronymus Bosch to the everyday life depictions of Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\nErasmus was arguably the Netherlands' best known humanist and Catholic intellectual during the Renaissance.\nNorthern Europe.\nThe Renaissance in Northern Europe has been termed the \"Northern Renaissance\". While Renaissance ideas were moving north from Italy, there was a simultaneous southward spread of some areas of innovation, particularly in music. The music of the 15th-century Burgundian School defined the beginning of the Renaissance in music, and the polyphony of the Netherlanders, as it moved with the musicians themselves into Italy, formed the core of the first true international style in music since the standardization of Gregorian Chant in the 9th century. The culmination of the Netherlandish school was in the music of the Italian composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. At the end of the 16th century Italy again became a center of musical innovation, with the development of the polychoral style of the Venetian School, which spread northward into Germany around 1600. In Denmark, the Renaissance sparked the translation of the works of Saxo Grammaticus into Danish as well as Frederick II and Christian IV ordering the redecoration or construction of several important works of architecture, i.e. Kronborg, Rosenborg and B\u00f8rsen. Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe greatly contributed to turn astronomy into the first modern science and also helped launch the Scientific Revolution.\nThe paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed from those of the Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Later, the works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries. A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of Dante Alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin. The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.\nPoland.\nThe Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. An early Italian humanist who came to Poland in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi, who was employed as royal advisor and councillor. The tomb of John I Albert, completed in 1505 by Francesco Fiorentino, is the first example of a Renaissance composition in the country. Many Italian artists subsequently came to Poland with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I in 1518. This was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, as well as by newly established universities. \nThe Renaissance was a period when the multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars, aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. Architecture became more refined and decorative. Mannerism played an important part in shaping what is now considered to be the truly Polish architectural style \u2013 high attics above the cornice with pinnacles and pilasters. It was also the time when the first major works of Polish literature were published, particularly those of Miko\u0142aj Rey and Jan Kochanowski, and the Polish language became the \"lingua franca\" of East-Central Europe. The Jagiellonian University transformed into a major institution of higher education for the region and hosted many notable scholars, chiefly Nicolaus Copernicus and Conrad Celtes. Three more academies were founded at K\u00f6nigsberg (1544), Vilnius (1579), and Zamo\u015b\u0107 (1594). The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country, giving rise to the Nontrinitarian Polish Brethren. Living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (\"szlachta\") and magnates. The nobles gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty, a counterweight to monarchical absolutism.\nPortugal.\nAlthough Italian Renaissance had a modest impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was influential in broadening the European worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including Pedro Nunes, Jo\u00e3o de Castro, Abraham Zacuto, and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Est\u00eav\u00e3o Gomes, and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary Tom\u00e9 Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.\nIn architecture, the huge profits of the spice trade financed a sumptuous composite style in the first decades of the 16th century, the Manueline, incorporating maritime elements. The primary painters were Nuno Gon\u00e7alves, Greg\u00f3rio Lopes, and Vasco Fernandes. In music, Pedro de Escobar and Duarte Lobo produced four songbooks, including the Cancioneiro de Elvas.\nIn literature, Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem \"Os Lus\u00edadas\". S\u00e1 de Miranda introduced Italian forms of verse and Bernardim Ribeiro developed pastoral romance, while plays by Gil Vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times. Travel literature especially flourished: Jo\u00e3o de Barros, Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda, Ant\u00f3nio Galv\u00e3o, Gaspar Correia, Duarte Barbosa, and Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press. After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, Amerigo Vespucci coined the term New World, in his letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.\nThe intense international exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, Andr\u00e9 de Resende, and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is, a friend of Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of King Manuel I. Diogo de Gouveia and Andr\u00e9 de Gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and Albrecht D\u00fcrer to the wider world. There, profits and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age, especially after the arrival of the wealthy cultured Jewish community expelled from Portugal.\nSpain.\nThe Renaissance arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions of the Crown of Aragon and the city of Valencia. Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the Crown of Aragon, including Ausi\u00e0s March and Joanot Martorell. In the Crown of Castile, the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza, marqu\u00e9s de Santillana, who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as Jorge Manrique, Fernando de Rojas, Juan del Encina, Juan Bosc\u00e1n Almog\u00e1ver, and Garcilaso de la Vega, kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon. Miguel de Cervantes's masterpiece \"Don Quixote\" is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher Juan Luis Vives, grammarian Antonio de Nebrija and natural historian Pedro de Mex\u00eda. The poet and philosopher Luisa de Medrano, celebrated among her Renaissance contemporaries as one of the \"puellae doctae\" (\"learned girls\"), was the first female professor in Europe at the University of Salamanca.\nLater Spanish Renaissance tended toward religious themes and mysticism, with poets such as Luis de Le\u00f3n, Teresa of \u00c1vila, and John of the Cross, and treated issues related to the exploration of the New World, with chroniclers and writers such as Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, giving rise to a body of work, now known as Spanish Renaissance literature. The late Renaissance in Spain produced political and religious authors such as Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Medrano and artists such as El Greco and composers such as Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria and Antonio de Cabez\u00f3n.\nHistoriography.\nConception.\nThe Italian artist and critic Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574) first used the term \"rinascita\" in his book \"The Lives of the Artists\" (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define what he described as a break with the barbarities of Gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay with the collapse of the Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240\u20131301) and Giotto (1267\u20131337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw ancient art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.\nHowever, only in the 19th century did the French word achieve popularity in describing the self-conscious cultural movement based on revival of Roman models that began in the late 13th century. French historian Jules Michelet (1798\u20131874) defined \"The Renaissance\" in his 1855 work \"Histoire de France\" as an entire historical period, whereas previously it had been used in a more limited sense. For Michelet, the Renaissance was more a development in science than in art and culture. He asserted that it spanned the period from Columbus to Copernicus to Galileo; that is, from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 17th century. Moreover, Michelet distinguished between what he called, \"the bizarre and monstrous\" quality of the Middle Ages and the democratic values that he, as a vocal Republican, chose to see in its character. A French nationalist, Michelet also sought to claim the Renaissance as a French movement.\nThe Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt (1818\u20131897) in his \"The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy\" (1860), by contrast, defined the Renaissance as the period between Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance the emergence of the modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance.\nMore recently, some historians have been much less keen to define the Renaissance as a historical age, or even as a coherent cultural movement. The historian Randolph Starn, of the University of California Berkeley, stated in 1998:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDebates about progress.\nThere is debate about the extent to which the Renaissance improved on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance toward the modern age. Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, allowing him to see clearly.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the Middle Ages both sides of human consciousness \u2013 that which was turned within as that which was turned without \u2013 lay dreaming or half awake beneath a common veil. The veil was woven of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession, through which the world and history were seen clad in strange hues.\u2014\u200a\nOn the other hand, many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period\u00a0\u2013 poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example\u00a0\u2013 seem to have worsened in this era, which saw the rise of Machiavellian politics, the Wars of Religion, the corrupt Borgia Popes, and the intensified witch-hunts of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the \"golden age\" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies. Significantly, though, the artists, writers, and patrons involved in the cultural movements in question believed they were living in a new era that was a clean break from the Middle Ages. Some Marxist historians prefer to describe the Renaissance in material terms, holding the view that the changes in art, literature, and philosophy were part of a general economic trend from feudalism toward capitalism, resulting in a bourgeois class with leisure time to devote to the arts.\nJohan Huizinga (1872\u20131945) acknowledged the existence of the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book \"The Autumn of the Middle Ages\", he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Medieval Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. This view is however somewhat contested by recent studies. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.\nSome historians have begun to consider the word \"Renaissance\" to be unnecessarily loaded, implying an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive \"Dark Ages\", the Middle Ages. Most political and economic historians now prefer to use the term \"early modern\" for this period (and a considerable period afterwards), a designation intended to highlight the period as a transitional one between the Middle Ages and the modern era. Others such as Roger Osborne have come to consider the Italian Renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as a period of great innovation.\nThe art historian Erwin Panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of \"Renaissance\":\nIt is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization \u2013 historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science \u2013 but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.\nOther Renaissances.\nThe term \"Renaissance\" has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries in the earlier Medieval period. Charles H. Haskins (1870\u20131937), for example, made a case for a Renaissance of the 12th century. Other historians have argued for a Carolingian Renaissance in the 8th and 9th centuries, Ottonian Renaissance in the 10th century and for the Timurid Renaissance of the 14th century. The Islamic Golden Age has been also sometimes termed with the Islamic Renaissance. The Macedonian Renaissance is a term used for a period in the Roman Empire in the 9th-11th centuries CE.\nOther periods of cultural rebirth in Modern times have also been termed \"renaissances\", such as the Bengal Renaissance, Tamil Renaissance, Nepal Bhasa renaissance, al-Nahda or the Harlem Renaissance. The term can also be used in cinema. In animation, the Disney Renaissance is a period that spanned the years from 1989 to 1999 which saw the studio return to the level of quality not witnessed since their Golden Age of Animation. The San Francisco Renaissance was a vibrant period of exploratory poetry and fiction writing in San Francisco in the mid-20th century.\nReferences.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistoriography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25533", "revid": "42894861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25533", "title": "Rheged", "text": "Sub-Roman kingdom of Northern Britain\nRheged () was one of the kingdoms of the ('Old North'), the Brittonic-speaking region of what is now Northern England and southern Scotland, during the post-Roman era and Early Middle Ages. It is recorded in several poetic and bardic sources, although its borders are not described in any of them. Archaeological work from 2012 onwards on a site in Galloway in Scotland is interpreted by the excavators as showing that it is a royal centre of Rheged. Rheged possibly extended into Lancashire and other parts of northern England. In some sources, Rheged is intimately associated with the king Urien Rheged and his family. Its inhabitants spoke Cumbric, a Brittonic dialect closely related to Old Welsh.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the name \"Rheged\" has been described as \"problematic\". One Brittonic-language solution is that the name may be a compound of \"r\u00f6-\", a prefix meaning \"great\", and \"c\u0119:d\" meaning \"wood, forest\" (cf. Welsh \"coed\") although the expected form in Welsh would be \"*Rhygoed\". If association of the name with \"c\u0119:d\" is correct, the prefix may be \"rag-\", meaning \"before, adjacent to, opposite\". Derivation from the element \"reg\", which with the suffix \"-ed\" has connotations of \"generosity\", is another possibility.\nLocation.\nThe name Rheged appears regularly as an epithet of Urien (a late 6th-century king of Rheged) in a number of early Welsh poems and royal genealogies. His victories over the Anglian chieftains of Bernicia in the second half of the 6th century are recorded by Nennius and celebrated by the bard Taliesin, who calls him \"Ruler of Rheged\". He is thus placed squarely in the North of Britain and perhaps specifically in Westmorland when referred to as \"Ruler of Llwyfenydd\" (identified with the Lyvennet Valley). Later legend associates Urien with the city of Carlisle (the Roman Luguvalium), only twenty-five miles away; Higham suggests that Rheged was \"broadly conterminous with the earlier \"Civitas Carvetiorum\", the Roman administrative unit based on Carlisle\". Although it is possible that Rheged was merely a stronghold, it was not uncommon for sub-Roman monarchs to use their kingdom's name as an epithet. \nPlace-name evidence, e.g., Dunragit (possibly \"Fort of Rheged\")\u03b1 suggests that, at least in one period of its history, Rheged included Dumfries and Galloway. Recent archaeological excavations at Trusty's Hill, a vitrified fort near Gatehouse of Fleet, and the analysis of its artefacts in the context of other sites and their artefacts have led to claims that the kingdom was centred on Galloway early in the 7th century.\nInterpretations of another place-name, with even less certainty, indicate that Rheged could also have reached as far south as Rochdale in Greater Manchester, recorded in the Domesday Book as \"Recedham\". The River Roch on which Rochdale stands was recorded in the 13th century as \"Rached\" or \"Rachet\". Such names may derive from Old English \"reced\" \"hall or house\". However, no other place names originating from this Old English element exist, which makes this derivation unlikely. If they are not of English origin, these place-names may incorporate the element 'Rheged' precisely because they lay on or near its borders. Certainly Urien's kingdom stretched eastward at one time, as he was also \"Ruler of Catraeth\" (Catterick in North Yorkshire).\nIt is accepted by most scholars, therefore, that Rheged was a kingdom covering a large part of modern Cumbria as well as areas of Dumfries and Galloway and extended, for some of its history, into present day Yorkshire.\nKings of Rheged.\nThe traditional royal genealogy of Urien and his successors traces their ancestry back to Coel Hen (considered by some to be the origins of the Old King Cole of folk tradition), who is considered by many to be a mythical figure; if he has some historicity, he may have ruled a considerable part of the North in the early 5th century. All of those listed below may have ruled in Rheged, but only three of their number can be verified from external sources:\nThere are two possible later kings of Rheged:\nSouthern Rheged.\nA second royal genealogy exists for a line, perhaps of kings, descended from Cynfarch Oer's brother: Elidir Lydanwyn. According to \"Bonedd Gw\u0177r y Gogledd\" Elidir's son, Llywarch Hen, was a ruler in North Britain in the 6th century. He was driven from his territory by princely in-fighting after Urien's death and was perhaps in old age associated with Powys. However, it is possible, because of internal inconsistencies, that the poetry connected to Powys was associated with Llywarch's name at a later, probably 9th century, date. Llywarch is referred to in some poems as king of South Rheged, and in others as king of Argoed, suggesting that the two regions were the same. Searching for Llywarch's kingdom has led some historians to propose that Rheged may have been divided between sons, resulting in northern and southern successor states. The connections of the family of Llywarch and Urien with Powys has suggested to some, on grounds of proximity, that the area of modern Lancashire may have been their original home.\nEnd of Rheged.\nAfter Bernicia united with Deira to become the kingdom of Northumbria, Rheged was annexed by Northumbria, some time before AD 730. There was a royal marriage between Prince (later King) Oswiu of Northumbria and the Rhegedian princess Rieinmelth, granddaughter of Rum (Rhun), probably in 638, so it is possible that it was a peaceful takeover, both kingdoms being inherited by the same man.\nAfter Rheged was incorporated into Northumbria, the old Cumbric language was gradually replaced by Old English, Cumbric surviving only in remote upland communities. Around the year 900, after the power of Northumbria was destroyed by Viking incursions and settlement, large areas west of the Pennines fell without apparent warfare under the control of the Brittonic Kingdom of Strathclyde, with Leeds recorded as being on the border between the Britons and the Norse Kingdom of York. This may have represented the political assertion of lingering Brittonic culture in the region. The area of Cumbria remained under the control of Strathclyde until the early 11th century when Strathclyde itself was absorbed into the Scottish kingdom. The name of the people, whose modern Welsh form is has, however, survived in the name of Cumberland and now Cumbria; it probably derives from an old Celtic word *\"Kombroges\" meaning \"fellow countrymen\".\nDiscovery of a possible royal centre of Rheged.\nIn 2012 archaeologists found evidence at Trusty's Hill near the town of Gatehouse of Fleet, in Galloway, southwest Scotland, which they interpreted as suggesting that the site may have been a royal centre of Rheged's capital c.\u2009600\u00a0AD. One of the lead researchers, Ronan Toolis, stated that their findings revealed structural ruins atop the hill. These originally belonged to a fortification system with a timber-reinforced stone rampart where the main fortification was supplemented by smaller defensive works along the low-lying slopes. According to Toolis, this suggests the presence of a royal stronghold of the period. The historian Roger Collins is sceptical, arguing that the evidence does not fit [the excavators'] favoured interpretation of the site as a royal centre\".\nGenetic legacy.\nAccording to the University of Oxford's \"People of the British Isles\" project, the original population of Rheged has left a distinct genetic heritage amongst the people of Cumbria. The research compared the DNA of over 2000 people across the British Isles whose grandparents were all born within of each other, and found a number of cases, including Rheged, where genetic clusters of people matched the location of historical kingdoms (other examples included Bernicia and Elmet).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^\u03b1 but see: Clarkson, T. J., The Men of the North: The Britons of Southern Scotland, John Donald, 2010, p. 71: \"Archaeologists are extremely sceptical that this was a site occupied in Early Historic times, still less that it was a royal residence. Such scepticism raises serious doubts about the usual derivation of the place-name Dunragit which may in fact be a red herring. It has been suggested that the second element could be Gaelic \"reichet\" rather than Old Welsh Reget, and that the place was so named by the Gall Gaidhil, 'foreign Gaels', who colonised Galloway in the Viking period.\" For Gaelic \"re(i)chet\", cf. the Old Irish place name \"Mag Roichet/Rechet\" (Modern Irish \"Maigh Reichead\"), now https://.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25534", "revid": "27853216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25534", "title": "Romanian language", "text": "Eastern Romance language\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nRomanian (obsolete spelling: Roumanian; , or , lit.\u2009'in Romanian') is the official and main language of Romania and Moldova. Romanian is part of the Eastern Romance sub-branch of Romance languages, a linguistic group that evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin which separated from the Western Romance languages in the course of the period from the 5th to the 8th centuries. To distinguish it within the Eastern Romance languages, in comparative linguistics it is called \"Daco-Romanian\" as opposed to its closest relatives, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian. It is also spoken as a minority language by stable communities in the countries surrounding Romania (Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Ukraine), and by the large Romanian diaspora. In total, it is spoken by 25 million people as a first language.\nRomanian was also known as \"Moldovan\" in Moldova, although the Constitutional Court of Moldova ruled in 2013 that \"the official language of Moldova is Romanian\". On 16 March 2023, the Moldovan Parliament approved a law on referring to the national language as Romanian in all legislative texts and the constitution. On 22 March, the president of Moldova, Maia Sandu, promulgated the law.\nOverview.\nThe history of the Romanian language started in the Roman provinces north of the Jire\u010dek Line in Classical antiquity but there are 3 main hypotheses about its exact territory: the autochthony thesis (it developed in left-Danube Dacia only), the discontinuation thesis (it developed in right-Danube provinces only), and the \"as-well-as\" thesis that supports the language development on both sides of the Danube. Between the 6th and 8th century, following the accumulated tendencies inherited from the vernacular spoken in this large area and, to a much smaller degree, the influences from native dialects, and in the context of a lessened power of the Roman central authority the language evolved into Common Romanian. This proto-language then came into close contact with the Slavic languages and subsequently divided into Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, and Daco-Romanian. Due to limited attestation between the 6th and 16th century, entire stages from its history are re-constructed by researchers, often with proposed relative chronologies and loose limits.\nFrom the 12th or 13th century, official documents and religious texts were written in Old Church Slavonic, a language that had a similar role to Medieval Latin in Western Europe. The oldest dated text in Romanian is a letter written in 1521 with Cyrillic letters, and until late 18th century, including during the development of printing, the same alphabet was used. The period after 1780, starting with the writing of its first grammar books, represents the modern age of the language, during which time the Latin alphabet became official, the literary language was standardized, and a large number of words from Modern Latin and other Romance languages entered the lexis.\nIn the process of language evolution from fewer than 2500 attested words from Late Antiquity to a lexicon of over 150,000 words in its contemporary form, Romanian showed a high degree of lexical permeability, reflecting contact with Thraco-Dacian, Slavic languages (including Old Slavic, Serbian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, and Russian), Greek, Hungarian, German, Turkish, and to languages that served as cultural models during and after the Age of Enlightenment, in particular French. This lexical permeability is continuing today with the introduction of English words.\nYet while the overall lexis was enriched with foreign words and internal constructs, in accordance with the history and development of the society and the diversification in semantic fields, the fundamental lexicon\u2014the core vocabulary used in everyday conversation\u2014remains governed by inherited elements from the Latin spoken in the Roman provinces bordering Danube, without which no coherent sentence can be made.\nHistory.\nCommon Romanian.\nRomanian descended from the Latin spoken in the Roman provinces of Southeastern Europe north of the Jire\u010dek Line (a hypothetical boundary between the dominance of Latin and Greek influences).\nMost scholars agree that two major dialects had developed from Common Romanian by the 10th century. Daco-Romanian (the official language of Romania and Moldova) and Istro-Romanian (a language spoken today by no more than 2,000 people in Istria) descended from the northern dialect. Two other languages, Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian, developed from the southern version of Common Romanian. These two languages are now spoken in lands to the south of the Jire\u010dek Line.\nOf the features that individualize Common Romanian, inherited from Latin or subsequently developed, of particular importance are:\nOld Romanian.\nThe use of the denomination \"Romanian\" () for the language and use of the demonym \"Romanians\" () for speakers of this language predate the foundation of the modern Romanian state. Romanians always used the general term / or regional terms such as (or ), or to designate themselves. Both the name of or for the Romanian language and the self-designation are attested as early as the 16th century, by various foreign travelers into the Carpathian Romance-speaking space, as well as in other historical documents written in Romanian at that time such as (\"The Chronicles of the land of Moldova\") by Grigore Ureche.\nThe few allusions to the use of Romanian in writing as well as common words, anthroponyms and toponyms preserved in the Old Church Slavonic religious writings and chancellery documents, attested prior to the 16th century, along with the analysis of graphemes show that the writing of Romanian with the Cyrillic alphabet started in the second half of the 15th century. \nThe Hurmuzaki Psalter (\"Psaltirea Hurmuzaki\") is the oldest writing in Romanian, dated on the basis of watermarks between 1491\u20131504. It is a copy of an older, fifteenth-century translation of the Psalter, which was bilingual (written in Church Slavonic, with Romanian translation after each verse). The oldest Romanian document precisely dated is Neac\u0219u's letter (1521) and was written using the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet, which was used until the late 19th century. The letter is the oldest testimony of Romanian epistolary style and uses a prevalent lexis of Latin origin. The slow process of Romanian establishing itself as an official language, used in the public sphere, in literature and ecclesiastically, began in the late 15th century and ended in the early decades of the 18th century, by which time Romanian had begun to be regularly used by the Church. The oldest Romanian texts of a literary nature are liturgical texts of the Eastern Orthodox Church: Psalter (Hurmuzaki Psalter, Scheian Psalter, Psalter of Vorone\u021b) and Apostolos lectionary (Bratu's Codex, Codex of Vorone\u021b). Their origins go back to the 15th century. The fact that they are bilingual writings or descend from bilingual writings shows that the initiative to translate them was prompted by the need to facilitate access to the Church Slavonic liturgical text.\nThe language spoken during this period had a phonological system of seven vowels and twenty-nine consonants. Particular to Old Romanian are the distribution of /z/, as the allophone of /dz/ from Common Romanian, in the Wallachian and south-east Transylvanian varieties, the presence of palatal sonorants /\u028e/ and /\u0272/, nowadays preserved only regionally in Banat and Oltenia, and the beginning of devoicing of asyllabic [u] after consonants. Text analysis revealed words that are now lost from modern vocabulary or used only in local varieties. These words were of various provenience for example: Latin (\"cure\" \u2013 to run, \"m\u00e2neca\"- to leave), Old Church Slavonic (\"dr\u0103ghicame\" \u2013 gem, precious stone, \"pril\u0103sti\" \u2013 to trick, to cheat), Hungarian (\"biz\u0103ntui\" \u2013 to bear witness).\nModern Romanian.\nThe modern age of Romanian starts in 1780 with the printing in Vienna of a very important grammar book titled \"Elementa linguae daco-romanae sive valachicae\". The author of the book, Samuil Micu-Klein, and the revisor, Gheorghe \u0218incai, both members of the Transylvanian School, chose to use Latin as the language of the text and presented the phonetical and grammatical features of Romanian in comparison to its ancestor. The Modern age of Romanian language can be further divided into three phases: pre-modern or modernizing between 1780 and 1830, modern phase between 1831 and 1880, and contemporary from 1880 onwards.\nPre-modern period.\nBeginning with the printing in 1780 of \"Elementa linguae daco-romanae sive valachicae\", the pre-modern phase was characterized by the publishing of school textbooks, appearance of first normative works in Romanian, numerous translations, and the beginning of a conscious stage of re-latinization of the language. Notable contributions, besides that of the Transylvanian School, are the activities of Gheorghe Laz\u0103r, founder of the first Romanian school, and Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu. The end of this period is marked by the first printing of magazines and newspapers in Romanian, in particular Curierul Rom\u00e2nesc and Albina Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103.\nModern period.\nStarting from 1831 and lasting until 1880 the modern phase is characterized by the development of literary styles: scientific, administrative, and belletristic. It quickly reached a high point with the printing of Dacia Literar\u0103, a journal founded by Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu and representing a literary society, which together with other publications like and spread the ideas of Romantic nationalism and later contributed to the formation of other societies that took part in the Revolutions of 1848. Their members and those that shared their views are collectively known in Romania as \"of '48\"(), a name that was extended to the literature and writers around this time such as Vasile Alecsandri, Grigore Alexandrescu, Nicolae B\u0103lcescu, Timotei Cipariu.\nBetween 1830 and 1860 \"transitional alphabets\" were used, adding Latin letters to the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet. The Latin alphabet became official at different dates in Wallachia and Transylvania\u00a0\u2013 1860, and Moldova\u00a0\u2013 1862.\nFollowing the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia further studies on the language were made, culminating with the founding of on 1 April 1866 on the initiative of C. A. Rosetti, an academic society that had the purpose of standardizing the orthography, formalizing the grammar and (via a dictionary) vocabulary of the language, and promoting literary and scientific publications. This institution later became the Romanian Academy.\nContemporary period.\nThe third phase of the modern age of Romanian language, starting from 1880 and continuing to this day, is characterized by the prevalence of the supradialectal form of the language, standardized with the express contribution of the school system and Romanian Academy, bringing a close to the process of literary language modernization and development of literary styles. It is distinguished by the activity of Romanian literature classics in its early decades: Mihai Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale, Ion Creang\u0103, Ioan Slavici.\nThe current orthography, with minor reforms to this day and using Latin letters, was fully implemented in 1881, regulated by the Romanian Academy on a fundamentally phonological principle, with few morpho-syntactic exceptions.\nModern history of Romanian in Bessarabia.\nThe first Romanian grammar was published in Vienna in 1780. Following the annexation of Bessarabia by Russia in 1812, Moldavian was established as an official language in the governmental institutions of Bessarabia, used along with Russian,\nThe publishing works established by Archbishop Gavril B\u0103nulescu-Bodoni were able to produce books and liturgical works in Moldavian between 1815 and 1820.\nBessarabia during the 1812\u20131918 era witnessed the gradual development of bilingualism. Russian continued to develop as the official language of privilege, whereas Romanian remained the principal vernacular.\nThe period from 1905 to 1917 was one of increasing linguistic conflict spurred by an increase in Romanian nationalism. In 1905 and 1906, the Bessarabian asked for the re-introduction of Romanian in schools as a \"compulsory language\", and the \"liberty to teach in the mother language (Romanian language)\". At the same time, Romanian-language newspapers and journals began to appear, such as (1906), (1907), (1907), (1908), (1913), (1913). From 1913, the synod permitted that \"the churches in Bessarabia use the Romanian language\". Romanian finally became the official language with the Constitution of 1923.\nHistorical grammar.\nRomanian has preserved a part of the Latin declension. However, while Latin had six cases, from a morphological viewpoint, Romanian has only three: the nominative/accusative, genitive/dative, and marginally the vocative. Romanian nouns also preserve the neuter gender, although instead of functioning as a separate gender with its own forms in adjectives, the Romanian neuter became a mixture of masculine and feminine. The verb morphology of Romanian has shown the same move towards a compound perfect and future tense as the other Romance languages. Compared with the other Romance languages, during its evolution, Romanian simplified the original Latin tense system.\nGeographic distribution.\nRomanian is spoken mostly in Central, South-Eastern, and Eastern Europe, although speakers of the language can be found all over the world, mostly due to emigration of Romanian nationals and the return of immigrants to Romania back to their original countries. Romanian speakers account for 0.5% of the world's population, and 4% of the Romance-speaking population of the world.\nRomanian is the single official and national language in Romania and Moldova, although it shares the official status at regional level with other languages in the Moldovan autonomies of Gagauzia and Transnistria. Romanian is also an official language of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in Serbia along with five other languages. Romanian minorities are encountered in Serbia (Timok Valley), Ukraine (Chernivtsi and Odesa oblasts), and Hungary (Gyula). Large immigrant communities are found in Italy, Spain, France, and Portugal.\nIn 1995, the largest Romanian-speaking community in the Middle East was found in Israel, where Romanian was spoken by 5% of the population. Romanian is also spoken as a second language by people from Arabic-speaking countries who have studied in Romania. It is estimated that almost half a million Middle Eastern Arabs studied in Romania during the 1980s. Small Romanian-speaking communities are to be found in Kazakhstan and Russia. Romanian is also spoken within communities of Romanian and Moldovan immigrants in the United States, Canada and Australia, although they do not make up a large homogeneous community statewide.\nLegal status.\nIn Romania.\nAccording to the Constitution of Romania of 1991, as revised in 2003, Romanian is the official language of the Republic.\nRomania mandates the use of Romanian in official government publications, public education and legal contracts. Advertisements as well as other public messages must bear a translation of foreign words, while trade signs and logos shall be written predominantly in Romanian.\nThe Romanian Language Institute (Institutul Limbii Rom\u00e2ne), established by the Ministry of Education of Romania, promotes Romanian and supports people willing to study the language, working together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department for Romanians Abroad.\nSince 2013, the Romanian Language Day is celebrated on every 31 August.\nIn Moldova.\nRomanian is the official language of the Republic of Moldova. The 1991 Declaration of Independence named the official language Romanian, and the Constitution of Moldova as originally adopted in 1994 named the state language of the country Moldovan. In December 2013, a decision of the Constitutional Court of Moldova ruled that the Declaration of Independence took precedence over the Constitution and the state language should be called Romanian. In 2023, the Moldovan parliament passed a law officially adopting the designation \"Romanian\" in all legal instruments, implementing the 2013 court decision.\nScholars agree that Moldovan and Romanian are the same language, with the glottonym \"Moldovan\" used in certain political contexts. It has been the sole official language since the adoption of the Law on State Language of the Moldavian SSR in 1989. This law mandates the use of Moldovan in all the political, economic, cultural and social spheres, as well as asserting the existence of a \"linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity\". It is also used in schools, mass media, education and in the colloquial speech and writing. Outside the political arena the language is most often called \"Romanian\". In the breakaway territory of Transnistria, it is co-official with Ukrainian and Russian.\nIn the 2014 census, out of the 2,804,801 people living in Moldova, 24% (652,394) stated Romanian as their most common language, whereas 56% stated Moldovan. While in the urban centers speakers are split evenly between the two names (with the capital Chi\u0219in\u0103u showing a strong preference for the name \"Romanian\", i.e. 3:2), in the countryside hardly a quarter of Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as their native language. Unofficial results of this census first showed a stronger preference for the name Romanian, however the initial reports were later dismissed by the Institute for Statistics, which led to speculations in the media regarding the forgery of the census results.\nIn Serbia.\nVojvodina.\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Serbia determines that in the regions of the Republic of Serbia inhabited by national minorities, their own languages and scripts shall be officially used as well, in the manner established by law.\nThe Statute of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina determines that, together with the Serbian language and the Cyrillic script, and the Latin script as stipulated by the law, the Croat, Hungarian, Slovak, Romanian and Rusyn languages and their scripts, as well as languages and scripts of other nationalities, shall simultaneously be officially used in the work of the bodies of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, in the manner established by the law. The bodies of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina are: the Assembly, the Executive Council and the provincial administrative bodies.\nThe Romanian language and script are officially used in eight municipalities: Alibunar, Bela Crkva (\"Biserica Alb\u0103\"), \u017diti\u0161te (\"S\u00e2ngeorgiu de Bega\"), Zrenjanin (\"Becicherecu Mare\"), Kova\u010dica (\"Cov\u0103ci\u021ba\"), Kovin (\"Cuvin\"), Plandi\u0161te (\"Plandi\u0219te\") and Se\u010danj (\"Seceani\"). In the municipality of Vr\u0161ac (\"V\u00e2r\u0219e\u021b\"), Romanian is official only in the villages of Vojvodinci (\"Voivodin\u021b\"), Markovac (\"Marcov\u0103\u021b\"), Stra\u017ea (\"Straja\"), Mali \u017dam (\"Jamu Mic\"), Malo Sredi\u0161te (\"Sredi\u0219tea Mic\u0103\"), Mesi\u0107 (\"Mesici\"), Jablanka (\"Iablanca\"), So\u010dica (\"S\u0103lci\u021ba\"), Riti\u0161evo (\"R\u00e2ti\u0219or\"), Ore\u0161ac (\"Ore\u0219a\u021b\") and Ku\u0161tilj (\"Co\u0219tei\").\nIn the 2002 Census, the last carried out in Serbia, 1.5% of Vojvodinians stated Romanian as their native language.\nTimok Valley.\nThe Vlachs of Serbia are considered to speak Romanian as well.\nRegional language status in Ukraine.\nIn parts of Ukraine where Romanians constitute a significant share of the local population (districts in Chernivtsi, Odesa and Zakarpattia oblasts) Romanian is taught in schools as a primary language and there are Romanian-language newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting.\nThe University of Chernivtsi in western Ukraine trains teachers for Romanian schools in the fields of Romanian philology, mathematics and physics.\nIn Hertsa Raion of Ukraine as well as in other villages of Chernivtsi Oblast and Zakarpattia Oblast, Romanian has been declared a \"regional language\" alongside Ukrainian as per the 2012 legislation on languages in Ukraine.\nIn other countries and organizations.\nRomanian is an official or administrative language in various communities and organisations, such as the Latin Union and the European Union. Romanian is also one of the five languages in which religious services are performed in the autonomous monastic state of Mount Athos, spoken in the monastic communities of Prodromos and Lakkoskiti. In the unrecognised state of Transnistria, Moldovan is one of the official languages. However, unlike all other dialects of Romanian, this variety of Moldovan is written in Cyrillic script.\nAs a second and foreign language.\nRomanian is taught in some areas that have Romanian minority communities, such as Vojvodina in Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Hungary. The Romanian Cultural Institute (ICR) has since 1992 organised summer courses in Romanian for language teachers. There are also non-Romanians who study Romanian as a foreign language, for example the Nicolae B\u0103lcescu High-school in Gyula, Hungary.\nRomanian is taught as a foreign language in tertiary institutions, mostly in European countries such as Germany, France and Italy, and the Netherlands, as well as in the United States. Overall, it is taught as a foreign language in 43 countries around the world.\nPopular culture.\nRomanian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Romanian language. Examples of Romanian acts that had a great success in non-Romanophone countries are the bands O-Zone (with their No. 1 single Dragostea Din Tei, also known as \"Numa Numa,\" across the world in 2003\u20132004), Akcent (popular in the Netherlands, Poland and other European countries), Activ (successful in some Eastern European countries), DJ Project (popular as clubbing music) SunStroke Project (known by viral video \"Epic Sax Guy\") and Alexandra Stan (worldwide no.1 hit with \"Mr. Saxobeat\") and Inna as well as high-rated movies like \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\", \"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu\", ' or \"California Dreamin (all of them with awards at the Cannes Film Festival).\nAlso some artists wrote songs dedicated to the Romanian language. The multi-platinum pop trio O-Zone (originally from Moldova) released a song called (\"I won't forsake our language\"). The final verse of this song, , is translated in English as \"I won't forsake our language, our Romanian language\". Also, the Moldovan musicians Doina and Ion Aldea Teodorovici performed a song called \"The Romanian language\".\nDialects.\nRomanian is also called Daco-Romanian in comparative linguistics to distinguish from the other dialects of Common Romanian: Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian. The origin of the term \"Daco-Romanian\" can be traced back to the first printed book of Romanian grammar in 1780, by Samuil Micu and Gheorghe \u0218incai. There, the Romanian dialect spoken north of the Danube is called to emphasize its origin and its area of use, which includes the former Roman province of Dacia, although it is spoken also south of the Danube, in Dobruja, the Timok Valley and northern Bulgaria.\nThis article deals with the Romanian (i.e. Daco-Romanian) language, and thus only its dialectal variations are discussed here. The differences between the regional varieties are small, limited to regular phonetic changes, few grammar aspects, and lexical particularities. There is a single written and spoken standard (literary) Romanian language used by all speakers, regardless of region. Like most natural languages, Romanian dialects are part of a dialect continuum. The dialects of Romanian are also referred to as 'sub-dialects' and are distinguished primarily by phonetic differences. Romanians themselves speak of the differences as 'accents' or 'speeches' (in Romanian: or ).\nDepending on the criteria used for classifying these dialects, fewer or more are found, ranging from 2 to 20, although the most widespread approaches give a number of five dialects. These are grouped into two main types, southern and northern, further divided as follows:\nOver the last century, however, regional accents have been weakened due to mass communication and greater mobility.\nSome argots and speech forms have also arisen from the Romanian language. Examples are the Gumu\u021beasca, spoken in M\u0103rg\u0103u, and the Totoiana, an inverted \"version\" of Romanian spoken in Totoi.\nClassification.\nRomance language.\nRomanian is a Romance language, belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family, having much in common with languages such as Italian, Spanish, French and Portuguese.\nThe closest relative of Romanian among the Romance languages is Italian. The lexical similarity of Romanian with Italian has been estimated at 77%, followed by French at 75%, Sardinian 74%, Catalan 73%, Portuguese and Rhaeto-Romance 72%, Spanish 71%.\nCompered to some other Romance languages such as Italian, Romanian reflects greater foreign influence in areas such as vocabulary. The Romanian vocabulary became predominantly influenced by French and, to a lesser extent, Italian in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\nA 1949 study by the Italian-American linguist Mario Pei, analyzing the degree to which seven Romance languages diverged from Vulgar Latin with respect to their accent vocalization, yielded the following measurements of divergence (with higher percentages indicating greater divergence from the stressed vowels of Vulgar Latin): \nThe study emphasized, however, that it represented only \"a very elementary, incomplete and tentative demonstration\" of how statistical methods could measure linguistic change, assigned \"frankly arbitrary\" point values to various types of change, and did not compare languages in the sample with respect to any characteristics or forms of divergence other than stressed vowels, among other caveats. \nBalkan language area.\nWhile most of Romanian grammar and morphology are based on Latin, there are some features that are shared only with other languages of the Balkans and not found in other Romance languages. The shared features of Romanian and the other languages of the Balkan language area (Bulgarian, Macedonian, Albanian, Greek, and Serbo-Croatian) include a suffixed definite article, the syncretism of genitive and dative case and the formation of the future and the alternation of infinitive with subjunctive constructions. According to a well-established scholarly theory, most Balkanisms could be traced back to the development of the Balkan Romance languages; these features were adopted by other languages due to language shift.\nSlavic influence.\nSlavic influence on Romanian is especially noticeable in its vocabulary, with words of Slavic origin constituting about 10\u201315% of modern Romanian lexicon, and with further influences in its phonetics, morphology and syntax. The greater part of its Slavic vocabulary comes from Old Church Slavonic, which was the official written language of Wallachia and Moldavia from the 14th to the 18th century (although not understood by most people), as well as the liturgical language of the Romanian Orthodox Church. As a result, much Romanian vocabulary dealing with religion, ritual, and hierarchy is Slavic. The number of high-frequency Slavic-derived words is also believed to indicate contact or cohabitation with South Slavic tribes from around the 6th century, though it is disputed where this took place (see Origin of the Romanians). Words borrowed in this way tend to be more vernacular (compare \"sf\u00e2r\u0219i\", \"to end\", with \"s\u0103v\u00e2r\u0219i\", \"to commit\"). It has also been argued that Slavic borrowing was a key factor in the development of (\"\u00ee\" and \"\u00e2\") as a separate phoneme.\nOther influences.\nEven before the 19th century, Romanian came in contact with several other languages. Notable examples of lexical borrowings include:\nFurthermore, during the Habsburg and, later on, Austrian rule of Banat, Transylvania, and Bukovina, a large number of words were borrowed from Austrian High German, in particular in fields such as the military, administration, social welfare, economy, etc. Subsequently, German terms have been taken out of science and technics, like: \"\u0219in\u0103\" &lt; \"Schiene\" \"rail\", \"\u0219tift\" &lt; \"Stift\" \"peg\", \"li\u021b\u0103\" &lt; \"Litze\" \"braid\", \"\u0219indril\u0103\" &lt; \"Schindel\" \"shingle\", \"\u0219tan\u021b\u0103\" &lt; \"Stanze\" \"punch\", \"\u0219aib\u0103\" &lt; \"Scheibe\" \"washer\", \"\u0219tang\u0103\" &lt; \"Stange\" \"crossbar\", \"\u021bigl\u0103\" &lt; \"Ziegel\" \"tile\", \"\u0219mirghel\" &lt; \"Schmirgelpapier\" \"emery paper\";\nFrench, Italian, and English loanwords.\nSince the 19th century, many literary or learned words were borrowed from the other Romance languages, especially from French and Italian (for example: \"desk, office\", \"airplane\", \"exploit\"). It was estimated that about 38% of words in Romanian are of French and/or Italian origin (in many cases both languages); and adding this to Romanian's native stock, about 75%\u201385% of Romanian words can be traced to Latin. The use of these Romanianized French and Italian learned loans has tended to increase at the expense of previous loanwords, many of which have become rare or fallen out of use. As second or third languages, French and Italian themselves are better known in Romania than in Romania's neighbors. Along with the switch to the Latin alphabet in Moldova, the re-latinization of the vocabulary has tended to reinforce the Latin character of the language.\nIn the process of lexical modernization, much of the native Latin stock have acquired doublets from other Romance languages, thus forming a further and more modern and literary lexical layer. Typically, the native word is a noun and the learned loan is an adjective. Some examples of doublets:\nIn the 20th century, an increasing number of English words have been borrowed (such as: &lt; jam; &lt; interview; &lt; match; &lt; manager; &lt; football; / &lt; sandwich; &lt; business; &lt; cake; &lt; WC; &lt; tramway). These words are assigned grammatical gender in Romanian and handled according to Romanian rules; thus \"the manager\" is . Some borrowings, for example in the computer field, appear to have awkward (perhaps contrived and ludicrous) 'Romanisation,' such as which is the plural of the Internet term \"cookie\"; normally, the hyphen isn't used for plural endings and definite articles.\nIn some cases, there are multiple variants of loanwords, such as / (masculine) and / (neuter).\nLexis.\nA 1988 statistic by Marius Sala is based on 2,581 words chosen on the criteria of frequency, semantic richness and productivity, which also contain words formed on the territory of the Romanian language. This statistic gives the percentages below:\nIf the analysis is restricted to a core vocabulary of 2,500 frequent, semantically rich and productive words, then the Latin inheritance comes first, followed by Romance and classical Latin neologisms, whereas the Slavic borrowings come third.\nAlthough they are rarely used nowadays, the Romanian calendar used to have the traditional Romanian month names, unique to the language.\nThe longest word in Romanian is , with 44 letters, but the longest one admitted by the \"Dic\u021bionarul explicativ al limbii rom\u00e2ne\" (\"Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language\", DEX) is , with 25 letters.\nGrammar.\nRomanian nouns are characterized by gender (feminine, masculine, and neuter), and declined by number (singular and plural) and case (nominative/accusative, dative/genitive and vocative). The articles, as well as most adjectives and pronouns, agree in gender, number and case with the noun they modify.\nRomanian is the only major Romance language where definite articles are enclitic: that is, attached to the end of the noun (as in the Scandinavian Languages, Bulgarian and Albanian), instead of in front (proclitic). They were formed, as in other Romance languages, from the Latin demonstrative pronouns.\nAs in all Romance languages, Romanian verbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, mood, and voice. The usual word order in sentences is subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO). Romanian has four verbal conjugations which further split into ten conjugation patterns. Romanian verbs are conjugated for five moods (indicative, conditional/optative, imperative, subjunctive, and presumptive) and four non-finite forms (infinitive, gerund, supine, and participle).\nPhonology.\nRomanian has seven vowels: , , , , , and . Additionally, and may appear in some borrowed words. Arguably, the diphthongs and are also part of the phoneme set. There are twenty-two consonants. The two approximants and can appear before or after any vowel, creating a large number of glide-vowel sequences which are, strictly speaking, not diphthongs.\nIn final positions after consonants, a short can be deleted, surfacing only as the palatalization of the preceding consonant (e.g., ). Similarly, a deleted may prompt labialization of a preceding consonant, though this has ceased to carry any morphological meaning.\nPhonetic changes.\nOwing to its isolation from the other Romance languages, the phonetic evolution of Romanian was quite different, but the language does share a few changes with Italian, such as \u2192 (Lat. clarus \u2192 Rom. chi\u00e0r, Ital. chiaro, Lat. clamare \u2192 Rom. chemare, Ital. chiamare) and \u2192 (Lat. *glacia (glacies) \u2192 Rom. gh\u00e9a\u021b\u0103, Ital. ghiaccia, ghiaccio, Lat. *ungla (ungula) \u2192 Rom. unghie, Ital. unghia), although this did not go as far as it did in Italian with other similar clusters (Rom. pl\u00e0ce, Ital. piace).\nAnother similarity with Italian is the change from or to or (Lat. pax, pacem \u2192 Rom. and Ital. pace, Lat. dulcem \u2192 Rom. dulce, Ital. dolce, Lat. circus \u2192 Rom. cerc, Ital. circo) and or to or (Lat. gelu \u2192 Rom. g\u00e8r, Ital. gelo, Lat. marginem \u2192 Rom. and Ital. margine, Lat. gemere \u2192 Rom. g\u00e8m (gemere), Ital. gemere).\nThere are also a few changes shared with Dalmatian, such as (probably phonetically ) \u2192 (Lat. cognatus \u2192 Rom. cumnat, Dalm. comnut) and \u2192 in some situations (Lat. coxa \u2192 Rom. c\u00f3ps\u0103, Dalm. copsa).\nAmong the notable phonetic changes are:\n* Lat. cera \u2192 Rom. c\u00e9r\u0103 (wax)\n* Lat. sole \u2192 Rom. s\u00f3re (sun)\n* Lat. herba \u2192 Rom. \u012darb\u0103 (grass, herb)\n* Lat. octo \u2192 Rom. opt (eight)\n* Lat. lingua \u2192 Rom. l\u00ecmb\u0103 (tongue, language)\n* Lat. signum \u2192 Rom. s\u00e8mn (sign)\n* Lat. coxa \u2192 Rom. c\u00f3ps\u0103 (thigh)\n* Lat. aqua \u2192 Rom. ap\u0103 (water)\n* Lat. caelum \u2192 Rom. c\u00e8r (sky)\n* Lat. deus \u2192 Rom. \u1e11\u00e8\u016d \u2192 z\u00e8\u016d (god)\n* Lat. tenem \u2192 Rom. \u021bine (hold)\nRomanian has entirely lost Latin (qu), turning it either into (Lat. quattuor \u2192 Rom. \"p\u00e0tru\", \"four\"; cf. It. \"quattro\") or (Lat. quando \u2192 Rom. \"c\u00e2nd\", \"when\"; Lat. quale \u2192 Rom. \"c\u00e0re\", \"which\").\nWriting system.\nThe first written record about a Romance language spoken in the Middle Ages in the Balkans is from 587. A Vlach muleteer accompanying the Byzantine army noticed that the load was falling from one of the animals and shouted to a companion \"Torna, torna, fratre!\" (meaning \"Return, return, brother!\"). Theophanes Confessor recorded it as part of a 6th-century military expedition by Comentiolus and Priscus against the Avars and Slovenes.\nThe oldest surviving written text in Romanian is a letter from late June 1521, in which Neac\u0219u of C\u00e2mpulung wrote to the mayor of Bra\u0219ov about an imminent attack of the Turks. It was written using the Cyrillic alphabet, like most early Romanian writings. The earliest surviving writing in Latin script was a late 16th-century Transylvanian text which was written with the Hungarian alphabet conventions.\nIn the 18th century, Transylvanian scholars noted the Latin origin of Romanian and adapted the Latin alphabet to the Romanian language, using some orthographic rules from Italian, recognized as Romanian's closest relative. The Cyrillic alphabet remained in (gradually decreasing) use until 1860, when Romanian writing was first officially regulated.\nIn the Soviet Republic of Moldova, the Russian-derived Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet was used until 1989, when the Romanian Latin alphabet was introduced; in the breakaway territory of Transnistria the Cyrillic alphabet remains in use.\nRomanian alphabet.\nThe Romanian alphabet is as follows:\nK, Q, W and Y, are not part of the native alphabet; they were officially introduced in the Romanian alphabet in 1982 and are mostly used to write loanwords like \"kilogram\", \"quasar\", \"watt\", and \"yoga\".\nThe Romanian alphabet is based on the Latin script with five additional letters , , , , . Formerly, there were as many as 12 additional letters, but some of them were abolished in subsequent reforms. Also, until the early 20th century, a breve marker was used, which survives only in \u0103.\nToday the Romanian alphabet is largely phonemic. However, the letters \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00ee\" both represent the same close central unrounded vowel . \"\u00c2\" is used only inside words; \"\u00ee\" is used at the beginning or the end of non-compound words and in the middle of compound words. Another exception from a completely phonetic writing system is the fact that vowels and their respective semivowels are not distinguished in writing. In dictionaries the distinction is marked by separating the entry word into syllables for words containing a hiatus.\nStressed vowels also are not marked in writing, except very rarely in cases where by misplacing the stress a word might change its meaning and if the meaning is not obvious from the context. For example, \"trei cop\u00edi\" means \"three children\" while \"trei c\u00f3pii\" means \"three copies\".\nPunctuation and capitalization.\nUses of punctuation peculiar to Romanian are:\nAcademy spelling recommendations.\nIn 1993, new spelling rules were proposed by the Romanian Academy. In 2000, the Moldovan Academy recommended adopting the same spelling rules, and in 2010 the Academy launched a schedule for the transition to the new rules that was intended to be completed by publications in 2011.\nOn 17 October 2016, the Moldovan minister of education signed Order No. 872, adopting the revised spelling rules as recommended by the Moldovan Academy of Sciences, and giving the following two school years as a transition period. Thus the spelling used by institutions under Moldova's ministry of education has been brought in line with the Romanian Academy's 1993 recommendation. This order, however, did not apply to other government institutions, and Law 3462 of 1989 (which provided for the means of transliterating Cyrillic to Latin) has not been amended to reflect the ministry of education's changes either; thus, most Moldovan government institutions, along with most Moldovans, prefer to use the spelling adopted in 1989 (when the use of Latin script became official).\n \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\"\n\"(Universal Declaration of Human Rights)\"\nExamples of Romanian text.\nThe sentence in contemporary Romanian.

{"id": "25536", "revid": "50584560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25536", "title": "Republic", "text": "Form of government\nA republic, based on the Latin phrase \"res publica\" ('public thing' or 'people's thing'), is a state in which political power rests with the public (people), typically through their representatives\u2014in contrast to a monarchy. Although a republic is most often a single sovereign state, subnational state entities that have governments that are republican in nature may be referred to as republics.\nRepresentation in a republic may or may not be freely elected by the general citizenry. In many historical republics, representation has been based on personal status and the role of elections has been limited. This remains true today; among the 159 states that use \"republic\" in their official names as of 2017[ [update]], and other states formally constituted as republics, are states that narrowly constrain both the right of representation and the process of election.\nThe term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC. This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates from the populace and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority.\nEtymology.\nThe term originates from the Latin translation of Greek word \"politeia\". Cicero, among other Latin writers, translated \"politeia\" into Latin as \"res publica\", and it was in turn translated by Renaissance scholars as \"republic\" (or similar terms in various European languages). The term can literally be translated as 'public matter'. It was used by Roman writers to refer to the state and government, even during the period of the Roman Empire.\nThe term \"politeia\" can be translated as form of government, polity, or regime, and it does not necessarily imply any specific type of regime as the modern word \"republic\" sometimes does. One of Plato's major works on political philosophy, usually known in English as \"The Republic\", was titled \"Politeia\". However, apart from the title, modern translations are generally used. Aristotle was apparently the first classical writer to state that the term \"politeia\" can be used to refer more specifically to one type of \"politeia\", asserting in Book III of his \"Politics\": \"When the citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments (\"to koinon onoma pas\u014dn t\u014dn politei\u014dn\"), government (\"politeia\")\". In later Latin works the term \"republic\" can also be used in a general way to refer to any regime, or to refer specifically to governments which work for the public good.\nIn medieval Northern Italy, a number of city states had commune or signoria based governments. In the late Middle Ages, writers such as Giovanni Villani described these states using terms such as \"libertas populi\", a free people. The terminology changed in the 15th century as the renewed interest in the writings of Ancient Rome caused writers to prefer classical terminology. To describe non-monarchical states, writers (most importantly, Leonardo Bruni) adopted the Latin phrase \"res publica\".\nWhile Bruni and Machiavelli used the term to describe the states of Northern Italy, which were not monarchies, the term \"res publica\" has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin. In subsequent centuries, the English word \"commonwealth\" came to be used as a translation of \"res publica\", and its use in English was comparable to how the Romans used the term \"res publica\". Notably, during The Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell the word \"commonwealth\" was the most common term to call the new monarchless state, but the word \"republic\" was also in common use.\nHistory.\nWhile the philosophical terminology developed in classical Greece and Rome, as already noted by Aristotle there was already a long history of city states with a wide variety of constitutions, not only in Greece but also in the Middle East. After the classical period, during the Middle Ages, many free cities developed again, such as Venice.\nSince the Age of Revolution the term \"republic\" has described a system of government in which the source of authority for the government is a constitution and the legitimacy of its officials derives from the consent of the people rather than heredity or divine right.\nClassical republics.\nThe modern type of republic itself is different from any type of state found in the classical world. Nevertheless, there are a number of states of the classical era that are today still called republics. This includes ancient Athens and the Roman Republic. While the structure and governance of these states was different from that of any modern republic, there is debate about the extent to which classical, medieval, and modern republics form a historical continuum. J. G. A. Pocock has argued that a distinct republican tradition stretches from the classical world to the present. Other scholars disagree. Paul Rahe, for instance, argues that the classical republics had a form of government with few links to those in any modern country.\nThe political philosophy of the classical republics has influenced republican thought throughout the subsequent centuries. Philosophers and politicians advocating republics, such as Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Adams, and Madison, relied heavily on classical Greek and Roman sources which described various types of regimes.\nAristotle's \"Politics\" discusses various forms of government. One form Aristotle named \"politeia\", which consisted of a mixture of the other forms, oligarchy and democracy. He argued that this was one of the ideal forms of government. Polybius expanded on many of these ideas, again focusing on the idea of mixed government and differentiated basic forms of government between \"benign\" monarchy,\u00a0aristocracy, and\u00a0democracy, and the \"malignant\" tyranny,\u00a0oligarchy, and\u00a0ochlocracy. The most important Roman work in this tradition is Cicero's \"De re publica\".\nOver time, the classical republics became empires or were conquered by empires. Most of the Greek republics were annexed to the Macedonian Empire of Alexander. The Roman Republic expanded dramatically, conquering the other states of the Mediterranean that could be considered republics, such as Carthage. The Roman Republic itself then became the Roman Empire.\nOther ancient republics.\nThe term \"republic\" is not commonly used to refer to pre-classical city-states, especially if outside Europe and the area which was under Graeco-Roman influence. However some early states outside Europe had governments that are sometimes today considered similar to republics.\nIn the ancient Near East, a number of cities of the Eastern Mediterranean achieved collective rule. Republic city-states flourished in Phoenicia along the Levantine coast starting from the 11th century BC. In ancient Phoenicia, the concept of Shophet was very similar to a Roman consul. Under Persian rule (539\u2013332 BC), Phoenician city-states such as Tyre abolished the king system and adopted \"a system of the suffetes (judges), who remained in power for short mandates of 6 years\". Arwad has been cited as one of the earliest known examples of a republic, in which the people, rather than a monarch, are described as sovereign. The Israelite confederation of the era of the Judges\nbefore the United Monarchy has also been considered a type of republic. The system of government of the Igbo people in what is now Nigeria has been described as \"direct and participatory democracy\".\nIndian subcontinent.\nEarly republican institutions come from the independent s\u2014 means 'tribe' and means 'assembly'\u2014which may have existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century AD in India. The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period. Diodorus, a Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of Alexander the Great's invasion of India (now Pakistan and northwest India) mentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India. Modern scholars note the word \"democracy\" at the time of the 3rd century BC and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how aristocratic in nature.\nKey characteristics of the seem to include a \"ga\u1e47a mukhya\" (chief), and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority. Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the , the chief apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of \"Kshatriya Varna\". The chief coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles. The Licchavis had a primary governing body of 7,077 \"ga\u1e47a mukhyas\", the heads of the most important families. On the other hand, the Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallakas, and Licchavis, during the period around Gautama Buddha, had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor. Early republics or , such as Mallakas, centered in the city of Kusinagara, and the Vajjika (or V\u1e5bjika) League, centered in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century AD. The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis. The Empire of Magadha included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called \"gramakas\". Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions.\nScholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an aristocracy. Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular. This is reflected in the \"Arthashastra\", an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the \"s\", which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens, indicating that the are more of an aristocratic republic, than democracy.\nIcelandic Commonwealth.\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth was established in 930 AD by refugees from Norway who had fled the unification of that country under King Harald Fairhair. The Commonwealth consisted of a number of clans run by chieftains, and the Althing was a combination of parliament and supreme court where disputes appealed from lower courts were settled, laws were decided, and decisions of national importance were taken. One such example was the Christianisation of Iceland in 1000, where the Althing decreed that all Icelanders must be baptized into Christianity, and forbade celebration of pagan rituals. Contrary to most states, the Icelandic Commonwealth had no official leader.\nIn the early 13th century, the Age of the Sturlungs, the Commonwealth began to suffer from long conflicts between warring clans. This, combined with pressure from the Norwegian king Haakon IV for the Icelanders to rejoin the Norwegian \"family\", led the Icelandic chieftains to accept Haakon IV as king by the signing of the \"Gamli s\u00e1ttm\u00e1li\" (\"Old Covenant\") in 1262. This effectively brought the Commonwealth to an end. The Althing, however, is still Iceland's parliament, almost 800 years later.\nMercantile republics.\nIn Europe new republics appeared in the late Middle Ages when a number of small states embraced republican systems of government. These were generally small, but wealthy, trading states, like the Mediterranean maritime republics and the Hanseatic League, in which the merchant class had risen to prominence. Knud Haakonssen has noted that, by the Renaissance, Europe was divided with those states controlled by a landed elite being monarchies and those controlled by a commercial elite being republics.\nItaly was the most densely populated area of Europe, and also one with the weakest central government. Many of the towns thus gained considerable independence and adopted commune forms of government. Completely free of feudal control, the Italian city-states expanded, gaining control of the rural hinterland. The two most powerful were the Republic of Venice and its rival the Republic of Genoa. Each were large trading ports, and further expanded by using naval power to control large parts of the Mediterranean. It was in Italy that an ideology advocating for republics first developed. Writers such as Bartholomew of Lucca, Brunetto Latini, Marsilius of Padua, and Leonardo Bruni saw the medieval city-states as heirs to the legacy of Greece and Rome.\nAcross Europe a wealthy merchant class developed in the important trading cities. Despite their wealth they had little power in the feudal system dominated by the rural land owners, and across Europe began to advocate for their own privileges and powers. The more centralized states, such as France and England, granted limited city charters.\nIn the more loosely governed Holy Roman Empire, 51 of the largest towns became free imperial cities. While still under the dominion of the Holy Roman Emperor most power was held locally and many adopted republican forms of government. The same rights to imperial immediacy were secured by the major trading cities of Switzerland. The towns and villages of alpine Switzerland had, courtesy of geography, also been largely excluded from central control. Unlike Italy and Germany, much of the rural area was thus not controlled by feudal barons, but by independent farmers who also used communal forms of government. When the Habsburgs tried to reassert control over the region both rural farmers and town merchants joined the rebellion. The Swiss were victorious, and the Swiss Confederacy was proclaimed, and Switzerland has retained a republican form of government to the present.\nTwo Russian cities with a powerful merchant class\u2014Novgorod and Pskov\u2014also adopted republican forms of government in 12th and 13th centuries, respectively, which ended when the republics were conquered by Muscovy/Russia at the end of 15th \u2013 beginning of 16th century.\nFollowing the collapse of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and establishment of the Turkish Anatolian Beyliks, the Ahiler merchant fraternities established a state centered on Ankara that is sometimes compared to the Italian mercantile republics.\nThe dominant form of government for these early republics was control by a limited council of elite patricians. In those areas that held elections, property qualifications or guild membership limited both who could vote and who could run. In many states no direct elections were held and council members were hereditary or appointed by the existing council. This left the great majority of the population without political power, and riots and revolts by the lower classes were common. The late Middle Ages saw more than 200 such risings in the towns of the Holy Roman Empire. Similar revolts occurred in Italy, notably the Ciompi Revolt in Florence.\nCalvinist republics.\nWhile the classical writers had been the primary ideological source for the republics of Italy, in Northern Europe, the Protestant Reformation would be used as justification for establishing new republics. Most important was Calvinist theology, which developed in the Swiss Confederacy, one of the largest and most powerful of the medieval republics. John Calvin did not call for the abolition of monarchy, but he advanced the doctrine that the faithful had the duty to overthrow irreligious monarchs. Advocacy for republics appeared in the writings of the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion.\nCalvinism played an important role in the republican revolts in England and the Netherlands. Like the city-states of Italy and the Hanseatic League, both were important trading centres, with a large merchant class prospering from the trade with the New World. Large parts of the population of both areas also embraced Calvinism. During the Dutch Revolt (beginning in 1566), the Dutch Republic emerged from rejection of Spanish Habsburg rule. However, the country did not adopt the republican form of government immediately: in the formal declaration of independence (Act of Abjuration, 1581), the throne of king Philip was only declared vacant, and the Dutch magistrates asked the Duke of Anjou, queen Elizabeth of England and prince William of Orange, one after another, to replace Philip. It took until 1588 before the Estates (the \"Staten\", the representative assembly at the time) decided to vest the sovereignty of the country in themselves.\nIn 1641 the English Civil War began. Spearheaded by the Puritans and funded by the merchants of London, the revolt was a success, and King Charles I was executed. In England James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and John Milton became some of the first writers to argue for rejecting monarchy and embracing a republican form of government. The English Commonwealth was short-lived, and the monarchy was soon restored. The Dutch Republic continued in name until 1795, but by the mid-18th century the stadtholder had become a \"de facto\" monarch. Calvinists were also some of the earliest settlers of the British and Dutch colonies of North America.\nLiberal republics.\nAlong with these initial republican revolts, early modern Europe also saw a great increase in monarchical power. The era of absolute monarchy replaced the limited and decentralized monarchies that had existed in most of the Middle Ages. It also saw a reaction against the total control of the monarch as a series of writers created the ideology known as liberalism.\nMost of these Enlightenment thinkers were far more interested in ideas of constitutional monarchy than in republics. The Cromwell regime had discredited republicanism, and most thinkers felt that republics ended in either anarchy or tyranny. Thus philosophers like Voltaire opposed absolutism while at the same time being strongly pro-monarchy.\nJean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu praised republics, and looked on the city-states of Greece as a model. However, both also felt that a state like France, with 20 million people, would be impossible to govern as a republic. Rousseau admired the republican experiment in Corsica (1755\u20131769) and described his ideal political structure of small, self-governing communes. Montesquieu felt that a city-state should ideally be a republic, but maintained that a limited monarchy was better suited to a state with a larger territory.\nThe American Revolution began as a rejection only of the authority of the British Parliament over the colonies, not of the monarchy. The failure of the British monarch to protect the colonies from what they considered the infringement of their rights to representative government, the monarch's branding of those requesting redress as traitors, and his support for sending combat troops to demonstrate authority resulted in widespread perception of the British monarchy as tyrannical.\nWith the United States Declaration of Independence the leaders of the revolt firmly rejected the monarchy and embraced republicanism. The leaders of the revolution were well-versed in the writings of the French liberal thinkers, and also in the history of the classical republics. John Adams had notably written a book on republics throughout history. In addition, the widely distributed and popularly read-aloud tract \"Common Sense\", by Thomas Paine, succinctly and eloquently laid out the case for republican ideals and independence to the larger public. The Constitution of the United States, which went into effect in 1789, created a relatively strong federal republic to replace the relatively weak confederation under the first attempt at a national government with the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union ratified in 1781. The first ten amendments to the Constitution called the United States Bill of Rights, guaranteed certain natural rights fundamental to republican ideals that justified the Revolution.\nThe French Revolution was also not republican at its outset. Only after the Flight to Varennes removed most of the remaining sympathy for the king was a republic declared and Louis XVI sent to the guillotine. The stunning success of France in the French Revolutionary Wars saw republics spread by force of arms across much of Europe as a series of client republics were set up across the continent. The rise of Napoleon saw the end of the French First Republic and her Sister Republics, each replaced by \"popular monarchies\". Throughout the Napoleonic period, the victors extinguished many of the oldest republics on the continent, including the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, and the Dutch Republic. They were eventually transformed into monarchies or absorbed into neighboring monarchies.\nOutside Europe, another group of republics was created as the Napoleonic Wars allowed the states of Latin America to gain their independence. Liberal ideology had only a limited impact on these new republics. The main impetus was the local European-descended Creole population in conflict with the Peninsulares\u2014governors sent from overseas. The majority of the population in most of Latin America was of either African or Amerindian descent, and the Creole elite had little interest in giving these groups power and broad-based popular sovereignty. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, both the main instigator of the revolts and one of its most important theorists, was sympathetic to liberal ideals but felt that Latin America lacked the social cohesion for such a system to function and advocated autocracy as necessary.\nIn Mexico, this autocracy briefly took the form of a monarchy in the First Mexican Empire. Due to the Peninsular War, the Portuguese court was relocated to Brazil in 1808. Brazil gained independence as a monarchy on September 7, 1822, and the Empire of Brazil lasted until 1889. In many other Latin American states various forms of autocratic republic existed until most were liberalized at the end of the 20th century.\nThe French Second Republic was created in 1848 but abolished by Napoleon III who proclaimed himself Emperor in 1852. The French Third Republic was established in 1870 when a civil revolutionary committee refused to accept Napoleon III's surrender during the Franco-Prussian War. Spain briefly became the First Spanish Republic in 1873\u201374, but the monarchy was soon restored. By the start of the 20th century France, Switzerland and San Marino remained the only republics in Europe. This changed when, after the 1908 Lisbon Regicide, the 5 October 1910 revolution established the Portuguese Republic.\nIn East Asia, China had seen considerable anti-Qing sentiment during the 19th century, and a number of protest movements developed calling for constitutional monarchy. The most important leader of these efforts was Sun Yat-sen, whose Three Principles of the People combined American, European, and Chinese ideas. Under his leadership, the Republic of China was proclaimed on January 1, 1912.\nRepublican ideas were spreading, especially in Asia. The United States began to have considerable influence in East Asia in the later part of the 19th century, with Protestant missionaries playing a central role. The liberal and republican writers of the West also exerted influence. These combined with native Confucian inspired political philosophy that had long argued that the populace had the right to reject unjust governments that had lost the Mandate of Heaven.\nDuring this period, three short-lived republics were proclaimed in East Asia; the Republic of Ezo, the Republic of Formosa, and the First Philippine Republic.\nRepublicanism expanded significantly in the aftermath of World War I when several of the largest European empires collapsed: the Russian Empire (1917), German Empire (1918), Austro-Hungarian Empire (1918), and Ottoman Empire (1922) were all replaced by republics. New states gained independence during this turmoil, and many of these, such as Ireland, Poland, Finland and Czechoslovakia, chose republican forms of government. Following Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322), the monarchy was briefly replaced by the Second Hellenic Republic (1924\u201335). In 1931, the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic (1931\u201339) resulted in the Spanish Civil War leading to the establishment of a Francoist regime.\nThe aftermath of World War II left Italy with a destroyed economy, a divided society, and anger against the monarchy for its endorsement of the Fascist regime. These frustrations contributed to a revival of the Italian republican movement. King Umberto II was pressured to call the 1946 Italian institutional referendum to decide whether Italy should remain a monarchy or become a republic. The supporters of the republic chose the effigy of the \"Italia turrita\", the national personification of Italy, as their unitary symbol to be used in the electoral campaign and on the referendum ballot on the institutional form of the State, in contrast to the Savoy coat of arms, which represented the monarchy. On June 2, 1946 the republican side won 54.3% of the vote and Italy officially became a republic, a day celebrated since as \"Festa della Repubblica\". Italy has a written democratic constitution, resulting from the work of a Constituent Assembly formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the liberation of Italy.\nDecolonization.\nIn the years following World War II, most of the remaining European colonies gained their independence, and most became republics. The two largest colonial powers were France and the United Kingdom. Republican France encouraged the establishment of republics in its former colonies. The United Kingdom attempted to follow the model it had for its earlier settler colonies of creating independent Commonwealth realms still linked under the same monarch. While most of the settler colonies and the smaller states in the Caribbean and the Pacific retained this system, it was rejected by the newly independent countries in Africa and Asia, which revised their constitutions and became republics instead.\nBritain followed a different model in the Middle East; it installed local monarchies in several colonies and mandates including Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen and Libya. In subsequent decades revolutions and coups overthrew a number of monarchs and installed republics. Several monarchies remain, and the Middle East is the only part of the world where several large states are ruled by monarchs with almost complete political control.\nSocialist republics.\nIn the wake of the First World War, the Russian monarchy fell during the Russian Revolution. The Russian Provisional Government was established in its place on the lines of a liberal republic, but this was overthrown by the Bolsheviks who went on to establish the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). This was the first republic established under Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology. Communism was wholly opposed to monarchy and became an important element of many republican movements during the 20th century. The Russian Revolution spread into Mongolia and overthrew its theocratic monarchy in 1924. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the communists gradually gained control of Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Albania, ensuring that the states were reestablished as socialist republics rather than monarchies.\nCommunism also intermingled with other ideologies. It was embraced by many national liberation movements during decolonization. In Vietnam, communist republicans pushed aside the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, and monarchies in neighbouring Laos and Cambodia were overthrown by communist movements in the 1970s. Arab socialism contributed to a series of revolts and coups that saw the monarchies of Egypt, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen ousted. In Africa, Marxism\u2013Leninism and African socialism led to the end of monarchy and the proclamation of republics in states such as Burundi and Ethiopia.\nConstitution.\nA republic does not necessarily have a constitution but is often constitutional in the sense of constitutionalism, meaning that it is constituted by a set of institutions which provide a separation of powers. The term constitutional republic is a way to highlight an emphasis on the separation of powers in a given republic, as with constitutional monarchy or absolute monarchy highlighting the absolute autocratic character of a monarchy.\nHead of state.\nStructure.\nWith no monarch, most modern republics use the title president for the head of state. Originally used to refer to the presiding officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain the usage was also applied to political leaders, including the leaders of some of the Thirteen Colonies (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the \"President of the Council\". The first republic to adopt the title was the United States of America. Keeping its usage as the head of a committee the President of the Continental Congress was the leader of the original congress. When the new constitution was written the title of President of the United States was conferred on the head of the new executive branch.\nIf the head of state of a republic is also the head of government, this is called a presidential system. There are a number of forms of presidential government. A full-presidential system has a president with substantial authority and a central political role.\nIn other states the legislature is dominant and the presidential role is almost purely ceremonial and apolitical, such as in Germany, Italy, India, and Trinidad and Tobago. These states are parliamentary republics and operate similarly to constitutional monarchies with parliamentary systems where the power of the monarch is also greatly circumscribed. In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power. Semi-presidential systems have a president as an active head of state with important powers, but they also have a prime minister as a head of government with important powers.\nThe rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France, when the members of the ruling cabinet and the president come from opposing political factions, this situation is called cohabitation.\nIn some countries, like Bosnia and Herzegovina, San Marino, and Switzerland, the head of state is not a single person but a committee (council) of several persons holding that office. The Roman Republic had two consuls, elected for a one-year term by the \"comitia centuriata\", consisting of all adult, freeborn males who could prove citizenship.\nElections.\nIn democracies, presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council. Typically in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people or is indirectly elected as done in the United States. In that country, the president is officially elected by an electoral college, chosen by the States. All U.S. States have chosen electors by popular election since 1832. The indirect election of the president through the electoral college conforms to the concept of the republic as one with a system of indirect election. In the opinion of some, direct election confers legitimacy upon the president and gives the office much of its political power. However, this concept of legitimacy differs from that expressed in the United States Constitution which established the legitimacy of the United States president as resulting from the signing of the Constitution by nine states. The idea that direct election is required for legitimacy also contradicts the spirit of the Great Compromise, whose actual result was manifest in the clause that provides voters in smaller states with more representation in presidential selection than those in large states; for example citizens of Wyoming in 2016 had 3.6 times as much electoral vote representation as citizens of California.\nIn states with a parliamentary system, the president is usually elected by the parliament. This indirect election subordinates the president to the parliament, and also gives the president limited legitimacy and turns most presidential powers into reserve powers that can only be exercised under rare circumstances. There are exceptions where elected presidents have only ceremonial powers, such as in Ireland.\nAmbiguities.\nThe distinction between a republic and a monarchy is not always clear. The constitutional monarchies of the former British Empire and Western Europe today have almost all real political power vested in the elected representatives, with the monarchs only holding either theoretical powers, no powers or rarely used reserve powers. Real legitimacy for political decisions comes from the elected representatives and is derived from the will of the people. While hereditary monarchies remain in place, political power is derived from the people as in a republic. These states are thus sometimes referred to as crowned republics.\nTerms such as \"liberal republic\" are also used to describe all of the modern liberal democracies.\nThere are also self-proclaimed republics that act similarly to absolute monarchies with absolute power vested in the leader and passed down from father to son. North Korea and Syria are two notable examples where a son has inherited political control. Neither of these states are officially monarchies. There is no constitutional requirement that power be passed down within one family, but it has occurred in practice.\nThere are also elective monarchies where ultimate power is vested in a monarch, but the monarch is chosen by some manner of election. A current example of such a state is Malaysia where the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected every five years by the Conference of Rulers composed of the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states, and the Vatican City-State, where the pope is selected by cardinal-electors, currently all cardinals under the age of 80. While rare today, elective monarchs were common in the past. The Holy Roman Empire is an important example, where each new emperor was chosen by a group of electors. Islamic states also rarely employed primogeniture, instead relying on various forms of election to choose a monarch's successor.\nThe Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth had an elective monarchy, with a wide suffrage of some 500,000 nobles. The system, known as the Golden Liberty, had developed as a method for powerful landowners to control the crown. The proponents of this system looked to classical examples, and the writings of the Italian Renaissance, and called their elective monarchy a \"rzeczpospolita\", based on \"res publica\".\nSub-national republics.\nIn general being a republic also implies sovereignty as for the state to be ruled by the people it cannot be controlled by a foreign power. There are important exceptions to this, for example, republics in the Soviet Union were member states which had to meet three criteria to be named republics:\nIt is sometimes argued that the former Soviet Union was also a supra-national republic, based on the claim that the member states were different nation states.\nThe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a federal entity composed of six republics (Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia). Each republic had its parliament, government, institute of citizenship, constitution, etc., but certain functions were delegated to the federation (army, monetary matters). Each republic also had a right of self-determination according to the conclusions of the second session of the AVNOJ and according to the federal constitution.\nIn Switzerland, all cantons can be considered to have a republican form of government, with constitutions, legislatures, executives and courts; many of them being originally sovereign states. As a consequence, several Romance-speaking cantons are still officially referred to as republics, reflecting their history and will of independence within the Swiss Confederation. Notable examples are the Republic and Canton of Geneva and the Republic and Canton of Ticino.\nStates of the United States are required, like the federal government, to be republican in form, with final authority resting with the people. This was required because the states were intended to create and enforce most domestic laws, with the exception of areas delegated to the federal government and prohibited to the states. The founders of the country intended most domestic laws to be handled by the states. Requiring the states to be a republic in form was seen as protecting the citizens' rights and preventing a state from becoming a dictatorship or monarchy, and reflected unwillingness on the part of the original 13 states (all independent republics) to unite with other states that were not republics. Additionally, this requirement ensured that only other republics could join the union.\nIn the example of the United States, the original 13 British colonies became independent states after the American Revolution, each having a republican form of government. These independent states initially formed a loose confederation called the United States and then later formed the current United States by ratifying the current U.S. Constitution, creating a union that was a republic. Any state joining the union later was also required to be a republic.\nOther meanings.\nArchaic meaning.\nBefore the 17th Century, the term 'republic' could be used to refer to states of any form of government as long as it was not a tyrannical regime. French philosopher Jean Bodin's definition of the republic was \"the rightly ordered government of a number of families, and of those things which are their common concern, by a sovereign power.\" Oligarchies and monarchies could also be included as they were also organised toward 'public' shared interests. In medieval texts, 'republic' was used to refer to the body of shared interest with the king at its head. For instance, the Holy Roman Empire was also known as the \"Sancta Respublica Romana\", the Holy Roman Republic. The Byzantine Empire also continued calling itself \"the Roman Republic\" as the Byzantines did not regard monarchy as a contradiction to republicanism. Instead, republics were defined as any state based on popular sovereignty and whose institutions were based on shared values.\nDemocracy vs. republic debate.\nIn a republic state, power is held by the people through elected representatives. The head of state is typically elected or nominated by representatives. In a democratic state, power is wielded by the people of the state, typically through a mixture of elected representatives and direct voting, but in theory could happen purely by Direct democracy without elected representatives acting as proxies. Many states are considered a mixture of both ideals, such as a Representative democracy or Democratic republic.\nThe term democracy is sometimes used interchangeably with the term republic, while others have made sharp distinctions between the two for millennia. \"Montesquieu, founder of the modern constitutional state, repeated in his The Spirit of the Laws of 1748 the insight that Aristotle had expressed two millennia earlier, 'Voting by lot is in the nature of democracy; voting by choice is in the nature of aristocracy.'\" Additional critics of elections include Rousseau, Robespierre, and Marat, who said of the new French Republic, \"What use is it to us, that we have broken the aristocracy of the nobles, if that is replaced by the aristocracy of the rich?\"\nPolitical philosophy.\nThe term \"republic\" originated from the writers of the Renaissance as a descriptive term for states that were not monarchies. These writers, such as Machiavelli, also wrote important prescriptive works describing how such governments should function. These ideas of how a government and society should be structured is the basis for an ideology known as classical republicanism or civic humanism. This ideology is based on the Roman Republic and the city states of Ancient Greece and focuses on ideals such as civic virtue, rule of law and mixed government.\nThis understanding of a republic as a form of government distinct from a liberal democracy is one of the main theses of the Cambridge School of historical analysis. This grew out of the work of J. G. A. Pocock who in 1975 argued that a series of scholars had expressed a consistent set of republican ideals. These writers included Machiavelli, Milton, Montesquieu and the founders of the United States of America.\nPocock argued that this was an ideology with a history and principles distinct from liberalism. These ideas were embraced by a number of different writers, including Quentin Skinner, Philip Pettit and Cass Sunstein. These subsequent writers have further explored the history of the idea, and also outlined how a modern republic should function.\nUnited States.\nA distinct set of definitions of the term \"republic\" evolved in the United States, where the term is often equated with \"representative democracy\". This narrower understanding of the term was originally developed by James Madison and notably employed in Federalist Paper No. 10. This meaning was widely adopted early in the history of the United States, including in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828. It was a novel meaning to the term; representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics. There is also evidence that contemporaries of Madison considered the meaning of \"republic\" to reflect the broader definition found elsewhere, as is the case with a quotation of Benjamin Franklin taken from the notes of James McHenry where the question is put forth, \"a Republic or a Monarchy?\".\nThe term republic does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, but it does appear in Article IV of the Constitution, which \"guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government.\" What exactly the writers of the constitution felt this should mean is uncertain. The Supreme Court, in \"Luther v. Borden\" (1849), declared that the definition of \"republic\" was a \"political question\" in which it would not intervene. In two later cases, it did establish a basic definition. In \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), the court ruled that the \"equal rights of citizens\" were inherent to the idea of a republic.\nHowever, the term republic is not synonymous with the republican form. The republican form is defined as one in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to whom those powers are specially delegated.\nBeyond these basic definitions, the word republic has a number of other connotations. W. Paul Adams observes that republic is most often used in the United States as a synonym for \"state\" or \"government\", but with more positive connotations than either of those terms. Republicanism is often referred to as the founding ideology of the United States. Traditionally scholars believed this American republicanism was a derivation of the classical liberal ideologies of John Locke and others developed in Europe.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Bernard Bailyn began to argue that republicanism was just as, or even more important than liberalism in the creation of the United States. This issue is still much disputed and scholars like Isaac Kramnick completely reject this view.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Musically, she is noted for performing upbeat dance-oriented songs that often feature melancholic lyrics. \nHer 1995 debut album \"Robyn Is Here\" produced two \"Billboard\" Hot 100 top 10 singles: \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\" and \"Show Me Love\". Her second and third albums, \"My Truth\" (1999) and \"Don't Stop the Music\" (2002), were released in Sweden.\nRobyn returned to international success with her fourth album, \"Robyn\" (2005), which brought a Grammy Award nomination. The album spawned the singles \"Be Mine!\" and \"With Every Heartbeat\" \u2013 the latter of which topped the charts in the United Kingdom. Robyn released a trilogy of mini-albums in 2010, known as the \"Body Talk\" series. They received broad critical praise and three Grammy Award nominations, and produced three top-10 singles: \"Dancing On My Own\", \"Hang with Me\" and \"Indestructible\". The sleeper hit \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d is often credited as her signature song and helped rejuvenate her career. Robyn followed this with two collaborative EPs: \"Do It Again\" (2014) with R\u00f6yksopp, and \"Love Is Free\" (2015) with La Bagatelle Magique. She released her eighth solo album, \"Honey\", in 2018 to widespread acclaim.\nEarly life.\nRobin Miriam Carlsson was born on 12 June 1979 in Stockholm. Robyn's parents led an independent theatre group, and growing up in that environment influenced her sense of style: \"I was around people who dressed up for work every day, and so the concept of how you can use clothes to change your personality or communicate who you are is very interesting to me.\" Robyn has two younger siblings.\nCareer.\n1989\u20131993: Early career.\nRobyn voiced the character of Miranda in the 1989 Swedish-Norwegian animated film \"The Journey to Melonia\". Directed by Per \u00c5hlin, the film is loosely based on William Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\".\nRobyn recorded \"Du kan alltid bli nummer ett\" (\"You Can Always be Number One\"), the theme song for the Swedish television show \"Lilla Sportspegeln\", in 1991 at age 12. Robyn performed her first original song at that age on another television show, \"S\u00f6ndags\u00f6ppet\" (\"Sundays\"). She was discovered by Swedish pop singer Meja in the early 1990s when Meja and her band, Legacy of Sound, visited Robyn's school as part of a musical workshop. Impressed by Robyn's performance, Meja contacted her management and a meeting was arranged with Robyn and her parents. At age 14, after completing middle school education in 1993, Robyn signed with Ricochet Records Sweden (which was acquired by BMG in 1994). Robyn collaborated with producers Max Martin and Denniz Pop, who gave the singer a gritty (but popular) sound.\n1994\u20132004: \"Robyn Is Here\", \"My Truth\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\".\nShe began her pop-music career at age 15, signing with RCA Records in 1994 and releasing her debut single (\"You've Got That Somethin'\") in Sweden. Later that year, Robyn's Swedish breakthrough came with the single \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\". The singles became part of the album \"Robyn Is Here\", which was released in October 1995. Robyn also contributed vocals to Blacknuss' 1996 single, \"Roll with Me.\" She entered Sweden's pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 1997 as co-writer and producer of \"Du g\u00f6r mig hel igen\" (\"You Make Me Whole Again\"), which was performed by Cajsalisa Ejemyr. In Melodifestivalen 1997, the song finished fourth.\nRobyn's US breakthrough came in late 1997, when the dance-pop/R&amp;B singles \"Show Me Love\" and \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\" reached the top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. She performed \"Show Me Love\" on the American children's show \"All That\" that year, and the songs also performed well in the UK. Robyn re-released \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\" internationally, but it was less successful than the other releases. It was ineligible for the US charts because there was no retail single available, but it reached number 32 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. \"Show Me Love\" was featured in the 1998 Lukas Moodysson film, \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\", and the song's title was used as the title of the film in English-speaking countries. As Robyn's popularity grew internationally, she was diagnosed with exhaustion and returned to Sweden to recover.\nRobyn's second album, \"My Truth\", was released in Sweden in May 1999 and subsequently in Europe. The single, \"Electric\", was a commercial success and propelled \"My Truth\" to the number-two position in Sweden. The autobiographical album included the tracks \"Universal Woman\" and \"Giving You Back\". Despite her US success with \"Robyn Is Here\", \"My Truth\" was not released in that country, partly because it included two songs which referenced an abortion she had in her teens. Robyn contributed to Christian Falk's 1999 debut solo album, \"Quel Bordel\" (\"What a Mess\"), appearing on \"Remember\" and \"Celebration\". The following year, she appeared on \"Intro/Fristil\" on Petter's self-titled album. In 2001, Robyn performed \"Say You'll Walk the Distance\" for the soundtrack of \"On the Line\".\nShe signed a worldwide deal with Jive Records in July 2001, moving from BMG after the singer was \"disillusioned with the lack of artistic control [she] had there\"; a year later, Jive was acquired by BMG when it bought Zomba Records. Robyn later said, \"I was back where I started!\" In October 2002, she released the album \"Don't Stop the Music\" in Sweden. The album's singles, \"Keep This Fire Burning\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\", received airplay in Scandinavia and elsewhere in Europe. The title track was later covered by the Swedish girl group Play, and the lead single (\"Keep This Fire Burning\") was covered by the British soul singer Beverley Knight. In May 2004, \"Robyn's Best\" was released in the US. It was a condensed version of her debut album, with no material from her later releases. In 2006, after her departure from BMG, \"Det B\u00e4sta Med Robyn\" (\"The Best of Robyn\") was released in Sweden with material from her first three albums; notable omissions, however, were the singles \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Keep This Fire Burning\".\n2004\u20132009: Konichiwa Records and \"Robyn\".\nThe decade-long relationship between Robyn and her label ended in 2004. When Jive Records reacted negatively to \"Who's That Girl?\"'s new electropop sound, the singer decided to release music on her own. In early 2005, she announced that she was leaving Jive to start her own label. Konichiwa Records was created to liberate Robyn artistically. She said on her website that her new album would be released earlier than anticipated, with notable collaborators including Klas \u00c5hlund from Teddybears STHLM, Swedish duo The Knife and former Cheiron Studios producer Alexander Kronlund.\nRobyn released the single \"Be Mine!\" in March 2005. Her fourth album, \"Robyn\", was her first number-one album in Sweden when it was released a month later. Influenced by electronica, rap, R&amp;B and new-age music, \"Robyn\" was critically praised and earned the singer three 2006 Swedish Grammy Awards: \"\u00c5rets Album\" (Best Album), \"\u00c5rets Komposit\u00f6r\" (Best Writer, with Klas \u00c5hlund) and \"\u00c5rets Pop Kvinnlig\" (Best Pop Female). The album evoked global interest in Robyn, who was recognized for co-writing the song \"Money for Nothing\" for Darin Zanyar (his debut single). She released three more singles\u2014\"Who's That Girl?\", \"Handle Me\" and \"Crash and Burn Girl\"\u2014from the eponymous LP, which was popular in Sweden. Robyn appeared on the Basement Jaxx track \"Hey U\" from their 2006 album, \"Crazy Itch Radio\", and contributed \"Dream On\" and \"C.C.C\" to Christian Falk's \"People Say\" (his second album) that year. In December 2006, Robyn released \"The Rakamonie EP\" in the UK as a preview of her more-recent material; this was followed by the March 2007 release of \"Konichiwa Bitches\". A revised edition of \"Robyn\" was released in the UK the following month, with two new tracks\u2014\"With Every Heartbeat\" (a collaboration with Kleerup) and \"Cobrastyle\" (a cover of a 2006 single by Swedish rockers Teddybears)\u2014with slightly altered versions of the original music.\nThe second single from the release in the United Kingdom was \"With Every Heartbeat\" with Kleerup, which was released in late July 2007 and topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming the second single by Swedish artists to top the charts in Britain during the 2000s decade after Eric Prydz's \"Call on Me\" in September and October 2004. Robyn appeared on Jo Whiley's BBC Radio 1 showcase show, \"Live Lounge\". In Australia, where \"Robyn\" reached the top ten of the iTunes Store's album chart, \"With Every Heartbeat\" received attention on radio and video networks. Robyn contributed vocals to Fleshquartet's single, \"This One's for You\", from their \"Voices of Eden\" album that year. Konichiwa Records signed an international licensing deal with Universal Music Group to distribute Robyn's music globally, and her UK recordings are released by Island Records. \"The Rakamonie EP\" was released in January 2008 by Cherrytree Records (a subsidiary of Interscope Records), and the US version of \"Robyn\" was released in April of that year. \"With Every Heartbeat\", \"Handle Me\" and \"Cobrastyle\" were top-10 club singles, and \"With Every Heartbeat\" received airplay on US pop and dance radio stations. Robyn provided backing vocals on Britney Spears' 2007 single, \"Piece of Me\", and appeared on the Fyre Department remix of \"Sexual Eruption\" by rapper Snoop Dogg. She made a brief US tour to promote \"Robyn\", and was the supporting act for Madonna's Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour on European dates in 2008. In January 2009, Robyn received a 2008 Swedish Grammis Award for Best Live Act.\n2010\u20132016: \"Body Talk\", \"Do It Again\" and EPs.\nShe released the first album of the \"Body Talk\" trilogy, \"Body Talk Pt. 1\", on 14 June 2010 in the Nordic countries on EMI and on 15 June in the US on Interscope Records. It was preceded by the single \"Dancing On My Own\" on 1 June 2010. The song was Robyn's first number-one single in Sweden and her fourth top-10 single in the UK and the US, peaking at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and number three on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In July 2010, she sang a minimalist, electro cover version of Alicia Keys' \"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\" live on IHeartRadio. Robyn made the All Hearts Tour in July and August 2010 with American singer Kelis to promote the \"Body Talk\" albums, and a four-date UK tour at the end of October.\nOn 6 September 2010, \"Body Talk Pt. 2\" was released in the UK. It was preceded by the lead single, a dance version of \"Hang with Me\" from \"Body Talk Pt. 1\", the day before. The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, \"U Should Know Better\". Robyn performed \"Dancing On My Own\" with Deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC \"Newsbeat\" interview, she explained her decision to release three albums in one year: \"It was just something I felt like I needed to do. I just never thought about selling records or not, making this decision. I just did it for myself. It's a way of, for me, to stay inspired and to be able to do the things I like to do\". However, Robyn said that she would not do it again: \"When you do 16 or 13 songs in one go, you kind of empty yourself, and it takes a while to fill back up and have new things to talk about, so I think it's good for everyone\". Robyn announced the release of the single, \"Indestructible\", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on \"Body Talk Pt. 2\". The song was released on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK. Co-written by Klas \u00c5hlund, it was described as a \"pulsating full power version [that] takes every ounce of that emotion and wraps it up in another exceptional disco-pop record worthy of any dance-floor or passion-laden sing-a-long.\" Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song \"Time Machine\"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles, \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\" and \"Show Me Love\", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" 100 in 1997. The \"Body Talk\" albums have sold 91,000 copies in the US.\nRobyn guest-starred on \"War at the Roses\", a 2010 episode of \"Gossip Girl\", where she performed an acoustic version of \"Hang with Me\"; \"Dancing On My Own\" was featured at the end of the episode. In November, she said she would return to the studio in January 2011 with enough material to release a new album later that year. Robyn opened for Coldplay on their 2012 tour in Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Miami, Atlanta, Charlotte, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. In mid-2013, she appeared with Paul Rudd and Sean Combs on \"Go Kindergarten\" from the Lonely Island's \"The Wack Album\". Robyn posted two videos of the Snoop Dogg collaboration (\"U Should Know Better\" and \"Behind the Scenes\") and a game, \"Mixory\", on 21 and 22 June 2013. That year she received the Stockholm KTH Royal Institute of Technology Great Prize for \"artistic contributions and embrace of technology\", worth 1.2\u00a0million Swedish kronor (around \u00a3117,000 at the time), which she planned to donate to a cause of her choice.\nRobyn sang on Neneh Cherry's \"Out of the Black\", from Cherry's album \"Blank Project\", in 2014. She also announced the Do It Again Tour with R\u00f6yksopp and a collaborative mini-album, \"Do It Again\", that year. The tour ended prematurely after the death of Robyn's longtime friend and collaborator, Christian Falk. An EP of their final collaboration, \"Love Is Free\", was released soon afterwards. Robyn appeared at the Popaganda Festival in Sweden the following year and performed songs written with Falk before she postponed subsequent performances because she was still grieving.\nShe premiered a dance set of remixed versions of her songs at the May 2016 Boston Calling Music Festival, with plans for more dates during the year. Robyn released \"Trust Me\", a collaboration EP with Mr. Tophat, in November 2016. She appeared on \"That Could Have Been Me\", a track from Todd Rundgren's album \"White Knight\", the following year.\n2017\u20132019: \"Honey\".\nIn March 2017, a new Robyn song called \"Honey\" was used in the soundtrack of the final season of HBO TV series, \"Girls\". The creator of the show, Lena Dunham selected it from a collection of her in-progress tracks. Robyn finalized it specially for the series.\nIn February 2018, Robyn answered a fan on Twitter, that she will release her new album \"some time this year\". During an interview with Kindness, she revealed she was almost done with her new album. Afterwards, at a party, she debuted the full version of her new song \"Honey\". On 23 July, a new song entitled \"Missing U\" was enlisted as a single, and later taken down. Fans quickly began noticing the hints she was dropping, including a post on Twitter with the hashtag #MissingU. It was released on 1 August 2018.\nOn 1 August 2018, Robyn presented \"Missing U\" on Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show. There she talked about the long silence and the process of making the upcoming album to be released before 2018's end. Robyn also released a mini-documentary featuring the song and a tribute to her fans who were missing her and her new music for years. On 19 September 2018, Robyn announced her upcoming album is titled \"Honey\" to be released on 26 October 2018. In November 2018, Robyn announced she would be touring across North America and Europe come 2019. The trek kicked off on 5 February 2019 and ended that April. On 27 September 2019, she performed in Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden in Stockholm during the international climate strikes. Before singing \"Ever Again\", she also told the audience she had met climate researcher Johan Rockstr\u00f6m.\n2020\u2013present: DJ sets, signing to Young Artists and further musical projects.\nIn February 2020, Robyn accepted the award for Songwriter of the Decade at the 2020 NME Awards. After cancelled promotion, gigs, and festivals starting that year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Robyn launched a series of live-stream DJ sets from Stockholm, \"Robyn Presents Club DOMO\", and also participated in Record Store Day with a series of previously unreleased remixes of tracks from her record \"Honey\" for limited-release vinyl then streaming by her favorite DJs, artists and collaborators, including Joe Goddard, Avalon Emerson, Robert Hood, Louie Vega, Soulwax, Kim Ann Foxman, Young Marco, The Blessed Madonna, Patrick Topping and Planningtorock. The next two years Robyn collaborated on SG Lewis and TEED's electropop track \"Impact\" with Channel Tres for the former's album \"Times\", J\u00f3nsi's avant-pop track \"Salt Licorice\" produced by A.G. Cook for the former's album \"Shiver\", and Joakim \u00c5hlund and Bj\u00f6rn Yttling's revived side project \"Smile\"'s psychedelic pop track \"Call My Name\" for their album \"Phantom Island\".\nIn September 2021, \"Rolling Stone\", from a poll of more than 250 artists, musicians, producers, critics, journalists and industry figures, ranked \"Dancing On My Own\" at number 20, between Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" and John Lennon's \"Imagine\", on their reissued list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", the decade's highest entry on their list. Also that month Robyn signed a management contract with Young Artists, the global division of Young (a music and arts organization founded in London) that still maintained her record label and distribution agreements apart from their own. In November 2021, Robyn received an Honorary Award for her \"significant contributions\" to the music industry from the Swedish Music Publishers Board who went on to say that she had \"forever written herself into music history\".\nIn 2025, Robyn was part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of \"Saturday Night Live\". On 14 February 2025 she performed \"Dancing On My Own\" and Talking Heads' \"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\" with David Byrne on \"\", while also attending the show's 50th Anniversary Special. She had performed as a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" on December 10, 2011.\nIn September 2025, producer Klas \u00c5hlund revealed that he and Robyn had completed a new album and on 12 November 2025 Robyn released the single 'Dopamine', her first new music in seven years.\nArtistry.\nRobyn has a soprano vocal range. The \"Dallas Observer\"'s Preston Jones described her music as \"electro-pop confections, with their gleaming, sexy, sophisticated surfaces, each laced with sharply observed lyrics capable of leaving a bruise or breaking your heart\", and characterized by \"lovelorn lyrics or her synth-sweetened hooks\". Alex Morris of \"Rolling Stone\" described \"the euphoria of heartbreak\" as a unifying theme underlying most of her albums, while \"The Daily Telegraph\"'s Alice Vincent said \"Her ability to translate the searing, antisocial brutality of heartbreak became a balm for millions\". Robyn debuted as a mainstream pop-R&amp;B singer during the 1990s, but felt limited by the artistic constraints of working for a major record label. Andrew R. Cho of NBCNews.com described her earlier work as \"cookie cutter 1990s R&amp;B out of the TLC playbook\". By the time she reinvented herself as an independent artist in 2005, she had pivoted away from R&amp;B and adopted an experimental electronic and synth-pop sound. Her fourth album, \"Robyn\", retained some influences of American R&amp;B and hip hop, but \"largely stuck to the sound and feel of electronic gadgets, manipulating them to sound like other genres\".\nWriter and musician Sasha Frere-Jones called Robyn \"remarkably adept at producing pleasurable, accessible pop that, like some kind of graphite alloy, is light but strong, able to carry humor and emotional weight\". Her lyrics sometimes reference female empowerment and independence; Frere-Jones said her \"wheelhouse is a classic subset of the dance song: a number that moves ahead quickly, with juicy chord changes, while the lyrics crack open with pain\". According to Jake Hall of i-D, the term \"sad banger\" has become virtually synonymous with Robyn since she released \"Dancing on My Own\".\nWhile writing her eighth studio album, \"Honey\", Robyn found that she was no longer interested in creating \"tidy pop songs\", exploring music she described as hypnotic \"that didn't have a beginning and an end\" unlike her previous work. She attributed this shift in approach to lacking the \"killer instinct\" to attempt to replicate her hits. Laura Snapes of \"The Guardian\" described the album as \"exploratory dance music that reflects the hopelessness and ecstasy that informed her time away from the spotlight\". Robyn has said she that she prefers writing with other artists instead of independently, but finds it frustrating that people expect her as a woman \"to have written the lyrics and the guys to have made the music\". Her collaborators have said that she \"was as involved in the technical work as they were\". Caryn Ganz of \"The New York Times\" called her writing process \"designed to wring out truths\", while songwriter and producer Klas \u00c5hlund called it a series of \"intimate, open and sort of confessional conversations\", in which they would share details they wouldn't with others.\nLegacy.\nVarious publications have nicknamed Robyn the \"Queen of Sad Bangers\", as well as the \"Queen of Heartbreak\". Robyn's debut, \"Robyn Is Here\", was instrumental in helping launch Max Martin's career in pop music, and creating demand for \"white girl R&amp;B singers, from Mandy Moore to Billie Piper.\" When Robyn turned down Jive Records' attempt to sign her in the United States, the label shifted their focus to a young artist named Britney Spears, with the head of Jive calling Spears \"an American Robyn \u2013 a Europop teen queen, with an added dash of 'girl next door.'\" Martin ended up producing much of Spears's debut album \"...Baby One More Time\", and she was seen as \"easier to control than the 'forceful' Swedish teenager.\"\n\"Robyn\" (2005) has been cited as a foundational pop album of the 2000s, cementing the validity of \"poptimism\" in music critics circles that \"[made] indie nerds lighten up.\" It gained significant acclaim from indie magazine \"Pitchfork\", which had only covered a few pop albums prior. Their acclaim \"placed synthpop on the same level as earnest, artsy acts such as Arcade Fire and Sufjan Stevens.\" She was seen as \"a bellwether for rock getting less rigid in introducing non-guitar sounds and for pop music becoming more dance-driven and experimental.\"\nRobyn helped shape contemporary pop music by taking creative control, introducing indie elements to mainstream pop, and including feminist and other political themes in her music long before it became acceptable for popstars to do so. \"Variety\" attributed her work as a \"savant\" and \"pioneer\" upon going independent to the accelerated prominence of the alternative pop genre starting in the late 2000s. According to El Hunt of \"NME\", the \"Body Talk\" project \"paved the way for more experimental, alternatively-minded pop stars to find a place in the landscape in years to come\" and pioneered \"a different kind of pop\".\nAccording to friend and collaborator Joseph Mount, after the singer's come back in the mid-2000s, there was \"more than one Robyn-style track on every pop person's record\". According to Alexandra Pollard of \"The Independent\", \"Ask any young pop singer today who their biggest influence is and chances are they'll have mentioned Robyn\". She has been recognized as an important influence by Carly Rae Jepsen, Lorde, Charli XCX, Taylor Swift, Christine and the Queens, Andy McCluskey, Ariel Rechtshaid and Perfume Genius. While accepting her British Dance Act award at the Brit Awards 2025, Charli XCX shouted Robyn out in her speech, among other dance acts she had been influenced by. Robyn's \"triumph in rejection\" has led to her status as an LGBTQ icon.\nPublications such as \"The Guardian\" and \"Rolling Stone\" have called Robyn one of the most influential pop artists of her generation, whereas \"Billboard\" declared her \"one of the most critically lauded pop artists of the century\". \"NPR\"'s Jessica Hopper deemed Robyn \"The 21st Century's Pop Oracle\", while \"The New York Times\"' Caryn Ganz called her \"Pop's Glittery Rebel\".\nPersonal life.\nRobyn began dating Olof Inger in 2002, and they were engaged until 2011. She later became engaged to videographer Max Vitali, referring to him in a 2013 interview with \"Collection of Style\" magazine as her fianc\u00e9: \"We became friends when we made the video for 'Be Mine', and now we work together a lot. He made all the videos for the last album.\" She and Vitali separated for a period of time following the release of \"Body Talk\", but had reconciled by 2018. In July 2023, she said she had a son.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

An RFC is authored by individuals or groups of engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or to convey new concepts, information, or, occasionally, engineering humor.\nThe IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFCs as Internet Standards. However, many RFCs are informational or experimental in nature and are not standards. The RFC system was invented by Steve Crocker in 1969 to help record unofficial notes on the development of ARPANET. RFCs have since become official documents of Internet specifications, communications protocols, procedures, and events. According to Crocker, the documents \"shape the Internet's inner workings and have played a significant role in its success,\" but are not widely known outside the community.\nOutside of the Internet community, other documents also called \"requests for comments\" have been published, as in U.S. Federal government work, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nHistory.\nThe inception of the RFC format occurred in 1969 as part of the seminal ARPANET project. Today, it is the official publication channel for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and\u00a0\u2013 to some extent\u00a0\u2013 the global community of computer network researchers in general.\nThe authors of the first RFCs typewrote their work and circulated hard copies among the ARPA researchers. Unlike the modern RFCs, many of the early RFCs were actual Requests for Comments and were titled as such to avoid sounding too declarative and to encourage discussion. The RFC leaves questions open and is written in a less formal style. This less formal style is now typical of Internet Draft documents, the precursor step before being approved as an RFC.\nIn December 1969, researchers began distributing new RFCs via the newly operational ARPANET. , titled \"Host Software\", was written by Steve Crocker of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and published on April 7, 1969. Although written by Steve Crocker, the RFC had emerged from an early working group discussion between Steve Crocker, Steve Carr, and Jeff Rulifson.\nIn , which first defined the RFC series, Crocker started attributing the RFC series to the Network Working Group. Rather than being a formal committee, it was a loose association of researchers interested in the ARPANET project. In effect, it included anyone who wanted to join the meetings and discussions about the project.\nMany of the subsequent RFCs of the 1970s also came from UCLA, because UCLA is one of the first of what were Interface Message Processors (IMPs) on ARPANET. The Augmentation Research Center (ARC) at Stanford Research Institute, directed by Douglas Engelbart, is another of the four first of what were ARPANET nodes and the source of early RFCs. The ARC became the first network information center (InterNIC), which was managed by Elizabeth J. Feinler to distribute the RFCs along with other network information.\nOn April Fools' Day 1978, was published as a parody of the TCP/IP documentation style. This resumed in 1989 with the publication of , which describes an option for telnet clients to display subliminal messages. Subsequent April Fools' Day RFCs have been published annually since then, notably which describes the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol and defines the HTTP 418 \"I'm a teapot\" status. Humorous RFCs date back to , published in January 1973.\nRFC Editor function.\nFrom 1969 until 1998, Jon Postel served as the RFC editor. On his death in 1998, his obituary was published as .\nFollowing the expiration of the original ARPANET contract with the U.S. federal government, the Internet Society, acting on behalf of the IETF, contracted with the Networking Division of the University of Southern California (USC) Information Sciences Institute (ISI) to assume the editorship and publishing responsibilities under the direction of the IAB. \nSandy Ginoza joined USC/ISI in 1999 to work on RFC editing, and Alice Hagens in 2005. Bob Braden took over the role of RFC project lead, while Joyce K. Reynolds continued to be part of the team until October 13, 2006.\nIn July 2007, \"streams\" of RFCs were defined, so that the editing duties could be divided. IETF documents came from IETF working groups or submissions sponsored by an IETF area director from the Internet Engineering Steering Group. The IAB can publish its own documents. A research stream of documents comes from the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and an independent stream from other outside sources. A new model was proposed in 2008, refined, and published in August 2009, splitting the task into several roles, including the RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG). The model was updated in 2012, and 2020.\nThe streams were also refined in December 2009, with standards defined for their style.\nIn January 2010, the RFC Editor function was moved to a contractor, Association Management Solutions, with Glenn Kowack serving as interim series editor. In late 2011, Heather Flanagan was hired as the permanent RFC Series Editor (RSE). Also at that time, an RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) was created.\nIn 2020, the IAB convened the RFC Editor Future Development program to discuss potential changes to the RFC Editor model. The results of the program were included the RFC Editor Model (Version 3) as defined in , published in June 2022. Generally, the new model is intended to clarify responsibilities and processes for defining and implementing policies related to the RFC series and the RFC Editor function. Changes in the new model included establishing the position of the RFC Consulting Editor, the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), and the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB). It also established a new Editorial Stream for the RFC Series and concluded the RSOC. The role of the RSE was changed to the RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE). In September 2022, Alexis Rossi was appointed to that position.\nNew publishing format.\nRequests for Comments were originally produced in non-reflowable text format. In August 2019, the format was changed so that new documents can be viewed optimally in devices with varying display sizes.\nProduction and versioning.\nThe RFC Editor assigns each RFC a serial number. Once assigned a number and published, an RFC is never rescinded or modified; if the document requires amendments, the authors publish a revised document. Therefore, some RFCs supersede others; the superseded RFCs are said to be \"deprecated\", \"obsolete\", or \"obsoleted by\" the superseding RFC. Together, the serialized RFCs compose a continuous historical record of the evolution of Internet standards and practices. The RFC process is documented in (\"The Internet Standards Process, Revision 3\").\nThe RFC production process differs from the standardization process of formal standards organizations such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Internet technology experts may submit an Internet Draft without support from an external institution. Standards-track RFCs are published with approval from the IETF, and are usually produced by experts participating in IETF Working Groups, which first publish an Internet Draft. This approach facilitates initial rounds of peer review before documents mature into RFCs.\nThe RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact standards authorship accomplished by individuals or small working groups can have important advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process typical of ISO and national standards bodies.\nMost RFCs use a common set of terms such as \"MUST\" and \"NOT RECOMMENDED\" (as defined by ), augmented Backus\u2013Naur form (ABNF) () as a meta-language, and simple text-based formatting, in order to keep the RFCs consistent and easy to understand.\nSub-series.\nThe RFC series contains three sub-series for IETF RFCs: BCP, FYI, and STD. Best Current Practice (BCP) is a sub-series of mandatory IETF RFCs not on standards track. For Your Information (FYI) is a sub-series of informational RFCs promoted by the IETF as specified in (FYI\u00a01). In 2011, obsoleted FYI\u00a01 and concluded this sub-series. Standard (STD) used to be the third and highest maturity level of the IETF standards track specified in (BCP\u00a09). In 2011 (a new part of BCP\u00a09) reduced the standards track to two maturity levels.\nStreams.\nThere are five streams of RFCs: IETF, IRTF, IAB, \"independent submission\", and \"Editorial\". Only the IETF creates BCPs and RFCs on the standards track. The IAB publishes informational documents relating to policy or architecture. The IRTF publishes the results of research, either as informational documents or as experiments. Independent submissions are published\nat the discretion of the Independent Submissions Editor. Non-IETF documents are reviewed by the IESG for conflicts with IETF work. IRTF and \"independent\u00a0\" RFCs generally contain relevant information or experiments for the Internet at large not in conflict with IETF work. compare . The Editorial Stream is used to effect editorial policy changes across the RFC series (see ).\nObtaining RFCs.\nThe official source for RFCs on the World Wide Web is the RFC Datatracker. Almost any published RFC can be retrieved via a URL of the form https:&lt;wbr /&gt;//datatracker&lt;wbr /&gt;.ietf&lt;wbr /&gt;.org&lt;wbr /&gt;/doc&lt;wbr /&gt;/html&lt;wbr /&gt;/rfc5000, shown for .\nEvery RFC is submitted as plain ASCII text and is published in that form, but may also be available in other formats.\nFor easy access to the metadata of an RFC, including abstract, keywords, author(s), publication date, errata, status, and especially later updates, the RFC Editor site offers a search form with many features. A redirection sets some efficient parameters, example: rfc:5000.\nThe official International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) of the RFC series is 2070-1721.\nStatus.\nNot all RFCs are standards.\nEach RFC is assigned a designation with regard to status within the Internet standardization process. This status is one of the following: \"Informational\", \"Experimental\", \"Best Current Practice\", \"Standards Track\", or \"Historic\".\nOnce submitted, accepted, and published, an RFC cannot be changed. Errata may be submitted, which are published separately. More significant changes require a new submission which will receive a new serial number.\nStandards Track.\nStandards track documents are further divided into \"Proposed Standard\" and \"Internet Standard\" documents.\nOnly the IETF, represented by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), can approve standards-track RFCs.\nIf an RFC becomes an Internet Standard (STD), it is assigned an STD number but retains its RFC number. The definitive list of Internet Standards is the Official Internet Protocol Standards. Previously STD 1 used to maintain a snapshot of the list.\nWhen an Internet Standard is updated, its STD number stays the same, now referring to a new RFC or set of RFCs. A given Internet Standard, STD \"n\", may be RFCs \"x\" and \"y\" at a given time, but later the same standard may be updated to be RFC \"z\" instead. For example, in 2007 was an Internet Standard\u2014STD 1\u2014and in May 2008 it was replaced with , so changed to \"Historic\", became an Internet Standard, and as of \u00a02008[ [update]] STD 1 is . as of \u00a02013[ [update]] is replaced by , updating to no longer use STD 1.\n(Best Current Practices work in a similar fashion; BCP \"n\" refers to a certain RFC or set of RFCs, but which RFC or RFCs may change over time).\nInformational.\nAn informational RFC can be nearly anything from April 1 jokes to widely recognized essential RFCs like Domain Name System Structure and Delegation (). Some informational RFCs formed the FYI sub-series.\nExperimental.\nAn experimental RFC can be an IETF document or an individual submission to the RFC Editor. A draft is designated experimental if it is unclear the proposal will work as intended or unclear if the proposal will be widely adopted. An experimental RFC may be promoted to standards track if it becomes popular and works well.\nBest Current Practice.\nThe Best Current Practice subseries collects administrative documents and other texts which are considered as official rules and not only \"informational\", but which do not affect \"over the wire data\". The border between standards track and BCP is often unclear. If a document only affects the Internet Standards Process, like BCP 9, or IETF administration, it is clearly a BCP. If it only defines rules and regulations for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) registries it is less clear; most of these documents are BCPs, but some are on the standards track.\nThe BCP series also covers technical recommendations for how to practice Internet standards; for instance, the recommendation to use source filtering to make DoS attacks more difficult (: \"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing\") is //.\nHistoric.\nA \"historic\" RFC is one that the technology defined by the RFC is no longer recommended for use, which differs from \"Obsoletes\" header in a replacement RFC. For example, (SMTP) itself is obsoleted by various newer RFCs, but SMTP itself is still \"current technology\", so it is not in \"Historic\" status. However, since BGP version 4 has entirely superseded earlier BGP versions, the RFCs describing those earlier versions, such as , have been designated historic.\nUnknown.\nStatus \"unknown\" is used for some very old RFCs, where it is unclear which status the document would get if it were published today. Some of these RFCs would not be published at all today; an early RFC was often just that: a simple Request for Comments, not intended to specify a protocol, administrative procedure, or anything else for which the RFC series is used today.\nCopyright.\nThe general rule is that original authors (or their employers, if their employment conditions so stipulate) retain copyright unless they make an explicit transfer of their rights.\nAn independent body, the IETF Trust, holds the copyright for some RFCs and for all others it is granted a license by the authors that allows it to reproduce RFCs. The Internet Society is referenced on many RFCs prior to RFC4714 as the copyright owner, but it transferred its rights to the IETF Trust.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The instrumentals primarily consist of electronic music with heavy use of sampling.\nWayne Smith's \"Under Mi Sleng Teng\", produced by King Jammy in 1985 on a Casio MT-40 synthesizer, is a seminal ragga song. \"Sleng Teng\" boosted Jammy's popularity immensely, and other producers quickly released their own versions of the riddim, accompanied by dozens of different vocalists.\nOrigins.\nRagga originated in Jamaica during the 1980s, at the same time that electronic dance music's popularity was increasing globally. It differs marginally from its dancehall predecessor \"other than a slightly more aggressive attitude, and an alignment with the kind of concerns of its youthful audience\". Ragga spread to Europe, North America, and Africa, eventually spreading to Japan, India, and the rest of the world. Ragga heavily influenced early jungle music, and also spawned the syncretistic bhangragga style when fused with bhangra. In the 1990s, ragga and breakcore music fused, creating a style known as raggacore.\nThe term \"raggamuffin\" is an intentional misspelling of \"ragamuffin\", a word that entered the Jamaican Patois lexicon after the British Empire colonized Jamaica in the 17th century. Despite the British colonialists' pejorative application of the term, Jamaican youth appropriated it as an ingroup designation. The term \"raggamuffin music\" describes the music of Jamaica's \"ghetto dwellers\".\nRagga and hip-hop.\nKing Jammy produced the 1985 hit, \"(Under Me) Sleng Teng\" by Wayne Smith. In the late 1980s, Jamaican deejay Daddy Freddy and Asher D's \"Ragamuffin Hip-Hop\" became the first multinational single to feature the word \"ragga\" in its title.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25597", "revid": "47179870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25597", "title": "Religious conversion", "text": "Adoption of religious beliefs\nReligious conversion is the adoption of a set of beliefs identified with one particular religious denomination to the exclusion of others. Thus \"religious conversion\" would describe the abandoning of adherence to one denomination and affiliating with another. This might be from one to another denomination within the same religion, for example, from Protestant Christianity to Roman Catholicism or from Shi'a Islam to Sunni Islam. In some cases, religious conversion \"marks a transformation of religious identity and is symbolized by special rituals\".\nPeople convert to a different religion for various reasons, including active conversion by free choice due to a change in beliefs, secondary conversion, deathbed conversion, conversion for convenience, marital conversion, and forced conversion. Religious conversion can also be driven by practical considerations. Historically, people have converted to evade taxes, to escape military service or to gain political representation.\nProselytism is the act of attempting to convert by persuasion another individual from a different religion or belief system. Apostate is a term used by members of a religion or denomination to refer to someone who has left that religion or denomination.\nReligion and proselytization.\nThe religions of the world are divided into two groups: those that actively seek new followers (missionary religions) and those that do not (non-missionary religions). This classification dates back to a lecture given by Max M\u00fcller in 1873, and is based on whether or not a religion seeks to gain new converts. The three main religions classified as missionary religions are Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam, while the non-missionary religions include Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Hinduism. Other religions, such as Primal Religions, Confucianism, and Taoism, may also be considered non-missionary religions.\nAbrahamic religions.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nIn sharing their faith with others, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are cautioned to \"obtain a hearing\" \u2013 meaning to make sure the person they are proposing to teach is open to hearing what they have to say. \"Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pioneers\", rather than attempting to supplant the cultural underpinnings of the people in their adopted communities, are encouraged to integrate into the society and apply Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed principles in living and working with their neighbors.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds recognize the divine origins of all revealed religion, and believe that these religions occurred sequentially as part of a divine plan (see Progressive revelation), with each new revelation superseding and fulfilling that of its predecessors. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regard their own faith as the most recent (but not the last), and believe its teachings \u2013 which are centered around the principle of the oneness of humanity \u2013 are most suited to meeting the needs of a global community.\nIn most countries conversion is a simple matter of filling out a card stating a declaration of belief. This includes acknowledgement of Bah\u00e1'u'llah \u2013 the Founder of the Faith \u2013 as the Messenger of God for this age, awareness and acceptance of his teachings, and intention to be obedient to the institutions and laws he established.\nConversion to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith carries with it an explicit belief in the common foundation of all revealed religion, a commitment to the unity of mankind, and active service to the community at large, especially in areas that will foster unity and concord. Since the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith has no clergy, converts are encouraged to be active in all aspects of community life. Even a recent convert may be elected to serve on a local Spiritual Assembly \u2013 the guiding Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed institution at the community level.\nChristianity.\nWithin Christianity conversion refers variously to three different phenomena: a person becoming Christian who was previously not Christian; a Christian moving from one Christian denomination to another; a particular spiritual development, sometimes called the \"second conversion\", or \"the conversion of the baptised\".\nConversion to Christianity is the religious conversion of a previously non-Christian person to some form of Christianity. Some Christian sects require full conversion for new members regardless of any history in other Christian sects, or from certain other sects. The exact requirements vary between different churches and denominations. Baptism is traditionally seen as a sacrament of admission to Christianity. Christian baptism has some parallels with Jewish immersion by \"mikvah\".\nIn the New Testament, Jesus commanded his disciples in the Great Commission to \"go and make disciples of all nations\". Evangelization \u2013 sharing the Gospel message or \"Good News\" in deed and word, is an expectation of Christians.\nConversions to Christianity have been widespread. Even Christian communities not known for proselytization, such as the Armenian Apostolic Church, are known to have accepted converts among Muslims, Yazidis, and Jews in the nineteenth century.\nComparison between Protestant denominations.\nWhile Calvinism is monergistic, like Lutherism, its monergism is through the inner calling of the Holy Spirit, which is irresistible according to the tradition. Lutherism, on the other hand, is monergistic through the means of grace, and holds the Word to be resistible. The Arminian view on salvation, unlike the other two, is synergistic, and considers salvation resistible due to the common grace of free will.\nLatter Day Saint movement.\nMuch of the theology of Latter Day Saint baptism was established during the early Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith, Jr. According to this theology, baptism must be by immersion, for the remission of sins (meaning that through baptism, past sins are forgiven), and occurs after one has shown faith and repentance. Mormon baptism does not purport to remit any sins other than personal ones, as adherents do not believe in original sin. Latter Day Saints baptisms also occur only after an \"age of accountability\" which is defined as the age of eight years. The theology thus rejects infant baptism.\nIn addition, Latter Day Saint theology requires that baptism may only be performed with one who has been called and ordained by God with priesthood authority. Because the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement operate under a lay priesthood, children raised in a Mormon family are usually baptized by a father or close male friend or family member who has achieved the office of priest, which is conferred upon worthy male members at least 16 years old in the LDS Church.\nBaptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus' death, burial and resurrection and is also symbolic of the baptized individual putting off of the natural or sinful man and becoming spiritually reborn as a disciple of Jesus.\nMembership into a Latter Day Saint church is granted only by baptism whether or not a person has been raised in the church. Latter Day Saint churches do not recognize baptisms of other faiths as valid because they believe baptisms must be performed under the church's unique authority. Thus, all who come into one of the Latter Day Saint faiths as converts are baptized, even if they have previously received baptism in another faith.\nWhen performing a Baptism, Latter Day Saints say the following prayer before performing the ordinance:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\nBaptisms inside and outside the temples are usually done in a baptistry, although they can be performed in any body of water in which the person may be completely immersed. The person administering the baptism must recite the prayer exactly, and immerse every part, limb, hair and clothing of the person being baptized. If there are any mistakes, or if any part of the person being baptized is not fully immersed, the baptism must be redone. In addition to the baptizer, two members of the church witness the baptism to ensure that it is performed properly.\nFollowing baptism, Latter Day Saints receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands of a Melchizedek Priesthood holder.\nLatter Day Saints hold that one may be baptized after death through the vicarious act of a living individual. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with a valid temple recommend (beginning in the year they turn twelve, and after being ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood for men and boys) have the opportunity to practice baptism for the dead as a missionary ritual. However, individuals for whom such baptisms are performed are not counted in figures regarding church membership statistics, such as total membership in the church, or the number of convert baptisms in a given year. Other churches of the Latter Day Saint movement also perform baptisms for the dead. This doctrine, in combination with others regarding the time between an individual's death and resurrection, also explains what happens to the righteous non-believer and the unevangelized by providing a post-mortem means of repentance and salvation.\nIslam.\nConverting to Islam requires one to declare the \"shah\u0101dah\", the Muslim profession of faith (\"There is no deity worthy of worship but Allah(Arabic word for the God); and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\"). According to Clinton Bennett, British\u2013American scholar of Religious studies, one's declaration of the Muslim profession of faith does not imply faith in God alone, since the conversion to Islam includes other distinct Islamic beliefs as well as part of the Muslim creed (\"\u02bfaq\u012bdah\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Technically, the \"Shahadah\" (first pillar) is the only obligatory statement of faith in Islam; however, over time a list of six items evolved, the essentials of faith (\"Iman Mufassal\"), namely: belief in God, in God's angels, scriptures, messengers, day of judgment, and God's divine decree (Al-Qadr).\nIn the Islamic religion, it is believed that everyone is Muslim at birth. Due to this, those who convert are typically referred to as reverts. In Islam, the practice of Islamic circumcision is considered a \"sunnah\" custom, not a requirement for conversion and there is a valid difference of opinion on whether it is fard (obligatory) or not. The majority of clerical opinions holds that circumcision is not required upon entering the Muslim faith. In the Sunn\u012b branch of Islam, the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b and \u1e24anbal\u012b schools regard male circumcision obligatory for Muslims, while the M\u0101lik\u012b and \u1e24anaf\u012b schools regard it as non-binding and only a recommendation.\nJudaism.\nConversion to Judaism is the religious conversion of non-Jews to become members of the Jewish religion and Jewish ethnoreligious community. The procedure and requirements for conversion depend on the sponsoring denomination. A conversion in accordance with the process of a denomination is not a guarantee of recognition by another denomination. A formal conversion is also sometimes undertaken by individuals whose Jewish ancestry is questioned, even if they were raised Jewish, but may not actually be considered Jews according to traditional Jewish law.\nAs late as the 6th century, the Eastern Roman empire and Caliph Umar ibn Khattab were issuing decrees against conversion to Judaism, implying that this was still occurring.\nSpiritism.\nThere are no rituals or dogmas, nor any sort of procedures in conversion to Spiritism. The doctrine is first considered as science, then philosophy and lastly as a religion. Allan Kardec's codification of Spiritism occurred between the years 1857 and 1868. Currently there are 25 to 60 million people studying Spiritism in various countries, mainly in Brazil, through its essential books, which include \"The Spirits Book\", \"The Book on Mediums\", \"The Gospel According to Spiritism\", \"Heaven and Hell\" and \"The Genesis According to Spiritism\".\nChico Xavier wrote over 490 additional books, which expand on the spiritualist doctrine.\nAs explained in the first of the 1,019 questions and answers in \"The Spirits Book\": \n1. What is God? Answer: \"God is the Supreme Intelligence-First Cause of all things.\"\nThe consensus in Spiritism is that God, the Great Creator, is above everything, including all human things such as rituals, dogmas, denominations or any other thing.\nDharmic religions.\nBuddhism.\nPersons newly adhering to Buddhism traditionally \"Taking Three Refuge\" (express faith in the Three Jewels \u2013 Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha) before a monk, nun, or similar representative, with often the sangha, the community of practitioners, also in ritual attendance.\nThroughout the timeline of Buddhism, conversions of entire countries and regions to Buddhism were frequent, as Buddhism spread throughout Asia. For example, in the 11th century in Burma, king Anoratha converted his entire country to Theravada Buddhism. At the end of the 12th century, Jayavarman VII set the stage for conversion of the Khmer people to Theravada Buddhism. Mass conversions of areas and communities to Buddhism occur up to the present day, for example, in the Dalit Buddhist movement in India there have been organized mass conversions.\nExceptions to encouraging conversion may occur in some Buddhist movements. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, the current Dalai Lama discourages active attempts to win converts.\nHinduism.\nHinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, pandeism, monism, and atheism among others. Hinduism has no traditional ecclesiastical order, no centralized religious authorities, no universally accepted governing body, no binding holy book nor any mandatory prayer attendance requirements. In its diffuse and open structure, numerous schools and sects of Hinduism have developed and spun off in India with help from its ascetic scholars, since the Vedic age. The six Astika and two Nastika schools of Hindu philosophy, in its history, did not develop a missionary or proselytization methodology, and they co-existed with each other. Most Hindu sub-schools and sects do not actively seek converts. Individuals have had a choice to enter, leave or change their god(s), spiritual convictions, accept or discard any rituals and practices, and pursue spiritual knowledge and liberation (moksha) in different ways. However, various schools of Hinduism do have some core common beliefs, such as the belief that all living beings have Atman (soul), a belief in karma theory, spirituality, ahimsa (non-violence) as the greatest dharma or virtue, and others.\nReligious conversion to Hinduism has a long history outside India. Merchants and traders of India, particularly from Indian peninsula, carried their religious ideas, which led to religious conversions to Hinduism in Indonesia, Champa, Cambodia and Burma. Some sects of Hindus, particularly of the Bhakti schools began seeking or accepting converts in early to mid 20th century. For example, groups like the International Society for Krishna Consciousness accept those who have a desire to follow their sects of Hinduism and have their own religious conversion procedure.\nSince 1800 CE, religious conversion from and to Hinduism has been a controversial subject within Hinduism. Some have suggested that the concept of missionary conversion, either way, is contrary to the precepts of Hinduism. Religious leaders of some of Hinduism sects such as Brahmo Samaj have seen Hinduism as a non-missionary religion yet welcomed new members, while other leaders of Hinduism's diverse schools have stated that with the arrival of missionary Islam and Christianity in India, the view that \"there is no such thing as proselytism in Hinduism\" must be re-examined.\nIn recent decades, mainstream Hinduism schools have attempted to systematize ways to accept religious converts, with an increase in inter-religious mixed marriages. The steps involved in becoming a Hindu have variously included a period where the interested person gets an informal \"ardha-Hindu\" name and studies ancient literature on spiritual path and practices (English translations of Upanishads, Agama, Itihasa, ethics in Sutra, Hindu festivals, yoga). If after a period of study, the individual still wants to convert, a \"Namakarana Samskara\" ceremony is held, where the individual adopts a traditional Hindu name. The initiation ceremony may also include \"Yajna\" (i.e., fire ritual with Sanskrit hymns) under guidance of a local Hindu priest. Some of these places are \"mathas\" and \"asramas\" (hermitage, monastery), where one or more \"gurus\" (spiritual guide) conduct the conversion and offer spiritual discussions. Some schools encourage the new convert to learn and participate in community activities such as festivals (Diwali etc.), read and discuss ancient literature, learn and engage in rites of passages (ceremonies of birth, first feeding, first learning day, age of majority, wedding, cremation and others).\nJainism.\nJainism accepts anyone who wants to embrace the religion. There is no specific ritual for becoming a Jain. One does not need to ask any authorities for admission. One becomes a Jain on one's own by observing the five vows (\"vratas\") The five main vows as mentioned in the ancient Jain texts like Tattvarthasutra are:\nFollowing the five vows is the main requirement in Jainism. All other aspects such as visiting temples are secondary. Jain monks and nuns are required to observe these five vows strictly.\nSikhism.\nSikhism is not known to openly proselytize conversions, however it is open and accepting to anyone wanting to take on the Sikh faith.\nOther religions and sects.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the rapid growth of new religious movements (NRMs) led some psychologists and other scholars to propose that these groups were using \"brainwashing\" or \"mind control\" techniques to gain converts. This theory was publicized by the popular news media but disputed by other scholars, including some sociologists of religion.\nIn the 1960s sociologist John Lofland lived with Unification Church missionary Young Oon Kim and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win converts to their church. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships \u2013 often family relationships \u2013 with existing members. Lofland summarised his findings in 1964 in a doctoral thesis entitled \"The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes\", and in 1966 in book form (published by Prentice-Hall) as \"\". It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion, and one of the first modern sociological studies of a new religious movement.\nThe Church of Scientology attempts to gain converts by offering \"free stress tests\". It has also used the celebrity status of some of its members (most notably that of the American actor Tom Cruise) to attract converts. The Church of Scientology requires that all converts sign a legal waiver which covers their relationship with the Church of Scientology before engaging in Scientology services.\nResearch in the United States and in the Netherlands has shown a positive correlation between areas lacking mainstream churches and the percentage of people who are members of a new religious movement. This applies also for the presence of New Age centres.\nOn the other end of the proselytising scale are religions that do not accept any converts. Often these are relatively small, close-knit minority religions that are ethnically based such as the Yazidis, Druze, and Mandaeans. The Parsis, a Zoroastrianism group based in India, classically does not accept converts, but this issue became controversial in the 20th century due to a rapid decline in membership. Chinese traditional religion lacks clear criteria for membership, and hence for conversion. However, Taoism does have its own religious conversion ceremony which seems to be adopted and modified from Chinese Buddhist refuge-taking ceremonies. The Shakers and some Indian eunuch brotherhoods do not allow procreation, so that every member is a convert.\nFostering conversion.\nDifferent factors and circumstances may operate and interact to persuade individuals of groups to convert and adopt a new set of religious doctrines and habits.\nReligious enthusiasm for proselytism can play a role. For example, the New Testament chronicles the personal activities of the Apostles and their followers in inspired preaching, miracle-working and the subsequent gathering of followers. Freshly-converted Irish and Anglo-Saxon priests spread their new-found faith among pagan British and Germanic peoples. Missions of the 19th century spread against a background of North Atlantic revivalism with its emotionalism and mass-meeting crowd psychological behaviours.\nMessianism may prepare groups for the coming of a Messiah or of a saviour. Thus the 1st-century Levant, steeped in expectations of overturning the political situation, provided fertile ground for nascent Christianity and other Jewish messianic sects, such as the Zealots.\nSome religious traditions, rather than stressing emotion in the conversion process, emphasise the importance of philosophical thought as a pathway to adopting a new religion. Saint Paul in Athens fits here, as do some of the Indic religions (such as Buddhism and Jainism). The historical God-fearers may represent a philosophical bridge between Hellenism and Abrahamic faith.\nA religious creed which can capture the ear and support of secular power can become a prestige movement, encouraging the mass of a people to follow its tenets. Christianity grew after becoming the state religion in Armenia, in the Roman Empire, and in Ethiopia. Eastern Orthodoxy expanded when it gained official sanction in Kievan Rus'.\nSome people convert under the influence of other social conditions. Early Christianity attracted followers by offering community material support and enhanced status for disadvantaged groups such as women and slaves. Islam allegedly spread in North Africa through just administration, and in the Balkans by integrating new believers with improved tax conditions and social prestige. Colonial missions since the 19th century have attracted people to an implied nexus of material well-being, civilisation, and European-style religion.\nForce can \u2013 at least apparently \u2013 coerce people into adopting different ideas. Religious police in (for example) Iran and Saudi Arabia answer for the correct religious expression of those in their purview. The Inquisition in France and in Iberia worked to convert heretics \u2013 with varying success. Frankish armies spread Roman Catholicism eastwards in the Middle Ages. Religious wars and suppression shaped the histories of the Baltic tribes, the Hussites and the Huguenots.\nOn the other hand, persecution can drive religious faith and practice underground and strengthen the resolve of oppressed adherents \u2013 as in the cases of the Waldenses or the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nInternational law.\nThe United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights defines religious conversion as a human right: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief\" (Article 18). Despite this UN-declared human right, some groups forbid or restrict religious conversion (see below).\nBased on the declaration the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) drafted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a legally binding treaty. It states that \"Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice\" (Article 18.1). \"No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice\" (Article 18.2).\nThe UNCHR issued a General Comment on this Article in 1993: \"The Committee observes that the freedom to 'have or to adopt' a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, \"including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another\" or to adopt atheistic views ... Article 18.2 bars coercion that would impair the right to have or adopt a religion or belief, including the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers to adhere to their religious beliefs and congregations, to recant their religion or belief \"or to convert\".\" (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, General Comment No. 22.; emphasis added)\nSome countries distinguish voluntary, motivated conversion from organized proselytism, attempting to restrict the latter. The boundary between them is not easily defined: what one person considers legitimate evangelizing, or witness-bearing, another may consider intrusive and improper. Illustrating the problems that can arise from such subjective viewpoints is this extract from an article by C. Davis, published in Cleveland State University's \"Journal of Law and Health\": \"According to the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Jews for Jesus and Hebrew Christians constitute two of the most dangerous cults, and its members are appropriate candidates for deprogramming. Anti-cult evangelicals ... protest that 'aggressiveness and proselytizing ... are basic to authentic Christianity,' and that Jews for Jesus and Campus Crusade for Christ are not to be labeled as cults. Furthermore, certain Hassidic groups who physically attacked a meeting of the Hebrew Christian 'cult' have themselves been labeled a 'cult' and equated with the followers of Reverend Moon, by none other than the President of the Central Conference of American Rabbis.\"\nSince the collapse of the former Soviet Union the Russian Orthodox Church has enjoyed a revival. However, it takes exception to what it considers illegitimate proselytizing by the Roman Catholic Church, the Salvation Army, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other religious movements in what it refers to as its \"canonical territory\".\nGreece has a long history of conflict, mostly with Jehovah's Witnesses, but also with some Pentecostals, over its laws on proselytism. This situation stems from a law passed in the 1930s by the dictator Ioannis Metaxas. A Jehovah's Witness, Minos Kokkinakis, won the equivalent of $14,400 in damages from the Greek state after being arrested for trying to preach his faith from door to door. In another case, \"Larissis v. Greece\", a member of the Pentecostal church also won a case in the European Court of Human Rights.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a very soft, whitish-grey solid in the alkali metal group, similar to potassium and caesium. Rubidium is the first alkali metal in the group to have a density higher than water. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is a stable isotope 85Rb, and 28% is slightly radioactive 87Rb, with a half-life of 48.8\u00a0billion years \u2013 more than three times as long as the estimated age of the universe.\nGerman chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 by the newly developed technique, flame spectroscopy. The name comes from the Latin word , meaning deep red, the color of its emission spectrum. Rubidium's compounds have various chemical and electronic applications. Rubidium metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range, making it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms. Rubidium is not a known nutrient for any living organisms. However, rubidium ions have similar properties and the same charge as potassium ions, and are actively taken up and treated by animal cells in similar ways.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nRubidium is a very soft, ductile, silvery-white metal. It has a melting point of and a boiling point of . It forms amalgams with mercury and alloys with gold, iron, caesium, sodium, and potassium, but not lithium (despite rubidium and lithium being in the same periodic group). Rubidium and potassium show a very similar purple color in the flame test, and distinguishing the two elements requires more sophisticated analysis, such as spectroscopy.\nChemical properties.\nRubidium is the second most electropositive of the stable alkali metals and has a very low first ionization energy of only 403\u00a0kJ/mol. It has an electron configuration of [Kr]5s1 and is photosensitive. Due to its strong electropositive nature, rubidium reacts explosively with water to produce rubidium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. As with all the alkali metals, the reaction is usually vigorous enough to ignite metal or the hydrogen gas produced by the reaction, potentially causing an explosion. Rubidium, being denser than potassium, sinks in water, reacting violently; caesium explodes on contact with water. However, the reaction rates of all alkali metals depend upon surface area of metal in contact with water, with small metal droplets giving explosive rates. Rubidium has also been reported to ignite spontaneously in air.\nCompounds.\nRubidium chloride (RbCl) is probably the most used rubidium compound: among several other chlorides, it is used to induce living cells to take up DNA; it is also used as a biomarker, because in nature, it is found only in small quantities in living organisms and when present, replaces potassium. Other common rubidium compounds are the corrosive rubidium hydroxide (RbOH), the starting material for most rubidium-based chemical processes; rubidium carbonate (Rb2CO3), used in some optical glasses, and rubidium copper sulfate, Rb2SO4\u00b7CuSO4\u00b76H2O. Rubidium silver iodide (RbAg4I5) has the highest room temperature conductivity of any known ionic crystal, a property exploited in thin film batteries and other applications.\nRubidium forms a number of oxides when exposed to air, including rubidium monoxide (Rb2O), Rb6O, and Rb9O2; rubidium in excess oxygen gives the superoxide RbO2. Rubidium forms salts with halogens, producing rubidium fluoride, rubidium chloride, rubidium bromide, and rubidium iodide.\nIsotopes.\nRubidium in the Earth's crust is composed of two isotopes: the stable 85Rb (72.2%) and the radioactive 87Rb (27.8%). Natural rubidium is radioactive, with specific activity of about 670 Bq/g, enough to significantly expose a photographic film in 110 days. Thirty additional rubidium isotopes have been synthesized with half-lives of less than 3\u00a0months; most are highly radioactive and have few uses.\nRubidium-87 has a half-life of \u00a0years, which is more than three times the age of the universe of \u00a0years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium\u2013strontium dating).\nRubidium-82, one of the element's non-natural isotopes, is produced by electron-capture decay of strontium-82 with a half-life of 25.36\u00a0days. With a half-life of 76 seconds, rubidium-82 decays by positron emission to stable krypton-82.\nOccurrence.\nRubidium is not abundant, being one of 56 elements that combined make up 0.05% of the Earth's crust; at roughly the 23rd most abundant element in the Earth's crust it is more abundant than zinc or copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.\nSeawater contains an average of 125\u00a0\u03bcg/L of rubidium compared to the much higher value for potassium of 408\u00a0mg/L and the much lower value of 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg/L for caesium. Rubidium is the 18th most abundant element in seawater.\nBecause of its large ionic radius, rubidium is one of the \"incompatible elements\". During magma crystallization, rubidium is concentrated together with its heavier analogue caesium in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore, the largest deposits of rubidium and caesium are zone pegmatite ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because rubidium substitutes for potassium in the crystallization of magma, the enrichment is far less effective than that of caesium. Zone pegmatite ore bodies containing mineable quantities of caesium as pollucite or the lithium minerals lepidolite are also a source for rubidium as a by-product.\nTwo notable sources of rubidium are the rich deposits of pollucite at Bernic Lake, Manitoba, Canada, and the rubicline ((Rb,K)AlSi3O8) found as impurities in pollucite on the Italian island of Elba, with a rubidium content of 17.5%. Both of those deposits are also sources of caesium.\nProduction.\nAlthough rubidium is more abundant in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2\u00b712H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.\nFor several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and a small amount of caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium produce rubidium as a by-product from pollucite.\nHistory.\nRubidium was discovered in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral lepidolite through flame spectroscopy. Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word , meaning \"deep red\".\nRubidium is a minor component in lepidolite. Kirchhoff and Bunsen processed 150\u00a0kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium monoxide (Rb2O). Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid, but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (Rb2PtCl6) could be obtained by fractional crystallization. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen, the process yielded 0.51\u00a0grams of rubidium chloride (RbCl) for further studies. Bunsen and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with of mineral water, which yielded 7.3\u00a0grams of caesium chloride and 9.2\u00a0grams of rubidium chloride. Rubidium was the second element, shortly after caesium, to be discovered by spectroscopy, just one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.\nThe two scientists used the rubidium chloride to estimate that the atomic weight of the new element was 85.36 (the currently accepted value is 85.47). They tried to generate elemental rubidium by electrolysis of molten rubidium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance, which \"neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope showed the slightest trace of metallic substance\". They presumed that it was a subchloride (Rb2Cl); however, the product was probably a colloidal mixture of the metal and rubidium chloride. In a second attempt to produce metallic rubidium, Bunsen was able to reduce rubidium by heating charred rubidium tartrate. Although the distilled rubidium was pyrophoric, they were able to determine the density and the melting point. The quality of this research in the 1860s can be appraised by the fact that their determined density differs by less than 0.1\u00a0g/cm3 and the melting point by less than 1\u00a0\u00b0C from the presently accepted values.\nThe slight radioactivity of rubidium was discovered in 1908, but that was before the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and the low level of activity (half-life greater than 1010\u00a0years) made interpretation complicated. The now proven decay of 87Rb to stable 87Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s.\nRubidium had minimal industrial value before the 1920s. Since then, the most important use of rubidium is research and development, primarily in chemical and electronic applications. In 1995, rubidium-87 was used to produce a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate, for which the discoverers, Eric Allin Cornell, Carl Edwin Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle, won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nApplications.\nRubidium compounds are sometimes used in fireworks to give them a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, whereby hot rubidium ions are passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator, thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, is one of the most commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose\u2013Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold-atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferred for its rich Feshbach spectrum.\nRubidium has been used for polarizing 3He, producing volumes of magnetized 3He gas, with the nuclear spins aligned rather than random. Rubidium vapor is optically pumped by a laser, and the polarized Rb polarizes 3He through the hyperfine interaction. Such spin-polarized 3He cells are useful for neutron polarization measurements and for producing polarized neutron beams for other purposes.\nThe resonant element in atomic clocks utilizes the hyperfine structure of rubidium's energy levels, and rubidium is useful for high-precision timing. It is used as the main component of secondary frequency references (rubidium oscillators) in cell site transmitters and other electronic transmitting, networking, and test equipment. These rubidium standards are often used with GNSS to produce a \"primary frequency standard\" that has greater accuracy and is less expensive than caesium standards. Such rubidium standards are often mass-produced for the telecommunications industry.\nOther potential or current uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines, as a getter in vacuum tubes, and as a photocell component. Rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass, in the production of superoxide by burning in oxygen, in the study of potassium ion channels in biology, and as the vapor in atomic magnetometers. In particular, 87Rb is used with other alkali metals in the development of spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers.\nRubidium-82 is used for positron emission tomography. Rubidium is very similar to potassium, and tissue with high potassium content will also accumulate the radioactive rubidium. One of the main uses is myocardial perfusion imaging. As a result of changes in the blood\u2013brain barrier in brain tumors, rubidium collects more in brain tumors than normal brain tissue, allowing the use of radioisotope rubidium-82 in nuclear medicine to locate and image brain tumors. Rubidium-82 has a very short half-life of 76\u00a0seconds, and the production from decay of strontium-82 must be done close to the patient.\nRubidium was tested for the influence on manic depression and depression. Dialysis patients suffering from depression show a depletion in rubidium, and therefore a supplementation may help during depression. In some tests the rubidium was administered as rubidium chloride with up to 720\u00a0mg per day for 60 days.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nPrecautions and biological effects.\nRubidium reacts violently with water and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually kept under dry mineral oil or sealed in glass ampoules in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to a small amount of air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.\nRubidium, like sodium and potassium, almost always has +1 oxidation state when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions as if they were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's intracellular fluid (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70\u00a0kg person contains on average 0.36\u00a0g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. The biological half-life of rubidium in humans measures 31\u201346\u00a0days. Although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible, when more than 50% of the potassium in the muscle tissue of rats was replaced with rubidium, the rats died.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25600", "revid": "50350376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25600", "title": "Ruthenium", "text": "element with atomic number 44 (Ru)\nRuthenium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ru and atomic number\u00a044. It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is unreactive to most chemicals. Karl Ernst Claus, a Russian scientist of Baltic-German ancestry, discovered the element in 1844 at Kazan State University and named it in honor of Russia, using the Latin name \"Ruthenia\". Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production has risen from about 19\u00a0tonnes in 2009 to 35.5\u00a0tonnes in 2017. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemical catalyst. A new application of ruthenium is as the capping layer for extreme ultraviolet photomasks in semiconductor lithography. Ruthenium is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury, Ontario, and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nRuthenium, a polyvalent hard white metal, is a member of the platinum group and is in group\u00a08 of the periodic table:\nWhile other group 8 elements have two electrons in the outermost shell, in ruthenium the outermost shell has only one electron (the final electron is in a lower shell). This anomaly, which has no effect on chemical properties, is also observed in all other elements (except technetium) in the range of \"Z\" = 41-45.\nChemical properties.\nRuthenium has four crystal modifications and does not tarnish at ambient conditions; it oxidizes upon heating to . Ruthenium dissolves in fused alkalis to give ruthenates (RuO42-). It is not attacked by acids (even aqua regia) but is attacked by sodium hypochlorite at room temperature, and halogens at high temperatures. Ruthenium is most readily attacked by oxidizing agents. Small amounts of ruthenium can increase the hardness of platinum and palladium. The corrosion resistance of titanium is increased markedly by the addition of a small amount of ruthenium. The metal can be plated by electroplating and by thermal decomposition. A ruthenium\u2013molybdenum alloy is known to be superconductive at temperatures below 10.6\u00a0K. Ruthenium is the only 4d\u00a0transition metal that can assume the group oxidation state\u00a0+8, and even then it is less stable there than the heavier congener osmium: this is the first group from the left of the table where the second and third-row transition metals display notable differences in chemical behavior. Like iron but unlike osmium, ruthenium can form aqueous cations in its lower oxidation +2 and +3\u00a0states.\nRuthenium is the first in a downward trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d\u00a0transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d\u00a0subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled [Kr]4d55s2 configuration, though it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d\u00a0transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is usually paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point. However, the metastable tetragonal phase of ruthenium, created as a thin film on single crystal Mo, is ferromagnetic at room temperature.\nThe reduction potentials in acidic aqueous solution for some common ruthenium species are shown below:\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring ruthenium is composed of seven stable isotopes: 96, 98-102, 104. Additionally, 34 synthetic radioactive isotopes have been discovered. Of these radioisotopes, the most stable are 106Ru with a half-life of 371.8\u00a0days, 103Ru with a half-life of 39.245\u00a0days and 97Ru with a half-life of 2.837 days.\nFifteen other radioisotopes have been characterized ranging from 87Ru) to 120Ru. Most of these have half-lives that are less than five minutes; the exceptions are 94Ru (51.8\u00a0minutes), 95Ru (1.607\u00a0hours), and 105Ru (4.44\u00a0hours).\nThe primary decay mode before the most abundant isotope, 102Ru, is electron capture while the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay product before 102Ru is technetium and the primary decay product after is rhodium.\n106Ru is a fission product of uranium or plutonium. High concentrations of this isotopes detected in the atmosphere over Europe were associated with an alleged undeclared nuclear accident in Russia in 2017.\nOccurrence.\nRuthenium is found in about 100\u00a0parts per trillion in the Earth's crust, making it the 78th most abundant element. It is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa. The native form of ruthenium is a very rare mineral (Ir replaces part of Ru in its structure). Ruthenium has a relatively high fission product yield in nuclear fission; and given that its most long-lived radioisotope has a half-life of \"only\" around a year, there are often proposals to recover ruthenium in a new kind of nuclear reprocessing from spent fuel. An unusual ruthenium deposit can also be found at the natural nuclear fission reactor that was active in Oklo, Gabon, some two billion years ago. Indeed, the isotope ratio of ruthenium found there was one of several ways used to confirm that a nuclear fission chain reaction had indeed occurred at that site in the geological past. Uranium is no longer mined at Oklo, and there have never been serious attempts to recover any of the platinum group metals present there.\nProduction.\nRoughly 30\u00a0tonnes of ruthenium are mined each year, and world reserves are estimated at 5,000\u00a0tonnes. The composition of the mined platinum group metal (PGM) mixtures varies widely, depending on the geochemical formation. For example, the PGMs mined in South Africa contain on average 11% ruthenium while the PGMs mined in the former USSR contain only 2% (1992). Ruthenium, osmium, and iridium are considered the minor platinum group metals.\nRuthenium, like the other platinum group metals, is obtained commercially as a by-product from processing of nickel, copper, and platinum metal ore. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold, and the platinum group metals precipitate as \"anode mud\", the feedstock for the extraction. The metals are converted to ionized solutes by any of several methods, depending on the composition of the feedstock. One representative method is fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and solution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid. Osmium (Os), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), and iridium (Ir) are insoluble in aqua regia and readily precipitate, leaving the other metals in solution. Rhodium is separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate. The insoluble residue, containing Ru, Os, and Ir is treated with sodium oxide, in which Ir is insoluble, producing dissolved Ru and Os salts. After oxidation to the volatile oxides, RuO4 is separated from OsO4 by precipitation of (NH4)3RuCl6 with ammonium chloride or by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide. Hydrogen is used to reduce ammonium ruthenium chloride, yielding a powder. The product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge metal that can be treated with powder metallurgy techniques or argon-arc welding.\nRuthenium is contained in spent nuclear fuel, both as a direct fission product and as a product of neutron absorption by long-lived fission product 99Tc. After allowing the unstable isotopes of ruthenium to decay, chemical extraction could yield ruthenium for use in all applications of ruthenium.\nRuthenium can also be produced by deliberate nuclear transmutation from 99Tc. Given its relatively long half-life, high fission product yield and high chemical mobility in the environment, 99Tc is among the most often proposed non-actinides for commercial-scale nuclear transmutation. 99Tc has a relatively large neutron cross section, and because technetium has no stable isotopes, there would not be a problem of neutron activation of stable isotopes. Significant amounts of 99Tc are produced in nuclear fission. They are also produced as a byproduct of the use of 99mTc in nuclear medicine, because this isomer decays to 99Tc. Exposing the 99Tc target to strong enough neutron radiation will eventually yield appreciable quantities of ruthenium, which can be chemically separated while consuming 99Tc.\nChemical compounds.\nThe oxidation states of ruthenium range from \u22122 to +8. The properties of ruthenium and osmium compounds are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states are the most common. The most prevalent precursor is ruthenium trichloride, a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically.\nOxides and chalcogenides.\nRuthenium can be oxidized to ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2, oxidation state +4), which can, in turn, be oxidized by sodium metaperiodate to the volatile yellow tetrahedral ruthenium tetroxide, RuO4, an aggressive, strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to osmium tetroxide. RuO4 is mostly used as an intermediate in the purification of ruthenium from ores and radiowastes.\nDipotassium ruthenate (K2RuO4, +6) and potassium perruthenate (KRuO4, +7) are also known. Unlike osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide is less stable, is strong enough as an oxidising agent to oxidise dilute hydrochloric acid and organic solvents like ethanol at room temperature, and is easily reduced to ruthenate (RuO42-) in aqueous alkaline solutions; it decomposes to form the dioxide above 100\u00a0\u00b0C. Unlike iron but like osmium, ruthenium does not form oxides in its lower +2 and +3 oxidation states. Ruthenium forms dichalcogenides, which are diamagnetic semiconductors crystallizing in the pyrite structure. Ruthenium sulfide (RuS2) occurs naturally as the mineral laurite.\nLike iron, ruthenium does not readily form oxoanions and prefers to achieve high coordination numbers with hydroxide ions instead. Ruthenium tetroxide is reduced by cold dilute potassium hydroxide to form black potassium perruthenate, KRuO4, with ruthenium in the +7 oxidation state. Potassium perruthenate can also be produced by oxidising potassium ruthenate, K2RuO4, with chlorine gas. The perruthenate ion is unstable and is reduced by water to form the orange ruthenate. Potassium ruthenate may be synthesized by reacting ruthenium metal with molten potassium hydroxide and potassium nitrate.\nSome mixed oxides are also known, such as MIIRuIVO3, Na3RuVO4, NaRuO, and MLnRuO.\nHalides and oxyhalides.\nThe highest known ruthenium halide is the hexafluoride, a dark brown solid that melts at 54\u00a0\u00b0C. It hydrolyzes violently upon contact with water and easily disproportionates to form a mixture of lower ruthenium fluorides, releasing fluorine gas. Ruthenium pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed, melting at 86.5\u00a0\u00b0C. The yellow ruthenium tetrafluoride is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine. Among the binary compounds of ruthenium, these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides.\nRuthenium trichloride is a well-known compound, existing in a black \u03b1-form and a dark brown \u03b2-form: the trihydrate is red. Of the known trihalides, trifluoride is dark brown and decomposes above 650\u00a0\u00b0C, tribromide is dark-brown and decomposes above 400\u00a0\u00b0C, and triiodide is black. Of the dihalides, difluoride is not known, dichloride is brown, dibromide is black, and diiodide is blue. The only known oxyhalide is the pale green ruthenium(VI) oxyfluoride, RuOF4.\nCoordination and organometallic complexes.\nRuthenium forms a variety of coordination complexes. Examples are the many pentaammine derivatives [Ru(NH3)5L]n+ that often exist for both Ru(II) and Ru(III). Derivatives of bipyridine and terpyridine are numerous, best known being the luminescent tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride.\nRuthenium forms a wide range compounds with carbon\u2013ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts in the absence of CO pressure to the dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).\nHistory.\nThough naturally occurring platinum alloys containing all six platinum-group metals were used for a long time by pre-Columbian Americans and known as a material to European chemists from the mid-16th century, not until the mid-18th century was platinum identified as a pure element. That natural platinum contained palladium, rhodium, osmium and iridium was discovered in the first decade of the 19th century. Platinum in alluvial sands of Russian rivers gave access to raw material for use in plates and medals and for the minting of ruble coins, starting in 1828. Residues from platinum production for coinage were available in the Russian Empire, and therefore most of the research on them was done in Eastern Europe.\nIt is possible that the Polish chemist J\u0119drzej \u015aniadecki isolated element 44 (which he called \"vestium\" after the asteroid Vesta discovered shortly before) from South American platinum ores in 1807. He published an announcement of his discovery in 1808. His work was never confirmed, however, and he later withdrew his claim of discovery.\nJ\u00f6ns Berzelius and Gottfried Osann nearly discovered ruthenium in 1827. They examined residues that were left after dissolving crude platinum from the Ural Mountains in aqua regia. Berzelius did not find any unusual metals, but Osann thought he found three new metals, which he called pluranium, ruthenium, and polinium. This discrepancy led to a long-standing controversy between Berzelius and Osann about the composition of the residues. As Osann was not able to repeat his isolation of ruthenium, he eventually relinquished his claims. The name \"ruthenium\" was chosen by Osann because the analysed samples stemmed from the Ural Mountains in Russia.\nIn 1844, Karl Ernst Claus, a Russian scientist of Baltic German descent, showed that the compounds prepared by Gottfried Osann contained small amounts of ruthenium, which Claus had discovered the same year. Claus isolated ruthenium from the platinum residues of rouble production while he was working in Kazan University, Kazan, the same way its heavier congener osmium had been discovered four decades earlier. Claus showed that ruthenium oxide contained a new metal and obtained 6\u00a0grams of ruthenium from the part of crude platinum that is insoluble in aqua regia. Choosing the name for the new element, Claus stated: \"I named the new body, in honour of my Motherland, ruthenium. I had every right to call it by this name because Mr. Osann relinquished his ruthenium and the word does not yet exist in chemistry.\" The name itself derives from the Latin word \"Ruthenia\".\nIn doing so, Claus started a trend that continues to this day \u2013 naming an element after a country.\nApplications.\nApproximately 30.9 tonnes of ruthenium were consumed in 2016, 13.8 of them in electrical applications, 7.7 in catalysis, and 4.6 in electrochemistry.\nBecause it hardens platinum and palladium alloys, ruthenium is used in electrical contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability. With its similar properties to and lower cost than rhodium, electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium. The ruthenium plate is applied to the electrical contact and electrode base metal by electroplating or sputtering.\nRuthenium dioxide with lead and bismuth ruthenates are used in thick-film chip resistors. These two electronic applications account for 50% of the ruthenium consumption.\nRuthenium is occasionally alloyed with metals outside the platinum group, where small quantities improve some properties. The added corrosion resistance in titanium alloys led to the development of a special alloy with 0.1% ruthenium. Ruthenium is also used in some advanced high-temperature single-crystal superalloys, with applications that include the turbines in jet engines. Several nickel based superalloy compositions are described, such as EPM-102 (with 3% Ru), TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), TMS-138, and TMS-174, the latter two containing 6% rhenium. Fountain pen nibs are frequently tipped with ruthenium alloy. From 1944 onward, the Parker 51 fountain pen was fitted with the \"RU\" nib, a 14K gold nib tipped with 96.2% ruthenium and 3.8% iridium.\nRuthenium is a component of mixed-metal oxide (MMO) anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures, and for electrolytic cells for such processes as generating chlorine from salt water. The fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen, finding use in optode sensors for oxygen. Ruthenium red, [(NH3)5Ru-O-Ru(NH3)4-O-Ru(NH3)5]6+, is a biological stain used to stain polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy. The beta-decaying isotope 106 of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors, mainly melanomas of the uvea. Ruthenium-centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties. The \"piano-stool\" Ru(II) compounds show promise to replace current platinum-based anti-tumor drugs.\nRuthenium tetroxide exposes latent fingerprints by reacting on contact with fatty oils or fats with sebaceous contaminants and producing brown/black ruthenium dioxide pigment.\nElectronics.\nElectronics is the largest use of ruthenium. Ru metal is particularly nonvolatile, which is advantageous in microelectronic devices. Ru and its main oxide RuO2 have comparable electrical resistivities. Copper can be directly electroplated onto ruthenium, particular applications include barrier layers, transistor gates, and interconnects. Ru films can be deposited by chemical vapor deposition using volatile complexes such as ruthenium tetroxide and the organoruthenium compound (cyclohexadiene)Ru(CO)3.\nCatalysis.\nMany ruthenium-containing compounds exhibit useful catalytic properties. Solutions containing ruthenium trichloride are highly active for olefin metathesis. Such catalysts are used commercially for the production of polynorbornene for example. Well defined ruthenium carbene and alkylidene complexes show similar reactivity but are only used on small-scale. The Grubbs' catalysts for example have been employed in the preparation of drugs and advanced materials.\nSome ruthenium complexes are highly active catalysts for transfer hydrogenations (sometimes referred to as \"borrowing hydrogen\" reactions). Chiral ruthenium complexes, introduced by Ryoji Noyori, are employed for the enantioselective hydrogenation of ketones, aldehydes, and imines. A typical catalyst is (cymene)Ru(S,S-TsDPEN): A Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 2001 to Ry\u014dji Noyori for contributions to the field of asymmetric hydrogenation.\nRuthenium-promoted cobalt catalysts are used in Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis.\nEmerging applications.\nRuthenium-based compounds are components of dye-sensitized solar cells, which are proposed as low-cost solar cell system.\nHealth effects.\nLittle is known about the health effects of ruthenium and it is relatively rare for people to encounter ruthenium compounds. Metallic ruthenium is inert (is not chemically reactive). Some compounds such as ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4) are highly toxic and volatile.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25601", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25601", "title": "Rhodium", "text": "element with atomic number 45 (Rh)\nRhodium is a chemical element; it has symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is a very rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion-resistant transition metal. It is a noble metal and a member of the platinum group. It has only one naturally occurring isotope, which is 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as a free metal or as an alloy with similar metals and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals. Rhodium is a group 9 element (cobalt group).\nRhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores with the other members of the platinum group metals. It was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds.\nThe element's major use (consuming about 80% of world rhodium production) is as one of the catalysts in the three-way catalytic converters in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance, while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated to resist tarnishing.\nRhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron flux level. Other uses of rhodium include asymmetric hydrogenation used to form drug precursors and the processes for the production of acetic acid.\nHistory.\nRhodium (from , meaning 'rose') was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, soon after he discovered palladium. He used crude platinum ore presumably obtained from South America. His procedure dissolved the ore in aqua regia and neutralized the acid with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). He then precipitated the platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate by adding ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). Most other metals like copper, lead, palladium, and rhodium were precipitated with zinc. Diluted nitric acid dissolved all but palladium and rhodium. Of these, palladium dissolved in aqua regia but rhodium did not, and the rhodium was precipitated by the addition of sodium chloride as Na3[RhCl6]\u00b7\"n\"H2O. After being washed with ethanol, the rose-red precipitate was reacted with zinc, which displaced the rhodium in the ionic compound and thereby released the rhodium as free metal.\nFor decades, the rare element had only minor applications; for example, by the turn of the century, rhodium-containing thermocouples were used to measure temperatures up to 1800\u00a0\u00b0C. They have exceptionally good stability in the temperature range of 1300 to 1800\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.\nCharacteristics.\nRhodium is a hard, silvery, durable metal that has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not normally form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.\nRhodium belongs to group 9 of the periodic table, but exhibits an atypical ground state valence electron configuration for that group, having only one electron in its outermost \"s\" orbital. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46).\nChemical properties.\nThe common oxidation states of rhodium are +3 and +1. Oxidation states 0, +2, and +4 are also well known. A few complexes at still higher oxidation states are known.\nThe rhodium oxides include Rh2O3, RhO2, RhO2\u00b7\"x\"H2O, Na2RhO3, Sr3LiRhO6 and Sr3NaRhO6. None are of technological significance.\nAll the Rh(III) halides are known but the hydrated trichloride is most frequently encountered. It is also available in an anhydrous form, which is somewhat refractory. Other rhodium(III) chlorides include sodium hexachlororhodate, , and pentaamminechlororhodium dichloride, . They are used in the recycling and purification of this very expensive metal. Heating a methanolic solution of hydrated rhodium trichloride with sodium acetate give the blue-green rhodium(II) acetate, , which features a Rh-Rh bond. This complex and related rhodium(II) trifluoroacetate have attracted attention as catalysts for cyclopropanation reactions. Hydrated rhodium trichloride is reduced by carbon monoxide, ethylene, and trifluorophosphine to give rhodium(I) complexes (L = CO, ). When treated with triphenylphosphine, hydrated rhodium trichloride converts to the maroon-colored , which is known as Wilkinson's catalyst. Reduction of rhodium carbonyl chloride gives hexarhodium hexadecacarbonyl, , and tetrarhodium dodecacarbonyl, , the two most common Rh(0) complexes.\nAs for other metals, rhodium forms high oxidation state binary fluorides. These include rhodium pentafluoride, a tetrameric complex with the true formula ) and rhodium hexafluoride.\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring rhodium is composed of only one isotope, 103Rh. The most stable radioisotopes are 101Rh with a half-life of 4.07 years, 102Rh with a half-life of 207 days, and 99Rh with a half-life of 16.1 days. Thirty other radioisotopes have been characterized ranging from 89Rh to 122Rh - these have half-lives that are less than an hour except 100Rh (20.8 hours) and 105Rh (35.34 hours). Numerous meta states are also found; those of notable stability being 102mRh (3.742 years) and 101mRh (4.343 days).\nIn isotopes less than 103 (the stable isotope), the primary decay mode is electron capture and the primary decay product is ruthenium. In isotopes greater than 103, the primary decay mode is beta emission and the primary product is palladium.\nOccurrence.\nRhodium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust, comprising an estimated 0.0002 parts per million (2 \u00d7 10\u221210). Its rarity affects its price and its use in commercial applications. The concentration of rhodium in nickel meteorites is typically 1 part per billion. Rhodium has been measured in some potatoes with concentrations between 0.8 and 30 ppt.\nMining and price.\nRhodium ores are a mixture with other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold. Few rhodium minerals are known. The separation of rhodium from the other metals poses significant challenges. Principal sources are located in South Africa, river sands of the Ural Mountains in Russia, and in North America, especially the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the rhodium abundance at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.\nThe main exporter of rhodium is South Africa (approximately 80% in 2010) followed by Russia. The annual world production is 30 tonnes. The price of rhodium is highly variable.\nUsed nuclear fuels.\nRhodium is a fission product of uranium-235: each kilogram of fission product contains a significant amount of the lighter platinum group metals. Used nuclear fuel is therefore a potential source of rhodium, but the extraction is complex and expensive, and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope (101Rh with a half-life of 3.3 years, and 102mRh with a half-life of 2.9 years), or about 10 years. These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.\nApplications.\nThe primary use of this element is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, changing harmful unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions into less noxious gases. Of 30,000\u00a0kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in 2012, 81% (24,300\u00a0kg) went into this application, and 8,060\u00a0kg was recovered from old converters. About 964\u00a0kg of rhodium was used in the glass industry, mostly for production of fiberglass and flat-panel glass, and 2,520\u00a0kg was used in the chemical industry.\nIn 2008, net demand (with the recycling accounted for) of rhodium for automotive converters made up 84% of the world usage, with the number fluctuating around 80% in 2015\u22122021.\nCarbonylation.\nRhodium catalysts are used in some industrial processes, notably those involving carbon monoxide. In the Monsanto process, rhodium iodides catalyze the carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid. This technology has been significantly displaced by the iridium-based Cativa process, which effects the same conversion but more efficiently. Rhodium-based complexes are the dominant catalysts for hydroformylation, which converts alkenes to aldehydes according to the following equation:\nRh-based hydroformylation underpins the industrial production of products as diverse as detergents, fragrances, and some drugs. Originally hydroformylation relied on much cheaper cobalt carbonyl-based catalysts, but that technology has largely been eclipsed by rhodium-based catalysts despite the cost differential.\nRhodium is also known to catalyze many reactions involving hydrogen gas and hydrosilanes. These include hydrogenations and hydrosilylations of alkenes. Rhodium metal, but not rhodium complexes, catalyzes the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane.\nOrnamental uses.\nRhodium finds use in jewelry and for decorations. It is electroplated on white gold and platinum to give it a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate. Rhodium has also been used for honors or to signify elite status, when more commonly used metals such as silver, gold or platinum were deemed insufficient. In 1979 the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" gave Paul McCartney a rhodium-plated disc for being history's all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist.\nOther uses.\nRhodium is used as an alloying agent for hardening and improving the corrosion resistance of platinum and palladium. These alloys are used in furnace windings, bushings for glass fiber production, thermocouple elements, electrodes for aircraft spark plugs, and laboratory crucibles. Other uses include:\nIn automobile manufacturing, rhodium is also used in the construction of headlight reflectors.\nPrecautions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nBeing a noble metal, pure rhodium is inert and harmless in elemental form. However, chemical complexes of rhodium can be reactive. For rhodium chloride, the median lethal dose (LD50) for rats is 198\u00a0mg (RhCl3) per kilogram of body weight. Like the other noble metals, rhodium has not been found to serve any biological function.\nPeople can be exposed to rhodium in the workplace by inhalation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specified the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for rhodium exposure in the workplace at 0.1\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL), at the same level. At levels of 100\u00a0mg/m3, rhodium is immediately dangerous to life or health. For soluble compounds, the PEL and REL are both 0.001\u00a0mg/m3.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the sixth element in group\u00a02 of the periodic table, also known as the alkaline earth metals. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) upon exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are radioactive, the most stable isotope being radium-226 with a half-life of 1,600\u00a0years. When radium decays, it emits ionizing radiation as a by-product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence. For this property, it was widely used in self-luminous paints following its discovery. Of the radioactive elements that occur in quantity, radium is considered particularly toxic, and it is carcinogenic due to the radioactivity of both it and its immediate decay product radon as well as its tendency to accumulate in the bones.\nRadium, in the form of radium chloride, was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898 from ore mined at J\u00e1chymov. They extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later. Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1910, and soon afterwards the metal started being produced on larger scales in Austria, the United States, and Belgium. However, the amount of radium produced globally has always been small in comparison to other elements, and by the 2010s, annual production of radium, mainly via extraction from spent nuclear fuel, was less than 100 grams.\nIn nature, radium is found in uranium ores in quantities as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite, and in thorium ores in trace amounts. Radium is not necessary for living organisms, and its radioactivity and chemical reactivity make adverse health effects likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes because of its chemical mimicry of calcium, due to them both being group 2 elements. As of 2018, other than in nuclear medicine, radium has no commercial applications. Formerly, from the 1910s to the 1970s, it was used as a radioactive source for radioluminescent devices and also in radioactive quackery for its supposed curative power. In nearly all of its applications, radium has been replaced with less dangerous radioisotopes, with one of its few remaining non-medical uses being the production of actinium in nuclear reactors. \nBulk properties.\nRadium is the heaviest known alkaline earth metal and is the only radioactive member of its group. Its physical and chemical properties most closely resemble its lighter congener, barium.\nPure radium is a volatile, lustrous silvery-white metal, even though its lighter congeners calcium, strontium, and barium have a slight yellow tint. Radium's lustrous surface rapidly becomes black upon exposure to air, likely due to the formation of radium nitride (Ra3N2). Its melting point is either or and its boiling point is ; however, this is not well established. Both of these values are slightly lower than those of barium, confirming periodic trends down the group\u00a02 elements.\nLike barium and the alkali metals, radium crystallizes in the body-centered cubic structure at standard temperature and pressure: the radium\u2013radium bond distance is 514.8\u00a0picometers.\nRadium has a density of 5.5\u00a0g/cm3, higher than that of barium, and the two elements have similar crystal structures (bcc at standard temperature and pressure).\nIsotopes.\nRadium has 33\u00a0known isotopes with mass numbers from 202 to 234, all of which are radioactive. Four of these \u2013 223Ra (half-life 11.4\u00a0days), 224Ra (3.64\u00a0days), 226Ra (1600\u00a0years), and 228Ra (5.75\u00a0years) \u2013 occur naturally in the decay chains of primordial thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 (223Ra from uranium-235, 226Ra from uranium-238, and the other two from thorium-232). These isotopes nevertheless still have half-lives too short to be primordial radionuclides, and only exist in nature from these decay chains.\nTogether with the mostly artificial 225Ra (15\u00a0d), which occurs in nature only as a decay product of minute traces of neptunium-237,\nthese are the five most stable isotopes of radium. All other 27\u00a0known radium isotopes have half-lives under two hours, and the majority have half-lives under a minute. Of these, 221Ra (half-life 28\u00a0s) also occurs as a 237Np daughter, and 220Ra and 222Ra would be produced by the still-unobserved double beta decay of natural radon isotopes. At least 12\u00a0nuclear isomers have been reported, the most stable of which is radium-205m with a half-life between 130~230\u00a0milliseconds; this is still shorter than twenty-four ground-state radium isotopes.\n226Ra is the most stable isotope of radium and is the last isotope in the decay chain of uranium-238 with a half-life of over a millennium; it makes up almost all of natural radium. Its immediate decay product is the dense radioactive noble gas radon (specifically the isotope 222Rn), which is responsible for much of the danger of environmental radium. It is 2.7\u00a0million times more radioactive than the same molar amount of natural uranium (mostly uranium-238), due to its proportionally shorter half-life.\nA sample of radium metal maintains itself at a higher temperature than its surroundings because of the radiation it emits. Natural radium (which is mostly 226Ra) emits mostly alpha particles, but other steps in its decay chain (the uranium or radium series) emit alpha or beta particles, and almost all particle emissions are accompanied by gamma rays.\nExperimental nuclear physics studies have shown that nuclei of several radium isotopes, such as 222Ra, 224Ra and 226Ra, have reflection-asymmetric (\"pear-like\") shapes. In particular, this experimental information on radium-224\nhas been obtained at ISOLDE using a technique called Coulomb excitation.\nChemistry.\nRadium only exhibits the oxidation state of +2 in solution. It forms the colorless Ra2+ cation in aqueous solution, which is highly basic and does not form complexes readily. Most radium compounds are therefore simple ionic compounds, though participation from the 6s and 6p electrons (in addition to the valence 7s electrons) is expected due to relativistic effects and would enhance the covalent character of radium compounds such as RaF2 and RaAt2. For this reason, the standard electrode potential for the half-reaction Ra2+ (aq) + 2e- \u2192 Ra (s) is \u22122.916\u00a0V, even slightly lower than the value \u22122.92\u00a0V for barium, whereas the values had previously smoothly increased down the group (Ca: \u22122.84\u00a0V; Sr: \u22122.89\u00a0V; Ba: \u22122.92\u00a0V). The values for barium and radium are almost exactly the same as those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium.\nCompounds.\nSolid radium compounds are white as radium ions provide no specific coloring, but they gradually turn yellow and then dark over time due to self-radiolysis from radium's alpha decay. Insoluble radium compounds coprecipitate with all barium, most strontium, and most lead compounds.\nRadium oxide (RaO) is poorly characterized, as the reaction of radium with air results in the formation of radium nitride. Radium hydroxide (Ra(OH)2) is formed via the reaction of radium metal with water, and is the most readily soluble among the alkaline earth hydroxides and a stronger base than its barium congener, barium hydroxide. It is also more soluble than actinium hydroxide and thorium hydroxide: these three adjacent hydroxides may be separated by precipitating them with ammonia.\nRadium chloride (RaCl2) is a colorless, luminescent compound. It becomes yellow after some time due to self-damage by the alpha radiation given off by radium when it decays. Small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color. It is soluble in water, though less so than barium chloride, and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of hydrochloric acid. Crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaCl2\u00b72H2O, isomorphous with its barium analog.\nRadium bromide (RaBr2) is also a colorless, luminous compound. In water, it is more soluble than radium chloride. Like radium chloride, crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaBr2\u00b72H2O, isomorphous with its barium analog. The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites nitrogen molecules in the air, making it glow. The alpha particles emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral helium, which builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals. This effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode.\nRadium nitrate (Ra(NO3)2) is a white compound that can be made by dissolving radium carbonate in nitric acid. As the concentration of nitric acid increases, the solubility of radium nitrate decreases, an important property for the chemical purification of radium.\nRadium forms much the same insoluble salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble sulfate (RaSO4, the most insoluble known sulfate), chromate (RaCrO4), carbonate (RaCO3), iodate (Ra(IO3)2), tetrafluoroberyllate (RaBeF4), and nitrate (Ra(NO3)2). With the exception of the carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts, but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally, radium phosphate, oxalate, and sulfite are probably also insoluble, as they coprecipitate with the corresponding insoluble barium salts. The great insolubility of radium sulfate (at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, only 2.1\u00a0mg will dissolve in 1\u00a0kg of water) means that it is one of the less biologically dangerous radium compounds. The large ionic radius of Ra2+ (148\u00a0pm) results in weak ability to form coordination complexes and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.\nOccurrence.\nAll isotopes of radium have half-lives much shorter than the age of the Earth, so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago. Radium nevertheless still occurs in the environment, as the isotopes 223Ra, 224Ra, 226Ra, and 228Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes; since thorium and uranium have very long half-lives, these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay. Of these four isotopes, the longest-lived is 226Ra (half-life 1600\u00a0years), a decay product of natural uranium. Because of its relative longevity, 226Ra is the most common isotope of the element, making up about one part per trillion of the Earth's crust; essentially all natural radium is 226Ra. Thus, radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore uraninite and various other uranium minerals, and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals. One ton of pitchblende typically yields about one seventh of a gram of radium. One kilogram of the Earth's crust contains about 900\u00a0picograms of radium, and one liter of sea water contains about 89\u00a0femtograms of radium.\nHistory.\nRadium was discovered by Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie and her husband Pierre Curie on 21 December 1898 in a uraninite (pitchblende) sample from J\u00e1chymov. While studying the mineral earlier, the Curies removed uranium from it and found that the remaining material was still radioactive. In July 1898, while studying pitchblende, they isolated an element similar to bismuth which turned out to be polonium. They then isolated a radioactive mixture consisting of two components: compounds of barium, which gave a brilliant green flame color, and unknown radioactive compounds which gave carmine spectral lines that had never been documented before. The Curies found the radioactive compounds to be very similar to the barium compounds, except they were less soluble. This discovery made it possible for the Curies to isolate the radioactive compounds and discover a new element in them. The Curies announced their discovery to the French Academy of Sciences on 26 December 1898. The naming of radium dates to about 1899, from the French word \"radium\", formed in Modern Latin from \"radius\" (\"ray\"): this was in recognition of radium's emission of energy in the form of rays. The gaseous emissions of radium, radon, were recognized and studied extensively by Friedrich Ernst Dorn in the early 1900s, though at the time they were characterized as \"radium emanations\".\nIn September 1910, Marie Curie and Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne announced that they had isolated radium as a pure metal through the electrolysis of pure radium chloride (RaCl2) solution using a mercury cathode, producing radium\u2013mercury amalgam. This amalgam was then heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas to remove the mercury, leaving pure radium metal.\nLater that same year, E. Ebler isolated radium metal by thermal decomposition of its azide, Ra(N3)2. Radium metal was first industrially produced at the beginning of the 20th century by Biraco, a subsidiary company of Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga (UMHK) in its Olen plant in Belgium. The metal became an important export of Belgium from 1922 up until World War II.\nThe general historical unit for radioactivity, the curie, is based on the radioactivity of 226Ra. it was originally defined as the radioactivity of one gram of radium-226, but the definition was later refined to be .\nHistorical applications.\nLuminescent paint.\nRadium was formerly used in self-luminous paints for watches, aircraft switches, clocks, and instrument dials and panels. A typical self-luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium. In the mid-1920s, a lawsuit was filed against the United States Radium Corporation by five dying \"Radium Girls\" \u2013 dial painters who had painted radium-based luminous paint on the components of watches and clocks. The dial painters were instructed to lick their brushes to give them a fine point, thereby ingesting radium. Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores, anemia, and bone cancer.\nDuring the litigation, it was determined that the company's scientists and management had taken considerable precautions to protect themselves from the effects of radiation, but it did not seem to protect their employees. Additionally, for several years the companies had attempted to cover up the effects and avoid liability by insisting that the Radium Girls were instead suffering from syphilis.\nAs a result of the lawsuit, and an extensive study by the U.S. Public Health Service, the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear. Radium continued to be used in dials, especially in manufacturing during World War II, but from 1925 onward there were no further injuries to dial painters.\nFrom the 1960s the use of radium paint was discontinued. In many cases luminous dials were implemented with non-radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light; such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light, but the glow fades. Where long-lasting self-luminosity in darkness was required, safer radioactive promethium-147 (half-life 2.6 years) or tritium (half-life 12 years) paint was used; both continue to be used as of 2018. These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time, unlike radium. Tritium as it is used in these applications is considered safer than radium, as it emits very low-energy beta radiation (even lower-energy than the beta radiation emitted by promethium) which cannot penetrate the skin, unlike the gamma radiation emitted by radium isotopes.\nClocks, watches, and instruments dating from the first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint. They are usually no longer luminous; this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600\u00a0years) but to the fluorescence of the zinc sulfide fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium. \nOriginally appearing as white, most radium paint from before the 1960s has tarnished to yellow over time. The radiation dose from an intact device is usually only a hazard when many devices are grouped together or if the device is disassembled or tampered with.\nUse in electron tubes.\nRadium has been used in electron tubes, such as the Western Electric 346B tube. These devices contain a small amount of radium (in the form of radium bromide) to ionize the fill gas, typically a noble gas like neon or argon. This ionization ensures reliable and consistent operation by providing a steady current when a high voltage is applied, enhancing the device's performance and stability. The radium is sealed within a glass envelope with two electrodes, one of which is coated with the radioactive material to create an ion path between the electrodes.\nQuackery.\nRadium was once an additive in products such as cosmetics, soap, razor blades, and even beverages due to its supposed curative powers. Many contemporary products were falsely advertised as being radioactive. Such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects. (See, for instance, \"Radithor\" or \"Revigator\" types of \"radium water\" or \"Standard Radium Solution for Drinking\".) Spas featuring radium-rich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial, such as those in Misasa, Tottori, Japan, though the sources of radioactivity in these spas vary and may be attributed to radon and other radioisotopes.\nMedical and research uses.\nRadium (usually in the form of radium chloride or radium bromide) was used in medicine to produce radon gas, which in turn was used as a cancer treatment. Several of these radon sources were used in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s. However, many treatments that were used in the early 1900s are not used anymore because of the harmful effects radium bromide exposure caused. Some examples of these effects are anaemia, cancer, and genetic mutations. As of 2011, safer gamma emitters such as 60Co, which is less costly and available in larger quantities, are usually used to replace the historical use of radium in this application, but factors including increasing costs of cobalt and risks of keeping radioactive sources on site have led to an increase in the use of linear particle accelerators for the same applications.\nIn the U.S., from 1940 through the 1960s, radium was used in nasopharyngeal radium irradiation, a treatment that was administered to children to treat hearing loss and chronic otitis. The procedure was also administered to airmen and submarine crew to treat barotrauma.\nEarly in the 1900s, biologists used radium to induce mutations and study genetics. As early as 1904, Daniel MacDougal used radium in an attempt to determine whether it could provoke sudden large mutations and cause major evolutionary shifts. Thomas Hunt Morgan used radium to induce changes resulting in white-eyed fruit flies. Nobel-winning biologist Hermann Muller briefly studied the effects of radium on fruit fly mutations before turning to more affordable x-ray experiments.\nProduction.\nUranium had no large scale application in the late 19th century and therefore no large uranium mines existed. In the beginning, the silver mines in J\u00e1chymov, Austria-Hungary (now Czech Republic) were the only large sources for uranium ore. The uranium ore was only a byproduct of the mining activities.\nIn the first extraction of radium, Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, which is similar to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide, followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to minimize impurities of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate (carrying the radium), thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution, the barium and radium were reprecipitated as sulfates; this was then repeated to further purify the mixed sulfate. Some impurities that form insoluble sulfides were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide, followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfates were pure enough, they were once more converted to mixed chlorides; barium and radium thereafter were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the electroscope.\nAfter the isolation of radium by Marie and Pierre Curie from uranium ore from J\u00e1chymov, several scientists started to isolate radium in small quantities. Later, small companies purchased mine tailings from J\u00e1chymov mines and started isolating radium. In 1904, the Austrian government nationalised the mines and stopped exporting raw ore. Until 1912, when radium production increased, radium availability was low.\nThe formation of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries to have access to radium led to a worldwide search for uranium ores. The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s, producing 70\u00a0g total from 1913 to 1920 in Pittsburgh alone.\nThe Curies' process was still used for industrial radium extraction in 1940, but mixed bromides were then used for the fractionation. If the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough, additional barium can be added to carry the radium. These processes were applied to high grade uranium ores but may not have worked well with low grade ores. Small amounts of radium were still extracted from uranium ore by this method of mixed precipitation and ion exchange as late as the 1990s, but as of 2011, it is extracted only from spent nuclear fuel. Pure radium metal is isolated by reducing radium oxide with aluminium metal in a vacuum at 1,200\u00a0\u00b0C.\nIn 1954, the total worldwide supply of purified radium amounted to about . Zaire and Canada were briefly the largest producers of radium in the late 1970s. As of 1997 the chief radium-producing countries were Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and Russia. The annual production of radium compounds was only about 100\u00a0g in total as of 1984; annual production of radium had reduced to less than 100\u00a0g by 2018.\nModern applications.\nRadium is seeing increasing use in the field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics. Symmetry breaking forces scale proportional to formula_1 which makes radium, the heaviest alkaline earth element, well suited for constraining new physics beyond the standard model. Some radium isotopes, such as radium-225, have octupole deformed parity doublets that enhance sensitivity to charge parity violating new physics by two to three orders of magnitude compared to 199Hg.\nRadium is also a promising candidate for trapped ion optical clocks. The radium ion has two subhertz-linewidth transitions from the formula_2 ground state that could serve as the clock transition in an optical clock. A 226Ra+ trapped ion atomic clock has been demonstrated on the formula_2 to formula_4 transition, which has been considered for the creation of a transportable optical clock as all transitions necessary for clock operation can be addressed with direct diode lasers at common wavelengths.\nSome of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties. More recently discovered radioisotopes, such as cobalt-60 and caesium-137, are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters, safer to handle, and available in more concentrated form.\nThe isotope 223Ra was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2013 for use in medicine as a cancer treatment of bone metastasis in the form of a solution including radium-223 chloride. The main indication of treatment is the therapy of bony metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n225Ra has also been used in experiments concerning therapeutic irradiation, as it is the only reasonably long-lived radium isotope which does not have radon as one of its daughters.\nRadium was still used in 2007 as a radiation source in some industrial radiography devices to check for flawed metallic parts, similarly to X-ray imaging. When mixed with beryllium, radium acts as a neutron source. Up until at least 2004, radium-beryllium neutron sources were still sometimes used,\nbut other materials such as polonium and americium have become more common for use in neutron sources. RaBeF4-based (\u03b1, n) neutron sources have been deprecated despite the high number of neutrons they emit (1.84\u00d7106 neutrons per second) in favour of 241Am\u2013Be sources. As of 2011[ [update]], the isotope 226Ra is mainly used to form 227Ac by neutron irradiation in a nuclear reactor.\nHazards.\nRadium is highly radioactive, as is its immediate decay product, radon gas. When ingested, 80% of the ingested radium leaves the body through the feces, while the other 20% goes into the bloodstream, mostly accumulating in the bones. This is because the body treats radium as calcium and deposits it in the bones, where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells. Exposure to radium, internal or external, can cause cancer and other disorders, because radium and radon emit alpha and gamma rays upon their decay, which kill and mutate cells. Radium is generally considered the most toxic of the radioactive elements. \nSome of the biological effects of radium include the first case of \"radium-dermatitis\", reported in 1900, two years after the element's discovery. The French physicist Antoine Becquerel carried a small ampoule of radium in his waistcoat pocket for six hours and reported that his skin became ulcerated. Pierre Curie attached a tube filled with radium to his arm for ten hours, which resulted in the appearance of a skin lesion, suggesting the use of radium to attack cancerous tissue as it had attacked healthy tissue.\nHandling of radium has been blamed for Marie Curie's death, due to aplastic anemia, though analysis of her levels of radium exposure done after her death find them within accepted safe levels and attribute her illness and death to her use of radiography. A significant amount of radium's danger comes from its daughter radon, which as a gas can enter the body far more readily than can its parent radium.\nRegulation.\nThe first published recommendations for protection against radium and radiation in general were made by the British X-ray and Radium Protection Committee and were adopted internationally in 1928 at the first meeting of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), following preliminary guidance written by the R\u00f6ntgen Society. This meeting led to further developments of radiation protection programs coordinated across all countries represented by the commission.\nExposure to radium is still regulated internationally by the ICRP, alongside the World Health Organization. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) publishes safety standards and provides recommendations for the handling of and exposure to radium in its works on naturally occurring radioactive materials and the broader International Basic Safety Standards, which are not enforced by the IAEA but are available for adoption by members of the organization. In addition, in efforts to reduce the quantity of old radiotherapy devices that contain radium, the IAEA has worked since 2022 to manage and recycle disused 226Ra sources.\nIn several countries, further regulations exist and are applied beyond those recommended by the IAEA and ICRP. For example, in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency-defined Maximum Contaminant Level for radium is 5\u00a0pCi/L for drinking water; at the time of the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, the \"tolerance level\" for workers was set at 0.1 micrograms of ingested radium. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration does not specifically set exposure limits for radium, and instead limits ionizing radiation exposure in units of roentgen equivalent man based on the exposed area of the body. Radium sources themselves, rather than worker exposures, are regulated more closely by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which requires licensing for anyone possessing 226Ra with activity of more than 0.01\u00a0\u03bcCi. The particular governing bodies that regulate radioactive materials and nuclear energy are documented by the Nuclear Energy Agency for member countries \u2013 for instance, in the Republic of Korea, the nation's radiation safety standards are managed by the Korea Radioisotope Institute, established in 1985, and the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety, established in 1990 \u2013 and the IAEA leads efforts in establishing governing bodies in locations that do not have government regulations on radioactive materials.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "25603", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25603", "title": "Rhenium", "text": "element with atomic number 75 (Re)\nRhenium is a chemical element; it has symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-gray, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. It has one of the highest melting and boiling points of any element. It resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores. It shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from \u22123 to +7.\nRhenium was originally discovered in 1908 by Masataka Ogawa, but he mistakenly assigned it as element 43 (now known as technetium) rather than element 75 and named it \"nipponium\". It was rediscovered in 1925 by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke and Otto Berg, who gave it its present name. It was named after the river Rhine in Europe, from which the earliest samples had been obtained and worked commercially.\nNickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines. These alloys contain up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element. The second-most important use is as a catalyst: it is an excellent catalyst for hydrogenation and isomerization, and is used for example in catalytic reforming of naphtha for use in gasoline (rheniforming process). Because of the low availability relative to demand, rhenium is expensive, with price reaching an all-time high in 2008\u201309 of US$10,600 per kilogram (US$4,800 per pound). As of 2018, its price had dropped to US$2,844 per kilogram (US$1,290 per pound) due to increased recycling and a drop in demand for rhenium catalysts.\nHistory.\nIn 1908, Japanese chemist Masataka Ogawa announced that he had discovered the 43rd element and named it \"nipponium\" (Np) after Japan (\"Nippon\" in Japanese). In fact, he had found element 75 (rhenium) instead of element 43: both elements are in the same group of the periodic table. Ogawa's work was often incorrectly cited, because some of his key results were published only in Japanese; it is likely that his insistence on searching for element 43 prevented him from considering that he might have found element 75 instead. Just before Ogawa's death in 1930, Kenjiro Kimura analysed Ogawa's sample by X-ray spectroscopy at the Imperial University of Tokyo, and said to a friend that \"it was beautiful rhenium indeed\". He did not reveal this publicly, because under the Japanese university culture before World War II it was frowned upon to point out the mistakes of one's seniors, but the evidence became known to some Japanese news media regardless. As time passed with no repetitions of the experiments or new work on nipponium, Ogawa's claim faded away. The symbol Np was later used for the element neptunium, and the name \"nihonium\", also named after Japan, along with symbol Nh, was later used for element 113. Element 113 was also discovered by a team of Japanese scientists and was named in respectful homage to Ogawa's work. Today, Ogawa's claim is widely accepted as having been the discovery of element 75 in hindsight.\nRhenium ( meaning: \"Rhine\") received its current name when it was rediscovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Noddack, and Otto Berg in Germany. In 1925 they reported that they had detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite. They also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite. In 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of the element by processing 660\u00a0kg of molybdenite. It was estimated in 1968 that 75% of the rhenium metal in the United States was used for research and the development of refractory metal alloys. It took several years from that point before the superalloys became widely used.\nThe original mischaracterization by Ogawa in 1908 and final work in 1925 makes rhenium perhaps the last stable element to be understood. Hafnium was discovered in 1923 and all other new elements discovered since then are radioactive.\nCharacteristics.\nRhenium is a silvery-white metal with one of the highest melting points of all elements, exceeded by only tungsten. (At standard pressure carbon sublimes rather than melts, though its sublimation point is comparable to the melting points of tungsten and rhenium.) It also has one of the highest boiling points of all elements, and the highest among stable elements. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by platinum, iridium and osmium. Rhenium has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure.\nIts usual commercial form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated by pressing and sintering in a vacuum or hydrogen atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90% of the density of the metal. When annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconductive at 10 K; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive around 4\u20138 K, depending on the alloy. Rhenium metal superconducts at .\nIn bulk form and at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the element resists alkalis, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and aqua regia. It will however, react with nitric acid upon heating.\nIsotopes.\nRhenium has one stable isotope, rhenium-185, which nevertheless occurs in minority abundance, a situation found only in two other elements (indium and tellurium). Naturally occurring rhenium is only 37.4% 185Re, and 62.6% 187Re, which is unstable but has a very long half-life (41.6 billion years). A kilogram of natural rhenium emits 1.07\u00a0MBq of radiation due to the presence of this isotope. This lifetime can be greatly affected by the charge state of the rhenium atom. The beta decay of 187Re is used for rhenium\u2013osmium dating of ores. The available energy for this beta decay (2.6\u00a0keV) is the second lowest known among all radionuclides, only behind the decay from 115In to excited 115Sn* (0.147\u00a0keV). The isotope rhenium-186m is notable as being one of the longest lived metastable isotopes with a half-life of around 200,000 years. There are 33 other unstable isotopes that have been recognized, ranging from 160Re to 194Re, the longest-lived of which is 183Re with a half-life of 70 days.\nCompounds.\nRhenium compounds are known for all the oxidation states between \u22123 and +7 except \u22122. The oxidation states +7, +4, and +3 are the most common. Rhenium is most available commercially as salts of perrhenate, including sodium and ammonium perrhenates. These are white, water-soluble compounds. Tetrathioperrhenate anion [ReS4]\u2212 is possible.\nHalides and oxyhalides.\nThe most common rhenium chlorides are ReCl6, ReCl5, ReCl4, and ReCl3. The structures of these compounds often feature extensive Re-Re bonding, which is characteristic of this metal in oxidation states lower than VII. Salts of [Re2Cl8]2\u2212 feature a quadruple metal-metal bond. Although the highest rhenium chloride features Re(VI), fluorine gives the d0 Re(VII) derivative rhenium heptafluoride. Bromides and iodides of rhenium are also well known, including rhenium pentabromide and rhenium tetraiodide.\nLike tungsten and molybdenum, with which it shares chemical similarities, rhenium forms a variety of oxyhalides. The oxychlorides are most common, and include ReOCl4, ReOCl3.\nOxides and sulfides.\nThe most common oxide is the volatile yellow Re2O7. The red rhenium trioxide ReO3 adopts a perovskite-like structure. Other oxides include Re2O5, ReO2, and Re2O3. The sulfides are ReS2 and Re2S7. Perrhenate salts can be converted to tetrathioperrhenate by the action of ammonium hydrosulfide.\nOther compounds.\nRhenium diboride (ReB2) is a hard compound having a hardness similar to that of tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.\nOrganorhenium compounds.\nDirhenium decacarbonyl is the most common entry to organorhenium chemistry. Its reduction with sodium amalgam gives Na[Re(CO)5] with rhenium in the formal oxidation state \u22121. Dirhenium decacarbonyl can be oxidised with bromine to bromopentacarbonylrhenium(I):\nRe2(CO)10 + Br2 \u2192 2 Re(CO)5Br\nReduction of this pentacarbonyl with zinc and acetic acid gives pentacarbonylhydridorhenium:\nRe(CO)5Br + Zn + HOAc \u2192 Re(CO)5H + ZnBr(OAc)\nMethylrhenium trioxide (\"MTO\"), CH3ReO3 is a volatile, colourless solid that has been used as a catalyst in some laboratory experiments. It can be prepared by many routes, a typical method is the reaction of Re2O7 and tetramethyltin:\nRe2O7 + (CH3)4Sn \u2192 CH3ReO3 + (CH3)3SnOReO3\nAnalogous alkyl and aryl derivatives are known. MTO catalyses for the oxidations with hydrogen peroxide. Terminal alkynes yield the corresponding acid or ester, internal alkynes yield diketones, and alkenes give epoxides. MTO also catalyses the conversion of aldehydes and diazoalkanes into an alkene.\nNonahydridorhenate.\nA distinctive derivative of rhenium is nonahydridorhenate, originally thought to be the \"rhenide\" anion, Re\u2212, but actually containing the ReH92- anion in which the oxidation state of rhenium is +7.\nOccurrence.\nRhenium is one of the rarest elements in Earth's crust with an average concentration of 1\u00a0ppb; other sources quote the number of 0.5\u00a0ppb making it the 77th most abundant element in Earth's crust. Rhenium is probably not found free in nature (its possible natural occurrence is uncertain), but occurs in amounts up to 0.2% in the mineral molybdenite (which is primarily molybdenum disulfide), the major commercial source, although single molybdenite samples with up to 1.88% have been found. Chile has the world's largest rhenium reserves, part of the copper ore deposits, and was the leading producer as of 2005. It was only recently (in 1994) that the first rhenium mineral was found and described, a rhenium sulfide mineral (ReS2) condensing from a fumarole on Kudriavy volcano, Iturup island, in the Kuril Islands. Kudriavy discharges up to 20\u201360\u00a0kg rhenium per year mostly in the form of rhenium disulfide. Named rheniite, this rare mineral commands high prices among collectors. \nProduction.\nApproximately 80% of rhenium is extracted from porphyry molybdenum deposits. Some ores contain 0.001% to 0.2% rhenium. Roasting the ore volatilizes rhenium oxides. Rhenium(VII) oxide and perrhenic acid readily dissolve in water; they are leached from flue dusts and gasses and extracted by precipitating with potassium or ammonium chloride as the perrhenate salts, and purified by recrystallization. Total world production is between 40 and 50 tons/year; the main producers are in Chile, the United States, Peru, and Poland. Recycling of used Pt-Re catalyst and special alloys allow the recovery of another 10 tons per year. Prices for the metal rose rapidly in early 2008, from $1000\u2013$2000 per kg in 2003\u20132006 to over $10,000 in February 2008. The metal form is prepared by reducing ammonium perrhenate with hydrogen at high temperatures:\n2 NH4ReO4 + 7 H2 \u2192 2 Re + 8 H2O + 2 NH3\nThere are technologies for the associated extraction of rhenium from productive solutions of underground leaching of uranium ores.\nApplications.\nRhenium is added to high-temperature superalloys that are used to make jet engine parts, using 70% of the worldwide rhenium production. Another major application is in platinum\u2013rhenium catalysts, which are primarily used in making lead-free, high-octane gasoline.\nAlloys.\nThe nickel-based superalloys have improved creep strength with the addition of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium. Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable topologically close packed (TCP) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation superalloys, ruthenium is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new superalloys are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.\nFor 2006, the consumption is given as 28% for General Electric, 28% Rolls-Royce plc and 12% Pratt &amp; Whitney, all for superalloys, whereas the use for catalysts only accounts for 14% and the remaining applications use 18%. In 2006, 77% of rhenium consumption in the United States was in alloys. The rising demand for military jet engines and the constant supply made it necessary to develop superalloys with a lower rhenium content. For example, the newer CFM International CFM56 high-pressure turbine (HPT) blades will use Rene N515 with a rhenium content of 1.5% instead of Rene N5 with 3%.\nRhenium improves the properties of tungsten. Tungsten-rhenium alloys are more ductile at low temperature, allowing them to be more easily machined. The high-temperature stability is also improved. The effect increases with the rhenium concentration, and therefore tungsten alloys are produced with up to 27% of Re, which is the solubility limit. Tungsten-rhenium wire was originally created in efforts to develop a wire that was more ductile after recrystallization. This allows the wire to meet specific performance objectives, including superior vibration resistance, improved ductility, and higher resistivity. One application for the tungsten-rhenium alloys is X-ray sources. The high melting point of both elements, together with their high atomic mass, makes them stable against the prolonged electron impact. Rhenium tungsten alloys are also applied as thermocouples to measure temperatures up to 2200 \u00b0C.\nThe high temperature stability, low vapor pressure, good wear resistance and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self-cleaning electrical contacts. In particular, the discharge that occurs during electrical switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide Re2O7 is volatile (sublimes at ~360\u00a0\u00b0C) and therefore is removed during the discharge.\nRhenium has a high melting point and a low vapor pressure similar to tantalum and tungsten. Therefore, rhenium filaments exhibit a higher stability if the filament is operated not in vacuum, but in oxygen-containing atmosphere. Those filaments are widely used in mass spectrometers, ion gauges and photoflash lamps in photography.\nCatalysts.\nRhenium in the form of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as catalyst for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.\nOther uses.\nThe isotopes 186Re and 188Re are radioactive and are used for treatment of liver cancer. They both have similar penetration depth in tissue (5\u00a0mm for 186Re and 11\u00a0mm for 188Re), but 186Re has the advantage of a longer half-life (90 hours vs. 17 hours).\n188Re is also being used experimentally in a novel treatment of pancreatic cancer where it is delivered by means of the bacterium \"Listeria monocytogenes\". The 188Re isotope is also used for the rhenium-SCT (skin cancer therapy). The treatment uses the isotope's properties as a beta emitter for brachytherapy in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\nRelated by periodic trends, rhenium has a similar chemistry to that of technetium; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium. This is useful for radiopharmacy, where it is difficult to work with technetium \u2013 especially the technetium-99m isotope used in medicine \u2013 due to its expense and short half-life.\nRhenium is used in manufacturing high precision equipment like gyroscopes. Its high density, mechanical stability and corrosion resistance characteristics ensure the equipment's durability and precise performance in demanding conditions. Rhenium cathodes are also used for their stability and precision in spectral analysis.\nRhenium is used in aerospace, nuclear, and electronic industries, and it shows potential for application in medical instrumentation. In the rocket industry, it is used in engine components for booster rockets. Additionally, rhenium was employed in the SP-100 program due to its low-temperature ductility.\nRhenium's stiffness and high melting point makes it a common gasket material for high pressure experiments in diamond anvil cells.\nPrecautions.\nVery little is known about the toxicity of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates, could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself. Only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity; two examples are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an LD50 value of 2800\u00a0mg/kg after seven days (this is very low toxicity, similar to that of table salt) and the rhenium trichloride showed LD50 of 280\u00a0mg/kg.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a radioactive noble gas and is colorless and odorless. Of the three naturally occurring radon isotopes, only 222Rn has a sufficiently long half-life (3.825 days) for it to be released from the soil and rock where it is generated. Radon isotopes are the immediate decay products of radium isotopes. \nThe instability of 222Rn, its most stable isotope, makes radon one of the rarest elements. Radon will be present on Earth for several billion more years despite its short half-life, because it is constantly being produced as a step in the decay chains of 238U and 232Th, both of which are abundant radioactive nuclides with half-lives of at least several billion years. The decay of radon produces many other short-lived nuclides, known as \"radon daughters\", ending at stable isotopes of lead. 222Rn occurs in significant quantities as a step in the normal radioactive decay chain of 238U, also known as the uranium series, which slowly decays into a variety of radioactive nuclides and eventually decays into stable 206Pb. 220Rn occurs in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the decay chain of 232Th, also known as the thorium series, which eventually decays into stable 208Pb. \nRadon was discovered in 1899 by Ernest Rutherford and Robert B. Owens at McGill University in Montreal, and was the fifth radioactive element to be discovered. First known as \"emanation\", the radioactive gas was identified during experiments with radium, thorium oxide, and actinium by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, Rutherford and Owens, and Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne, respectively, and each element's emanation was considered to be a separate substance: radon, thoron, and actinon. Sir William Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray considered that the radioactive emanations may contain a new element of the noble gas family, and isolated \"radium emanation\" in 1909 to determine its properties. In 1911, the element Ramsay and Whytlaw-Gray isolated was accepted by the International Commission for Atomic Weights, and in 1923, the International Committee for Chemical Elements and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) chose radon as the accepted name for the element's most stable isotope, 222Rn; thoron and actinon were also recognized by IUPAC as distinct isotopes of the element.\nA common source of environmental radon is uranium-containing minerals in the ground. Radon can also occur in ground water, such as spring waters and hot springs. Radon trapped in permafrost may be released by climate-change-induced thawing of permafrosts, and radon may also be released into groundwater and the atmosphere following seismic events leading to earthquakes, which has led to its investigation in the field of earthquake prediction. It is possible to test for radon in buildings, and to use techniques such as sub-slab depressurization for mitigation.\nEpidemiological studies have shown a clear association between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer. Radon is a contaminant that affects indoor air quality worldwide. Because radon is denser than air it accumulates in basements and crawlspaces under dwellings.\nAccording to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking, causing 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. About 2,900 of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked. While radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, it is the number one cause among non-smokers, according to EPA policy-oriented estimates. Significant uncertainties exist for the health effects of low-dose exposures. Due to local differences in geology, the level of exposure to radon gas differs by location.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nRadon is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas and therefore is not detectable by human senses alone. At standard temperature and pressure, it forms a monatomic gas with a density of 9.73\u00a0kg/m3, about 8 times the density of the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, 1.217\u00a0kg/m3. It is one of the densest gases at room temperature (a few are denser, e.g. CF3(CF2)2CF3 and WF6) and is the densest of the noble gases. Although colorless at standard temperature and pressure, when cooled below its freezing point of , it emits a brilliant radioluminescence that turns from yellow to orange-red as the temperature lowers. Upon condensation, it glows because of the intense radiation it produces. It is sparingly soluble in water, but more soluble than lighter noble gases. It is appreciably more soluble in organic liquids than in water. Its solubility equation is as follows:\n formula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the molar fraction of radon, formula_3 is the absolute temperature, and formula_4 and formula_5 are solvent constants.\nChemical properties.\nRadon is a member of the zero-valence elements that are called noble gases, and is chemically not very reactive. The inert pair effect stabilizes the 6s shell, making it unavailable for bonding\u2014a consequence only understood within relativistic quantum chemistry. The 3.8-day half-life of 222Rn makes it useful in physical sciences as a natural tracer. Because radon is a gas at standard conditions, unlike its decay-chain parents, it can readily be extracted from them for research.\nIt is inert to most common chemical reactions, such as combustion, because the outer valence shell contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. Its first ionization energy\u2014the minimum energy required to extract one electron from it\u2014is 1037\u00a0kJ/mol. In accordance with periodic trends, radon has a lower electronegativity than the element one period before it, xenon, and is therefore more reactive. Early studies concluded that the stability of radon hydrate should be of the same order as that of the hydrates of chlorine (Cl2) or sulfur dioxide (SO2), and significantly higher than the stability of the hydrate of hydrogen sulfide (H2S).\nBecause of its cost and radioactivity, experimental chemical research is seldom performed with radon, and as a result there are very few reported compounds of radon, all either fluorides or oxides. Radon can be oxidized by powerful oxidizing agents such as fluorine, thus forming radon difluoride (RnF2). It decomposes back to its elements at a temperature of above , and is reduced by water to radon gas and hydrogen fluoride: it may also be reduced back to its elements by hydrogen gas. It has a low volatility and was thought to be RnF2. Because of the short half-life of radon and the radioactivity of its compounds, it has not been possible to study the compound in any detail. Theoretical studies on this molecule predict that it should have a Rn\u2013F bond distance of 2.08\u00a0\u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms (\u00c5), and that the compound is thermodynamically more stable and less volatile than its lighter counterpart xenon difluoride (XeF2). The octahedral molecule RnF6 was predicted to have an even lower enthalpy of formation than the difluoride. The [RnF]+ ion is believed to form by the following reaction:\n Rn (g) + 2 [O2]+[SbF6]- (s) \u2192 [RnF]+[Sb2F11]- (s) + 2 O2 (g)\nFor this reason, antimony pentafluoride together with chlorine trifluoride and N2F2Sb2F11 have been considered for radon gas removal in uranium mines due to the formation of radon\u2013fluorine compounds. Radon compounds can be formed by the decay of radium in radium halides, a reaction that has been used to reduce the amount of radon that escapes from targets during irradiation. Additionally, salts of the [RnF]+ cation with the anions SbF6-, TaF6-, and BiF6- are known. Radon is also oxidised by dioxygen difluoride to RnF2 at .\nRadon oxides are among the few other reported compounds of radon; only the trioxide (RnO3) has been confirmed. The higher fluorides RnF4 and RnF6 have been claimed, are calculated to be stable, but have not been confirmed. They may have been observed in experiments where unknown radon-containing products distilled together with xenon hexafluoride: these may have been RnF4, RnF6, or both. Trace-scale heating of radon with xenon, fluorine, bromine pentafluoride, and either sodium fluoride or nickel fluoride was claimed to produce a higher fluoride as well which hydrolysed to form RnO3. While it has been suggested that these claims were really due to radon precipitating out as the solid complex [RnF][NiF6]2\u2212, the fact that radon coprecipitates from aqueous solution with CsXeO3F has been taken as confirmation that RnO3 was formed, which has been supported by further studies of the hydrolysed solution. That [RnO3F]\u2212 did not form in other experiments may have been due to the high concentration of fluoride used. Electromigration studies also suggest the presence of cationic [HRnO3]+ and anionic [HRnO4]\u2212 forms of radon in weakly acidic aqueous solution (pH &gt; 5), the procedure having previously been validated by examination of the homologous xenon trioxide.\nThe decay technique has also been used. Avrorin et al. reported in 1982 that 212Fr compounds cocrystallised with their caesium analogues appeared to retain chemically bound radon after electron capture; analogies with xenon suggested the formation of RnO3, but this could not be confirmed.\nIt is likely that the difficulty in identifying higher fluorides of radon stems from radon being kinetically hindered from being oxidised beyond the divalent state because of the strong ionicity of radon difluoride (RnF2) and the high positive charge on radon in RnF+; spatial separation of RnF2 molecules may be necessary to clearly identify higher fluorides of radon, of which RnF4 is expected to be more stable than RnF6 due to spin\u2013orbit splitting of the 6p shell of radon (RnIV would have a closed-shell 6s6p configuration). Therefore, while RnF4 should have a similar stability to xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), RnF6 would likely be much less stable than xenon hexafluoride (XeF6): radon hexafluoride would also probably be a regular octahedral molecule, unlike the distorted octahedral structure of XeF6, because of the inert pair effect. Because radon is quite electropositive for a noble gas, it is possible that radon fluorides actually take on highly fluorine-bridged structures and are not volatile. Extrapolation down the noble gas group would suggest also the possible existence of RnO, RnO2, and RnOF4, as well as the first chemically stable noble gas chlorides RnCl2 and RnCl4, but none of these have yet been found.\nRadon carbonyl (RnCO) has been predicted to be stable and to have a linear molecular geometry. The molecules Rn2 and RnXe were found to be significantly stabilized by spin-orbit coupling. Radon caged inside a fullerene has been proposed as a drug for tumors. Despite the existence of Xe(VIII), no Rn(VIII) compounds have been claimed to exist; RnF8 should be highly unstable chemically (XeF8 is thermodynamically unstable).\nRadon reacts with the liquid halogen fluorides ClF, ClF3, ClF5, BrF3, BrF5, and IF7 to form RnF2. In halogen fluoride solution, radon is nonvolatile and exists as the RnF+ and Rn2+ cations; addition of fluoride anions results in the formation of the complexes RnF3- and RnF42-, paralleling the chemistry of beryllium(II) and aluminium(III). The standard electrode potential of the Rn2+/Rn couple has been estimated as +2.0\u00a0V, although there is no evidence for the formation of stable radon ions or compounds in aqueous solution.\nIsotopes.\nRadon has no stable isotopes. Thirty-nine radioactive isotopes have been characterized, with mass numbers ranging from 193 to 231. Six of them, from 217 to 222 inclusive, occur naturally. The most stable isotope is 222Rn (half-life 3.82\u00a0days), which is a decay product of 226Ra, the latter being itself a decay product of 238U. A trace amount of the (highly unstable) isotope 218Rn (half-life about 35\u00a0milliseconds) is also among the daughters of 222Rn. The isotope 216Rn would be produced by the double beta decay of natural 216Po; while energetically possible, this process has however never been seen.\nThree other radon isotopes have a half-life of over an hour: 211Rn (about 15\u00a0hours), 210Rn (2.4\u00a0hours) and 224Rn (about 1.8\u00a0hours). However, none of these three occur naturally. 220Rn, also called thoron, is a natural decay product of the most stable thorium isotope (232Th). It has a half-life of 55.6 seconds and also emits alpha radiation. Similarly, 219Rn is derived from the most stable isotope of actinium (227Ac)\u2014named \"actinon\"\u2014and is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 3.96 seconds. \nDaughters.\n222Rn belongs to the radium and uranium-238 decay chain, and has a half-life of 3.8235 days. Its first four products (excluding marginal decay schemes) are very short-lived, meaning that the corresponding disintegrations are indicative of the initial radon distribution. Its decay goes through the following sequence (only main decay branches shown):\nThe radon equilibrium factor is the ratio between the activity of all short-period radon progenies (which are responsible for most of radon's biological effects), and the activity that would be at equilibrium with the radon parent.\nIf a closed volume is constantly supplied with radon, the concentration of short-lived isotopes will increase until an equilibrium is reached where the overall decay rate of the decay products equals that of the radon itself. The equilibrium factor is 1 when both activities are equal, meaning that the decay products have stayed close to the radon parent long enough for the equilibrium to be reached, within a couple of hours. Under these conditions, each additional pCi/L of radon will increase exposure by 0.01\u00a0\"working level\" (WL, a measure of radioactivity commonly used in mining). These conditions are not always met; in many homes, the equilibrium factor is typically 40%; that is, there will be 0.004\u00a0WL of daughters for each pCi/L of radon in the air. 210Pb takes much longer to come in equilibrium with radon, dependent on environmental factors, but if the environment permits accumulation of dust over extended periods of time, 210Pb and its decay products may contribute to overall radiation levels as well. Several studies on the radioactive equilibrium of elements in the environment find it more useful to use the ratio of other 222Rn decay products with 210Pb, such as 210Po, in measuring overall radiation levels.\nBecause of their electrostatic charge, radon progenies adhere to surfaces or dust particles, whereas gaseous radon does not. Attachment removes them from the air, usually causing the equilibrium factor in the atmosphere to be less than 1. The equilibrium factor is also lowered by air circulation or air filtration devices, and is increased by airborne dust particles, including cigarette smoke. The equilibrium factor found in epidemiological studies is 0.4.\nHistory and etymology.\nRadon was discovered in 1899 by Ernest Rutherford and Robert B. Owens at McGill University in Montreal. It was the fifth radioactive element to be discovered, after uranium, thorium, radium, and polonium. In 1899, Pierre and Marie Curie observed that the gas emitted by radium remained radioactive for a month. Later that year, Rutherford and Owens noticed variations when trying to measure radiation from thorium oxide. Rutherford noticed that the compounds of thorium continuously emit a radioactive gas that remains radioactive for several minutes, and called this gas \"emanation\" (from , to flow out, and , expiration), and later \"thorium emanation\" (\"Th Em\"). In 1900, Friedrich Ernst Dorn reported some experiments in which he noticed that radium compounds emanate a radioactive gas he named \"radium emanation\" (\"Ra Em\"). In 1901, Rutherford and Harriet Brooks demonstrated that the emanations are radioactive, but credited the Curies for the discovery of the element. In 1903, similar emanations were observed from actinium by Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne, and were called \"actinium emanation\" (\"Ac Em\").\nSeveral shortened names were soon suggested for the three emanations: \"exradio\", \"exthorio\", and \"exactinio\" in 1904; \"radon\" (Ro), \"thoron\" (To), and \"akton\" or \"acton\" (Ao) in 1918; \"radeon\", \"thoreon\", and \"actineon\" in 1919, and eventually \"radon\", \"thoron\", and \"actinon\" in 1920. (The name radon is not related to that of the Austrian mathematician Johann Radon.) The likeness of the spectra of these three gases with those of argon, krypton, and xenon, and their observed chemical inertia led Sir William Ramsay to suggest in 1904 that the \"emanations\" might contain a new element of the noble-gas family.\nIn 1909, Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray isolated radon and determined its melting temperature and critical point. Because it does not conform to expected periodic trends, their obtained melting point (the only experimental value) was questioned in 1925 by Friedrich Paneth and E. Rabinowitsch, but \"ab initio\" Monte Carlo simulations from 2018 agree almost exactly with Ramsay and Gray's result. In 1910, they determined its density (that showed it was the heaviest known gas) and its position in the periodic table. They wrote that \"\" (\"the expression 'radium emanation' is very awkward\") and suggested the new name niton (Nt) (from , shining) to emphasize the radioluminescence property, and in 1912 it was accepted by the International Commission for Atomic Weights. In 1923, the International Committee for Chemical Elements and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) chose the name of the most stable isotope, radon, as the name of the element. The isotopes thoron and actinon were later renamed 220Rn and 219Rn. This has caused some confusion in the literature regarding the element's discovery as while Dorn had discovered radon the isotope, he was not the first to discover radon the element.\nAs late as the 1960s, the element was also referred to simply as \"emanation\". The first synthesized compound of radon, radon fluoride, was obtained in 1962. Even today, the word \"radon\" may refer to either the element or its isotope 222Rn, with \"thoron\" remaining in use as a short name for 220Rn to stem this ambiguity. The name \"actinon\" for 219Rn is rarely encountered today, probably due to the short half-life of that isotope.\nThe danger of high exposure to radon in mines, where exposures can reach 1,000,000\u00a0Bq/m3, has long been known. In 1530, Paracelsus described a wasting disease of miners, the \"mala metallorum\", and Georg Agricola recommended ventilation in mines to avoid this mountain sickness (\"Bergsucht\"). In 1879, this condition was identified as lung cancer by Harting and Hesse in their investigation of miners from Schneeberg, Germany. The first major studies with radon and health occurred in the context of uranium mining in the Joachimsthal region of Bohemia. In the US, studies and mitigation only followed decades of health effects on uranium miners of the Southwestern US employed during the early Cold War; standards were not implemented until 1971.\nIn the early 20th century in the US, gold contaminated with the radon daughter 210Pb entered the jewelry industry. This was from gold brachytherapy seeds that had held 222Rn, which were melted down after the radon had decayed.\nThe presence of radon in indoor air was documented as early as 1950. Beginning in the 1970s, research was initiated to address sources of indoor radon, determinants of concentration, health effects, and mitigation approaches. In the US, the problem of indoor radon received widespread publicity and intensified investigation after a widely publicized incident in 1984. During routine monitoring at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant, a worker was found to be contaminated with radioactivity. A high concentration of radon in his home was subsequently identified as responsible.\nOccurrence.\nConcentration units.\nDiscussions of radon concentrations in the environment refer to 222Rn, the decay product of uranium and radium. While the average rate of production of 220Rn (from the thorium decay series) is about the same as that of 222Rn, the amount of 220Rn in the environment is much less than that of 222Rn because of the short half-life of 220Rn (55 seconds, versus 3.8 days respectively).\nRadon concentration in the atmosphere is usually measured in becquerel per cubic meter (Bq/m3), the SI derived unit. Another unit of measurement common in the US is picocuries per liter (pCi/L); 1\u00a0pCi/L = 37\u00a0Bq/m3. Typical domestic exposures average about 48\u00a0Bq/m3 indoors, though this varies widely, and 15\u00a0Bq/m3 outdoors.\nIn the mining industry, the exposure is traditionally measured in \"working level\" (WL), and the cumulative exposure in \"working level month\" (WLM); 1\u00a0WL equals any combination of short-lived 222Rn daughters (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi, and 214Po) in 1 liter of air that releases 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0MeV of potential alpha energy; 1 WL is equivalent to 2.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 joules per cubic meter of air (J/m3). The SI unit of cumulative exposure is expressed in joule-hours per cubic meter (J\u00b7h/m3). One WLM is equivalent to 3.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 J\u00b7h/m3. An exposure to 1\u00a0WL for 1 working-month (170 hours) equals 1\u00a0WLM cumulative exposure. The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends an annual limit of 4.8WLM for miners. Assuming 2000 hours of work per year, this corresponds to a concentration of 1500 \u00a0Bq/m3.\n222Rn decays to 210Pb and other radioisotopes. The levels of 210Pb can be measured. The rate of deposition of this radioisotope is weather-dependent.\nRadon concentrations found in natural environments are much too low to be detected by chemical means. A 1,000\u00a0Bq/m3 (relatively high) concentration corresponds to 0.17\u00a0picogram per cubic meter (pg/m3). The average concentration of radon in the atmosphere is about 6\u00d710-18 molar percent, or about 150 atoms in each milliliter of air. The radon activity of the entire Earth's atmosphere originates from only a few tens of grams of radon, consistently replaced by decay of larger amounts of radium, thorium, and uranium.\nNatural.\nRadon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium-226, which is found in uranium ores, phosphate rock, shales, igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, gneiss, and schist, and to a lesser degree, in common rocks such as limestone. Every square mile of surface soil, to a depth of 6\u00a0inches (2.6\u00a0km2 to a depth of 15\u00a0cm), contains about 1\u00a0gram of radium, which releases radon in small amounts to the atmosphere. It is estimated that 2.4 billion curies (90 EBq) of radon are released from soil annually worldwide. This is equivalent to some .\nRadon concentration can differ widely from place to place. In the open air, it ranges from 1 to 100\u00a0Bq/m3, even less (0.1\u00a0Bq/m3) above the ocean. In caves or ventilated mines, or poorly ventilated houses, its concentration climbs to 20\u20132,000\u00a0Bq/m3.\nRadon concentration can be much higher in mining contexts. Ventilation regulations instruct to maintain radon concentration in uranium mines under the \"working level\", with 95th percentile levels ranging up to nearly 3\u00a0WL (546\u00a0pCi 222Rn per liter of air; 20.2\u00a0kBq/m3, measured from 1976 to 1985).\nThe concentration in the air at the (unventilated) Gastein Healing Gallery averages 43\u00a0kBq/m3 (1.2\u00a0nCi/L) with maximal value of 160\u00a0kBq/m3 (4.3\u00a0nCi/L).\nRadon mostly appears with the radium/uranium series (decay chain) (222Rn), and marginally with the thorium series (220Rn). The element emanates naturally from the ground, and some building materials, all over the world, wherever traces of uranium or thorium are found, and particularly in regions with soils containing granite or shale, which have a higher concentration of uranium. Not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon. Being a rare gas, it usually migrates freely through faults and fragmented soils, and may accumulate in caves or water. Owing to its very short half-life (four days for 222Rn), radon concentration decreases very quickly when the distance from the production area increases. Radon concentration varies greatly with season and atmospheric conditions. For instance, it has been shown to accumulate in the air if there is a meteorological inversion and little wind.\nHigh concentrations of radon can be found in some spring waters and hot springs. The towns of Boulder, Montana; Misasa; Bad Kreuznach, Germany; and the country of Japan have radium-rich springs that emit radon. To be classified as a radon mineral water, radon concentration must be above 2\u00a0nCi/L (74\u00a0kBq/m3). The activity of radon mineral water reaches 2\u00a0MBq/m3 in Merano and 4\u00a0MBq/m3 in Lurisia (Italy).\nNatural radon concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere are so low that radon-rich water in contact with the atmosphere will continually lose radon by volatilization. Hence, ground water has a higher concentration of 222Rn than surface water, because radon is continuously produced by radioactive decay of 226Ra present in rocks. Likewise, the saturated zone of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone because of diffusional losses to the atmosphere.\nIn 1971, Apollo 15 passed above the Aristarchus plateau on the Moon, and detected a significant rise in alpha particles thought to be caused by the decay of 222Rn. The presence of 222Rn has been inferred later from data obtained from the Lunar Prospector alpha particle spectrometer.\nRadon is found in some petroleum. Because radon has a similar pressure and temperature curve to propane, and oil refineries separate petrochemicals based on their boiling points, the piping carrying freshly separated propane in oil refineries can become contaminated because of decaying radon and its products.\nResidues from the petroleum and natural gas industry often contain radium and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich, while the water, oil, and gas from a well often contains radon. Radon decays to form solid radioisotopes that form coatings on the inside of pipework.\nAccumulation in buildings.\nMeasurement of radon levels in the first decades of its discovery was mainly done to determine the presence of radium and uranium in geological surveys. In 1956, most likely the first indoor survey of radon decay products was performed in Sweden, with the intent of estimating the public exposure to radon and its decay products. From 1975 up until 1984, small studies in Sweden, Austria, the United States and Norway aimed to measure radon indoors and in metropolitan areas.\nHigh concentrations of radon in homes were discovered by chance in 1984 after the stringent radiation testing conducted at the new Limerick Generating Station nuclear power plant in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States revealed that Stanley Watras, a construction engineer at the plant, was contaminated by radioactive substances even though the reactor had never been fueled and Watras had been decontaminated each evening. It was determined that radon levels in his home's basement were in excess of 100,000\u00a0Bq/m3 (2.7\u00a0nCi/L); he was told that living in the home was the equivalent of smoking 135 packs of cigarettes a day, and he and his family had increased their risk of developing lung cancer by 13 or 14 percent. The incident dramatized the fact that radon levels in particular dwellings can occasionally be orders of magnitude higher than typical. Since the incident in Pennsylvania, millions of short-term radon measurements have been taken in homes in the United States. Outside the United States, radon measurements are typically performed over the long term.\nIn the United States, typical domestic exposures are of approximately 100\u00a0Bq/m3 (2.7\u00a0pCi/L) indoors. Some level of radon will be found in all buildings. Radon mostly enters a building directly from the soil through the lowest level in the building that is in contact with the ground. High levels of radon in the water supply can also increase indoor radon air levels. Typical entry points of radon into buildings are cracks in solid foundations and walls, construction joints, gaps in suspended floors and around service pipes, cavities inside walls, and the water supply. Radon concentrations in the same place may differ by double/half over one hour, and the concentration in one room of a building may be significantly different from the concentration in an adjoining room.\nThe distribution of radon concentrations will generally differ from room to room, and the readings are averaged according to regulatory protocols. Indoor radon concentration is usually assumed to follow a log-normal distribution on a given territory. Thus, the geometric mean is generally used for estimating the \"average\" radon concentration in an area. The mean concentration ranges from less than 10\u00a0Bq/m3 to over 100\u00a0Bq/m3 in some European countries.\nSome of the highest radon hazard in the US is found in Iowa and in the Appalachian Mountain areas in southeastern Pennsylvania. Iowa has the highest average radon concentrations in the US due to significant glaciation that ground the granitic rocks from the Canadian Shield and deposited it as soils making up the rich Iowa farmland. Many cities within the state, such as Iowa City, have passed requirements for radon-resistant construction in new homes. The second highest readings in Ireland were found in office buildings in the Irish town of Mallow, County Cork, prompting local fears regarding lung cancer.\nSince radon is a colorless, odorless gas, the only way to know how much is present in the air or water is to perform tests. In the US, radon test kits are available to the public at retail stores, such as hardware stores, for home use, and testing is available through licensed professionals, who are often home inspectors. Efforts to reduce indoor radon levels are called radon mitigation. In the US, the EPA recommends all houses be tested for radon. In the UK, under the Housing Health &amp; Safety Rating System, property owners have an obligation to evaluate potential risks and hazards to health and safety in a residential property. Alpha-radiation monitoring over the long term is a method of testing for radon that is more common in countries outside the United States.\nIndustrial production.\nRadon is obtained as a by-product of uraniferous ores processing after transferring into 1% solutions of hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids. The gas mixture extracted from the solutions contains H2, O2, He, Rn, CO2, H2O and hydrocarbons. The mixture is purified by passing it over copper at to remove the H2 and the O2, and then KOH and P2O5 are used to remove the acids and moisture by sorption. Radon is condensed by liquid nitrogen and purified from residue gases by sublimation.\nRadon commercialization is regulated, but it is available in small quantities for the calibration of 222Rn measurement systems. In 2008 it was priced at almost US$ per milliliter of radium solution (which only contains about 15 picograms of actual radon at any given moment). Radon is produced commercially by a solution of radium-226 (half-life of 1,600 years). Radium-226 decays by alpha-particle emission, producing radon that collects over samples of radium-226 at a rate of about 1\u00a0mm3/day per gram of radium; equilibrium is quickly achieved and radon is produced in a steady flow, with an activity equal to that of the radium (50\u00a0Bq). Gaseous 222Rn (half-life of about four days) escapes from the capsule through diffusion. Radon sources have also been produced for scientific purposes through the implantation of radium-226 into solid stainless steel.\nApplications.\nMedical.\nHormesis.\nAn early-20th-century form of quackery was the treatment of maladies in a radiotorium. It was a small, sealed room for patients to be exposed to radon for its \"medicinal effects\". The carcinogenic nature of radon due to its ionizing radiation became apparent later. Radon's molecule-damaging radioactivity has been used to kill cancerous cells, but it does not increase the health of healthy cells. The ionizing radiation causes the formation of free radicals, which results in cell damage, causing increased rates of illness, including cancer.\nExposure to radon has been suggested to mitigate autoimmune diseases such as arthritis in a process known as radiation hormesis. As a result, in the late 20th century and early 21st century, \"health mines\" established in Basin, Montana, attracted people seeking relief from health problems such as arthritis through limited exposure to radioactive mine water and radon. The practice is discouraged because of the well-documented ill effects of high doses of radiation on the body.\nRadioactive water baths have been applied since 1906 in J\u00e1chymov, Czech Republic, but even before radon discovery they were used in Bad Gastein, Austria. Radium-rich springs are also used in traditional Japanese onsen in Misasa, Tottori Prefecture. Drinking therapy is applied in Bad Brambach, Germany, and during the early 20th century, water from springs with radon in them was bottled and sold (this water had little to no radon in it by the time it got to consumers due to radon's short half-life). Inhalation therapy is carried out in Gasteiner-Heilstollen, Austria; \u015awierad\u00f3w-Zdr\u00f3j, Czerniawa-Zdr\u00f3j, Kowary, L\u0105dek-Zdr\u00f3j, Poland; Harghita B\u0103i, Romania; and Boulder, Montana. In the US and Europe, there are several \"radon spas\", where people sit for minutes or hours in a high-radon atmosphere, such as at Bad Schmiedeberg, Germany.\nNuclear medicine.\nRadon has been produced commercially for use in radiation therapy, but for the most part has been replaced by radionuclides made in particle accelerators and nuclear reactors. Radon has been used in implantable seeds, made of gold or glass, primarily used to treat cancers, known as brachytherapy. The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source, the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting. The gold layer keeps the radon within, and filters out the alpha and beta radiations, while allowing the gamma rays to escape (which kill the diseased tissue). The activities might range from 0.05 to 5 millicuries per seed (2 to 200\u00a0MBq). The gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short-lived elements of its decay chain (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi, 214Po).\nAfter 11 half-lives (42 days), radon radioactivity is at 1/2,048 of its original level. At this stage, the predominant residual activity of the seed originates from the radon decay product 210Pb, whose half-life (22.3 years) is 2,000 times that of radon and its descendants 210Bi and 210Po.\n211Rn can be used to generate 211At, which has uses in targeted alpha therapy.\nScientific.\nRadon emanation from the soil varies with soil type and with surface uranium content, so outdoor radon concentrations can be used to track air masses to a limited degree. Because of radon's rapid loss to air and comparatively rapid decay, radon is used in hydrologic research that studies the interaction between groundwater and streams. Any significant concentration of radon in a river may be an indicator that there are local inputs of groundwater.\nRadon soil concentration has been used to map buried close-subsurface geological faults because concentrations are generally higher over the faults. Similarly, it has found some limited use in prospecting for geothermal gradients.\nSome researchers have investigated changes in groundwater radon concentrations for earthquake prediction. Increases in radon were noted before the 1966 Tashkent and 1994 Mindoro earthquakes. Radon has a half-life of approximately 3.8 days, which means that it can be found only shortly after it has been produced in the radioactive decay chain. For this reason, it has been hypothesized that increases in radon concentration is due to the generation of new cracks underground, which would allow increased groundwater circulation, flushing out radon. The generation of new cracks might not unreasonably be assumed to precede major earthquakes. In the 1970s and 1980s, scientific measurements of radon emissions near faults found that earthquakes often occurred with no radon signal, and radon was often detected with no earthquake to follow. It was then dismissed by many as an unreliable indicator. As of 2009, it was under investigation as a possible earthquake precursor by NASA; further research into the subject has suggested that abnormalities in atmospheric radon concentrations can be an indicator of seismic movement.\nRadon is a known pollutant emitted from geothermal power stations because it is present in the material pumped from deep underground. It disperses rapidly, and no radiological hazard has been demonstrated in various investigations. In addition, typical systems re-inject the material deep underground rather than releasing it at the surface, so its environmental impact is minimal. In 1989, a survey of the collective dose received due to radon in geothermal fluids was measured at 2 man-sieverts per gigawatt-year of electricity produced, in comparison to the 2.5 man-sieverts per gigawatt-year produced from 14C emissions in nuclear power plants.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, radon produced from a radium source was used for industrial radiography. Other X-ray sources such as 60Co and 192Ir became available after World War II and quickly replaced radium and thus radon for this purpose, being of lower cost and hazard.\nHealth risks.\nIn mines.\nSince that time, ventilation and other measures have been used to reduce radon levels in most affected mines that continue to operate. In recent years, the average annual exposure of uranium miners has fallen to levels similar to the concentrations inhaled in some homes. This has reduced the risk of occupationally induced cancer from radon, although health issues may persist for those who are currently employed in affected mines and for those who have been employed in them in the past. As the relative risk for miners has decreased, so has the ability to detect excess risks among that population.\nResidues from processing of uranium ore can also be a source of radon. Radon resulting from the high radium content in uncovered dumps and tailing ponds can be easily released into the atmosphere and affect people living in the vicinity. The release of radon may be mitigated by covering tailings with soil or clay, though other decay products may leach into groundwater supplies.\nNon-uranium mines may pose higher risks of radon exposure, as workers are not continuously monitored for radiation, and regulations specific to uranium mines do not apply. A review of radon level measurements across non-uranium mines found the highest concentrations of radon in non-metal mines, such as phosphorus and salt mines. However, older or abandoned uranium mines without ventilation may still have extremely high radon levels.\nIn addition to lung cancer, researchers have theorized a possible increased risk of leukemia due to radon exposure. Empirical support from studies of the general population is inconsistent; a study of uranium miners found a correlation between radon exposure and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and current research supports a link between indoor radon exposure and poor health outcomes (i.e., an increased risk of lung cancer or childhood leukemia). Legal actions taken by those involved in nuclear industries, including miners, millers, transporters, nuclear site workers, and their respective unions have resulted in compensation for those affected by radon and radiation exposure under programs such as the compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases (in the United Kingdom) and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (in the United States).\nDomestic-level exposure.\nRadon has been considered the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States and leading environmental cause of cancer mortality by the EPA, with the first one being smoking. Others have reached similar conclusions for the United Kingdom and France. Radon exposure in buildings may arise from subsurface rock formations and certain building materials (e.g., some granites). The greatest risk of radon exposure arises in buildings that are airtight, insufficiently ventilated, and have foundation leaks that allow air from the soil into basements and dwelling rooms. In some regions, such as Ni\u0161ka Banja, Serbia and Ullensvang, Norway, outdoor radon concentrations may be exceptionally high, though compared to indoors, where people spend more time and air is not dispersed and exchanged as often, outdoor exposure to radon is not considered a significant health risk.\nRadon exposure (mostly radon daughters) has been linked to lung cancer in case-control studies performed in the US, Europe and China. There are approximately 21,000 deaths per year in the US (0.0063% of a population of 333 million) due to radon-induced lung cancers. In Europe, 2% of all cancers have been attributed to radon; in Slovenia in particular, a country with a high concentration of radon, about 120 people (0.0057% of a population of 2.11 million) die yearly because of radon. One of the most comprehensive radon studies performed in the US by epidemiologist R. William Field and colleagues found a 50% increased lung cancer risk even at the protracted exposures at the EPA's action level of 4\u00a0pCi/L. North American and European pooled analyses further support these findings. However, the conclusion that exposure to low levels of radon leads to elevated risk of lung cancer has been disputed, and analyses of the literature point towards elevated risk only when radon accumulates indoors and at levels above 100\u00a0Bq/m3.\nThoron (220Rn) is less studied than {{Sup|222}}Rn in regards to domestic exposure due to its shorter half-life. However, it has been measured at comparatively high concentrations in buildings with earthen architecture, such as traditional half-timbered houses and modern houses with clay wall finishes, and in regions with thorium- and monazite-rich soil and sand. Thoron is a minor contributor to the overall radiation dose received due to indoor radon exposure, and can interfere with {{Sup|222}}Rn measurements when not taken into account.\nAction and reference level.\nWHO presented in 2009 a recommended reference level (the national reference level), 100\u00a0Bq/m3, for radon in dwellings. The recommendation also says that where this is not possible, 300\u00a0Bq/m3 should be selected as the highest level. A national reference level should not be a limit, but should represent the maximum acceptable annual average radon concentration in a dwelling.\nThe actionable concentration of radon in a home varies depending on the organization doing the recommendation, for example, the EPA encourages that action be taken at concentrations as low as 74\u00a0Bq/m3 (2\u00a0pCi/L), and the European Union recommends action be taken when concentrations reach 400\u00a0Bq/m3 (11\u00a0pCi/L) for old houses and 200\u00a0Bq/m3 (5\u00a0pCi/L) for new ones. On 8 July 2010, the UK's Health Protection Agency issued new advice setting a \"Target Level\" of 100\u00a0Bq/m3 whilst retaining an \"Action Level\" of 200\u00a0Bq/m3. Similar levels (as in the UK) are published by Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (DSA) with the maximum limit for schools, kindergartens, and new dwellings set at 200\u00a0Bq/m3, where 100\u00a0Bq/m3 is set as the action level.\nInhalation and smoking.\nResults from epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer increases with exposure to residential radon. A well known example of source of error is smoking, the main risk factor for lung cancer. In the US, cigarette smoking is estimated to cause 80% to 90% of all lung cancers.\nAccording to the EPA, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is significant due to synergistic effects of radon and smoking. For this population about 62 people in a total of 1,000 will die of lung cancer compared to 7 people in a total of 1,000 for people who have never smoked. It cannot be excluded that the risk of non-smokers should be primarily explained by an effect of radon.\nRadon, like other known or suspected external risk factors for lung cancer, is a threat for smokers and former smokers. This was demonstrated by the European pooling study. A commentary to the pooling study stated: \"it is not appropriate to talk simply of a risk from radon in homes. The risk is from smoking, compounded by a synergistic effect of radon for smokers. Without smoking, the effect seems to be so small as to be insignificant.\"\nAccording to the European pooling study, there is a difference in risk for the histological subtypes of lung cancer and radon exposure. Small-cell lung carcinoma, which has a high correlation with smoking, has a higher risk after radon exposure. For other histological subtypes such as adenocarcinoma, the type that primarily affects non-smokers, the risk from radon appears to be lower.\nA study of radiation from post-mastectomy radiotherapy shows that the simple models previously used to assess the combined and separate risks from radiation and smoking need to be developed. This is also supported by new discussion about the calculation method, the linear no-threshold model, which routinely has been used.\nA study from 2001, which included 436 non-smokers with lung cancer and a control group of 1649 non-smokers without lung cancer, showed that exposure to radon increased the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers. The group that had been exposed to tobacco smoke in the home appeared to have a much higher risk, while those who were not exposed to passive smoking did not show any increased risk with increasing radon exposure.\nAbsorption and ingestion from water.\nThe effects of radon if ingested are unknown, although studies have found that its biological half-life ranges from 30 to 70 minutes, with 90% removal at 100 minutes. In 1999, the US National Research Council investigated the issue of radon in drinking water. The risk associated with ingestion was considered almost negligible; Water from underground sources may contain significant amounts of radon depending on the surrounding rock and soil conditions, whereas surface sources generally do not. Radon is also released from water when temperature is increased, pressure is decreased and when water is aerated. Optimum conditions for radon release and exposure in domestic living from water occurred during showering. Water with a radon concentration of 104\u00a0pCi/L can increase the indoor airborne radon concentration by 1\u00a0pCi/L under normal conditions. However, the concentration of radon released from contaminated groundwater to the air has been measured at 5 orders of magnitude less than the original concentration in water. \nOcean surface concentrations of radon exchange within the atmosphere, causing 222Rn to increase through the air-sea interface. Although areas tested were very shallow, additional measurements in a wide variety of coastal regimes should help define the nature of 222Rn observed.\nTesting and mitigation.\nThere are relatively simple tests for radon gas. In some countries these tests are methodically done in areas of known systematic hazards. Radon detection devices are commercially available. Digital radon detectors provide ongoing measurements giving both daily, weekly, short-term and long-term average readouts via a digital display. Short-term radon test devices used for initial screening purposes are inexpensive, in some cases free. There are important protocols for taking short-term radon tests and it is imperative that they be strictly followed. The kit includes a collector that the user hangs in the lowest habitable floor of the house for two to seven days. The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. Long term kits, taking collections for up to one year or more, are also available. An open-land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins. Radon concentrations can vary daily, and accurate radon exposure estimates require long-term average radon measurements in the spaces where an individual spends a significant amount of time.\nRadon levels fluctuate naturally, due to factors like transient weather conditions, so an initial test might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level. Radon levels are at a maximum during the coolest part of the day when pressure differentials are greatest. Therefore, a high result (over 4\u00a0pCi/L) justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects. Measurements between 4 and 10\u00a0pCi/L warrant a long-term radon test. Measurements over 10\u00a0pCi/L warrant only another short-term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed. The EPA has advised purchasers of real estate to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4\u00a0pCi/L or less.\nBecause the half-life of radon is only 3.8 days, removing or isolating the source will greatly reduce the hazard within a few weeks. Another method of reducing radon levels is to modify the building's ventilation. Generally, the indoor radon concentrations increase as ventilation rates decrease. In a well-ventilated place, the radon concentration tends to align with outdoor values (typically 10\u00a0Bq/m3, ranging from 1 to 100\u00a0Bq/m3).\nThe four principal ways of reducing the amount of radon accumulating in a house are:\nAccording to the EPA, the method to reduce radon \"...primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside\", which is also called sub-slab depressurization, active soil depressurization, or soil suction. Generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub-slab depressurization and exhausting such radon-laden air to the outdoors, away from windows and other building openings. \"[The] EPA generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon. Soil suction, for example, prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe, or pipes, to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted\" and the \"EPA does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because, by itself, sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently\".\nPositive-pressure ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside, and simply exhausting basement air to the outside is not necessarily a viable solution as this can actually draw radon gas into a dwelling. Homes built on a crawl space may benefit from a radon collector installed under a \"radon barrier\" (a sheet of plastic that covers the crawl space). For crawl spaces, the EPA states that \"[a]n effective method to reduce radon levels in crawl space homes involves covering the earth floor with a high-density plastic sheet. A vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors. This form of soil suction is called submembrane suction, and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawl space homes.\""}

{"id": "25609", "revid": "50441158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25609", "title": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology", "text": "University in Stockholm, Sweden\nKTH Royal Institute of Technology (), abbreviated KTH, is a public research university in Stockholm, Sweden. KTH conducts research and education in engineering and technology and is Sweden's largest technical university. Since 2018, KTH consists of five schools with four campuses in and around Stockholm.\nKTH was established in 1827 as the \"Teknologiska institutet\" (Institute of Technology) and had its roots in the \"Mekaniska skolan\" (School of Mechanics) that was established in 1798 in Stockholm. But the origin of KTH dates back to the predecessor of the \"Mekaniska skolan\", the \"Laboratorium mechanicum\", which was established in 1697 by the Swedish scientist and innovator Christopher Polhem. The \"Laboratorium mechanicum\" combined education technology, a laboratory, and an exhibition space for innovations. In 1877, KTH received its current name, \"Kungliga Tekniska h\u00f6gskolan\" (KTH Royal Institute of Technology). The Swedish king, His Majesty Carl XVI Gustaf, is the patron of KTH.\nKTH is ranked 73rd in the world among all universities in the 2024 QS World University Rankings, which is higher than any other university in the Nordic countries.\nHistory.\nKTH's earliest Swedish predecessor was the Laboratorium Mechanicum, a collection of mechanical models for teaching created in 1697 by Christopher Polhem. Polhem is considered to be the father of mechanics in Sweden. He founded the laboratorium as a school and research facility in the engineering field of mechanics after his extensive trips, studies and research abroad. The mechanical models that formed the basis of the education were used intermittently for teaching practical mechanics by different masters until the School of Mechanics (\"Mekaniska skolan\") was founded in 1798. In 1827 the School of Mechanics was transformed into the Technological Institute (\"Teknologiska institutet\"), following the establishment of polytechnical schools in many European countries the early years of the 19th century, often based on the model of \u00c9cole polytechnique in Paris.\nThe institute had one professor in chemistry and one in physics, and one class in mechanical engineering and one in chemical engineering. During the first years, however, teaching was at a very elementary level, and more aimed at craftsmanship rather than engineering as such. The institute was also plagued by conflicts between the faculty and the founder and head of the institute, Gustaf Magnus Schwartz, who was responsible for the artisanal focus of the institute. A government committee was appointed in 1844 to solve the issues, which led to removing Schwartz in 1845. Instead, Joachim \u00c5kerman, the head of the School of Mining in Falun and a former professor of chemistry at KTH, took over. He led a full reorganisation of the institute in 1846\u20131848, after which he returned to his post in Falun. An entrance test and a minimum age of 16 for students was introduced, which led to creating proper engineering training at the institute. In 1851, the engineering program was extended from two years to three.\nIn the late 1850s, the institute entered a time of expansion. In 1863, it received its own purpose-built buildings on Drottninggatan. In 1867, its regulations were again overhauled, to state explicitly that the institute should provide scientific training to its students. In 1869, the School of Mining in Falun was moved to Stockholm and merged with the institute. In 1871, the institute took over the civil engineering course formerly arranged by the Higher Artillery College in Marieberg.\nIn 1877, the name was changed into the current one, which changed KTH's status from Institute (\"institut\") to College (\"h\u00f6gskola\"), and some courses were extended from three years to four. Architecture was also added to the curriculum.\nIn 1915, the degree titles conferred by KTH received legal protection. In the late 19th century, it had become common to use the title \"civilingenj\u00f6r\" (literally \"civil engineer\") for most KTH-trained engineers, and not just those who studied building and construction-related subjects. The only exception was the mining engineers, which called themselves \"bergsingenj\u00f6r\" (\"mountain engineer\"). For a while, the title \"civilingenj\u00f6r\" was equal to \"KTH graduate\" but in 1937, Chalmers in Gothenburg became the second Swedish engineering college which were allowed to confirm these titles.\nIn 1917, the first buildings of KTH's new campus on were completed, and still constitute its main campus.\nAlthough the engineering education of the late 19th and early 20th century were scientifically founded, until the early 20th century, research as such was not seen as a central activity of an Institute of Technology. Those engineering graduates who went on to academic research had to earn their doctorates, typically in physics or chemistry, at a regular university. In 1927, KTH was finally granted the right to confer its own doctorates, under the designation \"Teknologie doktor\" (Doctor of Technology), and the first five doctors were created in 1929.\nIn 1984, the \"civilingenj\u00f6r\" programs at all Swedish universities were extended from four years to 4.5. From 1989, the shorter programs in technology arranged by the municipal polytechnical schools in Sweden were gradually extended and moved into the university system, from 1989 as two-year programs and from 1995 alternatively as three-year programs. For KTH, this meant that additional campuses around the Stockholm area were added.\nIn the present-day, KTH provides one-third of Sweden's research and engineering education. In 2019, there were a total of 13,500 undergraduate students, 1,700 doctoral students, and 3,600 staff members at the university.\nR1 nuclear reactor.\nAfter the American deployment of nuclear weapons at the end of World War II, the Swedish military leadership recognized the need for nuclear weapons to be thoroughly investigated and researched to provide Sweden with the knowledge to defend itself from a nuclear attack. With the mission to \"make something with neutrons\", the Swedish team, with scientists like Rolf Maximilian Sievert, set out to research the subject and eventually build a nuclear reactor for testing.\nAfter a few years of basic research, they started building a 300\u00a0kW (later expanded to 1 MW) reactor, named \"Reaktor 1\" (\"R1\"), in a reactor hall 25 meters under the surface right underneath KTH. Today this might seem ill-considered, since approximately 40,000 people lived within a 1\u00a0km radius. It was risky, but was deemed tolerable since the reactor was an important research tool for scientists at the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (\"Ingenj\u00f6rsvetenskapsakademien\").\nAt 18:59 on 13 July 1954, the reactor achieved criticality and sustained Sweden's first nuclear reaction. R1 was to be the main site for almost all Swedish nuclear research until 1970 when the reactor was finally decommissioned, mostly due to the increased awareness of the risks associated with operating a reactor in a densely populated area of Stockholm.\nMotto.\nThe motto of KTH, \"Vetenskap och konst,\" is directly translated as \"Science and Art.\" Here, the word \"konst\" (art) does not necessarily refer to creative art as the word typically does in its English usage. Rather, \"konst\" paired with \"vetenskap\" (science) more precisely describes the \"konst\" of putting scientific knowledge into practice; that is, through \"ingenj\u00f6rskonst\" (engineering, literally \"art of engineering\"). Hence, another possible translation of the motto is \"Science and the Art of its Application.\"\nSchools.\nKTH is organized into five schools individually responsible for education and research activities. Each of the schools head a number of departments, centres of excellence, and study programmes. The schools are:\nInternational and national ranking.\nOverall rankings.\nKTH was 73rd worldwide in the QS WUR 2024, 97th worldwide in the THE WUR 2024, 201\u2013300th worldwide in ARWU 2022, and 207th worldwide in the USNEWS rankings.\nKTH was the 138th best-ranked university worldwide in 2022 in terms of aggregate performance across QS, THE, and ARWU, as reported by ARTU.\nIt was ranked 3rd in Sweden and 79th worldwide in the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings 2025.\nSubject/Area Rankings.\nIn the QS rankings by subject 2023:\nIn the Times Higher Education subject rankings 2023:\nCampuses.\nKTH Campus.\nKTH Campus is the main campus of KTH located in the area of \u00d6stermalm. The main buildings by architect , were completed in 1917. The bells of the clock-tower were completed ten years later in 1927 at the 10 year anniversary of the transformation of the School of Mechanics to the Technological Institute. The buildings and surroundings were decorated by prominent early 20th-century Swedish artists such as Carl Milles, Axel T\u00f6rneman, Georg Pauli, Tore Strindberg and Ivar Johnsson. The older buildings on the campus were renovated heavily in 1994. While the original campus was large at the time of construction, KTH very soon outgrew it, and the campus has since been expanded with new buildings. KTH Campus is still the base for most of the university's operations.\nKTH Kista.\nIn the 1980s, the predecessor to the current School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (at KTH) located some of their operations to a campus in Kista, Stockholm. Kista is situated north of central Stockholm and is Sweden's largest corporate center and one of the most important ICT clusters in the world. The area is home to over a thousand companies in the ICT sector, for example Ericsson, Volvo, IBM, Tele2, TietoEnator, Microsoft, Intel and Oracle. Since 2025 however, the KTH Kista campus has been closed, and all of its students and faculty moved to the main KTH campus.\nKTH Flemingsberg.\nSince 2002, the current School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health (at KTH) has had a part of its activities in Flemingsberg, Stockholm. Flemingsberg is an area of high academic density and one of northern Europe's most important areas for biotechnology, both in terms of research and industrial activities. S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University and the Karolinska Institute also conducts education and research in Flemingsberg, often in collaboration with KTH.\nKTH S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje.\nKTH S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje was the southernmost and smallest KTH campus, located in the city of S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje. Education at KTH S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje was constantly developed via a close co-operation with the town's business community and in particular major S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje companies such as Scania and AstraZeneca. KTH offered both bachelor's and master's level courses on the campus, mainly focused on mechanical engineering, logistics, production and product development. However since 2025, KTH has elected to close down the campus, moving students and faculty to the main campus. Additionally, students who attend the foundation year program were moved to Flemingsberg.\nKTH Library.\nThe library at the Royal Institute of Technology (\"Kungliga Tekniska h\u00f6gskolans bibliotek\", KTHB) is Sweden's largest library for technology and basic sciences. The foundation for the library was laid in 1827, when KTH was founded in Stockholm. The main library is located on KTH's main campus in central Stockholm. The KTH library is a central academic meeting place at KTH, and an arena for collaboration. The library also has two branch libraries, in Kista and S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje.\nKTH Library supports the academic and digital skills of students and researchers. The library promotes open access publishing and provides the university with analyses that support and make it easier to make strategic decisions. One of the goals is to increase the awareness of KTH's research. The library's main purpose is to strengthen the quality of education and research.\nHistory.\nThe foundation for the library was created in 1827 when the Institute of Technology was founded in Stockholm. The institute's first director, Gustav Magnus Schwartz, made a study trip to France, Germany and England, where he bought books for the institute's library. The first collection of 800 books consisted mainly of books on crafts. In 1845, Professor Joachim \u00c5kerman became the institute's new director. During his time, the library focused entirely on scientific literature. In 1869, Falu Bergsskola was transferred to the institute, and 2 000 books in metallurgy and chemistry were incorporated into the library collection.\nIn 2013, KTH library was visited by US president Barack Obama.\nThe collections.\nThe library currently focuses on electronic books and journals, and it is also responsible for the KTH part of DiVA, the institutional repository for research publications, where all KTH publications are collected.\nThe library has extensive printed collections that have been built up over time. The rare books collection consists of 60,000 volumes from 1827 to 1960 and is located in the main library.\nThe building.\nThe main library is housed in a building from 1917 designed by architect Erik Lallerstedt, who also designed the rest of the university's then new campus. \nThe building was later rebuilt several times, and in the 1950s the former open courtyard was built in. During the period 2000\u20132002, the building was rebuilt according to drawings by architect Per Ahrbom. The extension from the 1950s was demolished and a new entrance and office building with a glass facade were erected. \nThe courtyard is the library's central room, and the rest of the library is grouped around the courtyard. Old facades have been renovated, both towards the courtyard and towards the streets. Inside, the old part of the house has been renovated and regained much of the original architecture.\nThe renovation and extension of the library has won several architectural awards. In 2004, Per Ahrbom was awarded the \"Helgopriset\".\nDirectors.\nThe title was \"\u00f6verdirektor\" first, then \"f\u00f6rest\u00e5ndare\" and from the beginning of the 20th century \"rektor\".\n1825\u20131845: Gustaf Magnus Schwartz\n1845\u20131848: Joachim \u00c5kerman, (acting)\n1848\u20131855: Lars Johan Wallmark\n1856\u20131877(1890): Knut Styffe\n(1856)1877\u20131890: Knut Styffe\n1890\u20131902: Gustaf Robert Dahlander (acting)\n1902\u20131909: Anders Lindstedt\n1909\u20131922: Carl Jacob Magnell\n1922\u20131927: Henning Pleijel\n1927\u20131931: Tore Lindmark\n1931\u20131943: Henrik Kre\u00fcger\n1942: H\u00e5kan Sterky, (acting)\n1943\u20131964: Ragnar Wox\u00e9n\n1964\u20131968: Lennart Stockman\n1968\u20131974: G\u00f6ran Borg\n1974\u20131980: Anders Rasmuson\n1980\u20131988: Gunnar Brodin\n1988\u20131998: Janne Carlsson\n1998\u20132007: Anders Flodstr\u00f6m\n2007: Anders Eriksson\n2007\u20132016: Peter Gudmundson\n2016\u20132022: Sigbritt Karlsson\n2022 -: Anders S\u00f6derholm\nNotable alumni.\nMany prominent former students have attended KTH, including;\nKTH Great Prize.\nKTH Great Prize is a prize annually awarded by KTH.

Together with six other European technical universities, KTH has formed the alliance UNITE! (University Network for Innovation, Technology and Engineering). The aim of the network is to create a trans-European campus, to introduce trans-European curricula, to promote scientific cooperation between the members and to strengthen knowledge transfer between the countries. The alliance includes the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Aalto University, KTH, the Polytechnic University of Turin, the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and the University of Lisbon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In computer science it is typically contrasted to sequential access which requires data to be retrieved in the order it was stored.\nFor example, data might be stored notionally in a single sequence like a row, in two dimensions like rows and columns on a surface, or in multiple dimensions. However, given all the coordinates, a program can access each record about as quickly and easily as any other. In this sense, the choice of datum is arbitrary in the sense that no matter which item is sought, all that is needed to find it is its address, i.e. the coordinates at which it is located, such as its row and column (or its track and record number on a magnetic drum). At first, the term \"random access\" was used because the process had to be capable of finding records no matter in which sequence they were required. However, soon the term \"direct access\" gained favour because one could directly retrieve a record, no matter what its position might be. The operative attribute, however, is that the device can access any required record immediately on demand. The opposite is sequential access, where a remote element takes longer time to access.\nA typical illustration of this distinction is to compare an ancient scroll (sequential; all material prior to the data needed must be unrolled) and the book (direct: can be immediately flipped open to any arbitrary page). A more modern example is a cassette tape (sequential \u2014 one must fast forward through earlier songs to get to later ones) and a CD (direct access \u2014 one can skip to the track wanted, knowing that it would be the one retrieved).\nIn data structures, direct access implies the ability to access any entry in a list in constant time (independent of its position in the list and of the list's size). Very few data structures can make this guarantee other than arrays (and related structures like dynamic arrays). Direct access is required, or at least valuable, in many algorithms such as binary search, integer sorting, or certain versions of sieve of Eratosthenes.\nOther data structures, such as linked lists, sacrifice direct access to permit efficient inserts, deletes, or re-ordering of data. Self-balancing binary search trees may provide an acceptable compromise, where access time is not equal for all members of a collection, but the maximum time to retrieve a given member grows only logarithmically with its size.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
