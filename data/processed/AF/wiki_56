Eisenhower intentionally caused the deaths by starvation or exposure of around a million German prisoners of war held in Western internment camps after the Second World War. \"Other Losses\" charges that hundreds of thousands of German prisoners that had fled the Eastern front were designated as \"Disarmed Enemy Forces\" in order to avoid recognition under the Geneva Convention (1929), for the purpose of carrying out their deaths through disease or slow starvation. \"Other Losses\" cites documents in the U.S. National Archives and interviews with people who stated they witnessed the events. The book claims that a \"method of genocide\" was present in the banning of Red Cross inspectors, the returning of food aid, soldier ration policy, and policy regarding shelter building.\nStephen Ambrose, a now-discredited historian enlisted by the Eisenhower Center for American Studies in 1990 in efforts to preserve Eisenhower's legacy and counteract criticisms of his presidency, and seven other American historians examined the book soon after its publication and concluded that it was inaccurate and pseudohistory. Other historians, including the former senior historian of the United States Army Center of Military History, Colonel Ernest F. Fisher, who was involved in the 1945 investigations into the allegations of misconduct by U.S. troops in Germany and who wrote the book's foreword, argue that the claims are accurate.\nContent.\nThe \"other losses\" statistic.\nThe title of \"Other Losses\" derives from a column of figures in weekly U.S. Army reports that Bacque states actually reflects a body count of German prisoners that died of slow starvation or diseases. The book states that Colonel Philip Lauben, chief of German Affairs Branch at SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force), confirmed that \"other losses\" meant deaths and escapes, with escapes being a minor part. This is supported by a US Army document lodged in the US National Archives which \"plainly states\" that the \"other losses\" category of prisoners was for deaths and escapes. Bacque dismisses claims from his opponents that \"other losses\" meant transfers or discharges, as these are accounted for in other columns in the same tables. Furthermore, there is no separate column in which deaths were recorded.\nThe book refers to the Army Chief Historians report that was published in 1947; in the 20 pages dealing with the capture, transfer and discharge of prisoners, the report makes no mention of releasing prisoners without formal discharge. Furthermore, Bacque cites Army orders from General Eisenhower himself (Disbandment Directive No. 1) stating that every prisoner leaving captivity had to have discharge papers.\nDisarmed Enemy Forces designation.\n\"Other Losses\" states that Eisenhower sought to sidestep the requirements of the Geneva Convention through the designation of these prisoners as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEF), specifically stating that \"in March, as Germany was being cracked\u00a0... a message was being signed and initialed by Eisenhower proposed a startling departure from the Geneva Convention (GC)\u2014the creation of a new class of prisoners who would not be fed by the Army after the surrender of Germany.\"\nThe book states that, against the orders of his superiors, Eisenhower took 2\u00a0million additional prisoners after Germany's surrender that fell under the DEF designation. According to the book, a million of those who died had fled the Eastern front and most likely ended up in Rheinwiesenlager prisoner transit camps run by the United States and French forces where many such prisoners died of disease or starvation under the cover of the DEF designation.\nThe book cites orders from Eisenhower which stipulated that the Germans would be solely responsible for feeding and maintaining the DEFs, however, he then prevented any aid from reaching them.\nBody count of German prisoners.\n\"Other Losses\" contends that nearly one million German prisoners died while being held by the United States and French forces at the end of World War II. Specifically, it states: \"The victims undoubtedly number over 800,000, almost certainly over 900,000 and quite likely over a million. Their deaths were knowingly caused by army officers who had sufficient resources to keep the prisoners alive.\"\n\"Other Losses\" contains an analysis of a medical record that it states supports the conclusion of a prisoner death rate of 30%. Bacque also referred to a 1950 report from the German Red Cross which stated that 1.5 million former German POWs were still officially listed as missing, fate unknown.\nThe book comments that approximately 15% of the deaths in the U.S. camps were from starvation or dehydration and that most deaths were caused by dysentery, pneumonia, or septicaemia, as a result of the unsanitary conditions and lack of medicine. Further, it states that officers from the U.S. Army Medical Corps reported death rates far higher than they had ever seen before.\nThe book states that Eisenhower's staff were complicit in the scheme, and that in order to carry out such a scheme, Eisenhower kept these prisoners in camps far longer than was necessary It states that, by the end of 1945, only 40% of prisoners had been released. \"Other Losses\" further characterizes the 22-volume German \"Maschke\" Commission report investigating the deaths of German prisoners as written by \"client-academics\" as part of a \"cover-up\" of the supposed deaths.\nTreatment of prisoners.\n\"Other Losses\" states that the U.S. dismantled the German welfare agencies, including the German Red Cross, then dismissed the Swiss Government from its role as Protecting Power. No agencies were allowed to visit the camps or provide any assistance to the prisoners, including delegates from ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross), which was a violation of the Geneva Convention. It further states that the only notable protest against this was from William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada.\nBacque comments that the press was also prevented from visiting the camps, and therefore was unable to report on the state of the camps and the condition of the prisoners.\nThe book states that many of the U.S. camps consisted of open fields surrounded by barbed wire, with no shelter or toilet facilities. In these camps prisoners were forced to sleep on the ground in the open, though it claims the U.S. Army had plenty of surplus shelter supplies which could have been issued. No supplies such as blankets were supplied to the prisoners, even though these were in good supply at various locations such as the depot at Naples. In a letter, General Everett Hughes stated that there were \"more stocks than we can ever use; stretch as far as eye can see.\"\nThe book quotes Dr. Konrad Adenauer (later Chancellor of Germany) stating that \"The German prisoners have been penned up for weeks without any protection from the weather, without drinking water, without medical care. They are being held in a manner contrary to all humanitarian principles and flagrantly contrary to the Hague and Geneva Conventions.\"\nBoth J. P. Pradervand (ICRC French Delegation) and Henry Dunning (American Red Cross) sent letters to the State Department condemning the poor treatment of the German prisoners. Colonel Philip Lauben stated that \"The Vosges was just one big death camp.\"\nPrisoner totals.\nAccording to \"Other Losses\", the U.S. Army employed a number of methods to reduce the number of prisoners officially on hand. One method was to accuse the Russians of taking far more prisoners than they reported. Another was the \"midnight shift\", whereby the opening balance of a given week was less than the closing balance of the previous week.\nThe book describes that a \"Missing Million\" prisoners exist in the difference in totals between two U.S. army reports (the last of the daily reports and the first of the weekly reports) issued on June 2, 1945. As a consequence of this, according to Quartermaster's reports the number of rations issued to the camps was reduced by 900,000.\n\"Other Losses\" states that after visiting many of the camps in August 1945, Major General Robert M. Littlejohn (Quartermaster of the ETO) concluded that the U.S. Army was reporting 3.7 million prisoners while it actually possessed 5.2 million, thereby corroborating the conclusions made in a report three months earlier from Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee (in charge of logistics for the ETO), which he had sent to SHAEF headquarters. \"Other Losses\" states that Littlejohn subsequently wrote in a report to Washington that because requisitions for supplies were based on these faulty numbers, 1.5 million prisoners were getting no food.\n\"Other Losses\" states that, three years later, in 1948 the ICRC formally requested documents confirming the total number of prisoners in the U.S. Zone and was eventually told that 3.5 million were there, which omitted approximately 1.7 million from the actual number of 5,224,000.\nFood shortage.\n\"Other Losses\" explicates the 1944\u20131949 German food crisis to support claims for a high mortality rate.\n\"Other Losses\" concludes that the 1945 food crisis in Europe was contrived by Allied forces by the use of restrictive food import policy, including restrictions on Red Cross food deliveries, and other means. It states that Eisenhower purposefully starved German prisoners given that \"[t]here was a lot more wheat available in the combined areas of western Germany, France, Britain, Canada and the USA than there had been in the same year in 1939.\" \"Other Losses\" states that, in May 1945, the ICRC had 100,000 tons of food in storage warehouses in Switzerland. According to the book, when they tried to send trainloads of this food into the U.S. Zone, the U.S. Army sent the trains back, saying their own warehouses were full. \"Other Losses\" states that this prompted Max Huber, head of the ICRC, to send a strong letter of protest to the State Department, in which he described the difficulties placed by SHAEF in the way of the ICRC efforts to provide aid. He said, \"Our responsibility for the proper use of relief supplies placed in our care is incompatible with a restriction to the fulfilment of orders which render us powerless to furnish relief which we ourselves judge necessary.\"\nU.S. Army warehouses had 13.5 million Red Cross food parcels taken from the ICRC, which were never distributed. The book also states that German civilians were prevented from bringing food to the camps, and that Red Cross food parcels were confiscated by SHAEF, and the War Department banned them from being given to the men in the camps. The book states that Bacque found no evidence of a drastic food shortage in the U.S. Army\u00a0\u2014\nReception and criticism.\nThe New Orleans panel.\nAfter the publication of Bacque's book, a panel of eight historians gathered for a symposium in the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the University of New Orleans from December 7\u20138, 1990 to review Bacque's work. In the introduction to a book later published containing each panellists' papers, Steven E. Ambrose noted that Bacque is a Canadian novelist with no previous historical research or writing experience. His introduction concludes that \"\"Other Losses\" is seriously\u2014nay, spectacularly\u2014flawed in its most fundamental aspects.\" The panel comments that, among its many problems, \"Other Losses\":\nAs a consequence of those and other shortcomings, the book \"makes charges that are demonstrably absurd.\" Panel member Stephen Ambrose later wrote in the \"New York Times\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Mr Bacque is wrong on every major charge and nearly all his minor ones. Eisenhower was not a Hitler, he did not run death camps, German prisoners did not die by the hundreds of thousands, there was a severe food shortage in 1945, there was nothing sinister or secret about the \"disarmed enemy forces\" designation or about the column \"other losses.\" Mr Bacque's \"missing million\" were old men and young boys in the Volkssturm (People's Militia) released without formal discharge and transfers of POWs to other allies control areas. Maj. Ruediger Overmans of the German Office of Military History in Freiburg who wrote the final volume of the official German history of the war estimated that the total death by all causes of German prisoners in American hands could not have been greater than 56,000 approximately 1% of the over 5,000,000 German POWs in Allied hands exclusive of the Soviets. Eisenhower's calculations as to how many people he would be required to feed in occupied Germany in 1945-46 were too low and he had been asking for more food shipments since February 1945. He had badly underestimated the number of German soldiers surrendering to the Western Allies; more than five million, instead of the anticipated three million as German soldiers crossed the Elbe River to escape the Russians. So too with German civilians\u2014about 13 million altogether crossing the Elbe to escape the Russians, and the number of slave laborers and displaced persons liberated was almost 8 million instead of the 5 million expected. In short, Eisenhower faced shortages even before he learned that there were at least 17 million more people to feed in Germany than he had expected not to mention all of the other countries in war-ravaged Europe, the Philippines, Okinawa and Japan. All Europe went on rations for the next three years, including Britain, until the food crisis was over. \nHistorians Gunter Bischof and Brian Loring Villa stated that a research report from the panel \"soundly refuted the charges of \"Other Losses\", especially Bacque's fanciful handling of statistics.\" The historians further stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is not necessary to review here Bacque's extravagant statistical claims which are the heart of his conspiracy theory. The eight scholars who gathered in New Orleans and contributed to \"Eisenhower and the German POWs: Facts against Falsehood\" (1992) refuted Bacque's wily misinterpretations of statistics and oral history evidence in detail. Numerous reviews of the book written by the top talent in the military history profession such as John Keegan and Russel Weigley were persuaded by the findings of the book. These findings have since been further solidified by detailed case studies on individual American POW camps in Germany hastily built at the end of the war, like Christof Strauss's exhaustive Heidelberg dissertation on the POW and internment in the Heilbronn camp.\nThe mountain of evidence has been building that Bacque's charge of the \"missing million\" supposedly perishing in the American (and French) POW camps in Germany and France is based on completely faulty interpretation of statistical data. There was never any serious disagreement that the German POWs were treated badly by the U.S. Army and suffered egregiously in these camps in the first weeks after the end of the war. That the chaos of the war's end would also produce potentially mismatches and errors in record keeping should surprise no one either. But there was NO AMERICAN POLICY to starve them to death as Bacque asserts and NO COVER UP either after the war. No question about it, there were individual American camp guards who took revenge on German POWs based on their hatred of the Nazis.\nThe New Orleans panel's book introduction concluded \"[t]hat Bacque is wrong on nearly every major and nearly all his minor charges seem to us to be overwhelmingly obvious. To sum up: Eisenhower was not a Hitler, he did not run death camps, German prisoners did not die by the hundreds of thousands, there was indeed a severe world food shortage in 1945, there was nothing sinister or secret about DEF designation or about the Other Losses column. Bacque's \"Missing Million\" were old and young boys in the militia dismissed early from the American camps; they were escapees from camps and POWs/DEFs transferred from camp to camp in Germany and Europe for various reasons.\"\nVilla states that \"James Bacque's \"Other Losses\" illustrates what happens when the context surrounding historical persons and important events is lost. The effect to give known facts a twist that seems dramatically new in important ways, but this is means the appearance of originality is a little deceptive. For the most part, Bacque's book is not very original at all. When it seems so, the price is purchased at the price of accuracy.\" He further stated that \"[t]hose parts of Other Losses that might rise above a failing grade in an undergraduate term paper are not new. It has long been known that German prisoners of war suffered terribly at the end of World War II, that they died by the thousands after hostilities ceased in the European theater, and that many were required to work as forced laborers for the victors.\" The main lines of the story have long been known, written up for example in the extensive German \"Maschke Commission\" between 1962 and 1975. Villa states that Bacque only adds two \"novel\" propositions: first, that the number that died was in the hundreds of thousands, and seconds, that these deaths were the result of deliberate extermination on the part of Eisenhower. \"The falsity of Bacque's charges can be easily demonstrated once the context, particularly the decision-making environment, is examined.\"\nBischof concludes that just the application of common sense alone refutes many of the most \"fantastical charges\" of Bacque, such as asking the question \"How could a single man order one million men killed without being caught in the heinous act? How could the bodies disappear without one soldier's coming forward in nearly fifty years to relieve his conscience? How could the Americans (almost one-third of whom are by ethnic background German) conspire for so long to cover up such a vast crime?\"\nIn a 1989 \"Time Magazine\" book review, Ambrose did, however, apart from his criticisms of the book, concede that \"We as Americans can't duck the fact that terrible things happened. And they happened at the end of a war we fought for decency and freedom, and they are not excusable.\"\nDocumentary evidence of deaths.\n\"Other Losses\" asserts that roughly a million German prisoners\u2014the \"Missing Million\"\u2014disappeared between two reports issued on June 2, 1945, with one (the last of the daily reports) totaling prisoners in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in U.S. custody at 2,870,400, while the other (the first of the weekly reports) gives the figure as 1,836,000 prisoners in the Communication Zone (COM Z). As a consequence of this, according to Quartermaster Reports the number of rations issued to the camps was reduced by 900,000. Historian Albert Cowdrey states that the reason for this is simply that COM Z is a subordinate of the ETO, and its figures omit prisoners held by other armies. In fact, Cowdrey states that the two documents further both cite exactly the same number of total prisoners in the ETO: 3,193,747. Cowdrey concludes \"[t]o judge by these documents, there was no Missing Million. There was not even a missing one.\"\nThe title of \"Other Losses\" derives from the heading of a column in weekly reports of the U.S. Army's theater provost marshal, which \"Other Losses\" states is actually a \"body count\" of dead prisoners. Cowdrey states that, in many cases, as explained by the footnotes in the very documents themselves, the \"other losses\" were transfers between zones and camps, which were regularly done for a variety of reasons, none of them sinister and all properly noted in the accompanying documents. Cowdrey further states that, not only are these figures many times mentioned in the footnotes, but they are also reflected in the actual increase and decrease in numbers of each camp in the individual army reports. Cowdrey concludes \"it is unclear how Bacque could have failed either to see these documents or, if he saw them, to understand their significance to the book he was writing.\" In addition, while \"Other Losses\" asserts that these prisoners died of diseases or slow starvation, Cowdrey states that even a cursory glance at the figures shows that this would have been impossible, with figures varying between zero and over 189,000 from week to week.\nThe introduction to the book publishing many of the New Orleans panel papers also noted that Bacque ignored the greatest source of for the \"other losses\" column, an August 1945 Report of the Military Governor that states \"An additional group of 664,576 are lists as \" 'other losses' \", consisting largely of members of the Volkssturm [People's Militia] released without a formal charge.\" It stated that Bacque ignored this document despite its presence in the National Archives, the Eisenhower Library and elsewhere. It further stated the dismissal of the Volkssturm (mostly old men and boys) \"accounts for most, quite probably all, of Bacque's 'Missing Million'\". Bischof notes that, in his later American edition of \"Other Losses\", Bacque discredits the document as a fake \"with a further fantastic twist in his convoluted cycle of conspiracy theories, he claims that Eisenhower and the army 'camouflaged' dead POWs/DEFs by listing them as 'discharged Volkssturm.'\" Even though Eisenhower himself did not write the document, Bacque concludes that it must have been \"doctored\".\nOf prisoners in French custody, the historian Rudiger Overmans wrote that, while the total number of prisoners dying in French custody might have exceeded the official statistic of 21,000, no evidence exists that it was hundreds of thousands of deaths higher than that figure, as Bacque claims. Overmans states that, in addition to the various problems with the Bacque's \"death rate\" calculations regarding the Rheinwiesenlager transit camps, he ignores that these camps were managed almost entirely by Germans and claimed that no record existed of the handover of the camps to the French in June and July 1945, when detailed records of the handover exist. Overmans also said that Bacque incorrectly claimed that the United States did nothing to help with the French Rheinwiesenlager camps, when the United States engaged in a large operation to raise the caloric intake of those prisoners. Bacque's claims that the 167,000 in French camps that were \"dus pour des raisons divers\" (other losses) actually died in the winter of 1945\u201346 not only are not supported by the evidence, but they ignore French documents stating that that figure reflects the release of Volkssturm, women and the sick from those camps.\nOvermans states that Bacque's claim that the 800,000 to 1,000,000 missing prisoners were originally German soldiers that fled from the east into western hands contradicts Soviet POW evidence \"well established that we can exclude the idea of an extra million hiding somewhere in the figures.\" Overmans states that Bacque's claim that one million fewer prisoners were taken by the Soviet Union than thought produces absurd results, such as that only 100,000 total prisoners could have died in Soviet hands when it is well documented that this amount was exceeded by the dead prisoners from Stalingrad alone. Bacque claimed that up to 500,000 of the missing prisoners were in Soviet camps. Postwar Soviet POW evidence was discredited when the KGB opened its archives in the 1990s and an additional 356,687 German soldiers and 93,900 civilians, previously recorded as missing, were found to be listed as dying in the Soviet camps. Overmans also states that, did they as Bacque claims, flee to the American Rheinwiesenlager camps, they could have easily had contact with their relatives and that it is \"quite inconceivable that these prisoners would not have been reported as missing by their relatives.\" Overmans states that the vast majority of this extra million would have been recorded in registrations that occurred in 1947\u20131948 and 1950, \"but the registrations showed nothing of the kind.\" Overmans further states that, as evidence that Germans believed that missing veterans were mostly in the west, Bacque relies on a statement by Konrad Adenauer that turns out in the minutes of the purported meeting to be a \"statement related to a TASS report concerning the POWs in the Soviet Union. So much for Bacque's careful use of sources.\"\nPlausibility of avoiding repercussion.\nOvermans states that, comporting with the most basic matters of common sense, \"if indeed 726,000 soldiers had died in the American camps (Bacque's number excluding those who supposedly died in French custody or after discharge), what became of the bodies?\" Given that the Rheinwiesenlager stretched along 200 kilometers of the Rhine river, \"Bacque's 726,000 dead would mean roughly 3,600 dead per kilometer or 5,800 per mile \u2013 better than one corpse per foot. Yet despite the widespread construction work carried out after the war, not a single one of these legions of dead was found.\" However, the sites where the camps were located are considered war graves where excavation is officially forbidden making such research problematical.\nVilla states that, by Bacque's reasoning, George C. Marshall, who gave SHAEF as much or more attention to detail than did Eisenhower, would be similarly guilty, perhaps more so under his reasoning, though \"Bacque\" who cares little for exploring the context, does not even raise the question.\" Villa states that \"It is a virtual impossibility that Eisenhower could have executed an extermination policy on his own\" and \"a near absolute impossibility that Marshall would not have noticed it, let alone that he would ever have tolerated it\" and \"what about the scores of officers and millions of soldiers who served under Eisenhower?\"\n\"Other Losses\" argues that Eisenhower's staff must have been implicated, charging \"[t]he squalor of the camps came from the moral squalor polluting the higher levels of the army.\" Villa states that \"[p]erhaps realizing that he already has a thesis involving a massive American conspiracy, Bacque is careful to exclude British officers from any participation or even knowledge of the crime. Although in his vast indictment, Bacque has included virtually Eisenhower's entire staff, all the doctors and personnel running the camps, the press who failed to uncover the monstrous crime and a whole generation of knowing but silent Germans, he has included not a single Briton.\" Villa notes that Bacque ignores that SHAEF was a fully integrated Anglo-American command, and many of Eisenhower's top officers were Britons who would have also had to cover up the conspiracy. Villa states that Bacque did not even need to read books to realize this, \"all he had to do was to look at the pictures: in slightly more than half the portraits contained therein, the staff officers wear British uniforms. Bacque, one understands, wants a villain in the piece. A complicated modern military bureaucracy such as SHAEF, is a tedious subject to study, unlikely to yield the insidious conspiracy apparently sought by this ex-publisher.\" Villa stated regarding the plausibility of the claims in \"Other Losses\" that \"The impossibility of Bacque's selective crime thesis\u2014[that the poor treatment was solely carried out by Americans]\u2014becomes all the more evident when one examines the basic decisions affecting occupation policy.\"\nRegarding the impossibility of a conspiracy on the scale purported by Bacque, Villa states that \"[i]n truth, had Eisenhower committed the crimes Bacque alleges, someone surely would have gossiped, ratted, leaked, or even just hinted. None did. Not even Field Marshal Montgomery. Certainly, if there had been a holocaust, it could never have been covered up.\" Regarding the overall bureaucracy within which Eisenhower had to operate, Villa stated that \"Although the average reader of \"Other Losses\" would never know it, there was a constellation of authorities to whom Eisenhower had to report his actions. Examining the situation as of May 8, 1945, when his murderous policy is said to have gone into full gear, no responsible historian could ignore the many limitations on Eisenhower's authority that made it impossible for him to carry out an independent policy in Germany.\"\nMethodology.\nCowdrey stated that Bacque's methodology for determining just the \"Other Losses\" figures was also \"slipshod\", with Bacque filling gaps in the records where no \"other losses\" were recorded by \"comput[ing] the number of deaths by applying the death rate given in Army statistics for another period to the known number of prisoners at hand.\" Cowdrey states that the \"rate given in Army statistics\" turned out to be a \"rate invented by Bacque himself.\" Cowdrey states that, with regard to Bacque's attempt to analyze a U.S. Army hospital record document, Bacque not only missed an obvious typo throwing his calculations off by 10, but he also badly erred in the math used to tabulate purported death rates of 30%, which he attempts to use to support his claim that the \"other losses\" column in the weekly army reports reflects a body count. Cowdrey concludes that \"the mathematical blunders of \"Other Losses\" are elementary. One turns from them feeling only embarrassment for the author who naively grounds his thesis upon them.\"\nHistorian Rolf Steininger stated that Bacque's claim that the failure to publish the 1960s and 1970s German Maschke Commission finding death figures to be a \"cover up\" contradicts that the entire 22 volume series was actually published in 1972 without any restrictions, to which only an oblique reference is made in an \"Other Losses\" endnote. Steininger says that \"Bacque himself is one of the mythmakers\" and that, when Bacque attacks the Maschke Commission scholars as \"client-academics\", \"he oversteps the bounds of mythmaking and enters the territory of libel.\" Historian Gunter Bischof states that it is simply \"outrageous to dismiss this vast and impressive body of scholarship as being designed to produce 'soothing conclusions' for the German public, as Bacque puts it.\"\nBischof said that while \"most scholarly reviewers of Bacque's book have pointed out that Bacque fails to establish the proper historical context\", \"worse, the historical records that Bacque did use are amateurishly misrepresented and often misleading or wrong. Once Bacque's endnotes are checked, frequent misreadings of documents are easily discernible.\" As an example, Bischof states that Bacque charged that General Mark Clark's raising of caloric intake in the Ebensee camp was \"trying to exculpate himself before history\" of Eisenhower's scheme to exterminate Germans. Bischof states that Bacque fails to tell his readers, first, that Ebensee was not even an Allied prisoner of war camp, but a camp for displaced persons that was actually housing Polish Jews liberated from a nearby concentration camp, second, that Clark raised the caloric intake levels in response to a report critical of the treatment of liberated Jews that had just been released and, third, that Eisenhower soon thereafter also raised the levels for his Jewish displaced persons in camps run by Eisenhower.\nOral sources.\nRegarding oral histories, Bischof concludes that \"Bacque abuses the process through his highly selective presentation of oral histories and memoir literature.\" \"Other Losses\" cited Colonel Phillip S. Lauben as the source for the claim that the \"other losses\" weekly report column covered up deaths. The New Orleans panel noted that Lauben himself twice has since repudiated this. When describing his interview with Bacque, Lauben stated \"I am 91 years old, legally blind, and my memory has lapsed to a point where it is quite unreliable\u00a0... Often during my talk with Mr Bacque I reminded him that my memory has deteriorated badly during the 40 odd years since 1945. Mr Bacque read to me the USFET POW figures for discharge and transfers to other national zones. It seemed to me that, after accounting for transfers and discharges, there was nothing left to make up the grand total except deaths and escapes. I.e.: the term OTHER LOSSES. I was mistaken\u00a0... many POWs were transferred from one U.S. Command to another U.S. Command. This left one with a loss and the other with a gain.\"\nBacque described his other witness, John Foster, as a camp guard \"in charge of the work detail of fifty men, Germans and Americans, who did nothing all day but drag bodies out of the camp.\" Bischof cites a researcher for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) who tracked down Foster who told the researcher that \"he never was a member of a burial detail, he never buried a body in his life. And he's unaware of any such activity in any camps.\" When the CBC interviewer confronted Bacque with Foster's denial, Bacque responded \"well, he's wrong. He's just wrong.\"\nBacque also interviewed Martin Brech, a U.S. soldier who was a guard at the Andernach camp. Brech discussed his experiences in detail, in which he witnessed the poor conditions in the camp, a large number of deaths, and the systematic starving of the prisoners. He said, \"The silence about this atrocity has pained me for forty-five years and I'm deeply grateful that James Bacque's 'Other Losses' has, at last, brought the truth to light.\"\nBacque states that he has received letters and phone calls from about 2,000 Germans who survived the camps, expressing gratitude that the truth about their experience has finally been published.\nContext of food shortage.\nHistorian James Tent concludes that \"James Bacque might be willing to relegate the world food shortage to the category of myth. Few others will do so. Perhaps he can try the interviewing techniques that he employed in \"Other Losses\"\u2014namely putting words in the mouths of selective eyewitnesses.\" The introduction to the New Orleans panel's book states that Bacque's insistence not only defies common sense, but it would have shocked anyone in Europe in 1945. \"Other Losses\" states \"There was a lot more wheat available in the combined areas of western Germany, France, Britain, Canada and the USA than there had been in the same year in 1939.\" Tent states that Bacque selectively cited diary entries and other sources to come to the conclusion of a food abundance and the lack of transportation problems. Tent further stated that Bacque's statements that the German population was 4% smaller in 1945 than in 1939 while mentioning only an \"influx of refugees from the East\", completely ignored that that \"influx\" consisted of a staggering 10 to 13 million Germans displaced from the east and south into Germany that had to be fed and housed. The panel introduction also stated that Bacque ignored the overriding reality that German agriculture had suffered extreme productivity decreases in 1944 and 1945, a shortage of synthetic fertilizers had developed after nitrogen and phosphate stocks were channeled into ammunition production, Tent stated that Bacque completely ignored that, because coal reserves had disappeared from the industrial pipeline, fertilizer plants and other food production facilities were inoperable, meaning that German farmers could expect little if any fertilizer over the next one to two years and that fuel was next to non-existent to power run-down farm equipment. In addition, the panel introduction said that Bacque ignored that the destroyed German transportation infrastructure created additional logistical nightmares, with railroad lines, bridges and terminals left in ruins, the turnaround time for railroad wagons was five times higher than the prewar average, and, of the 15,600 German locomotives, 38.6% were no longer operating and 31% were damaged.\nThe introduction to the panel's book also states that Bacque ignored that Eisenhower himself was the one warning his superiors about food shortages as early as February 1945\u2014months before the war had even ended\u2014then again in May when Eisenhower requested food imports from the United States. Tent stated that Bacque also misleadingly cited only part of a June 1945 war report that 630,000 tons of imported wheat would meet the minimum German civilians minimum food requirements, leaving the reader thinking that the food shortage could easily be solved by United States shipments, without informing the reader of an accompanying report that the Allies brought in 600,000 tons of grain, and that it was quickly used up.\nWhile \"Other Losses\" claims that the United States dismissed the Swiss Government from its role as a protecting power, Villa states that Bacque ignores that it was the Soviets that had vetoed permitting the continued existence of the German government in May 1945, leaving the Swiss no longer wanting to remain the protecting power because they no longer had a German government to which to report, and that the United Nations\u2014including Canada\u2014had concluded the same. Villa adds that, contrary to Bacque's implications, there is no evidence that Eisenhower would not have wanted the German government to continue operating under Doenitz' leadership in Flensburg. Even with regard to the supposed Canadian protest, Villa states \"this is another case of Bacque's outrageous editing of a document\" with Bacque using ellipses to edit out of his quote of the document the key text stating \"in the present unique situation there can be no protecting power for a Government which cannot exist.\"\nBischof stated that, even in Bacque's later released American edition, \"Bacque refuses to address the overwhelming evidence that there had been a great shortage of food in central Europe, beyond admitting that there was a food crisis in Germany in 1946\" and \"but again he turns the evidence on its head when he charges that 'Allied food policy [no longer does he heap the blame on the Americas alone, as in his Canadian edition] deliberately hampered the Germans in attempting to feed themselves.'\" Bischof states \"the opposite is true\", citing the large amounts of U.S. Army GARDA Aid, without which \"German and Austrian civilians would have had a much tougher time surviving the hunger months of 1945 and 1946.\"\nContext of Eisenhower quotations.\nBischof and Ambrose stated that \"Other Losses\" claims of Eisenhower that \"he felt ashamed that he bore a German name\", citing Stephen Ambrose and Colonel Ernest Fisher, when what Ambrose actually said to Fischer was \"It is rumored that Ike once said, 'I'm ashamed my name is Eisenhower,' but I've never seen it, never used it, and don't believe it.\" They concluded that \"[s]uch twisting of historical evidence\u2014both primary and secondary\u2014is not unusual in \"Other Losses\". In the end, Bacque usually resorts to conspiracy theories to salvage his outrageous charges.\" Regarding another example, Bischof and Ambrose stated that \"[o]ne of Bacque's strongest quotations is a line from one of Eisenhower's letters to his wife, Mamie: 'God I hate the Germans.' Bacque seems not to understand that the words were appropriate to the subject, that Ike was by no means unique, and that John Eisenhower printed the letter in his book \"Letters to Mamie\", where Bacque found it, without embarrassment.\" They also stated that, when in 1943, when discussing that he had never been trained for such logistics when he faced a similar problem in Tunisia, Eisenhower stated \"we should have killed more of them\", which Bacque took seriously in \"Other Losses\" (it was also removed in 1969 from a report lest it offend Allies). POWs from Tunisia fared well after being shipped to the United States, where they were well fed in U.S. POW camps.\nContext of Disarmed Enemy Forces designations.\nWith regard to DEF designations, Historian Brian Loring Villa stated that Bacque ignores the 1943 debates of the European Advisory Commission (EAC) and the 1944 EAC's instruments of surrender, not picking up until the March 1945. \"Other Losses\" states that \"in March, as Germany was being cracked\u00a0... a message was being signed and initialed by Eisenhower proposed a startling departure from the Geneva Convention (GC)\u2014the creation of a new class of prisoners who would not be fed by the Army after the surrender of Germany. The message, dated March 10, reads:\u00a0... \" \"Other Losses\" then quotes the cable from the third paragraph, which, Villa states, permits the casual reader to believe that Eisenhower invented the term \"disarmed enemy forces\", specifically omitting the other parts of the document referencing the EAC's draft surrender terms suggesting a designation to avoid the Geneva Convention categories, or the later use of the term \"disarmed enemy forces.\" Villa states that, when the actual full correspondence is read, Eisenhower was merely proposing, in March 1945 with thousands of prisoners surrendering, to act on the surrender condition drafts worked out months earlier. Villa concludes that \"[a]ll Bacque had to do was look for the EAC draft surrender terms mentioned in the cable\u2014these can readily be found in the standard collection of printed United States Diplomatic documents.\"\nVilla further states that \"Other Losses\" wrongly cites a March CCS directive to Eisenhower, claiming that it directs Eisenhower to not take any prisoners after Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, when in fact, the directive states that those taken after V-E day should not be designated as \"Prisoners of War\" under the Geneva Convention. In fact, JCS 1067 required Eisenhower to continue to take prisoners after V-E Day. Moreover, if Bacque truly believes that Eisenhower was supposed to stop taking prisoners, Villa states that Bacque does not explain how Eisenhower could have gotten away with taking 2 million prisoners after this date without CCS action.\nVilla also states that Bacque's assertion that the British rejected designations to not comply with the GC requirements are entirely unfounded and ignore that the British themselves requested that they be permitted to use such designations, with that request being granted by the CCS, with German prisoners of war who surrendered to the British being referred to as \"Surrendered Enemy Personnel\". Villa states that Bacque also entirely ignores that it was the Soviets that had first raised issues about GC requirements in wartime conferences because they were not GC signatories, and as such, did not want condition surrender terms reflecting GC requirements. Villa stated that Bacque goes further regarding the Soviets, implying that the scale of Soviet gulags were a myth invented to cover up the American crime he asserts. Villa also stated that Bacque claims that Eisenhower initially underestimated the expected POW figures as part of his attempt to starve them, while in actuality, Eisenhower was desperately requesting to have food imports approved. \"Other Losses\" fails to cite JCS 1067, the primary restriction on food importation, even once in its notes. Villa also states that Bacque misrepresented a June 5, 1945 memorandum in a way that makes the reader believe that Eisenhower could have requisitioned additional food if he had wanted to, while the memorandum itself makes clear that Eisenhower had requested and was denied additional imports. Villa concludes: \"Need it be added that anyone going back to the documents to find purported confessions of an extermination policy by one of Eisenhower's principal staff officers will find nothing even suggestive of it? Bacque has simply distorted the context beyond all recognition.\"\nHistorical evidence.\nSeveral historians rebutting Bacque have argued that the missing POWs simply went home, that Red Cross food aid was sent to displaced civilians and that German POWs were fed the same rations that the U.S. Army was providing to the civilian population. U.S. and German sources estimate the number of German POWs who died in captivity at between 56,000 and 78,000, or about one per cent of all German prisoners, which is roughly the same as the percentage of American POWs who died in German captivity.\nThe book \"Other Losses\" alleged 1.5 million prisoners were missing and estimated that up to 500,000 of these were in Soviet camps. When the KGB opened its archives in the 1990s, 356,687 German soldiers and 93,900 civilians previously recorded as missing were found to be listed in the Bulanov report as dying in the Soviet camps.\nGerman POW expert Kurt W. Bohme noted that, of the 5 million prisoners in American hands, the European Theater of Operations provost marshal recorded a total of 15,285 prisoner deaths. In 1974, the German Red Cross reported that about 41,000 German MIAs were last reported in western Germany, which is also the location of the prisoner camps. It is reasonable to assume that some deaths in transit camps just before the end of the war went unreported in the chaos at the time. Historian Albert Cowdrey estimates that the total figure is unlikely to be above the aggregate of the recorded deaths and the MIAs, which together total 56,285. That maximum number would constitute approximately 1.1% of the 5 million total prisoners held by U.S. forces. That figure also is close to Bohme's estimate of 1% for deaths of prisoners held by the Western powers.\nMany of these occurred in the initial Rheinwiesenlager transit camps. The German Maschke Commission which studied prisoner deaths in the 1960s and 1970s concluded that 557,000 prisoners lived in the Rheinwiesenlager camps. The official death toll for those camps was 3,053. The number registered by local Parish authorities was 5,311. The Maschke Commission noted that the largest claim was that \"32,000 fatalities had been heard of\", but the Maschke Commission considered this account to be impossible, as was anything in excess of double the parish authorities' figure.\nWhile harsh treatment of prisoners occurred, no evidence exists that it was part of an organized systematic effort. Bohme concluded that Eisenhower and the U.S. Army had to improvise for months in taking care of the masses of prisoners to prevent a catastrophe: \"In spite of all the misery that occurred behind the barbed wire, the catastrophe was prevented; the anticipated mass deaths did not happen.\"\nThe total death rates for United States-held prisoners is also far lower than those held by most countries throughout the war. In 1941 alone, two million of the 3.3 million German-held Soviet POWs\u2014about 60%\u2014died or were executed by the special SS \"Action Groups\" (Einsatzgruppen). By 1944, only 1.05 million of 5 million Soviet prisoners in German hands had survived. Of some 2\u20133 million German POWs in Russian hands, more than 1 million died. Of the 132,000 British and American POWs taken by the Japanese army, 27.6% died in captivity\u2014the Bataan death march being the most notorious incident, producing a POW death rate of between 40 and 60%.\nThe historian Niall Ferguson claims a significantly lower death rate of 0.15% for German POWs held by Americans, less than every other country except for fellow allied power Britain. Ferguson further claims that another advantage to surrendering to the British rather than the Americans was that the British were also less likely to hand German prisoners over to the Soviet Union. Large numbers of German prisoners were transferred between the Allies. The U.S. gave 765,000 to France, 76,000 to Benelux countries, and 200,000 to the Soviet Union. The U.S. also chose to refuse to accept the surrender of German troops attempting to surrender in Saxony and Bohemia. These soldiers were instead handed over to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, in turn, handed German prisoners over to other Eastern European nations, for example, 70,000 to Poland. According to Ferguson, the death rate of German soldiers held prisoner in the Soviet Union was 35.8%.\nFerguson tabulated the total death rate for POWs in World War II as follows:\nLack of records.\nThere are no longer any surviving records showing which German POWs and Disarmed Enemy Forces were in U.S. custody prior to roughly September 1945. The early standard operating procedure for handling POWs and Disarmed Enemy Forces was to send a copy of the POW form to the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects (CROWCASS). \nHowever, this practice was apparently stopped as impractical, and all copies of the POW forms, roughly eight million, were destroyed. By way of contrast, the Soviet archives contain dossiers for every German POW they held, averaging around 15 pages for each.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary\nSecondary"}

Jaundice in adults typically indicates the presence of underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism, liver dysfunction, or biliary-tract obstruction. The prevalence of jaundice in adults is rare, while jaundice in babies is common, with an estimated 80% affected during their first week of life. The most commonly associated symptoms of jaundice are itchiness, pale feces, and dark urine.\nNormal levels of bilirubin in blood are below 1.0\u00a0mg/dl (17\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), while levels over 2\u20133\u00a0mg/dl (34\u201351\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) typically result in jaundice. High blood bilirubin is divided into two types: unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin.\nCauses of jaundice vary from relatively benign to potentially fatal. High unconjugated bilirubin may be due to excess red blood cell breakdown, large bruises, genetic conditions such as Gilbert's syndrome, not eating for a prolonged period of time, newborn jaundice, or thyroid problems. High conjugated bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct, due to factors including gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Other conditions can also cause yellowish skin, but are not jaundice, including carotenemia, which can develop from eating large amounts of foods containing carotene\u2014or medications such as rifampin.\nTreatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present, surgery is typically required; otherwise, management is medical. Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing to the jaundice. Jaundice in newborns may be treated with phototherapy or exchanged transfusion depending on age and prematurity when the bilirubin is greater than 4\u201321\u00a0mg/dl (68\u2013365\u00a0\u03bcmol/L). The itchiness may be helped by draining the gallbladder, ursodeoxycholic acid, or opioid antagonists such as naltrexone. The word \"jaundice\" is from the French \"jaunisse\", meaning 'yellow disease'.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe most common signs of jaundice in adults are a yellowish discoloration of the white area of the eye (sclera) and skin, with scleral icterus presence indicating a serum bilirubin of at least 3\u00a0mg/dl. Other common signs include dark urine (bilirubinuria) and pale (acholia) fatty stool (steatorrhea). Because bilirubin is a skin irritant, jaundice is commonly associated with severe itchiness.\nEye conjunctiva has a particularly high affinity for bilirubin deposition due to high elastin content. Slight increases in serum bilirubin can, therefore, be detected early on by observing the yellowing of sclerae. Traditionally referred to as scleral icterus, this term is actually a misnomer, because bilirubin deposition technically occurs in the conjunctival membranes overlying the avascular sclera. Thus, the proper term for the yellowing of \"white of the eyes\" is conjunctival icterus.\nIn individuals with darker skin tones, jaundice may be less readily apparent on the skin and is more reliably observed in areas such as the sclera, palms, soles, and oral mucosa. Educational resources have increasingly highlighted this variation to support accurate clinical assessment across diverse populations.\nA rare sign of jaundice in childhood is the appearance of yellowish or greenish teeth. In developing children, hyperbilirubinemia can lead to yellow or green tooth discoloration as bilirubin deposits during tooth calcification. While this may occur in children with hyperbilirubinemia, tooth discoloration due to hyperbilirubinemia is not observed in individuals with adult-onset liver disease. Disorders associated with a rise in serum levels of conjugated bilirubin during early development can also cause dental hypoplasia.\nCauses.\nJaundice is a sign indicating the presence of an underlying diseases involving abnormal bilirubin metabolism, liver dysfunction, or biliary-tract obstruction. In general, jaundice is present when blood levels of bilirubin exceed 3\u00a0mg/dl. Jaundice is classified into three categories, depending on which part of the physiological mechanism the pathology affects. The three categories are:\nPrehepatic causes.\nPrehepatic jaundice is most commonly caused by a pathological increased rate of red blood cell (erythrocyte) hemolysis. The increased breakdown of erythrocytes \u2192 increased unconjugated serum bilirubin \u2192 increased deposition of unconjugated bilirubin into mucosal tissue. These diseases may cause jaundice due to increased erythrocyte hemolysis:\nHepatic causes.\nHepatic jaundice is caused by abnormal liver metabolism of bilirubin. The major causes of hepatic jaundice are significant damage to hepatocytes due to infectious, drug/medication-induced, autoimmune etiology, or less commonly, due to inheritable genetic diseases. The following is a partial list of hepatic causes to jaundice:\nPosthepatic causes (Obstructive jaundice).\nPosthepatic jaundice (obstructive jaundice) is caused by a blockage of bile ducts that transport bile containing conjugated bilirubin out of the liver for excretion. This is a list of conditions that can cause posthepatic jaundice:\nPathophysiology.\nJaundice is typically caused by an underlying pathological process that occurs at some point along the normal physiological pathway of heme metabolism. A deeper understanding of the anatomical flow of normal heme metabolism is essential to appreciate the importance of prehepatic, hepatic, and posthepatic categories. Thus, an anatomical approach to heme metabolism precedes a discussion of the pathophysiology of jaundice.\nNormal heme metabolism.\nPrehepatic metabolism.\nWhen red blood cells complete their lifespan of about 120 days, or if they are damaged, they rupture as they pass through the reticuloendothelial system, and cell contents including hemoglobin are released into circulation. Macrophages phagocytose free hemoglobin and split it into heme and globin. Two reactions then take place with the heme molecule. The first oxidation reaction is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme heme oxygenase and results in biliverdin (green color pigment), iron, and carbon monoxide. The next step is the reduction of biliverdin to a yellow color tetrapyrrole pigment called bilirubin by cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase. This bilirubin is \"unconjugated\", \"free\", or \"indirect\" bilirubin. Around 4\u00a0mg of bilirubin per kg of blood are produced each day. The majority of this bilirubin comes from the breakdown of heme from expired red blood cells in the process just described. Roughly 20% comes from other heme sources, however, including ineffective erythropoiesis, and the breakdown of other heme-containing proteins, such as muscle myoglobin and cytochromes. The unconjugated bilirubin then travels to the liver through the bloodstream. Because this bilirubin is not soluble, it is transported through the blood bound to serum albumin.\nHepatic metabolism.\nOnce unconjugated bilirubin arrives in the liver, liver enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase conjugates bilirubin + glucuronic acid \u2192 bilirubin diglucuronide (conjugated bilirubin). Bilirubin that has been conjugated by the liver is water-soluble and excreted into the gallbladder.\nPosthepatic metabolism.\nBilirubin enters the intestinal tract via bile. In the intestinal tract, bilirubin is converted into urobilinogen by symbiotic intestinal bacteria. Most urobilinogen is converted into stercobilinogen and further oxidized into stercobilin. Stercobilin is excreted via feces, giving stool its characteristic brown coloration. A small portion of urobilinogen is reabsorbed back into the gastrointestinal cells. Most reabsorbed urobilinogen undergoes hepatobiliary recirculation. A smaller portion of reabsorbed urobilinogen is filtered into the kidneys. In the urine, urobilinogen is converted to urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic yellow color.\nAbnormalities in heme metabolism and excretion.\nOne way to understand jaundice pathophysiology is to organize it into disorders that cause increased bilirubin production (abnormal heme metabolism) or decreased bilirubin excretion (abnormal heme excretion).\nPrehepatic pathophysiology.\nPrehepatic jaundice results from a pathological increase in bilirubin production, most often as a result of an increased rate of red blood cell hemolysis, leading to an increased deposition of bilirubin in mucosal tissues and the appearance of a yellow hue.\nHepatic pathophysiology.\nHepatic jaundice (hepatocellular jaundice) is due to significant disruption of liver function, leading to hepatic cell death and necrosis and impaired bilirubin transport across hepatocytes. Bilirubin transport across hepatocytes may be impaired at any point between hepatocellular uptake of unconjugated bilirubin and hepatocellular transport of conjugated bilirubin into the gallbladder. In addition, subsequent cellular edema due to inflammation causes mechanical obstruction of the intrahepatic biliary tract. Most commonly, interferences in all three major steps of bilirubin metabolism\u2014uptake, conjugation, and excretion\u2014usually occur in hepatocellular jaundice. Thus, an abnormal rise in both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin (formerly called cholemia) will be present. Because excretion (the rate-limiting step) is usually impaired to the greatest extent, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia predominates.\nThe unconjugated bilirubin still enters the liver cells and becomes conjugated in the usual way. This conjugated bilirubin is then returned to the blood, probably by rupture of the congested bile canaliculi and direct emptying of the bile into the lymph exiting the liver. Thus, most of the bilirubin in the plasma becomes the conjugated type rather than the unconjugated type, and this conjugated bilirubin, which did not go to the intestine to become urobilinogen, gives the urine a dark color.\nThere are other causes of hepatic jaundice that are not due to significant liver dysfunction and are associated solely with the conjugation of bilirubin. One example is Gilbert syndrome where affected individuals have normal liver function but have genetic variants in their UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme, causing the enzyme to be less efficient in conjugating unconjugated bilirubin. Individuals typically experience mild episodes of jaundice during periods of stress. Another example is Crigler-Najjar syndrome where genetic variants in the UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme result in partial or complete loss of enzyme activity, and affected individuals experience significant hyperbilirubinemia as a result.\nPosthepatic pathophysiology.\nPosthepatic jaundice, also called obstructive jaundice, is due to the blockage of bile excretion from the biliary tract, which leads to increased conjugated bilirubin and bile salts there. In complete obstruction of the bile duct, conjugated bilirubin cannot access the intestinal tract, disrupting further bilirubin conversion to urobilinogen and, therefore, no stercobilin or urobilin is produced. In obstructive jaundice, excess conjugated bilirubin is filtered into the urine without urobilinogen. Conjugated bilirubin in urine (bilirubinuria) gives urine an abnormally dark brown color. Thus, the presence of pale stool (stercobilin absent from feces) and dark urine (conjugated bilirubin present in urine) suggests an obstructive cause of jaundice. Because these associated signs are also positive in many hepatic jaundice conditions, they cannot be a reliable clinical feature to distinguish obstructive versus hepatocellular jaundice causes.\nDiagnosis.\nMost people presenting with jaundice have various predictable patterns of liver panel abnormalities, though significant variation does exist. The typical liver panel includes blood levels of enzymes found primarily from the liver, such as the aminotransferases (ALT, AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); bilirubin (which causes the jaundice); and protein levels, specifically, total protein and albumin. Other primary lab tests for liver function include gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and prothrombin time (PT). No single test can differentiate between various classifications of jaundice. A combination of liver function tests and other physical examination findings is essential to arrive at a diagnosis.\nLaboratory tests.\nSome bone and heart disorders can lead to an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which are only elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. ALP and GGT levels typically rise with one pattern while aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10\u201345 IU/L) and GGT (18\u201385 IU/L) levels rise proportionately as high as the AST (12\u201338 IU/L) and ALT (10\u201345 IU/L) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. If the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, though, this indicates a liver problem. Finally, distinguishing between liver causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful. AST levels typically are higher than ALT. This remains the case in most liver disorders except for hepatitis (viral or hepatotoxic). Alcoholic liver damage may have fairly normal ALT levels, with AST 10 times higher than ALT. If ALT is higher than AST, however, this is indicative of hepatitis. Levels of ALT and AST are not well correlated to the extent of liver damage, although rapid drops in these levels from very high levels can indicate severe necrosis. Low levels of albumin tend to indicate a chronic condition, while the level is normal in hepatitis and cholestasis.\nLaboratory results for liver panels are frequently compared by the magnitude of their differences, not the pure number, as well as by their ratios. The AST:ALT ratio can be a good indicator of whether the disorder is alcoholic liver damage (above 10), some other form of liver damage (above 1), or hepatitis (less than 1). Bilirubin levels greater than 10 times normal could indicate neoplastic or intrahepatic cholestasis. Levels lower than this tend to indicate hepatocellular causes. AST levels greater than 15 times normal tend to indicate acute hepatocellular damage. Less than this tend to indicate obstructive causes. ALP levels greater than 5 times normal tend to indicate obstruction, while levels greater than 10 times normal can indicate drug (toxin) induced cholestatic hepatitis or cytomegalovirus infection. Both of these conditions can also have ALT and AST greater than 20 times normal. GGT levels greater than 10 times normal typically indicate cholestasis. Levels 5\u201310 times tend to indicate viral hepatitis. Levels less than 5 times normal tend to indicate drug toxicity. Acute hepatitis typically has ALT and AST levels rising 20\u201330 times normal (above 1000) and may remain significantly elevated for several weeks. Acetaminophen toxicity can result in ALT and AST levels greater than 50 times than normal.\nLaboratory findings depend on the cause of jaundice:\nUnconjugated bilirubin is hydrophobic, so cannot be excreted in urine. Thus, the finding of increased urobilinogen in the urine without the presence of bilirubin in the urine (due to its unconjugated state) suggests hemolytic jaundice as the underlying disease process. Urobilinogen will be greater than 2 units, as hemolytic anemia causes increased heme metabolism; one exception being the case of infants, where the gut flora has not developed). Conversely, conjugated bilirubin is hydrophilic and thus can be detected as present in the urine\u2014bilirubinuria\u2014in contrast to unconjugated bilirubin, which is absent in the urine.\nImaging.\nMedical imaging such as ultrasound, CT scan with contrast, and HIDA scan are useful for detecting bile-duct blockage. Ultrasound and CT scans are routinely first line as they provide rapid results while remaining noninvasive and cost-effective. Other imaging modalities may also be effective and utilized when a particular etiology is suspected, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the setting of suspected bile duct obstruction.\nLiver biopsy.\nLiver biopsy may be indicated if labs, imaging, or other diagnostic tests do not determine the cause of jaundice. There is a substantial risk of bleeding of up to 10% associated with liver biopsy, although significant life-threatening bleeding is much less likely. Given this, liver biopsy should be reserved for cases in which it will significantly impact diagnosis or management.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nOther etiologies of yellow discoloration of the skin not related to deposition of bilirubin include:\nTreatment.\nTreatment of jaundice varies depending on the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present, surgery is typically required; otherwise, management is pharmacological.\nEpidemiology.\nJaundice in adults is rare. Under the five year DISCOVERY programme in the UK, annual incidence of jaundice was 0.74 per 1000 individuals over age 45, although this rate may be slightly inflated due to the main goal of the programme collecting and analyzing cancer data in the population. Jaundice is commonly associated with severity of disease with an incidence of up to 40% of patients requiring intensive care in ICU experiencing jaundice. The causes of jaundice in the intensive care setting are both due to jaundice as the primary reason for ICU stay or as a morbidity to an underlying disease (i.e. sepsis).\nIn the developed world, the most common causes of jaundice are blockage of the bile duct or medication-induced. In the developing world, the most common cause of jaundice is infectious, such as viral hepatitis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, or malaria.\nRisk factors.\nRisk factors associated with high serum bilirubin levels include male gender, white ethnicities, and active smoking. Mean serum total bilirubin levels in adults were found to be higher in men (0.72 \u00b1 0.004\u00a0mg/dl) than women (0.52 \u00b1 0.003\u00a0mg/dl). Higher bilirubin levels in adults are found also in non-Hispanic white population (0.63 \u00b1 0.004\u00a0mg/dl) and Mexican American population (0.61 \u00b1 0.005\u00a0mg/dl) while lower in non-Hispanic black population (0.55 \u00b1 0.005\u00a0mg/dl). Bilirubin levels are higher in active smokers.\nSpecial populations.\nNeonatal jaundice.\nSymptoms.\nJaundice in infants presents with yellowed skin and icteral sclerae. Neonatal jaundice spreads in a cephalocaudal pattern, affecting the face and neck before spreading down to the trunk and lower extremities in more severe cases. Other symptoms may include drowsiness, poor feeding, and in severe cases, unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause permanent neurological damage (kernicterus).\nCauses.\nThe most common cause of jaundice in infants is normal physiologic jaundice. Pathologic causes of neonatal jaundice include:\nPathophysiology.\nTransient neonatal jaundice is one of the most common conditions occurring in newborns (children under 28 days of age) with more than 80 per cent experienceing jaundice during their first week of life. Jaundice in infants, as in adults, is characterized by increased bilirubin levels (infants: total serum bilirubin greater than 5\u00a0mg/dL).\nNormal physiological neonatal jaundice is due to immaturity of liver enzymes involved in bilirubin metabolism, immature gut microbiota, and increased breakdown of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Breast milk jaundice is caused by an increased concentration of \u03b2-glucuronidase in breast milk, which increases bilirubin deconjugation and reabsorption of bilirubin, leading to persistence of physiologic jaundice with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Onset of breast milk jaundice is within 2 weeks after birth and lasts for 4\u201313 weeks.\nWhile most cases of newborn jaundice are not harmful, when bilirubin levels are very high, brain damage\u2014kernicterus\u2014may occur leading to significant disability. Kernicterus is associated with increased unconjugated bilirubin (bilirubin which is not carried by albumin). Newborns are especially vulnerable to this damage, due to increased permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier occurring with increased unconjugated bilirubin, simultaneous to the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin and the immaturity of gut flora. This condition has been rising in recent years, as babies spend less time in sunlight.\nTreatment.\nJaundice in newborns is usually transient and dissipates without medical intervention. In cases when serum bilirubin levels are greater than 4\u201321\u00a0mg/dl (68\u2013360\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), infant may be treated with phototherapy or exchanged transfusion depending on the infant's age and prematurity status. A bili light is often the tool used for early treatment, which consists of exposing the baby to intensive phototherapy, which may be intermittent or continuous. A 2014 systematic review found no evidence indicating whether outcomes were different for hospital-based versus home-based treatment. A 2021 Cochrane systematic review found that sunlight can be used to supplement phototherapy, as long as care is taken to prevent overheating and skin damage. There was not sufficient evidence to conclude that sunlight by itself is an effective treatment. Bilirubin count is also lowered through excretion\u2014bowel movements and urination\u2014so frequent and effective feedings are vital measures to decrease jaundice in infants.\nEtymology.\nJaundice comes from the French , meaning 'yellow'; meaning 'yellow disease'. The medical term is \"icterus,\" from the Greek word . The term \"icterus\" is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to jaundice specifically of sclera. It is also referenced in the scientific name of the yellow-breasted chat (\"Icteria virens\"), whose sight was believed to cure jaundice.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ambrose", "text": "American historian and writer (1936\u20132002)\nStephen Edward Ambrose (January 10, 1936 \u2013 October 13, 2002) was an American historian, academic, and author, most noted for his books on World War II and his biographies of U.S. presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. He was a longtime professor of history at the University of New Orleans and the author of many bestselling volumes of American popular history.\nIn 2002, several instances of plagiarism were discovered in his books. In 2010, after his death, Ambrose was found to have fabricated interviews and events in his biographies of Eisenhower.\nEarly life and education.\nAmbrose was born on January 10, 1936, in Lovington, Illinois, to Rosepha Trippe Ambrose and Stephen Hedges Ambrose. His father was a physician who served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Ambrose was raised in Whitewater, Wisconsin, where he graduated from Whitewater High School. His family also owned a farm in Lovington, Illinois, and vacation property in Marinette County, Wisconsin. He attended college at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where he was a member of Chi Psi fraternity and played on the University of Wisconsin football team for three years.\nAmbrose planned to major in pre-medicine, but changed his major to history after hearing the first lecture in a U.S. history class entitled \"Representative Americans\" in his sophomore year. The course was taught by William B. Hesseltine, whom Ambrose credits with fundamentally shaping his writing and igniting his interest in history. While at Wisconsin, Ambrose was a member of the Navy and Army ROTC. He graduated with a B.A. in 1957. Ambrose received a master's degree in history from Louisiana State University in 1958, studying under T. Harry Williams. Ambrose then went on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1963, under William B. Hesseltine.\nCareer.\nAcademic positions.\nAmbrose was a history professor from 1960 until his retirement in 1995. From 1971 onward, he was a member of the University of New Orleans faculty, where he was named the Boyd Professor of History in 1989, an honor given only to faculty who attain \"national or international distinction for outstanding teaching, research, or other creative achievement\". During the 1969\u20131970 academic year, he was the Ernest J. King Professor of Maritime History at the Naval War College. While teaching at Kansas State University as the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of War and Peace during the 1970\u20131971 academic year, Ambrose participated in heckling of Richard Nixon during a speech the president gave on the KSU campus. Given pressure from the KSU administration and having job offers elsewhere, upon finishing out the year Ambrose offered to leave and the offer was accepted. His opposition to the Vietnam War stood in contrast to his research on \"presidents and the military at a time when such topics were increasingly regarded by his colleagues as old fashioned and conservative.\" Ambrose also taught at Louisiana State University (assistant professor of history; 1960\u20131964) and Johns Hopkins University (associate professor of history; 1964\u20131969). He held visiting posts at Rutgers University, the University of California, Berkeley, and a number of European schools, including University College Dublin, where he taught as the Mary Ball Washington Professor of American History.\nHe founded the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans in 1989 with, \"The mission of the Eisenhower Center is the study of the causes, conduct, and consequences of American national security policy and the use of force as an instrument of policy in the twentieth century.\" He served as its director until 1994. The center's first efforts, which Ambrose initiated, involved the collection of oral histories from World War II veterans about their experiences, particularly any participation in D-Day. By the time of publication of Ambrose's \"D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II,\" in 1994, the center had collected more than 1,200 oral histories. Ambrose donated $150,000 to the Center in 1998 to foster additional efforts to collect oral histories from World War II veterans.\nWritings.\nAmbrose's earliest works concerned the American Civil War. He wrote biographies of the generals Emory Upton and Henry Halleck, the first of which was based on his dissertation.\nEarly in his career, Ambrose was mentored by World War II historian Forrest Pogue. In 1964, Ambrose took a position at Johns Hopkins as the Associate Editor of the \"Eisenhower Papers\", a project aimed at organizing, cataloging and publishing Eisenhower's principal papers. From this work and discussions with Eisenhower emerged an article critical of Cornelius Ryan's \"The Last Battle\", which had depicted Eisenhower as politically na\u00eeve, when at the end of World War II he allowed Soviet forces to take Berlin, thus shaping the Cold War that followed. Ambrose expanded this into a book, \"Eisenhower and Berlin, 1945: The Decision to Halt at the Elbe\" (1967). Ambrose was aided in the book's writing by comments and notes provided by Eisenhower, who read a draft of the book.\nIn 1964, Ambrose was commissioned to write the official biography of the former president and five-star general Dwight D. Eisenhower. This resulted in a book on Eisenhower's war years, \"The Supreme Commander\" (1970), and a two-volume full biography (published in 1983 and 1984), which are considered \"the standard\" on the subject. Regarding the first volume, Gordon Harrison, writing for \"The New York Times\", proclaimed, \"It is Mr. Ambrose's special triumph that he has been able to fight through the memoranda, the directives, plans, reports, and official self-serving pieties of the World War II establishment to uncover the idiosyncratic people at its center.\" Ambrose also wrote a three-volume biography of Richard Nixon. Although Ambrose was a strong critic of Nixon, the biography was considered fair and just regarding Nixon's presidency.\nA visit to a reunion of Easy Company veterans in 1988 prompted Ambrose to collect their stories, turning them into \"Band of Brothers, E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne: From Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest\" (1992). \"D-Day\" (1994), built upon additional oral histories, presented the battle from the view points of individual soldiers and became his first best seller. A reviewer for the \"Journal of Military History\" commended \"D-Day\" as the \"most comprehensive discussion\" of the sea, air, and land operations that coalesced on that day. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, writing for \"The New York Times\", proclaimed that \"Reading this history, you can understand why for so many of its participants, despite all the death surrounding them, life revealed itself in that moment at that place.\" Ambrose's \"Citizen Soldiers\", which describes battles fought in northwest Europe from D-Day through the end of the war in Europe, utilized, again, extensive oral histories. \"Citizen Soldiers\" became a best seller, appearing on the \"New York Times\" best sellers lists for both hardcover and paperback editions in the same week. During the same week, in September 1998, \"D-Day\" and \"Undaunted Courage\", Ambrose's 1996 book on Meriwether Lewis and the Corps of Discovery, appeared on the best seller list, also. He also wrote \"The Victors\" (1998), a distillation of material from other books detailing Eisenhower's wartime experiences and connections to the common soldier, and \"The Wild Blue\", that looks at World War II aviation largely through the experiences of George McGovern, who commanded a B-24 crew that flew numerous missions over Germany. His other major works include \"Undaunted Courage\" about the Lewis and Clark Expedition and \"Nothing Like It in the World\" about the construction of the Pacific Railroad. His final book, \"This Vast Land\", a historical novel about the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition written for young readers, was published posthumously in 2003.\nAmbrose's most popular single work was \"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West\" (1996), which stayed on the \"New York Times\" best seller list for a combined, hardcover and paperback, 126 weeks. Ambrose consolidated research on the Corps of Discovery's expedition conducted in the previous thirty years and \"synthesized it skillfully to enrich our understanding and appreciation of this grand epic\", according to Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., who reviewed the book for \"The New York Times\". Ken Burns, who produced and directed a PBS documentary on Lewis &amp; Clark declared that Ambrose \"takes one of the great, but also one of the most superficially considered, stories in American history and breathes fresh life into it.\"\nIn addition to 27 self-authored books, Ambrose co-authored, edited, and contributed to many more and was a frequent contributor to magazines such as \"American Heritage\". He, also, reviewed the works of other historians in the \"Journal of Southern History\", \"Military Affairs\", \"American Historical Review\", \"The Journal of American History\", and \"Foreign Affairs\". He served as a contributing editor to \"\", also.\nTelevision, film, and other activities.\nAmbrose featured in the 1973-74 ITV television series, \"The World at War\", which detailed the history of World War II.\nHe served as the historical consultant for the movie \"Saving Private Ryan\". Tom Hanks, who starred in the movie, said he \"pored over \"D-Day\"\" and \"Band of Brothers\" in researching his role. Hanks also credited Ambrose's books with providing extensive detail, particularly regarding D-Day landings.\nThe HBO mini-series, \"Band of Brothers\" (2001), for which he was an executive producer, helped sustain the fresh interest in World War II that had been stimulated by the 50th anniversary of D-Day in 1994 and the 60th anniversary in 2004. Ambrose served as executive producer for \"Price for Peace\", a documentary concerning the war in the Pacific theater during World War II, and for \"Moments of Truth\", a TV documentary containing interviews with World War II veterans.\nIn addition, Ambrose served as a commentator for \"\", a documentary by Ken Burns. He provided commentary in 20 made-for-TV documentaries, covering diverse topics, such as World War II, Lewis &amp; Clark, and America's prominence in the 20th century. He also appeared as a guest on numerous TV programs or stations, including \"The Charlie Rose Show\", C-Span programming, CNN programming, NBC's \"Today Show\", CNBC's \"Hardball\", and various programming on The History Channel and the National Geographic Channel. Ambrose's association with National Geographic stemmed, in part, from his designation as an Explorer-in-Residence by the Society.\nIn addition to his academic work and publishing, Ambrose operated a historical tour business, acting as a tour guide to European locales of World War II. Also, he served on the board of directors for American Rivers and was a member of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council.\nNational World War II Museum.\nAmbrose's work for the Eisenhower Center, specifically his work with D-Day veterans, inspired him to co-found the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans with another historian and UNO professor Gordon H. \"Nick\" Mueller. Ambrose initiated fundraising by donating $500,000. \"He dreamt of a museum that reflected his deep regard for our nation's citizen soldiers, the workers on the Home Front and the sacrifices and hardships they endured to achieve victory.\" He secured large contributions from the federal government, state of Louisiana, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and many smaller donations from former students, who answered a plea made by Ambrose in the \"New Orleans Times-Picayune\". In 2003, Congress designated the museum as \"America's National World War II Museum,\" acknowledging an expanded scope and mission for the museum. \"The Stephen E. Ambrose Memorial Fund continues to support the development of the museum's Center for Study of the American Spirit, its educational programs and oral history and publication initiatives.\"\nAwards.\nIn 1997, Ambrose received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In 1998, he received the National Humanities Medal. In 1998, he was awarded the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize for lifetime achievement given by the Society for Military History. In 1998, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2000, Ambrose received the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the highest honorary award the Department of Defense offers to civilians. In 2001, he was awarded the Theodore Roosevelt Medal for Distinguished Service from the Theodore Roosevelt Association. Ambrose won an Emmy as one of the producers for the mini-series \"Band of Brothers\". Ambrose also received the George Marshall Award, the Abraham Lincoln Literary Award, the Bob Hope Award from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, and the Will Rogers Memorial Award.\nUpon Ambrose's death, U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana offered a resolution in the Senate, which received unanimous consent, saluting the \"excellence of Stephen Ambrose at capturing the greatness of the American spirit in words.\"\nPersonal life, final years, and death.\nHe married his first wife, Judith Dorlester, in 1957, and they had two children, Stephenie and Barry. Judith died in 1965, when Ambrose was 29. Ambrose married his second wife, Moira Buckley (1939\u20132009), in 1967 and adopted her three children, Andrew, Grace, and Hugh. Moira was an active assistant in his writing and academic projects. After retiring, he maintained homes in Helena, Montana, and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in April 2002. His health deteriorated rapidly, and seven months after the diagnosis, he died at the age of 66. George McGovern, the primary focus of Ambrose's \"Wild Blue\" said, \"He probably reached more readers than any other historian in our national history.\"\nLegacy.\nAmbrose donated $500,000, half the amount needed, to the University of Wisconsin, to endow a chair in the name of William B. Hesseltine, Ambrose's mentor. The chair's position would focus on the teaching of American military history. When the chair became fully endowed, after Ambrose's death, it was renamed the Ambrose-Hesseltine Chair.\nThe Ambrose Professor of History title was established at the University of New Orleans after his death. The position is reserved for a military historian.\nEach year the Rutgers University Living History Society awards the Stephen E. Ambrose Oral History Award to \"an author or artist who has made significant use of oral history.\" Past winners include Tom Brokaw, Steven Spielberg, Studs Terkel, Michael Beschloss, and Ken Burns.\nCriticism.\nPlagiarism.\nIn 2002, Ambrose was accused of plagiarizing several passages in his book \"The Wild Blue\". Fred Barnes reported in \"The Weekly Standard\" that Ambrose had taken passages from \"Wings of Morning: The Story of the Last American Bomber Shot Down over Germany in World War II\", by Thomas Childers, a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Ambrose had footnoted sources, but had not enclosed in quotation marks numerous passages from Childers's book.\nAmbrose asserted that only a few sentences in all his numerous books were the work of other authors. He offered this defense:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I tell stories. I don't discuss my documents. I discuss the story. It almost gets to the point where, how much is the reader going to take? I am not writing a Ph.D. dissertation.\nI wish I had put the quotation marks in, but I didn't. I am not out there stealing other people's writings. If I am writing up a passage and it is a story I want to tell and this story fits and a part of it is from other people's writing, I just type it up that way and put it in a footnote. I just want to know where the hell it came from.\nA \"Forbes\" investigation of his work found cases of plagiarism involving passages in at least six books, with a similar pattern going back to his doctoral dissertation. The History News Network lists seven of Ambrose's more than 69 works\u2014\"The Wild Blue\", \"Undaunted Courage\", \"Nothing Like It In the World\", \"Nixon: Ruin and Recovery\", \"Citizen Soldiers\", \"The Supreme Commander\", and \"Crazy Horse and Custer\"\u2014contained content from twelve authors without appropriate attribution from Ambrose.\nFactual errors and disputed characterizations.\nPacific Railroad.\nA front-page article published in \"The Sacramento Bee\" on January 1, 2001, entitled \"Area Historians Rail Against Inaccuracies in Book\", listed more than sixty instances identified as \"significant errors, misstatements, and made-up quotes\" in \"Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad, 1863\u20131869\", Ambrose's non-academic popular history about the construction of the Pacific Railroad between Council Bluffs, Iowa/Omaha, Nebraska, and the San Francisco Bay at Alameda/Oakland via Sacramento, California, which was published in August 2000. The discrepancies were documented in a detailed \"fact-checking\" paper compiled in December 2000 by three Western US railroad historians who are also experienced researchers, consultants, and collectors specializing in the Pacific Railroad and related topics.\nOn January 11, 2001, \"Washington Post\" columnist Lloyd Grove reported in his column \"The Reliable Source\" that a co-worker had found a \"serious historical error\" in the same book that \"a chastened Ambrose\" promised to correct in future editions. A number of journal reviews also sharply criticized the research and fact-checking in the book. Reviewer Walter Nugent observed that it contained \"annoying slips\" such as mislabeled maps, inaccurate dates, geographical errors, and misidentified word origins, while railroad historian Don L. Hofsommer agreed that the book \"confuses facts\" and that \"The research might best be characterized as 'once over lightly'.\"\nThe Eisenhower controversy.\nIn the introduction to Ambrose's biography of Eisenhower, he claims that the former president approached him after having read his previous biography of the American general Henry Halleck,\nbut Tim Rives, Deputy Director of the Eisenhower Presidential Center, says it was Ambrose who contacted Eisenhower and suggested the project, as shown by a letter from Ambrose found in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum. In his response, Eisenhower stated that \"the confidence I have derived from your work by reading your two books\u2014especially the one on Halleck\u2014give reasons why I should be ready to help out so far as I can.\" The Halleck biography \"still sits on a shelf\" at the Eisenhower National Historic Site in Gettysburg.\nAfter Eisenhower's death in 1969, Ambrose made repeated claims to have had a unique and extraordinarily close relationship with him over the final five years of the former President's life. In an extensive 1998 interview, before a group of high school students, Ambrose stated that he spent \"a lot of time with Ike, really a lot, hundreds and hundreds of hours\". Ambrose claimed he interviewed Eisenhower on a wide range of subjects, and that he had been with him \"on a daily basis for a couple years\" before his death \"doing interviews and talking about his life\". The former president's diary and telephone records show that the pair met only three times, for a total of less than five hours. Rives has stated that interview dates Ambrose cites in his 1970 book, \"The Supreme Commander\", cannot be reconciled with Eisenhower's personal schedule, but Rives discovered, upon further investigation, a \"hidden\" relationship between the two men. Eisenhower enlisted Ambrose in his efforts to preserve his legacy and counteract criticisms of his presidency, particularly those charging that Eisenhower's actions at the end of World War II produced the Cold War. Ambrose wrote a review and book supporting the former general, with Eisenhower providing direction and comments during the process. Rives could not square the questionable interview dates cited by Ambrose in later works, but uncovered a relationship with Eisenhower that was \"too complicated\" to be described by Ambrose's critics.\nIn his 2015 book \"The President and the Apprentice: Eisenhower and Nixon, 1952\u20131961\", Irwin F. Gellman wrote that \"while some Eisenhower scholars questioned Ambrose's research after [his] book's publication, the enormity of his falsifications was not revealed until after his death. Ambrose lied about his relationship with Eisenhower\" and that \"Ambrose also manufactured events that never took place\". Historian David Greenberg stated in 2015 that Ambrose's \"wanton acts of plagiarism and the posthumous revelation that he fabricated interviews with Dwight Eisenhower have rendered his work unusable\".\n\"Band of Brothers\".\nThe book \"Band of Brothers\" states Easy reached Berchtesgaden first amongst Allied units. Other units claim the honor, for example, on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. Reputedly members of the 7th went as far as the elevator to the \"Kehlsteinhaus\", with at least one individual claiming he and a partner continued on to the top. However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus. Elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis and Paul R\u00e9piton-Pr\u00e9neuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of US command, and this is supported by testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They have historically been classified as \"minor places of sovereignty\" within the \"plazas de soberan\u00eda\".\nThe islands are part of Spain's Plazas de soberan\u00eda and is under Spanish administration, however they are also claimed by Morocco as part of its territory alongside other Spanish overseas territories in Northern Africa.\nOverview.\nPe\u00f1\u00f3n de Alhucemas, together with the islets of Isla de Mar and Isla de Tierra slightly to the west, form the Alhucemas Islands. They are located off the Moroccan town of Al Hoceima, or \"Alhucemas\" (former Villa Sanjurjo), east of Ceuta and west of Melilla. The aggregate land area of the group of three islands is 4.6 ha or .\nSpanish rule dates back to 1559, when the Saadis ceded several territories to Spain in exchange for Spanish help against Ottoman armies. In 1673, Spain sent a garrison to the island of Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Alhucemas, and has permanently occupied it since then. The islands are also located near the landing place the Spanish and French expeditionary forces used in 1925 during the Rif War. Morocco has contested Spanish sovereignty over the islets since Morocco received its independence in 1956.\nIn 2012 the Spanish military garrison in the fort on Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Alhucemas comprised an infantry section of 25\u201330 men from the 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment, plus personnel from the marine services with an inflatable boat for reaching supply vessels.\nOn 29 August 2012, 19 sub-Saharan immigrants traversed the short expanse of water between Morocco and the Isla de Tierra. These individuals camped on the island, hoping to somehow gain access to the Spanish mainland. They were shortly joined by an additional 68 immigrants on 2 September 2012. Refugees and illegal immigration from sub-Saharan nations have been a problem that Spain, and the European Union as a whole, has been trying to solve. Since the islets had an \"undefined internal status\", the immigrants did not benefit from the Spanish immigration laws and, under a joint operation, Spanish troops tended to the women, children, and medical needs of the immigrants, then turned them back over to Morocco. Moroccan forces promptly deported the individuals across the Algerian border. The Spanish Army has since stationed a small camp on the Isla de Tierra to discourage new attempts to illegally cross into Spanish territory. The handling and deportation of these individuals have been criticized by the Ombudsman of the Spanish Parliament, the Defensor del Pueblo, and by various NGOs and organizations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fort Hare alumni were part of many subsequent independence movements and governments of newly independent African countries.\nIn 1959, the university was subsumed by the apartheid system, but it is now part of South Africa's post-apartheid public higher education system. It is the alma mater of well-known people including Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Robert Sobukwe, Oliver Tambo, and others.\nHistory.\nOriginally, Fort Hare was a British fort in the wars between British settlers and the Xhosa of the 19th century. Some of the ruins of the fort are still visible today, as well as graves of some of the British soldiers who died while on duty there.\nDuring the 1830s, the Lovedale Missionary Institute was built near Fort Hare. James Stewart, one of its missionary principals, suggested in 1878 that an institution for higher education of black students needed to be created. However, he did not live to see his idea put into operation when, in 1916, Fort Hare was established with Alexander Kerr as its first principal. D. D. T. Jabavu was its first black staff member who lectured in Latin and African languages. In accord with its Christian principles, fees were low and heavily subsidised. Several scholarships were also available for indigent students.\nFort Hare had many associations over the years before it became a university in its own right. It was initially called the South African Native College or Fort Hare Native College and attached to the University of South Africa. It then became the University College of Fort Hare and associated with Rhodes University. With the introduction of apartheid, higher educational institutions in South Africa were strictly segregated along racial lines; blacks had previously gone to classes with Indians, coloureds and a few white students. From 1953 the school became part of the Bantu education system, and with the passage of the Promotion of Bantu Self Government Act in 1959, it was nationalized and segregated along racial and tribal lines, and teaching in African languages rather than English was encouraged. Fort Hare became a black university in its own right in 1970, strictly controlled by the state government.\nIt was a key institution in higher education for black Africans from 1916 to 1959. It offered a Western-style academic education to students from across sub-Saharan Africa, creating a black African elite. Fort Hare alumni were part of many subsequent independence movements and governments of newly independent African countries. Amongst those who studied at Fort Hare who later became leaders of their countries were Kenneth Kaunda, Seretse Khama, Yusuf Lule, Julius Nyerere, Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo.\nLeading opponents of the apartheid regime who attended included Nelson Mandela, Govan Mbeki and Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress, Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Robert Sobukwe of the Pan Africanist Congress, and Desmond Tutu. Mandela, who studied Latin and physics there for almost two years in the 1940s, left the institution as a result of a conflict with a college leader. He later wrote in his autobiography: \"For young black South Africans like myself, it was Oxford and Cambridge, Harvard and Yale, all rolled into one.\"\nAfter the end of apartheid, Oliver Tambo became chancellor of the university in 1991. In 2005, the University of Fort Hare was awarded the Order of the Baobab in Gold for \"Exceptional contribution to Black academic training and leadership development on the African continent.\"\nUniversity.\nThe university's main campus is located in Alice near the Tyhume River. It is in the Eastern Cape Province about 50\u00a0km west of King William's Town, in a region that for a while was known as the \"independent\" state of Ciskei. In 2011, the Alice campus had some 6400 students. A second campus at the Eastern Cape provincial capital of Bhisho was built in 1990 and hosts a few hundred students, while the campus in East London, acquired through incorporation in 2004, has some 4300 students.\nThe university has five faculties (Education, Law, Management &amp; Commerce, Science &amp; Agriculture, Social Sciences &amp; Humanities) all of which offer qualifications up to the doctoral level.\nStrategic plans.\nFollowing a period of decline in the 1990s, Derrick Swarts was appointed vice-chancellor with the task of re-establishing the university on a sound footing. The programme launched by Swarts was the UFH Strategic Plan 2000. The plan was meant to address the university's financial situation and academic quality standards simultaneously. The focus of the university was narrowed and consequently five faculties remained:\nFurther narrowing the focus, 14 institutes were founded to deal with specific issues, such as the UNESCO Oliver Tambo Chair of Human Rights. Through their location the institutes have access to poor rural areas, and consequently emphasis is placed on the role of research in improving quality of life and economic growth (and especially sustainable job creation). Among the outreach programmes, the Telkom Centre of Excellence maintains a \"living laboratory\" of four schools at Dwesa on the Wild Coast, which have introduced computer labs and internet access to areas that until 2005 did not even have electricity. The projects at Dwesa focus research on Information and Communication for Development (ICD).\nIncorporation of Rhodes University's former campus in East London in 2004 gave the university an urban base and a coastal base for the first time. Subsequent growth and development on this campus have been rapid.

Eemil Nestor Set\u00e4l\u00e4 also stated that Ukko can't be a very old name for a god and that the thunder god cult among Finns was of Germanic origin. According to Martti Haavio, the name Ukko was sometimes used as a common noun or generalised epithet for multiple deities instead of denoting a specific god. In 1789, Christfried Ganander wrote that the forest god Tapio was sometimes honoured with the name .\nUkko is parallel to Uku in Estonian mythology, but it is highly debated if such god was ever worshipped in Estonia. According to the \"Etymological Dictionary of the Finnish Language\", the word was loaned into Estonian from Finnish and the first to use it in the sense of a high god was Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald in the 1830s. Kaarle Krohn believed Kreutzwald had confused the Finnish and Ingrian \"Ukko vak\", a sacrifice to Ukko, with the Estonian , a sacrifice to the household spirit. There has also been a mention of sacrificial stones in Estonia called Ukko's stones. According to Oskar Loorits, Kreutzwald had copied \"high god Uku\" from Finnish Christfried Ganander, but the Ukko cult had many Scandinavian features which had also spread to the coasts of Virumaa, Estonia.\nName.\n, the Finnish word for thunder, is the diminutive form of the name . Ukko is Finnish for 'male grandparent', 'grandfather', and 'old man'.\nAccording to Matthias Castr\u00e9n, Ukko as the name of a god can't be very old, or at least not the oldest, because it does not exist in a wider Finno-Ugric area apart from Finland, Estonia and, in a slightly modified form, Lapland. The mainly western word (), which has the same meaning as the word , could also be connected to a thunder god: In Uusimaa, (lit.\u2009'old man is rumbling') has meant thunder. Salo and Uno Harva have also pointed out the Estonian terms 'thunder rain' and 'thunder'. Thunder is also connected to a \"grandfather\" in Selkup, languages with a distant relation to Finnish, where thunder can be called (lit.\u2009'grandfather is cursing'). Sometimes (lit.\u2009'grandfather') is replaced with (lit.\u2009'god, sky'): (lit.\u2009'voice of Num/sound of the sky'). Similar meaning is found from some of the names of the S\u00e1mi thunder god: Aija, Aije, or Aijeke.\nIn runic songs, Ukko is also given the epithet (lit.\u2009'High God'), which earlier writers have understood meaning Ukko's role as the supreme god and ruler of other gods. Julius Krohn emphasised that Ukko was not the leader of other gods, stating that this hierarchy had been created by Elias L\u00f6nnrot. According to Haavio, this epithet refers to Ukko's location: on high in the sky. Haavio also brought up the name ' which appears in runic songs, suggesting it to be a loan from Slavic languages (compare to Russian and Old Slavonic \"grom\" 'thunder'). The name ' appeared in Western Finland for a thunder god, loaned from Thor. Same might appear in a runic song from White Karelia.\nOther names for include (, 'long'), (, 'father'), (, archaic form of the above, modern meaning 'great', 'big' or 'large'). These could be euphemisms, as Jacob Fellman wrote the S\u00e1mi didn't dare to utter the name of their thunder god when it was thundering, and the same could've been true for Finns. Forest Finns used the euphemisms and , meaning something or someone who is above. A similar meaning for the name of a thunder god exists among the S\u00e1mi as , which might also be loaned as in Savo.\nA runic song from South Ostrobothnia mentions Pitk\u00e4m\u00f6\u00f6nen striking fire. In the same context, another runic song from South Ostrobothnia mentions V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen in this part, and a runic song from Kainuu mentions V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen and Ilmarinen ().\nOrigins.\nIn 1782, Christian Erici Lencqvist said seemed to have been the chief god of Finland, which was later repeated by L\u00f6nnrot and Castr\u00e9n. Julius Krohn opposed this view. Kaarle Krohn called Ukko a thunder god who had received features of a Christian protector of everything. Ukko's thunder and refreshing rain were vital for the growth of crops, but he was also asked to help in various kinds of situations, such as labour, weddings, healing the sick, setting cattle on the fields and slaughtering them, hunting, fishing, when in court, etcetera. At this point, Ukko had become a ruler of the sky with features of the Christian God. While making the \"Kalevala\", L\u00f6nnrot wanted to emphasise the supposed \"good\" proto-monotheistic nature of Finnish paganism and began to systemically refer to Ukko as the supreme god.\nUkko likely developed from Baltic influence which reached Finland with the Corded Ware culture. Later, he was influenced by the Scandinavian thunder god, Thor. Ukko shares many similarities with Thor as a club or sword wielding ruler of storms and lightning. According to Anna-Leena Siikala, Ukko's importance grew due to the rise of slash-and-burn agriculture, which resulted in the Vakkajuhlat ritual beer festival which was held until the 19th century. This beer festival also had its Baltic equivalents.\nAccording to Salo, Ukko and Ilmarinen are from their roots the same Indo-European human formed thunder god. Examples of a personified thunder or thunder god can be found among both Finno-Ugrics and Indo-Europeans. The one who strikes fire in the origin of fire runic song, and is therefore the lord of the thunderstorm, is typically called Ilmarinen or 'old man of the sky' by forging with eagle () feathers. While Harva thought Ilmarinen is the primary figure of this position, it alone is not sufficient to categorize Ilmarinen as a true thunder god. On the other hand, Frog wrote that that the sky god and thunder god likely used to be the same: Ilmari. Siikala thought was thunder itself, and Ilmarinen would've taken over its role in the song in inland Finland to emphasise the differences between fire, water (V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen) and air (Ilmarinen). In Latvian mythology, the sky smith () or a parallel figure of the thunder god or sky god forges so that coals fall into the sea or the river Daugava. Though Ukko gained the role of a controller of rain and weather for the purposes of agriculture, Ilmarinen kept a role as a wind god.\nPrior to a human-form thunder deity, it seems that Finns believed thunder to be caused by the thunder eagle. Echoes of this can still be seen with Ilmarinen forging with eagle feathers. In a runic song from Kuusamo, a spark of fire is born when an eagle's claws hit a rock. This eagle or bird from Pohjola is also able to spit fire, further confirming the thunderbird imagery. Forest Finns believed the eagle to be Ukko's helper, who drove away Ukko and V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen's enemy, Loho. Loho travelled in a raven-form, bringing wolves with her to devour cattle. To please Ukko, and to keep Loho away, Forest Finns kept a woodgrouse's wing on an altar shelf ().\nAlthough portrayed active in myth, when appealed to makes all his appearances in legend solely by natural phenomena.\nFinnish folklore.\nOldest mentions of Ukko were by Mikael Agricola in 1551, who described the festival. It is unclear what he meant by the lines . Early interpreters understood this as a description of thunder god Ukko fighting with his wife, thunder goddess Rauni, which would've then resulted in thunder. Christfried Ganander connected this \"Ukko's wife Rauni\" to Maaem\u00e4 (lit.\u2009'earth mother'; also called Akka lit.\u2009'old woman'). Haavio disagreed with this, stating that the text written by Agricola which has been used to justify this interpretation is a misunderstanding. He argued that Agricola's text mentioned two completely different gods, a fertility god and his unnamed wife (\"wife of Rauni-ukko\"), whose copulation would result in fertile fields. According to Haavio, the name Rauni would be a loan and have the same origin as the name Freyr, and the copulation of Rauni-ukko and his wife would be inspired by the Scandinavian story of intercourse between Freyr and Freyja. Salo agreed with Haavio on that Rauni was the epithet of Ukko himself, not his wife, but that it still meant the thunder god Ukko instead of a separate fertility god. He suggested the name Rauni could be a corruption of Latin and Greek made by Agricola to connect Ukko to (Greek 'belonging to the\nthunderbolt, struck by a thunderbolt, hurling thunderbolts, bearer of lightning'; Latin 'thunderbolts'), instead of a name used in folk tradition. In this case, Agricola's fertility-increasing description would refer to a sexual act between heavenly and terrestrial deities, like a spark while striking a thunderstone ( 'Ukko's rock') which were vulva-shaped.\nRainbow has been called 'Ukko's arch'. The rowan tree was sacred to Finns, and in Norse mythology, they were sacred to Thor as it was said that the rowan is Thor's saviour: He was able to get out of the Vimur River by grabbing onto a rowan. Swedes thought of the rainbow as a rowan tree, and this belief spread to Estonia as well. Because the name sounds like Old Norse 'rowan', a connection made by Set\u00e4l\u00e4, later writers have called rowan a tree sacred to Ukko. According to Kaarle Krohn, as Scandinavians thought the rowan was sacred to Thor, this belief could've spread to Finland. In runic songs, the rowan tree appears as a sacred tree in wedding songs, the rowan's branches full of berries symbolizing a pregnant woman. Rowan berries were also used for different kinds of healing and protection spells. Evil spirits and demons were thought to be afraid of the rowan.\nThe \"old man in the sky\" was also believed to cause thunderstorms by driving his chariot through the skies. Other possible causes of thunder include the rolling of stones or grinding, and there is even a set of verses describing Ukko \"threshing in a cabin of fire\".\n possessed a weapon, often called 'Ukko's nail' or , meaning a thunderstone (Neolithic stone tools such as battle axes). In spirit with the idea that thunder was originally the thunder eagle for Finns, thunderstones are also called 'Ukko's claw', claws made of stone. He also possessed a fiery arrow, 'Ukko's arrow', and a fiery bow. Runic songs mention him having a golden axe, a golden club, a hammer (Ukonvasara) and a sword. To be noted is that the word for hammer, , originally meant a stone age battle axe. Uno Harva compared Ukko's vaaja to \"vajrapani\" held by the Hindu god Indra. Ukko's hammer made of metal is comparable to Thor's weapon Mj\u00f6lnir, and pendants similar to those of Mj\u00f6lnir have been unearthed in Finland. Ukko fights against evil beings, be it demons or trolls. Similar beliefs have been recorded from Estonia, as during thunder, God is thought to strike evil spirits or Vanapagan.\nThe ladybird was also considered sacred to and called 'Ukko's cow'. The Finnish name of the great mullein (\"Verbascum thapsus\") is (lit.\u2009'Ukko's fire flower'), possibly named after Ukko.\nFestivals dedicated to Ukko.\nBefore the advent of Christianity, the Midsummer festival in Finland, today known as after John the Baptist (), was held in honor of and called (Festival of Ukko). This tradition carried to the 19th century.\nAlso dedicated to were the ( festival) also known as (Ukko's ) or simply (s). s were commonly held in May coinciding with the spring sowing. During s it was customary to consume or otherwise offer a container or some other vessel () of an alcoholic beverage or food as sacrifice. It appears that often the festival was held in the community's sacred grove or where an animal sacrifice was sometimes also performed as part of the same festival. This ceremony was believed to guarantee good weather for the coming year and thus a good harvest.\nIt appears that the tradition was rather lively. The last uncontested reports of s being held originate in the 19th century, although sporadic reports also surface in the 20th century. The festival is also mentioned by the Finnish reformer in his account of what from his point of view was Finnish idolatry.\nEponymy.\nA number of toponyms in Finland and surrounding regions contain some form of the name Ukko.\nModern influence.\nThe Weather Channel list of winter storms for 2012 list as one of the alphabetic names they used.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her personal best of 48.63 seconds currently ranks her as the 11th-fastest woman of all time, set while finishing second to Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec's number-six time at the 1996 Olympics. She became the Olympic champion for the women's 400\u00a0metres at the 2000 Summer Olympics, at which she had lit the Olympic Flame.\nFreeman was the first female Indigenous Australian to become a Commonwealth Games gold medalist at age 16 in 1990. The year 1994 was her breakthrough season. At the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Canada, Freeman won gold in both the 200\u00a0m and 400\u00a0m. She also won the silver medal at the 1996 Olympics and came first at the 1997 World Championships in the 400\u00a0m event. In 1998, Freeman took a break from running due to injury. She returned from injury in form with a first-place finish in the 400\u00a0m at the 1999 World Championships. She announced her retirement from athletics in 2003.\nIn 2007, she founded the Cathy Freeman Foundation, which changed names twice (to Community Spirit Foundation and later to Murrup). She is of the Kuku-yalanji and Birri-gubba peoples.\nCareer.\nPrior to 1987.\nCathy Freeman was successful in school athletics events. After 1987, she was coached by her stepfather, Bruce Barber, to various regional and national titles.\n1987\u20131989.\nIn 1987, Freeman moved to Kooralbyn International School to be coached professionally by Romanian Mike Danila, who later became a key influence throughout her career; he provided a strict training regime for the young athlete.\nIn 1988, she was awarded a scholarship to an exclusive girls' school, Fairholme College in Toowoomba. In a competition in 1989, Freeman ran 11.67 s in the 100 metres and Danila began to think about entering her in the Commonwealth Games Trials in Sydney.\n1990\u20131995.\nIn 1990, Freeman was chosen as a member of Australia's 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. The team won the gold medal, making Freeman the first-ever Aboriginal Commonwealth Games gold medallist, as well as one of the youngest, at 16 years old. She moved to Melbourne in 1990 after the Auckland Commonwealth Games. Shortly after moving to Melbourne, her manager Nic Bideau introduced Freeman to athletics coach Peter Fortune, who would become Freeman's coach for the rest of her career. She was then selected to represent Australia at the 1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. There, she reached the semi-finals of the 100 m and placed fifth in the final of the 200 m.\nFreeman competed in her second World Junior Championships in Seoul, South Korea. She competed only in the 200 m, winning the silver medal behind China's Hu Ling. Also in 1992, she travelled to her first Olympic Games in Barcelona, reaching the second round of her new specialty event, the 400 metres, and finishing 7th as part of the Australian team in the women's 4 \u00d7 400 m relay finals. At the 1993 World Championships in Athletics Freeman competed in the 200 m, reaching the semi-finals.\n1994 was Freeman's breakthrough season, when she entered into the world's elite for the first time. Competing at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Canada, Freeman won gold in both the 200 m and 400 m. She also competed as a member of Australia's 4 \u00d7 100 m squad, winning the silver medal and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 400 m team, who finished first but were later disqualified after Freeman obstructed the Nigerian runner. During the 1994 season, Freeman took 1.3 seconds from her 400 m personal best, achieving 50.04 seconds. She also set all-time personal bests in the 100 m (11.24) and 200 m (22.25).\nAlthough a medal favourite at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics in Sweden, Freeman finished fourth. She also reached the semi-finals of the 200 m.\n1996\u20132003.\nFreeman made more progress during the 1996 season, setting many personal bests and Australian records. By this stage, she was the biggest challenger to France's Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec at the 1996 Olympics. She eventually took the silver medal behind P\u00e9rec, in an Australian record of 48.63 seconds. This was the fourth-fastest since the world record was set in Canberra, Australia, in 1985. P\u00e9rec's winning time of 48.25 was an Olympic record.\nIn 1997, Freeman won the 400 m at the World Championships in Athens, with a time of 49.77 seconds. Her only loss in the 400 m that season was in Oslo where she injured her foot.\nFreeman took a break for the 1998 season, due to injury. Upon her return to the track in 1999, Freeman did not lose a single 400 m race, including at the World Championships.\nFreeman also lit the torch in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.\nShe continued to win into the 2000 season, despite P\u00e9rec's return to the track. Freeman was the home favourite for the 400\u00a0m title at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, where she was expected to face-off with rival P\u00e9rec. This showdown never happened, as P\u00e9rec left the Games after what she described as harassment from strangers. Freeman won the Olympic title in a time of 49.11 seconds, becoming only the second Australian Aboriginal Olympic champion (the first was Freeman's 4 \u00d7 400 teammate Nova Peris-Kneebone who won for field hockey four years earlier in Atlanta). After the race, Freeman took a victory lap, carrying both the Aboriginal and Australian flags. This was despite unofficial flags being banned at the Olympic Games, and the Aboriginal flag, while recognised as official in Australia, not being a national flag or recognised by the International Olympic Committee. Freeman also reached the final of the 200\u00a0m, coming sixth. In honour of her gold medal win in Sydney, she represented Oceania in carrying the Olympic flag at the opening ceremonies of the next Olympics, in Salt Lake City, joining Archbishop Desmond Tutu (Africa), John Glenn (The Americas), Kazuyoshi Funaki (Asia), Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa (Europe), Jean-Michel Cousteau (Environment), Jean-Claude Killy (Sport), and Steven Spielberg (Culture).\nThroughout her career, Freeman regularly competed in the Victorian Athletic League where she won two 400\u00a0m races at the Stawell Gift Carnival.\nFreeman did not compete during the 2001 season. In 2002 she returned to the track to compete as a member of Australia's victorious 4 \u00d7 400 m relay team at the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\nFreeman announced her retirement in 2003.\nPost-athletic career.\nSince retiring from athletics Freeman has become involved in a range of community and charitable activities. She was an Ambassador of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation (AIEF) until 2012.\nFreeman was appointed as an Ambassador for Cottage by the Sea (a children's holiday camp in Queenscliffe, Victoria), alongside celebrity chef Curtis Stone and big-wave surfer Jeff Rowley. Freeman retired from her position as Patron after 10 years in 2014.\nCathy Freeman Foundation.\nIn 2007 Freeman founded the Cathy Freeman Foundation. The Foundation works with four remote Indigenous communities to close the gap in education between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian children, by offering incentives for children to attend school. It partners with the AIEF and the Brotherhood of St Laurence.\nPersonal life.\nFreeman was born in 1973 at Slade Point, Mackay, Queensland, to Norman Freeman and Cecelia Barber. Norman was born in Woorabinda of the Birri Gubba people; Cecelia was born on Palm Island in Queensland, and is of Kuku Yalanji heritage. Moreover, Freeman also has Syrian ancestry. Freeman and her brothers Gavin, Garth, and Norman were raised in Mackay and in other parts of Queensland. She also had an older sister, Anne-Marie, who was born in 1966 and died in 1990. Anne-Marie had cerebral palsy and spent much of her life in the Birribi care facility in Rockhampton.\nFreeman attended several schools, including schools in Mackay and Coppabella, but was mostly educated at Fairholme College in Toowoomba where she attended after winning a scholarship to board there.\nFreeman's parents divorced in 1978, after which her father returned to Woorabinda.\nFreeman has described how she has been influenced by early experiences with racism and also by the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. She was raised a Catholic, and says of her faith, \"I'm not a devout Catholic but I like the prayers and I appreciate their values about the equality of all human kind.\"\nFreeman had a long-term romantic relationship with Nick Bideau, her manager, that ended in acrimony and legal wranglings over Freeman's endorsement earnings. Freeman married Alexander \"Sandy\" Bodecker, a Nike executive 20 years her senior, in 1999. After her success in Sydney she took an extended break from the track to nurse Bodecker through a bout of throat cancer from May to October 2002. She announced their separation in February 2003. Later that year, Freeman began dating Australian actor Joel Edgerton whom she had initially met at the 2002 \"TV Week\" Logies. Their relationship ended in early 2005.\nIn October 2006, Freeman announced her engagement to Melbourne stockbroker James Murch. They married at Spray Farm on the Bellarine Peninsula on 11 April 2009. Freeman gave birth to her first child in 2011. In August 2024 Freeman and Murch announced their separation.\nFreeman is a supporter of National Rugby League team the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and Australian Football League team the Carlton Blues. Freeman was also a part of the \"Group of 14\" who backed the return of the South Sydney Rabbitohs to the NRL following their exclusion in 2000 and 2001.\nOn 10 October 2023, Freeman was one of 25 Australians of the Year who signed an open letter supporting the Yes vote in the Indigenous Voice referendum, initiated by psychiatrist Patrick McGorry.\nMedia.\nShe joined with actress Deborah Mailman on a road trip, a four-part television documentary series \"Going Bush\" (2006) where the pair set off on a journey from Broome to Arnhem Land spending time with Indigenous communities along the way.\nIn 2008, Freeman participated in \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" and discovered that her mother was of Chinese and English heritage as well as Aboriginal. As a result of a 1917 Queensland policy that Aboriginal people could serve in the military if they had a European parent, her paternal great-grandfather, Frank Fisher served in the 11th Light Horse Regiment during World War I.\nOn her right arm, the side closest to the spectators on an athletics track, she had the words \"Cos I'm free\" tattooed midway between her shoulder and elbow.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Puppet states have nominal sovereignty, except that a foreign power effectively exercises control through economic or military support. By leaving a local government in existence the outside power evades all responsibility, while at the same time successfully paralysing the local government they tolerate.\nPuppet states differ from allies, who choose their actions of their own initiative or in accordance with treaties they have voluntarily entered. Puppet states are forced into legally endorsing actions already taken by a foreign power.\nCharacteristics.\nPuppet states are \"endowed with the outward symbols of authority\", such as a name, flag, anthem, constitution, law codes, motto, and government, but in reality, are appendages of another state which creates, sponsors or otherwise controls the puppet government. International law does not recognise occupied puppet states as legitimate.\nPuppet states can cease to be puppets through:\nTerminology.\nThe term is a metaphor which compares a state or government to a puppet controlled by a puppeteer with strings. The first recorded use of the term \"puppet government\" was in 1884, in reference to the Khedivate of Egypt.\nIn the Middle Ages, vassal states existed based on delegation of the rule of a country by a king to noble men of lower rank. Since the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, the concept of a nation came into existence where sovereignty was connected more to the people who inhabited the land than to the nobility who owned the land.\nAn earlier similar concept is suzerainty, the control of the external affairs of one state by another.\nNineteenth-century examples.\nFrench revolutionary and Napoleon/Napoleonic clients.\nThe Batavian Republic was established in the Netherlands under French revolutionary protection.\nIn Italy, the French First Republic encouraged a proliferation of small republics in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, known as sister republics.\nIn Eastern Europe, Napoleon's First French Empire established the Polish client state of the Duchy of Warsaw.\nBritish Empire.\nIn 1896, Britain established a state in Zanzibar.\nWorld War II.\nImperial Japan.\nDuring Japan's imperial period, and particularly during the Pacific War (parts of which are considered the Pacific theatre of World War II), the Imperial Japanese government established a number of dependent states.\nNazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\nSeveral European governments under the domination of Germany and Italy during World War II have been described as \"puppet r\u00e9gimes\". The formal means of control in occupied Europe varied greatly. These states fall into several categories.\nBritish examples during and after World War II.\nThe Axis demand for oil and the concern of the Allies that Germany would look to the oil-rich Middle East for a solution, caused the invasion of Iraq by the United Kingdom and the invasion of Iran by the UK and the Soviet Union. Pro-Axis governments in both Iraq and Iran were removed and replaced with Allied-dominated governments.\nSoviet examples after 1939.\nOther states under Soviet influence.\nYugoslavia was a communist state closely linked to the Soviet Union, but Yugoslavia retained autonomy within its own borders. After the Tito\u2013Stalin split in 1948, the relationship between the two countries deteriorated significantly. Yugoslavia was expelled from the international organisations of the Eastern Bloc. After Stalin's death and a period of de-Stalinization by Nikita Khrushchev, peace was restored, but the relationship between the two countries was never completely mended. Yugoslavia continued to pursue independent policies and became the founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement.\nExamples before and during decolonisation.\nIn some cases, the process of decolonisation has been managed by the decolonising power to create a neo-colony, that is a nominally independent state whose economy and politics permits continued foreign domination. Neo-colonies are not normally considered puppet states.\nDutch East Indies.\nThe Netherlands formed several puppet states in the former Dutch East Indies as part of its effort to quell the Indonesian National Revolution.\nCongo crisis.\nFollowing the Belgian Congo's independence as Congo-Leopoldville in 1960, Belgian interests supported the short-lived breakaway State of Katanga (1960\u20131963).\nEast Timor.\nIndonesia established a Provisional Government of East Timor following its invasion of East Timor in December 1975.\nSouth Africa's Bantustans.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, four ethnic Bantustans - some of which were extremely fragmented - called \"homelands\" by the government of the time, were carved out of South Africa and given nominal sovereignty. Mostly Xhosa people resided in the Ciskei and Transkei, Tswana people in Bophuthatswana, and Venda people in the Venda.\nThe principal purpose of these states was to remove South African citizenship from the Xhosa, Tswana, and Venda peoples, and so provide grounds for denying them their democratic rights. All four Bantustans were reincorporated into a democratic South Africa on 27 April 1994, under a new constitution.\nThe South African authorities established ten Bantustans in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), then illegally occupied by South Africa, in the late 1960s and early 1970s in accordance with the Odendaal Commission. Three of them were granted self-rule.

However, it was first analyzed in a philosophy paper by Robert Nozick in 1969 and appeared in the March 1973 issue of \"Scientific American\", in Martin Gardner's \"Mathematical Games\". Today it is a much debated problem in the philosophical branch of decision theory.\nDefinition.\nIn the standard version of Newcomb's problem, two boxes are designated A and B. The player is given a choice between taking only box B or taking both boxes A and B. The player knows the following:\nThe player does not know what the predictor predicted or what box B contains while making the choice.\nLimit case.\nIn the limit case of Newcomb's problem, the predictor is not only extremely reliable but actually infallible. Many solutions focus on the limit case, especially as there can seem to be no decision-relevant difference between extremely high probability and certainty. However, Nozick defended one-boxing in the limit case and two-boxing in other cases.\nRelationship to game theory.\nSome treatments of Newcomb's problem attempt to interpret it in terms of game theory, with the predictor interpreted as a second player. However, the problem does not qualify as a game in the sense defined by game theory, since the predictor's choice is probabilistically dependent on the player's choice, and the predictor has no preference order over the possible outcomes.\nStrategies.\nIn his 1969 article, Nozick noted that \"To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done. The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem, with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly.\" The problem continues to divide philosophers today. In a 2020 survey, a modest plurality of professional philosophers chose to take both boxes (39.0% versus 31.2%).\nDecision theory offers two strategies for this game that rely on different principles: the expected utility principle and the strategic dominance principle. The problem is sometimes considered a paradox (although this classification is disputed) because two seemingly logical analyses yield conflicting answers regarding which choice maximizes the player's payout.\nDavid Wolpert and Gregory Benford point out that paradoxes arise when not all relevant details of a problem are specified, and there is more than one \"intuitively obvious\" way to fill in those missing details. They suggest that, in Newcomb's paradox, the debate over which strategy is \"obviously correct\" stems from the fact that interpreting the problem details differently can lead to two distinct noncooperative games. Each strategy is optimal for one interpretation of the game but not the other. They then derive the optimal strategies for both of the games, which turn out to be independent of the predictor's infallibility, questions of causality, determinism, and free will. A similar analysis of different interpretations of the problem is given in below.\nNewcomb's problem has been used as an argument against causal decision theory, on the premise that causal decision theory supports taking both boxes in Newcomb's problem, but taking only one box is the superior choice (on expected-utility grounds). Caspar Oesterheld and Vincent Conitzer, for instance, have argued against the use of causal decision theory when applied to Newcomb's paradox. They argue that there exist multiple scenarios where the use of causal decision theory cause the agent to voluntarily lose money, and that causal decision theorists are subject to diachronic Dutch books.\nInterpretations.\nDifferent interpretations as to \"why\" the predictor is so accurate yield different rational solutions to the problem. Some such interpretations are illustrated in this section with diagrams in a convention similar to Mackie's 1977 paper \"Newcomb's Paradox and the Direction of Causation\", using white squares for events whose outcome is \"open\" to the player's rational deliberation, black squares for events whose outcome is not open to deliberation, and arrows for causal connections. In the diagrams, references to a choice being \"free\" refer to the choice being open to influence by decision-theoretical reasoning about the rational choice in the decision problem, not necessarily in some broader \"free will\" sense, although some cited authors have discussed such broader conceptions.\nCausal connection.\nIf (a) the predictor is always putting $1,000,000 in the opaque box and then using a hidden trapdoor to remove it if the player goes for the transparent box, it is reasonable to one-box. Similarly, if backwards causation is possible (b), or if (c) the problem situation is played multiple times so that the predictor learns from your behavior in one round of play to make his prediction for the next round, it is clearly reasonable to one-box. In cases (a)\u2013(c), there is a \"causal\" connection between two-boxing and losing the million, so there is no controversy.\nWilliam Lane Craig has suggested that, in a world with perfect predictors (or time machines, because a time machine could be used as a mechanism for making a prediction), retrocausality can occur. The chooser's choice can be said to have \"caused\" the predictor's prediction. Some have concluded that if time machines or perfect predictors can exist, then there can be no free will and choosers will do whatever they are fated to do. Taken together, the paradox is a restatement of the old contention that free will and determinism are incompatible, since determinism enables the existence of perfect predictors. Put another way, this paradox can be equivalent to the grandfather paradox; the paradox presupposes a perfect predictor, implying the \"chooser\" is not free to choose, yet simultaneously presumes a choice can be debated and decided. This suggests to some that the paradox is an artifact of these contradictory assumptions.\nIf the predictor is posited as infallible and incapable of error, it can seem that it is impossible for there to be a true answer as to what it is most reasonable to \"choose\", as there is no true choice, and the player's decision is predetermined by the psychological facts surveyed by the predictor. For instance, if the predictor has such an accurate track record because (f) he is a capable hypnotist who manipulates all choosers to one-box or two-box in accordance with whether he chose to put the money in the opaque box, then it would be reasonable to two-box if one could, but by construction, one is not free to. Similarly, if the predictor has an infallibly correct psychology (g), then the player's choice cannot be determined by a strategist's recommendation of what is most reasonable to do, as it is fixed in advance by his psychological character. Any solution then becomes moot. Nozick avoids this issue by positing that the predictor's predictions are \"\"almost\" certainly\" correct, thus sidestepping any issues of infallibility and causality. Nozick also stipulates that if the predictor predicts that the player will choose randomly, then box B will contain nothing. This assumes that inherently random or unpredictable events would not come into play anyway during the process of making the choice, such as free will or quantum mind processes.\nThis interpretation of Newcomb's paradox is related to logical fatalism in that they both suppose absolute certainty of the future. In logical fatalism, this assumption of certainty creates circular reasoning (\"a future event is certain to happen, therefore it is certain to happen\"), while Newcomb's paradox considers whether the participants of its game are able to affect a predestined outcome.\nCharacter formation.\nHowever, the problem can be thought of as a situation (d) where, although the predictor is infallible, the player is free to develop their own character at some point ahead of the problem situation so as to determine what the predictor will predict. Under this condition, it seems that taking only B is the correct option. This analysis argues that we can ignore the possibilities that return $0 and $1,001,000, as they both require that the predictor has made an incorrect prediction, and the problem states that the predictor is never wrong. Thus, the choice becomes whether to take both boxes with $1,000 or to take only box B with $1,000,000\u00a0\u2013 so taking only box B is always better. An example of this interpretation is Gary Drescher, who argues in his book \"Good and Real\" that the correct decision is to take only box B, by appealing to a situation he argues is analogous\u00a0\u2013 a rational agent in a deterministic universe deciding whether or not to cross a potentially busy street. Alternatively, however, if (e) the predictor can be systematically fooled, then the player should determine their character so as to always fool the predictor. As Mackie says, \"the best character of all to develop, if it were possible, is one which would fool these psychologist-seers \u2014 the player should appear to be a closed-box-only-taker, and should perhaps start by intending to take the closed box only, but then change his mind at the last minute and take both boxes; if the game is to be played repeatedly, he must appear at the start of each new game to be a reformed character who, despite his former lapses, will take only the closed box this time, and yet he must in the end yield to temptation again and take both boxes after all.\"\nSimon Burgess has argued that the problem can be divided into two stages: the stage before the predictor has gained all the information on which the prediction will be based and the stage after it. While the player is still in the first stage, they are presumably able to influence the predictor's prediction, for example, by committing to taking only one box. So players who are still in the first stage should simply commit themselves to one-boxing.\nBurgess readily acknowledges that those who are in the second stage should take both boxes. As he emphasises, however, for all practical purposes that is beside the point; the decisions \"that determine what happens to the vast bulk of the money on offer all occur in the first [stage]\". So players who find themselves in the second stage without having already committed to one-boxing will invariably end up without the riches and without anyone else to blame. In Burgess's words: \"you've been a bad boy scout\"; \"the riches are reserved for those who are prepared\".\nBurgess has stressed that\u00a0\u2013 \"pace\" certain critics (e.g., Peter Slezak)\u00a0\u2013 he does not recommend that players try to trick the predictor. Nor does he assume that the predictor is unable to predict the player's thought process in the second stage. Quite to the contrary, Burgess analyses Newcomb's paradox as a common cause problem, and he pays special attention to the importance of adopting a set of unconditional probability values\u00a0\u2013 whether implicitly or explicitly\u00a0\u2013 that are entirely consistent at all times. To treat the paradox as a common cause problem is simply to assume that the player's decision and the predictor's prediction have a common cause. (That common cause may be, for example, the player's brain state at some particular time before the second stage begins.) \nBurgess highlights a similarity between Newcomb's paradox and the Kavka's toxin puzzle. In both problems one can have a reason to intend to do something without having a reason to actually do it. Recognition of that similarity, however, is something that Burgess actually credits to Andy Egan.\nNo connection at all.\nFinally, it is possible to suppose that the predictor's past accuracy came from other factors which are now causally unconnected with the player's move, such as (h) very lucky sheer coincidence, or (i) a form of hypnosis which the player is able, in some rare cases, to break free from, or (j) a form of highly correct psychology which nevertheless it is possible, in some rare cases, to fool. The indeterminacy of such a causal connection is signified by a dashed arrow. In those situations, it is reasonable to make the two-boxing choice, but simply much more difficult to do so when there is money in the opaque box.\nAnalogies and extensions.\nAndrew Irvine argues that the problem is structurally isomorphic to Braess's paradox, a non-intuitive but ultimately non-paradoxical result concerning equilibrium points in physical systems of various kinds.\nNewcomb's paradox can also be related to the question of machine consciousness, specifically if a perfect simulation of a person's brain will generate the consciousness of that person. Suppose we take the predictor to be a machine that arrives at its prediction by simulating the brain of the chooser when confronted with the problem of which box to choose. If that simulation generates the consciousness of the chooser, then the chooser cannot tell whether they are standing in front of the boxes in the real world or in the virtual world generated by the simulation in the past. The \"virtual\" chooser would thus tell the predictor which choice the \"real\" chooser is going to make, and the chooser, not knowing whether they are the real chooser or the simulation, should take only the second box.\nA quantum-theoretical version of Newcomb's problem, in which box B is entangled with box A has been proposed. This gives yet another interpretation to the reliability of the predictor. Due to ongoing debates on the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics, it is not settled whether this counts as a .\nNick Bostrom has proposed an extension of Newcomb's problem, called \"the meta-Newcomb problem.\" The setup of this problem is similar to the original Newcomb problem. However, the twist here is that the predictor may elect to decide whether to fill box B after the player has made a choice, and the player does not know whether box B has already been filled. There is also another predictor: a \"meta-predictor\" who has reliably predicted both the players and the predictor in the past, and who predicts the following: \"Either you will choose both boxes, and the predictor will make its decision after you, or you will choose only box B, and the predictor will already have made its decision.\" In this situation, a proponent of choosing both boxes is faced with the following dilemma: if the player chooses both boxes, the predictor will not yet have made its decision, and therefore a more rational choice would be for the player to choose box B only. But if the player so chooses, the predictor will already have made its decision, making it impossible for the player's decision to affect the predictor's decision.\nIn the late 1950s, R.A. Fisher proposed an analogy between Newcomb's problem and the rationality of smoking under the (now known to be false) supposition that smoking does not cause cancer but rather, a so-called \"smoker's lesion\" is probabilistically connected with both smoking and cancer. In what is called the \"tickle defense\", the real-life relevance of this analogy is disputed by noting that the causal mechanism for such a lesion would have to work by increasing the player's expected utility if they were to smoke. If so, the player must know whether he has the lesion as long as he knows the payoff-matrix parameters to make a rational choice regarding the problem\u2014and if he does not know these parameters, then he is not facing a decision problem at all. Nevertheless, such medical analogies are still often considered \"realistic versions\" of Newcomb's problem.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally the term referred to smaller guns that could accompany a field army on the march, that when in combat could be moved about the battlefield in response to changing circumstances (field artillery), as opposed to guns installed in a fort (garrison artillery or coastal artillery), or to siege cannons and mortars which are too large to be moved quickly, and would be used only in a prolonged siege.\nPerhaps the most famous use of the field gun in terms of advanced tactics was Napoleon Bonaparte's use of very large wheels on the guns that allowed them to be moved quickly even during a battle. By moving the guns from point to point during a battle, enemy formations could be broken up to be handled by the infantry or cavalry wherever they were massing, dramatically increasing the overall effectiveness of the attack.\nWorld War I.\nAs the evolution of artillery continued, almost all guns of any size became capable of being moved at some speed. With few exceptions, even the largest siege weapons had become mobile by road or rail by the start of World War I, and evolution after that point tended to be towards smaller weapons with increased mobility. Even the German super-heavy guns in World War II were rail or caterpillar-track mobile.\nIn British use, \"field guns\" or \"light guns\" were anything up to in calibre, larger calibres were \"medium guns\", and the largest calibres were \"heavy guns\".\nWorld War II.\nSince about the start of World War II, the term has been applied to long-range artillery pieces that fire at a relatively low angle, as opposed to howitzers which can fire at higher angles. Field guns also lack a specialized purpose, such as anti-tank or coastal artillery. By the later stages of World War II the majority of artillery in use was either in the form of howitzers of to , or in form of hybrid anti-tank/field guns that had high enough muzzle velocity to be used in both roles. The most common field guns of the era were the British , the American 155 mm Long Tom (a development of a French World War I weapon) and the Soviet BS-3 \u2013 an artillery piece adapted from a naval gun and designed to double up as an anti-tank weapon.\nOne of the most produced field guns during the war was the Soviet ZiS-3 with over 103,000 produced. The ZiS-3 could be used in direct fire against armored vehicles, direct fire in infantry support, and indirect fire against distant targets.\n1960s and 1970s.\nThe U.S. Army tried the long-range gun again from the early 1960s to the late 1970s with the M107 175 mm gun. The M107 was used extensively in the Vietnam War and proved effective in artillery duels with the North Vietnamese forces. It was considered a high-maintenance item and was removed from service with U.S. forces after a rash of cracked barrels. Production of the M107 continued until 1980 and the gun is still in service with the Israeli military. Reserve stocks are held by other former users such as the People's Army of Vietnam.\nModern times.\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, the field gun has seen limited combat use. The class of small and highly mobile artillery has been filled with increasing capacity by the man-portable mortar in or / calibre and has replaced every artillery piece smaller than . Gun-howitzers fill the middle ground, with the world rapidly standardizing on either the 155 mm (6.1 in) NATO or Warsaw Pact (former USSR) standards. The need for a long-range weapon is filled by rockets, missiles, and aircraft. Modern gun-artillery such as the L118 105 mm light gun or the M119 105 mm howitzer are used to provide fire support for infantry and armour at ranges where mortars are impractical. Man-packed mortars lack the range or hitting power of gun-artillery. In between is the rifled towed mortar; this weapon (usually in calibre) is light enough to be towed by a truck or SUV, has a range of over and fires a projectile comparable in destructive power to a / artillery shell.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also used to quantify internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus, and ultimate tensile strength. The unit, named after Blaise Pascal, is an SI coherent derived unit defined as one newton per square metre (N/m2). It is also equivalent to 10 barye (10 Ba) in the CGS system. Common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal (1\u00a0hPa = 100\u00a0Pa), which is equal to one millibar, and the kilopascal (1\u00a0kPa = 1,000\u00a0Pa), which is equal to one centibar.\nThe unit of measurement called \"standard atmosphere\" (atm) is defined as .\nMeteorological observations typically report atmospheric pressure in hectopascals per the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization, thus a standard atmosphere or typical sea-level air pressure is about 1,013\u00a0hPa. Reports in the United States typically use inches of mercury or millibars (hectopascals). In Canada, these reports are given in kilopascals.\nEtymology.\nThe unit is named after Blaise Pascal, noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, and experiments with a barometer. The name \"pascal\" was adopted for the SI unit newton per square metre (N/m2) by the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971.\nDefinition.\nThe pascal can be expressed using SI derived units, or alternatively solely SI base units, as:\n formula_1\nwhere N is the newton, m is the metre, kg is the kilogram, s is the second, and J is the joule.\nOne pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre.\nStandard units.\nThe unit of measurement called an atmosphere or a standard atmosphere (atm) is . This value is often used as a reference pressure and specified as such in some national and international standards, such as the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 2787 (pneumatic tools and compressors), ISO 2533 (aerospace) and ISO\u00a05024 (petroleum). In contrast, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends the use of 100\u00a0kPa as a standard pressure when reporting the properties of substances.\nUnicode has dedicated code-points and in the CJK Compatibility block, but these exist only for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore deprecated.\nUses.\nThe pascal (Pa) or kilopascal (kPa) as a unit of pressure measurement is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the pounds per square inch (psi) unit, except in some countries that still use the imperial measurement system or the US customary system, including the United States.\nGeophysicists use the gigapascal (GPa) in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the Earth.\nMedical elastography measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, and often displays the Young's modulus or shear modulus of tissue in kilopascals.\nIn materials science and engineering, the pascal measures the stiffness, tensile strength and compressive strength of materials. In engineering the megapascal (MPa) is the preferred unit for these uses, because the pascal represents a very small quantity.\nThe pascal is also equivalent to the SI unit of energy density, the joule per cubic metre. This applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases, but also to the energy density of electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields.\nThe pascal is used to measure sound pressure. Loudness is the subjective experience of sound pressure and is measured as a sound pressure level (SPL) on a logarithmic scale of the sound pressure relative to some reference pressure. For sound in air, a pressure of 20 \u03bcPa is considered to be at the threshold of hearing for humans and is a common reference pressure, so that its SPL is zero.\nThe airtightness of buildings is measured at 50\u00a0Pa.\nIn medicine, blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg, very close to one Torr). The normal adult blood pressure is less than 120\u00a0mmHg systolic BP (SBP) and less than 80\u00a0mmHg diastolic BP (DBP). Convert mmHg to SI units as follows: 1 mmHg =. Hence the normal blood pressure in SI units is less than 16.0\u00a0kPa SBP and less than 10.7\u00a0kPa DBP. These values are similar to the pressure of water column of average human height; so pressure has to be measured on arm roughly at the level of the heart.\nHectopascal and millibar units.\nThe units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in meteorology were formerly the bar (), which is close to the average air pressure on Earth, and the millibar. Since the introduction of SI units, meteorologists generally measure atmospheric pressure in hectopascals (hPa), equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar. Exceptions include Canada, which uses kilopascals (kPa). In many other fields of science, prefixes that are a power of 1000 are preferred, which theoretically excludes hectopascal from use.\nMany countries still use millibars to measure atmospheric pressure. In practically all other fields, the kilopascal is used instead.\nMultiples and submultiples.\nDecimal multiples and submultiples are formed using standard metric prefixes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It became the most widely syndicated newspaper column in the world, syndicated in 1,400 newspapers with 110 million readers.\nFrom 1963 to 1975, Phillips also hosted a daily \"Dear Abby\" program on CBS Radio. TV anchorwoman Diane Sawyer calls her the \"pioneering queen of salty advice\". She was also the paternal stepgrandmother of U.S. Congressman Dean Phillips.\nEarly life.\nPauline Friedman, nicknamed \"Popo\", was born in Sioux City, Iowa, to Russian Jewish immigrants Rebecca (n\u00e9e Rushall) and Abraham B. Friedman, owner of a chain of movie theaters. She was the youngest of four sisters and grew up in Sioux City. Her identical twin Esther Pauline Friedman (married name Lederer), nicknamed \u201cEppie\u201d, was columnist Ann Landers. Lederer had become Ann Landers in 1955, and Phillips soon followed suit by launching her own advice column.\nPhillips graduated from the now-defunct Central High School in Sioux City. She then studied journalism and psychology at Morningside College, where she and her twin sister wrote a gossip column in the school newspaper. The column was called \"The Campus Rat\", and they used the pen name \"PE-EP\", inspired by their names Pauline Esther and Esther Pauline. Both sisters were married in a double wedding ceremony on July 2, 1939, two days before their 21st birthday. Pauline married Morton Phillips of Minneapolis, and had son Edward and daughter Jeanne.\nCareer.\nPhillips' writing career began in January 1956 when she was 37 and new to the San Francisco area. She phoned the editor of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and said that she could write a better advice column than the one that she had been reading in the newspaper. After hearing her modest credentials, editor Stanleigh Arnold gave her some letters in need of answers and told her to bring back her replies in a week; Phillips got her replies back to the \"Chronicle\" in an hour and a half. In an interview with Larry King, she said that she had no work experience, lacking even a social security number. The editor, however, asked if she was a professional writer. He said that her writing was \"fabulous', and she was hired that day.\nShe went by the pen name Abigail Van Buren, combining the Old Testament prophetess from with President Martin Van Buren. Her twin sister was the author of the Ann Landers column, and the competition created acrimony between them for many years. In 1956, Phillips offered her column to the \"Sioux City Journal\" at a reduced price, provided that the paper refuse to print her sister's column. The sisters ostensibly reconciled in 1964 but remained competitors. They became \"the most widely read and most quoted women in the world\" in 1958, according to \"Life\" magazine.\nWriting style.\nNewspapers had included gossip and personal columnists for more than a century, but the two sisters added \"something special\", according to \"Life\", in that they were the first to publish letters and replies covering a wide range of personal problems, replying with \"vaudeville punch lines\" rooted in common sense. The editor of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" described their skill as \"beyond mere shrewdness\u2014a quality very close to genuine wisdom.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPhillips stated that she did not publish the most sensitive letters that she received, but instead replied to them individually. Sometimes she would write a brief note on the letter itself, letting one of her secretaries respond fully using her advice. If a person seemed suicidal from their letter, she would call them on the phone.\nPersonal life and beliefs.\nPhillips was considered \"the embodiment of female orthodoxy.\" This attitude carried over into her column in the late 1950s, and she considered women \"faintly ridiculous\" if they were unable to make their marriages work. Her \"code of conduct\" was \"husband and children first.\" In her later years, she did not avoid suggesting divorce when a relationship became \"intolerable\", and considered how a bad marriage might affect children: \"When kids see parents fighting, or even sniping at each other, I think it is terribly damaging.\"\nPhillips supported gay rights, and season 1, episode 8 of the podcast \"Making Gay History\" is about her.\nBoth Phillips and her sister enjoyed socializing with celebrities, and because of their fame, celebrities liked being seen with them. Among Phillips' friends soon after she began her column were politicians, including Senators Hubert Humphrey and Herbert Lehman; and entertainers, including Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. They also admired Bishop Fulton Sheen, whom they met when learning about Catholicism while studying about other religions. The bishop admired them both in return due to their ability to remain \"unawed\" and unaffected by the fame of others. Phillips was Jewish, and she commented: \"He's one of the greatest men I ever met, but he'll be a Jew before I'm a Catholic.\"\nPhillips was an honorary member of Women in Communications, the American College of Psychiatrists, and the National Council of Jewish Women. Her columns were collected in \"Dear Abby\", \"Dear Teenager\", \"Dear Abby on Marriage\", \"Where Were You When President Kennedy was Shot?\", \"The Dear Abby Wedding Planner\", and \"The Best of Dear Abby\". She said that writing is \"only work if you'd rather be doing something else.\" She co-wrote the column with her daughter Jeanne from 1987 until her retirement. In 2002, Phillips' Alzheimer's disease made it impossible for her to continue writing, and Jeanne assumed all the writing responsibilities of \"Dear Abby\".\nDeath.\nPhillips died on January 16, 2013, at age 94, after battling Alzheimer's for 11 years. She was survived by her husband of 73 years, Morton Phillips, daughter Jeanne Phillips, four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Her son, Edward, had died two years prior.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The unit is known for its experimental and pioneering work in electronic music and music technology, as well as its popular scores for programmes such as \"Doctor Who\" and \"Quatermass and the Pit\" during the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe original Radiophonic Workshop was based in the BBC's Maida Vale Studios in Delaware Road, Maida Vale, London. The Workshop was closed in March 1998, although much of its traditional work had already been outsourced by 1995. Its members included Daphne Oram, Delia Derbyshire, David Cain, John Baker, Paddy Kingsland, Glynis Jones, Maddalena Fagandini, Richard Yeoman-Clark and Elizabeth Parker, the last to leave.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe Workshop was set up to satisfy the growing demand in the late 1950s for \"radiophonic\" sounds from a group of producers and studio managers at the BBC, including Desmond Briscoe, Daphne Oram, Donald McWhinnie, and Frederick Bradnum. For some time there had been much interest in producing innovative music and sounds to go with the pioneering programming of the era, in particular the dramatic output of the BBC Third Programme. Often the sounds required for the atmosphere that programme makers wished to create were unavailable or non-existent through traditional sources and so some, such as the musically trained Oram, would look to new techniques to produce effects and music for their pieces. Much of this interest drew them to musique concr\u00e8te and tape manipulation techniques, since using these methods could allow them to create soundscapes suitable for the growing range of unconventional programming. When the BBC noticed the rising popularity of this method they established a Radiophonic Effects Committee, setting up the Workshop in rooms 13 &amp; 14 of the BBC's Maida Vale studios with a budget of \u00a32,000. The Workshop contributed articles on their findings to magazines, leading to some of their techniques being borrowed by sixties producers and engineers such as Eddie Kramer.\nEarly days.\nIn 1957, Daphne Oram set up the Radiophonic Workshop with Desmond Briscoe, who was appointed the Senior Studio Manager with Dick Mills employed as a technical assistant. Much of The Radiophonic Workshop's early work was in effects for radio, in particular experimental drama and \"radiophonic poems\". Their significant early output included creating effects for the popular science-fiction serial \"Quatermass and the Pit\" and memorable comedy sounds for \"The Goon Show\". In 1959, Daphne Oram left the workshop to set up her own studio, the \"Oramics Studios for Electronic Composition\", where she eventually developed her \"Oramics\" technique of electronic sound creation. That year Maddalena Fagandini joined the workshop from the BBC's Italian Service.\nFrom the early sixties the Workshop began creating television theme tunes and jingles, particularly for low budget schools programmes. The shift from the experimental nature of the late 50s dramas to theme tunes was noticeable enough for one radio presenter to have to remind listeners that the purpose of the Workshop was not pop music. In fact, in 1962 one of Fagandini's interval signals \"Time Beat\" was reworked with assistance from George Martin (in his pre-Beatles days) and commercially released as a single using the pseudonym Ray Cathode. During this early period the innovative electronic approaches to music in the Workshop began to attract some significant young talent including Delia Derbyshire, Brian Hodgson and John Baker, who was in fact a jazz pianist with an interest in reverse tape effects. Later, in 1967. they were joined by David Cain, a jazz bass player and mathematician.\nIn these early days, one criticism the Workshop attracted was its policy of not allowing musicians from outside the BBC to use its equipment, which was some of the most advanced in the country at that time not only because of its nature, but also because of the unique combinations and workflows which the Workshop afforded its composers. In later years this would become less important as more electronic equipment became readily available to a wider audience.\n\"Doctor Who\".\nIn 1963 they were approached by composer Ron Grainer to record a theme tune for the upcoming BBC television series \"Doctor Who\". Presented with the task of \"realising\" Grainer's score, complete with its descriptions of \"sweeps\", \"swoops\", \"wind clouds\" and \"wind bubbles\", Delia Derbyshire created a piece of electronic music which has become one of television's most recognisable themes. Over the next quarter-century the Workshop contributed greatly to the programme providing its vast range of unusual sound-effects, from the TARDIS dematerialisation to the Sonic screwdriver, as well as much of the programme's distinctive electronic incidental music, including every score from 1980 to 1985.\nIn 2018 Matthew Herbert, creative director of The New Radiophonic Workshop, composed the sting used alongside the reveal of the new Doctor Who logo debuting later that year.\nChanges.\nAs the sixties drew to a close, many of the techniques used by the Workshop changed as more electronic music began to be produced by synthesisers. Many of the old members of the Workshop were reluctant to use the new instruments, often because of the limitations and unreliable nature of many of the early synthesisers but also, for some, because of a dislike of the sounds they created. This led to many leaving the workshop making way for a new generation of musicians in the early 1970s including Malcolm Clarke, Paddy Kingsland, Roger Limb and Peter Howell. From the early days of a studio full of tape reels and electronic oscillators, the Workshop now found itself in possession of various synthesisers including the EMS VCS 3 and the EMS Synthi 100 nicknamed the \"Delaware\" by the members of the Workshop.\nIn 1977, Workshop co-founder Desmond Briscoe retired from organisational duties with Brian Hodgson, returning after a five-year gap away from the Workshop, taking over.\nBy this point the output of the Workshop was vast with high demand for complete scores for programmes as well as the themes and sound effects for which it had made its name. By the end of the decade the workshop was contributing to over 300 programmes a year from all departments of the BBC and had long since expanded from its early two-room setup. Its contributions included material for programmes such as \"The Body in Question\", \"Blue Peter\" and \"Tomorrow's World\" as well as sound effects for popular science fiction programmes \"Blake's 7\" and \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (in both its radio and television forms) by Richard Yeoman-Clark and Paddy Kingsland respectively.\nLatter days.\nBy the early 1990s, BBC Director General John Birt decided that departments were to charge each other and bid against each other for services and to close those that couldn't make enough revenue to cover their costs. In 1991 the Workshop was given five years in which to break even but the cost of keeping the department, which required two dedicated engineers, a software developer (Tony Morton) and a secretary (Maxine) as well as the composers, proved too much and so they failed. Dick Mills, who had worked on \"Doctor Who\" since the very beginning, left in 1993, along with Ray White, Senior Engineer, and his assistant, Ray Riley, with the Maida Vale technical team taking on their role, and engineer Fiona Sleigh smoothing the transition.\nIn 1995, despite being asked to continue, organiser Brian Hodgson left the Workshop, and his role was carried out remotely from Broadcasting House by people with other priorities and little enthusiasm. Malcolm Clarke and Roger Limb left. By the end, only one composer, Elizabeth Parker, remained. The Workshop officially closed in March 1998, but Elizabeth stayed on for a couple of months to complete her last job. John Hunt, (who took over much of the specialist editing side of the workshop previously done by Dick Mills) continued working in Studio E, now called \"Radiophonics\" until well into 2000, occasionally managing to fit in a bit of traditional Radiophonics work. Mark Ayres recalls the Workshop's tape archive being collected on 1 April, exactly 40 years after the department had opened.\nLegacy.\nFollowing the decision to close the Radiophonic Workshop, the studios were cleared and most remaining equipment was disposed of, with some of it being sold to the composers. The tape library was largely forgotten until the room was ordered to be \"cleared\". Fortunately the Maida Vale studios technical team became aware of this and were able to hide the tapes away in various dark corners of the building before they could be thrown away. Eventually Mark Ayres and Brian Hodgson were commissioned to catalogue its extensive library of recordings with help from other composers.\nIn October 2003, \"Alchemists of Sound\", an hour-long television documentary about the Radiophonic Workshop, was broadcast on BBC Four.\nThe Magnetic Fields titled the first track of their album \"Holiday\", after the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.\nIn February 2025, Spitfire Audio released a sample library featuring sounds from the Radiophonic Workshop for public purchase. The library featured audio sourced from the original Workshop archives, as well as newly recorded performances by the Workshop members. Archivist Mark Ayres noted the team's age as a motivating factor for this collaboration, stating, \"We're not going to be around for ever. It was really important to leave a creative tool, inspired by our work, for other people to use going forward.\"\nLive reunions since 2009.\nIn May 2009, Dick Mills reunited with former BBC Radiophonic Workshop composers Roger Limb, Paddy Kingsland and Peter Howell with archivist Mark Ayres for a live concert at The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London, performing as \"The Radiophonic Workshop\". The composers, backed by a small brass section and a live drummer, performed a large number of their BBC-commissioned musical works including sections of incidental music from \"The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy\" and \"Doctor Who\" (including a medley of Mark Ayres's work) as well as some collaborative compositions written specifically for the Roundhouse concert.\nThe live performances were mixed in surround sound and interspersed with musical video montage tributes of deceased members of the Workshop including Daphne Oram, Delia Derbyshire and John Baker. The two and a half-hour event climaxed with live performances of the Derbyshire and Peter Howell arrangements of \"Doctor Who\", segueing into a new Radiophonic version of the theme tune. Celebrated attendees included actor/writer/composer Peter Serafinowicz and satirist/writer/broadcaster Victor Lewis-Smith. Multiple cameras recorded the event but it has yet to be broadcast or released in any form, although amateur footage of the event can be seen on YouTube.\nIn 2013 the original members of the Workshop regrouped again for a more concerted programme of live appearances. Performing as 'The Radiophonic Workshop' (dropping the BBC prefix) they were joined by drummer Kieron Pepper (The Prodigy, Dead Kids, OutPatient) and Bob Earland from Clor. They also embarked on a new recording project set for release in Autumn of 2014. This involved collaborations with contemporary electronic musicians, video artists, DJs, remixers, poets, writers and singers. Live appearances in 2013 included Festival Number 6 at Portmeirion, Wales in September and The London Electronic Arts Festival in November. The shows featured archive TV and visuals from many of the TV and film soundtracks that the Radiophonic Workshop contributed to between 1958 and 1998 when the unit was deactivated. The Radiophonic Workshop appeared on BBC television's The One Show on 20 November 2013 playing a unique version of the Doctor Who Theme that combined Delia Derbyshire's original source tapes and Peter Howell's 1980 realisation of the Ron Grainer composition. Radio 6 Music's Marc Riley played host to a Radiophonic Workshop session where they delivered live versions of Roger Limb's Incubus, Paddy Kingsland's Vespucci, the Doctor Who Medley and a new composition \u2013 Electricity Language and Me (by American poet Peter Adam Salomon), featuring DJ Andrew Weatherall as the narrative voice for this classic piece of Radiophonic sound design. There were a number of radio, online and print interviews done at the time to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who.\nThe Workshop's early archive recordings were also reissued on vinyl in November 2013 to accompany this renewed activity. In 2014, \"The Radiophonic Workshop\" appeared at festivals including End of the Road Festival, and the reissue programme of earlier work from their extensive catalogue continues along with a planned exploration of previously unheard or rare archive recordings.\n2012 online revival.\nIn September 2012 Arts Council England and the BBC announced a joint venture whereby the concept of the Radiophonic Workshop would be revived as an online venture, with seven new, non-original composers and musicians. The new Workshop was based online at The Space, a joint venture between the BBC and Arts Council England. Composer Matthew Herbert was appointed the new Creative Director, and worked alongside Micachu, Yann Seznec, Max de Wardener, Patrick Bergel, James Mather, theatre director Lyndsey Turner and broadcast technologist Tony Churnside.\nComposer Matthew Herbert's first work for The New Radiophonic Workshop takes audio from 25 previous projects featured on the website \u2013 from theater performances to poetry readings, creating a \"curious murmur of activity\". It can be heard by clicking on a button labeled \"listen to The Space\" at the top of any page on the website.\nThe New Radiophonic Workshop, not to be confused with the reactivated Radiophonic Workshop whose members are original BBC personnel, an entirely separate entity from the original unit, was assembled by Mathew Herbert as an online collective of composers for The Space arts project.\nTechniques.\nThe techniques initially used by the Radiophonic Workshop were closely related to those used in \"musique concr\u00e8te\"; new sounds for programmes were created by using recordings of everyday sounds such as voices, bells or gravel as raw material for \"radiophonic\" manipulations. In these manipulations, audio tape could be played back at different speeds (altering a sound's pitch), reversed, cut and joined, or processed using reverb or equalisation. The most famous of the Workshop's creations using 'radiophonic' techniques include the \"Doctor Who\" theme music, which Delia Derbyshire created using a plucked string, 12 oscillators and a lot of tape manipulation; and the sound of the TARDIS (the Doctor's time machine) materialising and dematerialising, which was created by Brian Hodgson running his keys along the rusty bass strings of a broken piano, with the recording slowed down to make an even lower sound.\nMuch of the equipment used by the Workshop in the earlier years of its operation in the late 1950s was semi-professional and was passed down from other departments, though two giant professional tape-recorders made an early centrepiece. Reverberation was obtained using an echo chamber, a basement room with bare painted walls empty except for loudspeakers and microphones. Due to the considerable technical challenges faced by the Workshop and BBC traditions, staff initially worked in pairs with one person assigned to the technical aspects of the work and the other to the artistic direction.\nInfluence on popular music.\nThe Radiophonic Workshop published \"Radiophonics in the BBC\" in November 1963, listing all equipment used in their two workshops, diagrams of several systems, and a number of anecdotes. The Radiophonic Workshop also contributed articles to magazines of its experiments, complete with instructions and wiring diagrams.\nBritish psychedelic rock group Pink Floyd made a memorable trip to the workshop in 1967. They had employed tape loops, sound effects, found sounds and the principles of musique concrete on their debut album \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" from that same year. Other fans of the Radiophonic Workshop included The Rolling Stones' Brian Jones \u2013 who visited in 1968 \u2013 and Roger Mayer, who supplied guitar pedals to Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix. Phil Manzanera has also cited the Workshop as an influence on the sound of his group Roxy Music.\nIn 1997 the electronic dance music magazine \"Mixmag\" described the Workshop as, \"the unsung heroes of British electronica\". Their work has been sampled extensively by contemporary electronic artists.\nMembers of the Radiophonic Workshop.\n1958\u20131998.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDiscography.\nMain albums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSelected other works.\n\"Doctor Who\" incidental music.\nThe \"Doctor Who\" theme music was provided by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop from 1963 to 1985.

{"id": "66038", "revid": "50452819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66038", "title": "Breakbeat", "text": "Genre of electronic music\nBreakbeat is a broad type of electronic music that uses drum breaks, often sampled from early recordings of funk, jazz, and R&amp;B. Breakbeats have been used in styles such as Florida breaks, hip-hop, jungle, drum and bass, big beat, breakbeat hardcore, and UK garage styles (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep).\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the word \"breakbeat\" is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a \"break\" in the music \u2013 for example, the Amen break (a drum solo from \"Amen, Brother\" by the Winstons) or the Think break (from \"Think (About It)\" by Lyn Collins).\nHistory.\n1970s\u20131980s: Classic breaks and hip-hop production.\nBeginning in 1973 and continuing through the late 1970s and early 1980s, hip-hop turntablists such as DJ Kool Herc began using several funk breaks in a row, using drum breaks from jazz-funk tracks such as James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" and the Winstons' \"Amen, Brother\", to form the rhythmic base for hip-hop songs.\nDJ Kool Herc's breaks style involved playing the same record on two turntables and playing the break repeatedly, alternating between the two records. Grandmaster Flash perfected this idea with what he called the \"quick-mix theory\": he would mark the points on the record where the break began and ended with a crayon, so that he could easily replay the break by spinning the record and not touching the tone arm. This style was copied and improved upon by early hip-hop DJs Afrika Bambaataa and Grand Wizard Theodore. This style was extremely popular in clubs and dancehalls because the extended breaks compositions provided breakers with more opportunities to showcase their skills.\nIn the late 1970s, breakbeats had attained a large presence in hip-hop. In the 1980s, the evolution of technology began to make sampling breaks easier and more affordable for DJs and producers, which helped nurture the commercialization of hip-hop. Through early techniques such as pausing tapes and then recording the break, by the 1980s, technology allowed anybody with a tape recorder to find the breakbeat.\n1990s: Evolution as electronic dance genre.\nIn the late-1980s, breakbeat became an essential feature of many genres of breaks music which became popular within the global dance music scene, including acid breaks, electro-funk, and Miami bass, and a decade later big beat and nu skool breaks.\nIn the early 1990s, acid house artists and producers started using breakbeat samples in their music to create breakbeat hardcore. The hardcore scene then diverged into subgenres like jungle and drum and bass, which generally was faster and focused more on complex sampled drum patterns. An example of this is Goldie's album \"Timeless\". Josh Lawford of Ravescene prophesied that breakbeat was \"the death-knell of rave\" because the ever-changing drumbeat patterns of breakbeat music didn't allow for the same zoned out, trance-like state that the standard, steady 4/4 beats of house enabled.\nIncorporating many components of those genres, the Florida breaks subgenre followed during the early-to-mid 1990s and had a unique sound that was soon internationally popular among producers, DJs, and club-goers.\nIn 1994, the influential techno act Autechre released \"Anti EP\" in response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, deliberately using advanced algorithmic programming to generate non-repetitive breakbeats for the full duration of the tracks, in order to subvert the legal definitions within that legislation which specified in the section creating police powers to remove ravers from raves that \"'music' includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats\".\nIn the late 1990s, another style of breakbeat emerged, \"funky breaks\", a style that was incorporating elements of trance, hip-hop and jungle. It was pioneered by the Chemical Brothers and James Lavelle's Mo'Wax imprint. The genre had commercial peak in 1997, when such music was topping in pop charts and often featured in commercials. The most notable artists of the sound were the Prodigy, Death in Vegas, the Crystal Method, and Propellerheads.\nCharacteristics.\nThe tempo of breaks tracks, ranging from 110 to 175 beats per minute, allows DJs to mix breaks with a wide range of different genres in their sets. This has led to breakbeats being used in many hip-hop, jungle, drum and bass and hardcore tracks. They can also be heard in other music, anywhere from popular music to background music in car and clothing commercials on radio or TV.\nThe \"Amen break\".\nThe Amen break, a drum break from the Winstons' song \"Amen, Brother\" is widely regarded as one of the most widely used and sampled breaks among music using breakbeats. One of the earliest uses of the Amen break was on \"King of the Beats\" by Mantronix, and has since been used in thousands of songs. Other popular breaks are from James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" (1970) and \"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\" (1969), the Incredible Bongo Band's 1973 cover of the Shadows' \"Apache\", and Lyn Collins's 1972 song \"Think (About It)\". The Winstons have not received royalties for third-party use of samples of the break recorded on their original music release.\nSampled breakbeats.\nWith the advent of digital sampling and music editing on the computer, breakbeats have become much easier to create and use. Now, instead of cutting and splicing tape sections or constantly backspinning two records at the same time, a computer program can be used to cut, paste, and loop breakbeats endlessly. Digital effects such as filters, reverb, reversing, time stretching and pitch shifting can be added to the beat, and even to individual sounds by themselves. Individual instruments from within a breakbeat can be sampled and combined with others, thereby creating wholly new breakbeat patterns.\nLegal issues.\nWith the rise in popularity of breakbeat music and the advent of digital audio samplers, companies started selling \"breakbeat packages\" for the express purpose of helping artists create breakbeats. A breakbeat kit CD would contain many breakbeat samples from different songs and artists, often without the artist's permission or even knowledge.\nSubgenres.\nAcid breaks.\n\"Acid breaks\" or \"chemical breaks\" is acid house, but with a breakbeat instead of a house beat. One of the earliest synthesizers to be employed in acid music was the Roland TB-303, which makes use of a resonant low-pass filter to emphasize the harmonics of the sound.\nAsian breakbeat.\nThe Asian breakbeat scene is a remix genre blending elements of freestyle, electro, progressive trance melodies, Florida breaks drums and Southern crunk rap. It was originated and made popular by predominantly Vietnamese American and Southeast Asian DJs throughout the U.S. South (Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina) during the 1990s and 2000s. Notable active DJs include New Orleans's DJ Babyboi, Tinman, and Loopy.\nBig beat.\nBig beat is a term employed since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe much of the music by artists such as the Prodigy, Cut La Roc, Fatboy Slim, the Chemical Brothers, the Crystal Method and Propellerheads typically driven by heavy breakbeats combined with four-on-the floor kick drums, synthesizer-generated loops and patterns in common with established forms of electronic dance music such as techno and acid house.\nElectro breaks.\nBreakbeat combined with electro music, often using 80s synths, robotic sounds, vocals with vocoders or talkboxes, and infused with elements of funk. Electro breaks was pioneered by Afrika Bambaataa &amp; the Soulsonic Force, Kraftwerk, Man Parrish, Cybotron, and Newcleus. \nAndalusian breakbeat.\nIn Spain from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, breakbeat became a massive social movement, especially in the southern part of the country, Andalusia.\nLargely responsible for the spread of the \"broken rhythm\" in Andalusia, was the public radio station of the autonomous community: Canal Sur Radio and Canal Fiesta, known at that time as F\u00f3rmula 1, where the program \"Mundo Evassion\" was broadcast, or \"Evassion Planet\" which was presented by Dani Moreno. Artists of that era included Digital Base, Dj Nitro, Jordi Slate, Man, Wally, Kultur, Jan B, Anuschka, and Ale Baquero. \nThe breakbeat of Andalusia has formed its own style, based on a simple structure of pre breaks + pre drop + drop. All this is repeated a second time with some variations in the song. With this structure, the tracks are mixed when one has passed the drop, until the pre drop of the next one arrives, respecting the melodies without breaks. \nAndalusian breakbeat has once again become a mass industry, with festivals almost exclusively dedicated to this genre, such as the Winter Festival, Summer Festival, Floridance, Retro Fest, and Olibass.\nProgressive breaks.\nProgressive breaks or prog breaks, also known as atmospheric breaks, is a subgenre of breaks that is essentially a fusion of breakbeat and progressive house. Much like progressive house, this subgenre is characterized by its \"trancey\" sound. Its defining traits include extended synthesizer pads and washes, melodic synth leads, heavy reverberation, and electronic breakbeats. However, unlike progressive house, very few progressive breaks tracks have vocals, with most tracks being entirely instrumental or using only electronically altered snippets of vocal samples for sonic effect. Typical progressive breaks tracks will often have a long build-up section that leads to a breakdown and a climax, often having numerous sonic elements being added or subtracted from the track at various intervals in order to increase its intensity. Progressive breaks artists include Hybrid, BT, Way Out West, Digital Witchcraft, Momu, Wrecked Angle, Fourthstate, Burufunk, Under This and Fretwell.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The 8008 architecture was designed by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) and was implemented and manufactured by Intel. While the 8008 was originally designed for use in CTC's Datapoint 2200 programmable terminal, an agreement between CTC and Intel permitted Intel to market the chip to other customers after Seiko expressed an interest in using it for a calculator.\nHistory.\nIn order to address several issues with the Datapoint 3300, including excessive heat radiation, Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) designed the architecture of the 3300's planned successor with a CPU as part of the internal circuitry re-implemented on a single chip. Looking for a company able to produce their chip design, CTC co-founder Austin O. \"Gus\" Roche turned to Intel, then primarily a vendor of memory chips. Roche met with Bob Noyce, who expressed concern with the concept; John Frassanito recalls that: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Another major concern was that Intel's existing customer base purchased their memory chips for use with their own processor designs; if Intel introduced their own processor, they might be seen as a competitor, and their customers might look elsewhere for memory. Nevertheless, Noyce agreed to a US$50,000 development contract in early 1970 (). Texas Instruments (TI) was also brought in as a second supplier.\nIn December 1969, Intel engineer Stan Mazor and a representative of CTC met to discuss options for the logic chipset to power a new CTC business terminal. Mazor, who had been working with Ted Hoff on the development of the Intel 4004, proposed that a one-chip programmable microprocessor might be less cumbersome and ultimately more cost effective than building a custom logic chipset. CTC agreed and development work began on the chip, which at the time was known as the 1201.\nTI was able to make samples of the 1201 based on Intel drawings, calling it the TMX 1795. These proved to be buggy and were rejected. Intel's own versions were delayed. CTC decided to re-implement the new version of the terminal using serial discrete TTL instead of waiting for a single-chip CPU. The new system was released as the Datapoint 2200 in the spring of 1970, with their first sale to General Mills on 25 May 1970. CTC paused development of the 1201 after the 2200 was released, as it was no longer needed. Later in early 1971, Seiko approached Intel, expressing an interest in using the 1201 in a scientific calculator, likely after seeing the success of the simpler 4004 used by Busicom in their business calculators. A small re-design followed, under the leadership of Federico Faggin, the designer of the 4004, now project leader of the 1201, expanding from a 16-pin to 18-pin design, and the new 1201 was delivered to CTC in late 1971.\nBy that point, CTC had once again moved on, this time to the parallel-architecture Datapoint 2200 II, which was faster than the 1201. CTC voted to end their involvement with the 1201, leaving the design's intellectual property to Intel instead of paying the $50,000 contract. Intel renamed it the 8008 and put it in their catalog in April 1972 priced at US$120 (). This renaming tried to ride off the success of the 4004 chip, by presenting the 8008 as simply a 4 to 8 port, but the 8008 is \"not\" based on the 4004. The 8008 went on to be a commercially successful design. This was followed by the popular Intel 8080, and then the hugely successful Intel x86 family. \nIn the UK, a team at S. E. Laboratories Engineering (EMI) led by Tom Spink in 1972 built a microcomputer based on a pre-release sample of the 8008. Joe Hardman extended the chip with an external stack. This, among other things, gave it power-fail save and recovery. Joe also developed a direct screen printer. The operating system was written using a meta-assembler developed by L. Crawford and J. Parnell for a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11. The operating system was burnt into a PROM. It was interrupt-driven, queued, and based on a fixed page size for programs and data.\nThe 8008 was the CPU for the very first commercial non-calculator personal computers (excluding the Datapoint 2200 itself): the US SCELBI kit and the pre-built French Micral N and Canadian MCM/70. It was also the controlling microprocessor for the first several models in Hewlett-Packard's 2640 family of computer terminals.\nIn 1973, Intel offered an instruction set simulator for the 8008 named INTERP/8. It was written in FORTRAN IV by Gary Kildall while he worked as a consultant for Intel.\nFeatures.\nThe 8008 architecture includes the following features:\nThe 8008 was provided in an 18-pin dual in-line package.\nDesign.\nThe 8008 was implemented in 10\u00a0\u03bcm silicon-gate enhancement-mode PMOS logic. Initial versions could work at clock frequencies up to 0.5\u00a0MHz. This was later increased in the 8008-1 to a specified maximum of 0.8\u00a0MHz. Instructions take between 3 and 11 T-states, where each T-state is 2 clock cycles.\nRegister\u2013register loads and ALU operations take 5T (20\u00a0\u03bcs at 0.5\u00a0MHz), register\u2013memory 8T (32\u00a0\u03bcs), while calls and jumps (when taken) take 11 T-states (44\u00a0\u03bcs).\nThe 8008 is a little slower in terms of instructions per second (36,000 to 80,000 at 0.8\u00a0MHz) than the 4-bit Intel 4004 and Intel 4040. but since the 8008 processes data 8 bits at a time and can access significantly more RAM, in most applications it has a significant speed advantage over these processors. The 8008 has 3,500 transistors.\nThe chip, limited by its 18-pin DIP, has a single 8-bit bus working triple duty to transfer 8 data bits, 14 address bits, and two status bits. The small package requires about 30 TTL support chips to interface to memory. For example, the 14-bit address, which can access \"16 K \u00d7 8 bits of memory\", needs to be latched by some of this logic into an external memory address register (MAR). The 8008 can access 8 input ports and 24 output ports.\nFor controller and CRT terminal use, this is an acceptable design, but it is rather cumbersome to use for most other tasks, at least compared to the next generations of microprocessors.\nRelated processor designs.\nThe subsequent 40-pin NMOS Intel 8080 expanded upon the 8008 registers and instruction set and implements a more efficient external bus interface (using the 22 additional pins). Despite a close architectural relationship, the 8080 was not made binary compatible with the 8008, so an 8008 program would not run on an 8080. However, as two different assembly syntaxes were used by Intel at the time, the 8080 could be used in an 8008 assembly-language backward-compatible fashion.\nThe Intel 8085 is an electrically modernized version of the 8080 that uses depletion-mode transistors and also added two new instructions.\nThe Intel 8086, the original x86 processor, is a non-strict extension of the 8080, so it loosely resembles the original Datapoint 2200 design as well. Almost every Datapoint 2200 and 8008 instruction has an equivalent not only in the instruction set of the 8080, 8085, and Z80, but also in the instruction set of modern x86 processors (although the instruction encodings are different).\nInstruction set.\nInstructions are one to three bytes long. The instruction format is an opcode byte, followed by up to two bytes of operands. Operands can be an address, a constant, a register, or the memory pointed to by the HL register pair, referenced as M. The 8008 has the JMP (jump) instruction which replaces the program counter with a new memory address. Additionally, the CAL (call) and RET (return) instructions provide seven levels of subroutine invocations. The RST (restart) instruction is a one byte shortcut to execute eight subroutines located in the first 64 instruction bytes. The subroutines are located at fixed addresses of 00h, 08h, 10h, ..., 38h. These are intended to be supplied to external hardware in order to invoke interrupt service routines, or they can be employed as fast calls. Direct copying may be made between any two registers or a register and memory. Eight math/logic functions are supported between the accumulator (A) and any register, memory, or immediate value. Results are always deposited to register A. Instructions operate on 8-bits only; there are no 16-bit operations. Increments and decrements are supported for most registers but, curiously, not A. Register A supports four rotate instructions.\nAll instructions execute in 3 to 11 states. Each state requires two clocks.\nCode example 1.\nThe following 8008 assembly source code is for a subroutine named codice_1 that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. Intel's 8008 assembler supported only + and - operators. This example borrows the 8080's assembler AND and SHR (shift right) operators to select the low and high bytes of a 14-bit address for placement into the 8 bit registers. A contemporaneous 8008 programmer was expected to calculate the numbers and type them in for the assembler.\nIn the code above, all values are given in octal. Locations , , and are 16-bit parameters for the subroutine named . In actuality, only 14 bits of the values are used, since the CPU has only a 14-bit addressable memory space. The values are stored in little-endian format, although this is an arbitrary choice, since the CPU is incapable of reading or writing more than a single byte into memory at a time. Since there is no instruction to load a register directly from a given memory address, the HL register pair must first be loaded with the address, and the target register can then be loaded from the M operand, which is an indirect load from the memory location in the HL register pair. The BC register pair is loaded with the parameter value and decremented at the end of the loop until it becomes zero. Note that most of the instructions used occupy a single 8-bit opcode.\nCode example 2.\nThe following 8008 assembly source code is for a simplified subroutine named MEMCPY2 that copies a block of data bytes from one location to another. By reducing the byte counter to 8 bits, there is enough room to load all the subroutine parameters into the 8008's register file.\nInterrupts.\nInterrupts on the 8008 are only partially implemented. After the INT line is asserted, the 8008 acknowledges the interrupt by outputting a state code of S0,S1,S2 = 011 at T1I time. At the subsequent instruction fetch cycle, an instruction is \"jammed\" (Intel's word) by external hardware on the bus. Typically this is a one-byte RST instruction.\nAt this point, there is a problem. The 8008 has no provision to save its architectural state. The 8008 can only write to memory via an address in the HL register pair. When interrupted, there is no mechanism to save HL so there is no way to save the other registers and flags via HL. Because of this, some sort of external memory device such as a hardware stack or a pair of read/write registers must be attached to the 8008 via the I/O ports to help save the state of the 8008.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Roosevelt on June 19, 1934, and codified as Chapter 5 of Title 47 of the United States Code, \u00a0https:// et seq. The act replaced the Federal Radio Commission with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It also transferred regulation of interstate telephone services from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the FCC.\nThe first section of the act originally read as follows: \"For the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available, so far as possible to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges, for the purpose of the national defense, for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communication, and for the purpose of securing a more effective execution of this policy by centralizing authority heretofore granted by law to several agencies and by granting additional authority with respect to interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication, there is hereby created a commission to be known as the \"Federal Communications Commission,\" which shall be constituted as hereinafter provided, and which shall execute and enforce the provisions of this Act.\"; although it has since been amended.\nOn January 3, 1996, the 104th\u00a0Congress of the United States amended or repealed sections of the Communications Act of 1934 with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. It was the first major overhaul of American telecommunications policy in nearly 62\u00a0years.\nHistory.\nThe Communications Act of 1934 largely combined and reorganized existing provisions of law, including provisions of the Federal Radio Act of 1927 relating to radio licensing, and of the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 relating to telephone service.\nIn 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, to appoint an interdepartmental committee for studying electronic communications. The Committee reported that \"the communications service, as far as congressional action is involved, should be regulated by a single body\". A recommendation was made for the establishment of a new agency that would regulate all interstate and foreign communication by wire and radio, telegraphy, telephone and broadcast.\nOn February 26, 1934, the President sent a special message to Congress urging the creation of the Federal Communications Commission\u00a0(FCC). The following day Senator Clarence Dill and Representative Sam Rayburn introduced bills to carry out this recommendation. The Senate Bill (S.3285) passed the House on June 1, 1934, and the conference report was adopted by both houses eight days later. The Communications Act was signed by President Roosevelt in June 1934. Particular parts of it became effective July 1, 1934; the remaining parts on July 11, 1934.\nThe Communications Act of 1934 followed the precedents of trial cases set under the Commerce Clause of the U.S.\u00a0Constitution (Article\u00a0I, Section\u00a08, Clause\u00a03), regulating commerce \"among the several states\". Twenty years earlier, in 1914, the U.S.\u00a0Supreme Court had set limits on price discrimination that were effectively interstate commerce in \"Houston, East &amp; West Texas Railway\u00a0Co. v. United States\". The railway was setting lower prices for intrastate carriers within Texas while charging more for carriers that were going through or out of the state. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the ICC, and maximum prices were set to limit the damage that other states could face due to price discrimination.\nCommunications technology was determined to be an interstate good. President Franklin Roosevelt, along with lobbyists and state regulators, wanted communications technology, both wired and wireless, to be monitored in a similar way and influenced Congress to pass the Communications Act of 1934. The goal was to have telephone and broadcasting regulated with the same jurisdiction in a way similar to that in which the ICC regulates the railways and interstate commerce. The act did not, however, allow for price regulation through the FCC due to strong lobbying efforts from the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC).\nCurrently there are some challenges and proposed changes to the act. The company CellAntenna unsuccessfully sued the FCC, claiming the Homeland Security Act of 2002 did override the Communications Act of 1934.\nThe 1934 Communications Act prohibits local and state law enforcement from using jamming devices to thwart criminal and terrorist acts. CellAntenna lost its case, but as a response have supported legislation (The Safe Prisons Communications Act) sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Kevin Brady, attempting to amend the Communications Act of 1934. The bill was left in committee in the House.\nThere has been public debate about the need for an Internet kill switch, defined in a proposed Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act. This act removes the powers established in the 1934 Act and gives the President the authority to stop the Internet in case of a cyber attack.\nThe act forbids foreign individuals, governments, and corporations owning more than 20% of the capital stock of a broadcast, common carrier, or radio station. In 2013 the FCC relaxed these rules.\nStructure.\nThe Communications Act of 1934, as of 2021[ [update]], consists of seven major sections or \"subchapters\", as expressed in the US Code, Title 47 (Communications), Chapter 5 \u2014 Wire or Radio Communication:\nLegacy.\nThe act established a legal basis for regulating wired and wireless communications on a nationwide and worldwide basis. The Federal Communications Commission was founded because of the act; it replaced the Federal Radio Commission. Because of the act, the U.S.\u00a0government could regulate new media technologies such as television and mobile phones.\nMoreover, the act permitted the regulation of commercial communication corporations such as private radio and television companies. Opponents in Congress argued that the act harmed the telecommunications industry, such as by delaying the development of new technologies. In 1982, Congress produced a report recommending changes called \"Proposals for Revision of the Communications Act of 1934: Telecommunications Issues\".\nCreation of the Federal Communications Commission.\nThe Commerce Clause in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate foreign and interstate commerce. By the early 20th century, radio transmission had become the most efficient way to facilitate communication about commerce and therefore, radio frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum could constitutionally be regulated. The Wireless Ship Act of 1910 called for Congress to modestly regulate the wireless industry and the Radio Act of 1912 was their first attempt to make more legislative oversight to the entire radio industry.\nThis act required anyone who wanted to transmit over the radio to have government issued permission in form of a license. Along with the help of important legislators, these were the early building blocks that eventually evolved into the FCC.\nSecretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover played a large role regarding regulation because he issued the licenses which allocated the spectrum. Once radio broadcasting became popular, Hoover brought attention to the limited amount of frequency space the spectrum held. This problem made obtaining frequencies and airtime very difficult, as well as making \"noise\" on existing frequencies. Between 1923 and 1924, Hoover expanded the number of assigned frequencies to reduce the interference, but his quick fix failed, which, in turn, ended self-regulation of spectrum space. Congress then passed the Radio Act of 1927 to create the framework for regulating the rapidly-growing broadcast industry.\nPresident Calvin Coolidge was an important aspect of radio regulation by signing the Radio Act of 1927, which invested regulatory power to the Federal Radio Commission (FRC). Senators Clarence Dill and Wallace H. White,\u00a0Jr. also pushed toward passing the 1927 act. The FRC had a short, 6-year term in American history and transferred its responsibility, as the agency for managing the radio spectrum, to the FCC after the Communications Act of 1934. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the bill in 1934. This change in power was needed to develop a better way of determining who got to use what radio bands and for what purposes. There were many factors and individuals that played a role in the creation of the FCC, but in the end, Congress created the agency.\nWiretapping.\nIn section 605 of the act, the FCC was empowered by Congress to enforce wiretapping compliance. Academic Colin Agur argues that the Communications Act of 1934 \"filled a legal void\" by creating a process through which telephone carrier companies could record and report illegal wiretapping requests and the FCC could punish law enforcement officials who abused wiretapping surveillance.\nTransition from the Federal Radio Commission.\nThe FCC took over regulation in 1934 and changed many of the structural characteristics of the original agency, although its goal of reducing interference remained the same. The original FRC had 5 members who were each responsible for representing one geographical area of the United States. Congress also planned for the 5-member agency to become a quasi-judicial body which would only have to meet when necessary. Their jobs were to alleviate \"noise\" from the airwaves and they were given the power to license and regulate radio stations. The Federal Radio Commission's lack of regulatory action lead to the more permanent Federal Communications Commission. Much like the FRC, the FCC consists of commissioners who are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. Each Commissioner can only serve for a five-year term, even the one chosen to be the chairperson. Originally there were 7 commissioners with 7 year terms, but this was changed to 5 commissions with 5 year terms in 1986. Though there are only five commissioners, there are several offices and departments, made up of hundreds and staff members that carry out different duties. For example, the Mass Media Bureau processes license applications and renewals. These divisions of administrative duties differentiate the FRC from the FCC.\nChanges and amendments.\n1960s quiz show amendments.\nAmendments made to the Act in 1960, passed in the wake of the 1950s quiz show scandals, prohibited the presentation of scripted game shows under the guise of a legitimate contest.\nTelecommunications Act of 1996.\nThe Telecommunication Act 1996 contained two major changes from the original Communications Act of 1934: the new act was less technologically biased and offered less regulation.\nThis act determined the basis of media regulation by its contents, not a technological standard. Title V in Telecommunication Act of 1996, \"Obscenity and Violence\", is a good example of this; Title V set the standard for regulating media contents.\nThe Communications Act of 1934 is argued by some to have created monopolies, such as the case of AT&amp;T. The FCC recognized AT&amp;T as a \"natural monopoly\" during the 1930s in the Communications Act of 1934. Because of these effects, the FCC designed the Communications Act 1996 \"to provide for a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced information technologies and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition...\" The Telecommunication Act of 1996 also added and changed some rules to account for the emerging internet.\nThe FCC derives its jurisdiction to facilitate the deployment of broadband to Americans in Section 706 in the Telecommunications act of 1996. In this section the code states that the FCC is to \"encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans.\"\nThey currently want to advocate the following objectives:\n1984 &amp; 1992 Amendments.\nOne major amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 was made on September 7, 1999. The FCC ruled \"that a broadcast station should not be allowed to refuse a request for political advertising time solely on the ground that the station does not sell or program such lengths of time\". Politics have had many effects and changes to the act that are not in the \"best interest of the public\" thus taking away some of the power given to the FCC from the Act.\nProposed amendments.\nThe Federal Communications Commission Consolidated Reporting Act of 2013 (H.R. 2844; 113th Congress) would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to publish on its website and submit to Congress a biennial report on the state of the communications marketplace. That report would include an analysis of \"the state of competition in the markets for voice, video, and data services, as well as the availability of high-speed and high-quality telecommunications services\" in the United States. It would also \"require the FCC to determine whether laws and regulations pose a barrier to entry into communications markets and to include that information in the biennial report\" and cancel a number of preexisting requirements for various other reports from the FCC.\nControversies.\n1934: Commercial radio debate.\nBefore the Communications Act of 1934 was enacted as law by the U.S.\u00a0Congress, there was a debate over commercial versus non-commercial broadcasting: Senators Robert Wagner of New York and Henry Hatfield of West Virginia offered an amendment to the then proposed Communications Act. Educators wanted more of radio to be given to them; they had been termed a \"special interest\" by the Federal Radio Commission and their stations were forced to share frequencies.\nThe Wagner-Hatfield amendment would have given 25% of all radio broadcasting facilities to non-profit institutions and organizations. It would also have allowed these educational stations to sell advertising in order to become self-sufficient.\nSenator Clarence Dill, a pro-industry spokesman, opposed this amendment. It would have meant eliminating numerous commercial stations, but that is not what Senator Dill publicly complained about. He expressed horror over the advertising. He said there was too much advertising already. Not all educators supported the advertising clause, so a compromise was struck.\nThe issue was to be given to the new FCC to study and to hold hearings on and to report back to Congress. Hatfield and Wagner stuck to their guns, however, and proposed their amendment anyway. The Hatfield-Wagner amendment died and the Communications Act was passed.\nThe Federal Communications Commission reported back, saying that commercial stations had ample time for educational and other public service programs. The Commission called for cooperation between commercial and educational interests and other non-profit groups. The educators lost, although commercial broadcasters were forced to air public affairs programs.\n1943: Chain (network) case.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held in \"National Broadcasting Co. v. United States\", 319\u00a0U.S.\u00a0190 on May 10, 1943, that the FCC had the right to issue regulations pertaining to associations between broadcasting networks and their affiliated stations. The opinion of the Supreme Court was not unanimous and it led to a conflict with an earlier decision in \"Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station\", 309\u00a0U.S.\u00a0470, on March 25, 1940.\nIn that case the FCC interpreted Supreme Court decisions concerning broadcasting to mean that potential economic injury to an existing licensee was not grounds for refusing to license a competitor. (This FCC interpretation remained in place from 1940 to 1958.)\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court was delivered by Felix Frankfurter. Justices Hugo Black and Wiley Blount Rutledge took no part in the discussion or decision. Justice Frank Murphy offered a dissenting opinion, stating that the Court was effectively giving the FCC a power to regulate networks which had not been given to the FCC by Congress. Murphy stated that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;we exceed our competence when we gratuitously bestow upon an agency power which the Congress has not granted. Since that is what the Court in substance does today, I dissent.\nBecause the majority of the Court did not agree with Murphy, it effectively gave the FCC power to regulate the networks. As a result of this 1943 decision, NBC was forced to sell one of its two networks\u2014the Blue Network\u2014and it was this action which then led to the creation of the American Broadcasting Company.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66044", "revid": "51059816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66044", "title": "ITT Inc.", "text": "American worldwide manufacturing company owner De RosaCesare\nITT Inc., formerly ITT Corporation, is an American worldwide manufacturing company based in Stamford, Connecticut. The company produces specialty components for the aerospace, transportation, energy, and industrial markets. ITT's three business units are Industrial Process, Motion Technologies, and Connect and Control Technologies. \nITT has over 10,000 employees in more than 35 countries and serves customers in more than 100 countries. The company's long-standing brands include Goulds Pumps, Cannon connectors, KONI shock absorbers, and Enidine energy absorption components.\nThe company was founded in 1920 as International Telephone &amp; Telegraph. During the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of CEO Harold Geneen, the company rose to prominence as the archetypal conglomerate, deriving its growth from hundreds of acquisitions in diversified industries.\nITT divested its telecommunications assets in 1986. In 1995, the company sold off its hospitality portfolio, including Sheraton Hotels and Resorts. In 1996, the current company was founded as a spinoff of ITT as ITT Industries, Inc. It later changed its name to ITT Corporation in 2006.\nIn 2011, ITT spun off its defense businesses into a company named Exelis (now part of L3Harris Technologies), and its water technology business into a company named Xylem Inc. ITT Corporation changed its name to ITT Inc. in 2016.\nHistory.\nBeginnings and early acquisitions.\nBrothers Hernan Behn and Colonel Sosthenes Behn formed International Telephone &amp; Telegraph (ITT) in 1920. The brothers had acquired the Puerto Rico Telephone Company in 1914, along with the Cuban-American Telephone and Telegraph Company and a half-interest in the Cuban Telephone Company. ITT's first major expansion came in 1923, when it consolidated operators in the telecoms market in Spain into what eventually became Telef\u00f3nica. From 1922 to 1925, ITT purchased a number of European telephone companies.\nIn 1925, ITT purchased several companies from Western Electric, as Bell had agreed to \"divest\" itself of its international operations. They included the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company (BTM) of Antwerp, Belgium, which manufactured rotary system switching equipment, and the British \"International Western Electric\", which was renamed Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Electricit\u00e9 later purchased BTM; Nortel later purchased STC.\nIn the 1930s, ITT purchased German electronic companies Standard Elektrizit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft (SEG) and Mix &amp; Genest (both of which were internationally active companies) and Romanian telecommunications monopoly Societatea Anonima Rom\u00e2n\u0103 de Telefoane. Its only serious rival was the Theodore Gary &amp; Company conglomerate, which operated a subsidiary, Associated Telephone and Telegraph, with manufacturing plants in Europe.\nIn the United States, ITT acquired the various companies of the Mackay Companies in 1928 through a specially organized subsidiary corporation, Postal Telegraph &amp; Cable. These companies included the Commercial Cable Company, the Commercial Pacific Cable Company, Postal Telegraph, and the Federal Telegraph Company.\nGerman subsidiaries in the Nazi period.\nOn August 3, 1933, Adolf Hitler received Sosthenes Behn (then the CEO of &lt;includeonly&gt;ITT&lt;/includeonly&gt;) and his German representative, Henry Mann, in one of his first meetings with US businesspeople.\nIn his book \"Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler\", Antony C. Sutton claims that ITT subsidiaries made cash payments to SS leader Heinrich Himmler. ITT, through its subsidiary C. Lorenz AG, owned 25% of Focke-Wulf, the German aircraft manufacturer and builder of some of the most successful Luftwaffe fighter aircraft. In the 1960s, ITT Corporation won $27 million in compensation for damage inflicted on its share of the Focke-Wulf plant by Allied bombing during World War II. In addition, Sutton's book uncovers that ITT owned shares of \"Signalbau AG, Dr. Erich F. Huth\" (Signalbau Huth), which produced for the German Wehrmacht radar equipment and transceivers in Berlin, Hanover (later the Telefunken factory), and other places. While ITT-Focke-Wulf planes were bombing Allied ships and ITT lines were passing information to German submarines, ITT direction-finders were saving other ships from torpedoes. The payments to Himmler were noted in a 1946 banking investigation report by the Office of Military Government, United States.\nIn 1943, ITT became the largest shareholder of Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH with 29% and remained so for the duration of the war. This was due to Kaffee HAG's share falling to 27% after the death in May of Kaffee HAG chief Dr. Ludwig Roselius. OMGUS documents reveal that the role of the HAG conglomerate could not be determined during WWII.\nPost-war acquisitions.\nIn 1951, ITT purchased Philo Farnsworth's television company to break into that market. At the time, Farnsworth was also developing the Fusor fusion reactor, which was funded by ITT until 1967. Also in 1951, ITT bought a majority interest in the Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Company (founded in 1897 as a pioneer in \"divided-multiple\" telephone switchboards) and bought the remaining shares the next year. ITT changed the company's name to ITT Kellogg. After merging Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation into ITT Kellogg and combining manufacturing operations, the name again changed to ITT Telecommunications, eventually reverting to ITT Kellogg.\nOne prominent subsidiary of this firm was the American Cable and Radio Corporation, which operated the transatlantic cables of the Commercial Cable Company, among other ventures. It bought Philadelphia-based heating and air-conditioning manufacturer John J. Nesbitt Inc. In 1968, the company purchased Levittown homebuilder Levitt &amp; Sons for a reported $90 million.\nIn 1972 the KONI Group, manufacturer of shock absorbers, was added to the list of ITT's acquisitions.\nInternational telecommunications.\nInternational telecommunications manufacturing subsidiaries included Standard Telephones and Cables in the United Kingdom and Australia, Indosat in Indonesia, Standard Elektrik Lorenz (today part of Nokia Germany) and \"Intermetall Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Metallurgie und Elektronik mbH\" (acquired from Clevite in 1965; now TDK-Micronas) in Germany, BTM in Belgium, and CGCT and LMT in France. These companies manufactured equipment according to ITT designs, including the (1960s) Pentaconta crossbar switch and (1970s) Metaconta D, L, and 10c Stored Program Control exchanges, mostly for sale to their respective national telephone administrations. This equipment was also produced under license in Pozna\u0144 (Poland) and in Yugoslavia and elsewhere. ITT was the largest owner of the LM Ericsson company in Sweden but sold out in 1960.\nAlec Reeves, an ITT employee in France in the 1930s, developed pulse-code modulation (PCM) innovations, upon which future digital voice communication was based. Charles K. Kao, working at STC in the UK, pioneered the use of optical fiber from 1966, for which he was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nHarold Geneen's appointment.\nIn 1959, Harold Geneen became CEO. Using leveraged buyouts, he turned the minor acquisitions of the 1950s into major growth during the 1960s. In 1965, ITT attempted to purchase the ABC television network for $700 million. The deal was halted by federal antitrust regulators who feared ITT was growing too large. ITT moved to acquire companies outside the telecommunications industry to continue its growth without violating antitrust legislation. Under Geneen's leadership, ITT acquired over 300 companies in the 1960s, with some of these acquisitions being hostile takeovers. The deals included well-known businesses like the Sheraton hotel chain, Wonder Bread maker Continental Baking, Rayonier, and Avis Rent-a-Car. ITT also absorbed smaller operations in auto parts, energy, books, semiconductors, and cosmetics. In 1966, ITT acquired Educational Services, Inc., an operator of for-profit schools, which became ITT/ESI. When ITT attempted to acquire The Hartford insurance company in 1970, the US Justice Department filed suit, and ITT agreed to divest assets equal to those of Hartford's, including Avis.\nITT's sales grew from about $700 million in 1960 to about $8 billion in 1970, and its profit from $29 million to $550 million. However, when increased interest rates started eating away at profits in the late 1960s, ITT's growth slowed considerably.\nIn the late 1960s, the British electronics manufacturer Kolster-Brandes Limited, KB for short, had run into trouble with its color television manufacturing and turned to ITT for help; ITT bought out the company, and for a while, UK products were badged \"ITT KB\" then eventually just ITT. By the late 1970s, ITT had a substantial presence on the UK domestic electrical market in television, audio, and portable radio products.\nBrazilian expropriation in 1962.\nIn February 1962, during the presidency of Jo\u00e3o Goulart, the State Governor of Rio Grande do Sul, Leonel Brizola, decided to expropriate a Brazilian subsidiary of ITT, the Companhia Telef\u00f4nica Nacional. During the following years of Goulart's presidency, the expropriation was one of the most debated Brazilian political issues. The action from the state governor to expropriate the company was never supported by the Brazilian president at the time and had severe implications for Brazil\u2013United States relations. Some historians even say that the expropriation was one of the reasons for the federal government of the United States supporting the 1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat.\n1972 Republican National Convention.\nITT became involved in a scandal related to the 1972 Republican National Convention. In May 1971, ITT president Geneen pledged $400,000 to support a proposal to hold the convention in San Diego; only $100,000 of the contribution was publicly disclosed. The Republican National Committee selected San Diego as the site in July 1971.\nHowever, on February 29, 1972, newspaper columnist Jack Anderson disclosed an interoffice memo from ITT lobbyist Dita Beard to ITT vice president Bill Merriam, dated June 25, 1971. The memo appeared to draw a connection between ITT's contribution to the convention and the favorable settlement of a United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division lawsuit. The resulting scandal, including a Senate investigation and the threat of criminal charges, caused ITT to withdraw its support for the San Diego convention. That, combined with a shortage of hotel space and problems with the proposed venue, led the RNC to move the convention to Miami. Special prosecutor Leon Jaworski investigated the case but ultimately concluded there was no evidence of criminal conduct by ITT.\nNixon aides such as John Dean and Jeb Stuart Magruder have alleged that the Watergate break-in was motivated by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President's suspicion that the Democratic National Committee was making similar deals to fund its 1972 convention. This theory is supported by conversations and exchanges between President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff H. R. Haldeman before and after the break-in, as well as by testimony by E. Howard Hunt. However, this theory has also been disputed by others involved in the break-in, such as G. Gordon Liddy.\nInvolvement in 1973 Pinochet coup in Chile.\nIn 1970, ITT owned 70% of CTC (the Chilean Telephone Company, now Movistar Chile) and funded \"El Mercurio\", a Chilean right-wing newspaper. ITT also had some $200\u00a0million worth of investments in Chile. Under Geneen's leadership, ITT funneled $350,000 to Allende's opponent, Jorge Alessandri. When Allende won the presidential election, ITT offered the CIA $1,000,000 to defeat Allende, though the offer was rejected. Declassified documents released by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in 2000 reveal that the company financially helped opponents of Salvador Allende's government prepare a military coup. On September 28, 1973, an ITT building in New York City was bombed by the Weather Underground for involvement in the coup d'\u00e9tat.\nPost-Geneen: Hamilton and Araskog.\nIn March 1977, Lyman C. Hamilton was appointed CEO, and Geneen became chairman of the board. In June 1979, while Hamilton was in Asia, Geneen became aware of Hamilton's plans to divest ITT's European consumer goods business and lobbied his fellow board members to dismiss him. In July 1979, Rand Araskog became CEO. Shortly thereafter, Araskog insisted that the board remove Geneen as chairman, though Geneen remained on the board for four more years.\nAraskog over the next two decades dismantled much of ITT, selling most of its holdings.\nStarting in 1977, ITT set out to develop an ambitious new Digital Telephone Exchange, System 1240 (later System 12), which reportedly cost US$1 billion. According to \"Fortune\"'s Myron Magnet in 1985, Araskog directed the company's efforts towards a relentless pursuit of developing and promoting System 12, while channeling profits from successful ventures into fulfilling System 12's voracious demands. System 12 was intended to operate in all markets and in all modes, from local switches to long distance. The design was done at the Advanced Technology Center (Stamford, Connecticut, and then Shelton, Connecticut). Manufacturing was by ITT's subsidiaries, such as BTM in Belgium, where the first production system was installed at Brecht in August 1982. Initial sales, particularly in Europe and Mexico, were strong, but the new system took longer than expected to integrate, with further losses. Against the advice of headquarters, ITT Telecommunications (ITT Kellogg) in Raleigh, North Carolina, undertook the conversion in the US market, and although sales were announced in 1984 and 1985, the attempt ultimately failed in early 1986.\nITT divested its global telecommunications product ventures, such as ITT Kellogg, to Alcatel Alsthom, a subsidiary of Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Electricit\u00e9 (CGE), resulting in the establishment of Alcatel N.V. (Netherlands) in 1986. This transaction positioned Alcatel N.V. as the world's second-largest telecommunications company at that time. Initially, ITT retained a 37% ownership stake, but in March 1992, it proceeded to sell off its remaining 30%, effectively ceasing its participation in the telephone industry. In 2006, Alcatel Alsthom S.A. merged with Lucent to form Alcatel-Lucent.\nITT Educational Services, Inc. (ESI) was spun off through an IPO in 1994, with ITT as an 83% shareholder (in September 2016, ESI announced plans to close all of its 130 technical institutes in 38 states because their students were no longer eligible for federal aid). ITT merged its long-distance division with Metromedia Long Distance in March 1989, creating \"Metromedia-ITT\". Long Distance Discount Services, Inc. (LDDS) eventually acquired Metromedia-ITT in 1993. Subsequently, LDDS would rename itself WorldCom in 1995.\n1995 breakup.\nIn 1995, with Araskog still at the helm, ITT split into three separate public companies:\nCriminal prosecution.\nIn March 2007, ITT Corporation became the first major defense contractor to be convicted for criminal violations of the U.S. Arms Export Control Act. The fines resulted from ITT's outsourcing program, in which they transferred night vision goggles and classified information about countermeasures against laser weapons, including light interference filters, to engineers in Singapore, the People's Republic of China, and the United Kingdom. They were fined US$100 million although they were also given the option of spending half of that sum on research and development of new night vision technology. The United States government will assume rights to the resulting intellectual property.\nIn its investigation and subsequent ruling, the United States Department of Justice found that the corporation went to significant lengths to circumvent rules regarding the exports, including setting up a front company. According to U.S. Attorney John L. Brownlee, the company fought the investigation in order \"to essentially run out the clock on the statute of limitations.\"\nFurther corporate acquisitions.\nOn June 26, 2007, ITT reached an agreement to acquire the privately held \"International Motion Control\" (IMC) for $395 million. The transaction was finalized in September 2007. Subsequently, on September 14, 2010, an announcement was made to close the Cleveland site.\nAn agreement was reached on September 18, 2007, for ITT to buy EDO Corporation for $1.7 billion. After EDO shareholders' approval, the deal was closed and finalized on December 20, 2007.\nOn April 16, 2009, ITT announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Laing GmbH of Germany, a privately held leading producer of energy-efficient circulator pumps primarily used in residential and commercial plumbing and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.\n2011 breakup.\nOn January 12, 2011, ITT announced a transformation to separate the remaining company into three publicly traded independent companies. On July 14, 2011, ITT announced the names of the three companies: \nThen-ITT stockholders subsequently owned shares in all three companies following the spinoff.\nHeadquarters.\nIn 1929, ITT's headquarters were at (75) 67 Broad Street, Manhattan, New York, New York. \"During World War II the building was a hub for communications with American submarines operating in the Atlantic Ocean.\"\nFrom 1961 to 1989, ITT's headquarters were at 320 Park Ave., New York.\n1330 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, which was ITT's corporate headquarters prior to its merger with Starwood, was originally owned by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), which ITT attempted to acquire in 1963. After a financial downturn, ABC moved out of the building known as \"Brown Rock\" and sold it to a Japanese conglomerate, which then in turn leased a beneficial portion out to ITT Corporation.\nIn 2022, ITT's global headquarters moved out of White Plains, NY, and into Harbor Point in Stamford, CT.\nITT Avionics.\nITT Avionics was a division of ITT Corporation in Nutley, New Jersey. A 300-foot research tower at ITT Avionics just off Washington Ave. (Nutley, New Jersey) was built in 1947 for scientists to research microwave communication systems. Research at the tower had stopped in the 1970s. On the morning of April 4, 1996, at 10:00 am, the tower was demolished with explosives to prepare the site for sale.\nIn October 1989, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded a contract to ITT Avionics for production of an Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ), and a similar contract was issued to Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Westinghouse and ITT had worked together with the U.S. government to develop the ASPJ. The contract was later terminated by the government for convenience because the ASPJ failed independent operational test and evaluation (OPEVAL) procedures.\nIn 1991, the company won a $19.6 million contract from the United States Air Force to develop the \"intraflight data link,\" a communications system for \"tactical airborne forces\". In 2004, they were awarded a $24.9 million contract from the Naval Air Systems Command Weapons Division for engineering software support services provided to the Tactical Aircraft Electronic Warfare Integrated Program Team at Point Mugu, California and China Lake, California.\nConsumer electronics.\nThrough their then subsidiary Schaub Elektrik Lorenz, ITT manufactured consumer products under the ITT Schaub-Lorenz brand, such as Touring radio receivers and Ideal Color television sets employing Heliochrom picture tubes.\nSome television models feature the Ideal-Computer cartridge system, featuring a slot suitable for housing an ultrasonic remote control (acting as front panel buttons while docked), a teletext decoder, or Tele-Match video game dedicated consoles (unrelated to the \"ITT Telematch Processor\" console, a rebrand of the Fairchild Channel F); the Ideal-Computer system was licensed to other German producers of its time.\nITT Schaub-Lorenz was also behind the Digivision, the first television employing digital signal processing of the image.\nFor a comparable time span, ITT had also controlled and then fully absorbed English radio and television manufacturer Kolster-Brandes.\nIn 1986, throughout the following year, the ITT Telecommunications division (which included Schaub-Lorenz and Kolster-Brandes) was transferred to Alcatel through the French CGE, then in 1988, the consumer electronics division was further spun off and sold to Nokia, who sold some products under the ITT Nokia brand.\nNokia closed their German TV factories in 1996, although their use of the ITT brand may have been discontinued earlier.\nSince 2006, the ITT brand and logo have been licensed to the Karcher corporation, which is not part of the ITT group.\nCustomers and programs.\nFederal Aviation Administration NextGen.\nIn 2007, ITT was awarded a $207 million initial contract by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to lead a team to develop and deploy the Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Broadcast (ADS-B) system. ADS-B is a key component of the FAA's NextGen air traffic control modernization program intended to increase safety and efficiency to meet the growing needs of air transportation. ITT is responsible for overall system integration and engineering and under contract options will operate and maintain the system after deployment through September 2025. The ITT team includes its partners AT&amp;T, Thales North America, WSI, SAIC, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Aerospace Engineering, Sunhillo, Comsearch, MCS of Tampa, Pragmatics, Washington Consulting Group, Aviation Communications and Surveillance Systems (ACSS), Sandia Aerospace, and NCR Corporation.\nGeoEye-1.\nOn September 6, 2008, the ITT-built imaging payload was launched aboard the GeoEye-1 satellite to provide high-resolution earth imaging. The satellite has the ability to collect images at 0.41-meter panchromatic (black and white) and 1.65-meter multispectral (color) resolution. GeoEye-1 can precisely locate an object to within three meters of its true location on the Earth's surface. The satellite will also be able to collect up to 700,000 square kilometers of panchromatic imagery per day.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The genre often mocks or satirizes standard science fiction conventions, concepts and tropes \u2013 such as alien invasion of Earth, interstellar travel, or futuristic technology. It can also satirize and criticize present-day society.\nAn early example was the \"Pete Manx\" series by Henry Kuttner and Arthur K. Barnes (sometimes writing together and sometimes separately, under the house pen-name of Kelvin Kent). Published in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the series featured a time-traveling carnival barker who uses his con-man abilities to get out of trouble. Two later series cemented Kuttner's reputation as one of the most popular early writers of comic science fiction: the \"Gallegher\" series (about a drunken inventor and his narcissistic robot) and the \"Hogben\" series (about a family of mutant hillbillies). The former appeared in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" in 1943 and 1948 and was collected in hardcover as \"Robots Have No Tails\" (Gnome, 1952), and the latter appeared in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" in the late 1940s. \nIn the 1950s of the authors contributing to the sub-genre included: Alfred Bester, Harry Harrison, C. M. Kornbluth, Frederik Pohl, and Robert Sheckley.\n\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" is a science fiction comedy series written by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, it later morphed into other formats, including stage shows, novels, comic books, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 computer game, and 2005 feature film. A prominent series in British popular culture, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" has become an international multi-media phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005.\nTerry Pratchett's 1981 novel \"Strata\" also exemplifies the science fiction comedy genre.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Highly regarded as a military strategist, Gi\u00e1p led Vietnamese communist military forces to victory in the decades long Indochina wars. Gi\u00e1p was the military commander of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh and the People's Army from 1941 to 1972, minister of defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1946\u20131947 and from 1948 to 1980, and deputy prime minister from 1955 to 1991. He was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam.\nBorn in Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh province to an affluent peasant family, Gi\u00e1p began participating in anti-colonial political activity in 1925. Sources conflict as to whether he joined the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, or not until 1940. Gi\u00e1p rose to prominence during World War II as the military leader of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh resistance against the Japanese occupation, and after the war led anti-colonial forces in the First Indochina War against the French. He won a decisive victory at the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which ended the war. In the Vietnam War, Gi\u00e1p led the PAVN against South Vietnam and the United States. Gi\u00e1p was commander of the army during the 1968 Tet Offensive and 1972 Easter Offensive, after which he was succeeded by V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng, but remained defense minister through the U.S. withdrawal and final victory against South Vietnam in 1975. Gi\u00e1p oversaw his final campaigns in the successful Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978 and the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War. He resigned as defense minister in 1980 and left the Politburo in 1982. Gi\u00e1p remained on the Central Committee and as deputy prime minister until 1991, and died in 2013 at age 102.\nGi\u00e1p is regarded as a great military leader. During the First Indochina War, he transformed a disorganized band of rebels to a \"fine light-infantry army\" fielding cryptography, artillery and advanced logistics capable of challenging the larger, modernised French Far East Expeditionary Corps and Vietnamese National Army. Gi\u00e1p, who in the 1930s had studied law and worked as a history teacher, had never received any military training prior to World War II. A highly-effective logistician, he was the principal architect of the Ho Chi Minh trail, the logistical network from North to South Vietnam, through the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, which is recognised as one of the 20th century's great feats of military engineering. \nGi\u00e1p is often credited with North Vietnam's military victory over the United States and South Vietnam. Recent scholarship cites other leaders as more prominent, with former subordinates and later rivals D\u0169ng and Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u00e1i later having a more direct military responsibility. Nevertheless, he was crucial to the transformation of the PAVN into \"one of the largest, most formidable\" mechanised and combined-arms fighting force capable of defeating the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in conventional warfare.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nV\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p was born on 25 August 1911 (or 1912 according to some sources) in Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh province, Annam, French Indochina. Gi\u00e1p's father and mother, V\u00f5 Quang Nghi\u00eam and Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ki\u00ean, worked the land, rented some to neighbours, and lived a relatively comfortable life.\nGi\u00e1p's father was both a minor official and a committed Vietnamese nationalist, having participated in the C\u1ea7n V\u01b0\u01a1ng movement in the 1880s. He was arrested for subversive activities by the French colonial authorities in 1919 and died in prison a few weeks later. Gi\u00e1p had two sisters and one brother, and soon after his father's incarceration, one of his sisters was also arrested. Although she was not held for long, the privations of prison life made her ill and she too died a few weeks after being released.\nGi\u00e1p was taught at home by his father before going to the village school. His precocious intelligence meant that he was soon transferred to the district school and in 1924, at the age of thirteen, he left home to attend the Qu\u1ed1c H\u1ecdc (also known in English as the \"National Academy\"), a French-run \"lyc\u00e9e\" in Hu\u1ebf, where he studied arithmetic, history, geography, literature, and natural science. This school had been founded by a Catholic official named Ngo Dinh Kha, and his son, Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m also attended it. Diem later became President of South Vietnam (1955\u201363). Years earlier the same school had educated another boy, Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Cung, also the son of an official. In 1943 Cung adopted the name Ho Chi Minh.\nAt age 14, Gi\u00e1p became a messenger for the Haiphong Power Company. He was expelled from the school after two years for taking part in protests, and went home to his village for a while. While there, he joined the \"T\u00e2n Vi\u1ec7t Revolutionary Party\", an underground group founded in 1924, which introduced him to communism. He returned to Hue and continued his political activities. He was arrested in 1930 for taking part in student protests and served 13 months of a two-year sentence at Lao B\u1ea3o Prison. By Gi\u00e1p's own account the reason for his release was lack of evidence against him. He joined the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1931 and took part in several demonstrations against French rule in Indochina as well as assisting in founding the Democratic Front in 1933.\nAlthough he denied it, Gi\u00e1p was said by the historian Cecil B. Currey to have also spent some time in the prestigious Hanoi Lyc\u00e9e Albert Sarraut, where the local elite was educated to serve the colonial regime. He was said to have been in the same class as Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, a future Prime Minister, who also denied studying at Albert Sarraut, and B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, the last Emperor of Annam. From 1933 to 1938, Gi\u00e1p studied at the Indochinese University in Hanoi where he earned a bachelor's degree in law with a major in political economy.\nPolitical activism.\nWhile a student, Gi\u00e1p had taken lodgings with Professor Dang Thai Minh, whose daughter, Nguyen Thi Minh Giang (also cited as Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Quang Th\u00e1i; 1915\u20131944), he had first met at school in Hue. She too had learned nationalism from her father and had joined the revolutionary activities with which Gi\u00e1p was involved. In June 1938 (or, according to some sources, April 1939) they were married and in May 1939 they had a daughter, Hong Anh (Red Queen of Flowers). Gi\u00e1p's busy political activities took a toll on his postgraduate studies, and he failed to pass the examinations for the Certificate of Administrative Law. Unable therefore to practice as a lawyer, he took a job as a history teacher at the Th\u0103ng Long School in Hanoi.\nAs well as teaching in school, Gi\u00e1p was busy producing and writing articles for \"Ti\u1ebfng D\u00e2n\" (Voice of the People) founded by Hu\u1ef3nh Th\u00fac Kh\u00e1ng and many other revolutionary newspapers, while actively participating in various revolutionary movements. All the while, Gi\u00e1p was a dedicated reader of military history and philosophy, revering Sun Tzu. He also made a particular study of Napoleon's generalship, and greatly admired T. E. Lawrence's \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\", learning from it practical examples of how to apply minimum military force to maximum effect. He also read and was influenced by historical figures including Carl von Clausewitz, George Washington, and Vladimir Lenin. During the Popular Front years in France, he founded \"H\u1ed3n Tr\u1ebb t\u1eadp m\u1edbi\" (Soul of Youth), an underground socialist newspaper. He also founded the French-language paper \"Le Travail\" (on which Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng also worked).\nAfter the signing of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, the French authorities outlawed the Indochinese Communist Party. Its leaders decided that Gi\u00e1p should leave Vietnam and go into exile in China. On 3 May 1940 he said farewell to his wife, left Hanoi and crossed the border into China. Gi\u00e1p's wife went to her family home in Vinh, where she was arrested, sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, and incarcerated in the Hoa Lo Central Prison in Hanoi. In China, Gi\u00e1p joined up with Ho Chi Minh, then an adviser to the People's Liberation Army. Gi\u00e1p adopted the alias Duong Huai-nan, learned to speak and write Chinese, and studied the strategy and tactics of the Chinese Communist Party.\nIn September 1940, Vichy France agreed to the Japanese occupation of Vietnam, to 'protect' Indochina. In May 1941 the Eighth Congress of the Indochinese Communist Party decided to form the Viet Minh; Gi\u00e1p was made responsible for establishing an intelligence network and organising political bases in the far north of the country. To begin propaganda work among the population, a news-sheet called \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u0110\u1ed9c L\u1eadp\" was produced. Gi\u00e1p wrote many articles for it, and was repeatedly criticised by Ho Chi Minh for the excessive verbosity of his writing style.\nMilitary career.\nIn 1942, Gi\u00e1p and about forty men moved back into Vietnam and established themselves in remote caves near the village of Vu Nhai. This and similar small groups in the mountains were the basis of the Viet Minh, the armed wing of the Vietnam Independence League. The local N\u00f9ng people spoke little Vietnamese, so Gi\u00e1p and his colleagues had to learn local dialects and draw pictures to communicate. When Vichy security patrols approached, they would conceal themselves in a cave under a waterfall, or, at times, in the lands of the Man Trang people.\nFor the next few years he and his comrades worked steadily to build up a small military force and to win local people over to the communist cause. By the end of 1943 several hundred men and women had joined the Viet Minh. It was in the summer of 1943 that Gi\u00e1p was told that his wife had been beaten to death by guards in the central prison in Hanoi.\nHer sister was guillotined.\nIn September 1944 the first Revolutionary Party Military Conference was held and it was agreed that the time was now right to take the military struggle forward into a new phase. The formation of the Vietnam Liberation army was proclaimed, with Gi\u00e1p as its commander. Ho Chi Minh directed him to establish Armed Propaganda Brigades and the first one, consisting of thirty-one men and three women, was formed in December 1944. Named the Tran Hung Dao Platoon after the great Vietnamese hero, it was armed with two revolvers, seventeen rifles, one light machine gun, and fourteen breech-loading flintlocks dating from the Russo-Japanese War.\nHo Chi Minh decided that for propaganda purposes, the Armed Propaganda Unit had to win a military victory within a month of being established, so on 25 December 1944 Gi\u00e1p led successful attacks against French outposts in the Battles of Khai Phat and Na Ngan. Two French lieutenants were killed and the Vietnamese soldiers in the outposts surrendered. The Viet Minh attackers suffered no casualties. A few weeks later, Gi\u00e1p was wounded in the leg when his group attacked another outpost at Dong Mu.\nThrough the first half of 1945, Gi\u00e1p's military position strengthened as the political position of the French and Japanese weakened. On 9 March the Japanese removed the titular French regime and placed the emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i at the head of a puppet state, the Empire of Vietnam.\nBy April the Viet Minh had nearly five thousand members, and was able to attack Japanese posts with confidence. Between May and August 1945, the United States, keen to support anti-Japanese forces in mainland Asia, actively supplied and trained Gi\u00e1p and the Viet Minh. Major Archimedes Patti, in charge of the so-called 'Deer Team' unit, taught the Viet Minh to use flamethrowers, grenade launchers and machine guns.\nIn a single month they succeeded in training around 200 hand-picked future leaders of the army they were to oppose a few decades later. Growing stronger, Gi\u00e1p's forces took more territory and captured more towns up until the announcement on 15 August by the Japanese Emperor of his country's unconditional surrender to the allies.\nOn 28 August 1945, Gi\u00e1p led his men into Hanoi, and on 2 September, Ho Chi Minh declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He formed a new government, with Gi\u00e1p as Minister of the Interior. Unbeknownst to the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, President Harry S. Truman, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Premier Joseph Stalin had already decided the future of postwar Vietnam at a summit meeting at Potsdam. They agreed that the country would be occupied temporarily to get the Japanese out; the northern half would be under the control of the Republic of China and the southern half under the British.\nOn 9 September, the Republic of China forces crossed the border and quickly took control of the north, while on 12 September, the British Indian Army arrived in Saigon. By October French forces had begun to arrive in Vietnam, and the British handed control of the south back to them and in May 1946, an agreement between the French and the Chinese saw the Chinese withdraw from the north and the French move in there as well. Ho Chi Minh and V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p pursued lengthy negotiations with the French, seeking to avoid an all-out war to cement their independence. Gi\u00e1p led the Vietnamese delegation at the Dalat conference in April 1946, which yielded nothing, and, returning to Hanoi, he was made Minister of Defense. Ho Chi Minh departed for France on 31 May, to negotiate with the French at Fontainebleau, and he remained in France until November.\nWith Ho in France, Gi\u00e1p was effectively in charge of the government in Hanoi. Up to then, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had allowed nationalist and other newspapers to publish, but when they began attacking and vilifying the government, he cracked down on them and closed them all. He also deployed Viet Minh forces against non-communist nationalist troops in the suburbs of Hanoi, and had their leaders arrested and imprisoned. During this period he also began a relationship with a famous and beautiful dancer, Thuong Huyen, and was seen in public with her at nightclubs. This conduct caused serious concern in the upper ranks of the Party as it was contrary to the very strict and abstemious moral code by which all members were expected to abide. Wanting to protect him, Ho Chi Minh arranged for him to meet a graduate from a well-known family, \u0110\u1eb7ng B\u00edch H\u00e0 (1928\u20132024).\nThey married in August 1946, and went on to have five children.\nFirst Indochina War.\nThe tense standoff between the Vietnamese government and the French occupiers escalated dramatically on 23 October when the French commander Argenlieu ordered the cruiser \"Suffren\" to bombard Haiphong in response to repeated skirmishes with Vietnamese forces as they tried to bring arms and contraband into the port. Around six thousand people were killed, and fourteen thousand wounded in the bombardment. Gi\u00e1p, acting as de facto president in the absence of Ho Chi Minh, tried to maintain some kind of peace but by the time Ho returned in November, both sides were on a war footing. Local fighting broke out repeatedly and on 27 November, Ho's government, concluding that it could not hold Hanoi against the French, retreated up into the northern mountains where it had been based two years previously. On 19 December, the Vietnamese government officially declared war on France and fighting erupted all over the country. After this time, detailed information on Gi\u00e1p's personal life becomes much scarcer and in most sources the emphasis is on his military achievements and, later, on his political work.\nThe first few years of the war involved mostly a low-level, semi-conventional resistance fight against the French occupying forces. V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p first saw real fighting at Nha Trang, when he traveled to south-central Vietnam in January\u2013February 1946, to convey the determination of leaders in Hanoi to resist the French. In 1947, though French ambitious armored, amphibious, and airborne drives had plunged into the northern mountains and along the Annam coast, Viet Minh sabotage and raids along lines of communication had mounted steadily, and the French had come to realize that France had lost the military initiative.\nFrench Union forces included colonial troops from many parts of the former French empire (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Laotian, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Vietnamese ethnic minorities), French professional troops and units of the French Foreign Legion. The use of metropolitan recruits (i.e. recruits from France itself) was forbidden by French governments to prevent the war from becoming even more unpopular at home. It was called the \"dirty war\" (\"la sale guerre\") by supporters of the Left in France and intellectuals (including Jean-Paul Sartre) during the Henri Martin affair in 1950.\nWhen it became clear that France was becoming involved in a drawn-out and so far unsuccessful war, the French government tried to negotiate an agreement with the Viet Minh. They offered to help set up a national government and promised that they would eventually grant Vietnam its independence. Ho Chi Minh and the other leaders of the Viet Minh did not trust the word of the French and continued the war.\nFrench public opinion continued to move against the war. Between 1946 and 1952 many French troops had been killed, wounded, or captured. Additionally, France was attempting to build up its economy after the devastation of the Second World War. The cost of the war had so far been twice what they had received from the United States under the Marshall Plan. \nThe war had lasted for seven years and there was still no sign of a clear French victory. A growing number of people in France had reached the conclusion that their country did not have any moral justification for being in Vietnam, and parts of the French left supported the goals of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh to form a socialist state.\nWhile growing stronger in Vietnam, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh also expanded the war and lured the French to spread their force to remote areas such as Laos. In December 1953, French military commander General Henri Navarre set up a defensive complex at \u00d0i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 in the M\u01b0\u1eddng Thanh Valley, disrupting Vi\u1ec7t Minh supply lines passing through Laos. He surmised that in an attempt to reestablish the route, Gi\u00e1p would be forced to organize a mass attack on \u00d0i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, thus fighting a conventional battle, in which Navarre could expect to have the advantage.\nGi\u00e1p took up the French challenge. While the French dug in at their outpost, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh were also preparing the battlefield. While diversionary attacks were launched in other areas, Gi\u00e1p ordered his men to covertly position their artillery by hand. Defying standard military practice, he had his twenty-four 105 mm howitzers placed on the forward slopes of the mountains around Dien Bien Phu, in deep, mostly hand-dug emplacements protecting them from French aircraft and counter-battery fire.\nWith anti-aircraft guns supplied by the Soviet Union, Gi\u00e1p was able to severely restrict the ability of the French to supply their garrison, forcing them to drop supplies inaccurately from high altitude. Gi\u00e1p ordered his men to dig a trench system that encircled the French. From the outer trench, other trenches and tunnels were gradually dug inward towards the center. The Viet Minh were now able to move in close to the French troops defending Dien Bien Phu.\nWhen Navarre realized that he was trapped, he appealed for help. The United States was approached and some advisers suggested the use of tactical nuclear weapons against the Viet Minh, but this was never seriously considered. Another suggestion was that conventional air raids would be enough to scatter Gi\u00e1p's troops. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, however, refused to intervene unless the British and other Western allies agreed. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declined, claiming that he wanted to wait for the outcome of the peace negotiations taking place in Geneva, before becoming involved in escalating the war.\nOn 13 March 1954, Gi\u00e1p launched his offensive. For 54\u00a0days, the Viet Minh seized position after position, pushing the French until they occupied only a small area of Dien Bien Phu. Colonel Piroth, the artillery commander, blamed himself for the destruction of French artillery superiority. He told his fellow officers that he had been \"completely dishonoured\" and committed suicide with a hand grenade. General De Castries, French Commander in Dien Bien Phu, was captured alive in his bunker. The French surrendered on 7 May. Their casualties totaled over 2,200\u00a0killed, 5,600\u00a0wounded, and 11,721\u00a0taken prisoner. The following day the French government announced that it intended to withdraw from Vietnam.\nGi\u00e1p's victory over the French was an important inspiration to anti-colonial campaigners around the world, particularly in French colonies, and most particularly in North Africa, not least because many of the troops fighting on the French side in Indochina were from North Africa.\nInterwar years.\nAfter the Geneva Peace Accords, Gi\u00e1p moved back into Hanoi as the North Vietnamese government re-established itself. He expanded and modernised the army, re-equipping it with Soviet and Chinese weapons systems. On 7 May 1955, he inaugurated the Vietnam People's Navy and on 1 May 1959, the Vietnam People's Air Force. During the late 1950s Gi\u00e1p served as Minister of Defence, Commander in Chief of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), Deputy Prime Minister, and deputy chairman of the Defence Council. In terms of his personal life, he was also able to move back in with his wife, from whom he had been separated for eight years during the war. She was working as a professor of history and social science at that time. Together they raised two boys and two girls. In the little spare time he had, he said in interviews that he occasionally enjoyed playing the piano, as well as reading Goethe, Shakespeare and Tolstoy.\nDuring the late 1950s the top priority of the re-established Vietnamese government was the rapid establishment of a socialist economic order and Communist Party rule. This involved collectivisation of agriculture and central management of all economic production. The process did not go smoothly and it led to food shortages and revolts. At the 10th Plenum of the Communist Party, 27\u201329 October 1956, Gi\u00e1p stood in front of the assembled delegates and said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cadres, in carrying out their antifeudal task, created contradictions in the tasks of land reform and the Revolution, in some areas treating them as if they were separate activities. We indiscriminately attacked all families owning land. Many thousands were executed. We saw enemies everywhere and resorted to widespread violence and terror. In some places, in our efforts to implement land reform, we failed to respect religious freedoms and the right to worship. We placed too much emphasis on class origins rather than political attitudes. There were grave errors.\nThe departure of the French and the partition of Vietnam meant that the Hanoi government only controlled the north part of the country. In South Vietnam there were still several thousand guerillas, known as Viet Cong (VC), fighting against the government in Saigon. The Party Plenum in 1957 ordered changes to the structure of their units and Gi\u00e1p was put in charge of implementing them and building their strength to form a solid basis for an insurrection in the South. The 1959 Plenum decided that the time for escalating the armed struggle in the South was right and in July that year Gi\u00e1p ordered the opening up of the Ho Chi Minh trail to improve supply lines to VC units.\nVietnam War.\nGi\u00e1p remained commander in chief of the PAVN throughout the war against South Vietnam and its allies, the United States, South Korea, Australia, Thailand, New Zealand and the Philippines. He oversaw the expansion of the PAVN from a small self-defense force into a large conventional army, equipped by its communist allies with considerable amounts of relatively sophisticated weaponry, although that did not usually match the weaponry of the Americans.\nGi\u00e1p opposed the implementation of the T\u1ebft Offensive of 1968, considering focus on guerrilla tactics in the south to be more effective. The best evidence suggests that when it became obvious that L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n and V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng were going to conduct it anyway, he left North Vietnam for medical treatment in Hungary and did not return until after the offensive had begun. Although their attempt to spark a general uprising against the southern government failed disastrously, it was a significant political victory through convincing American politicians and the public that their commitment to South Vietnam could not be open-ended. Gi\u00e1p later argued that the T\u1ebft Offensive was not a \"purely military strategy\" but part of a \"general strategy, an integrated one, at once military, political and diplomatic.\"\nPeace negotiations between representatives from the United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam and the VC began in Paris in January 1969. President Richard Nixon, like President Lyndon B. Johnson before him, was convinced that a U.S. withdrawal was necessary, but four years passed before the last American troops departed.\nIn October 1972, the negotiators came close to agreeing to a formula to end the conflict. The proposal was that the remaining U.S. troops would withdraw from South Vietnam in exchange for a cease-fire and the return of American prisoners held by North Vietnam. It was also agreed that the governments in North and South Vietnam would remain in power, and reunification would be \"carried out step by step through peaceful means\". Although the North's Easter Offensive of 1972 had been beaten back with high casualties, the proposal did not require them to leave the South. PAVN would thus be able to maintain control of considerable territory in South Vietnam from which to launch future offensives.\nIn an effort to put pressure on both North and South Vietnam during the negotiations, Nixon ordered a series of air raids on Hanoi and Haiphong, codenamed Operation Linebacker II. The operation ended on 29 December 1972, after 12 days with 42 U.S. casualties and over 1,600 North Vietnamese killed. North Vietnam then agreed to sign the Paris Peace Accords that had been proposed in October, although with added conditions favorable to both the U.S. and to North Vietnam. South Vietnam objected, but had little choice but to accept it.\nThe last U.S. military personnel (except for the staff of the Defense Attache's Office and the US Embassy's Marine Security Guards) completed their withdrawal in March 1973. Despite the agreement, there was no end in fighting. South Vietnamese attempts to regain communist-controlled territory inspired their opponents to change strategy. Communist leaders met in Hanoi in March for a series of meetings to plan for a massive offensive against the South. In June 1973, the U.S. Congress passed the Case\u2013Church Amendment, which prohibited any further U.S. military involvement, and the PAVN supply routes could operate normally without any fear of U.S. bombing.\nFall of Saigon.\nThe Western view of this period is that after Ho Chi Minh's death in September 1969, Gi\u00e1p lost a power struggle in 1972 shortly after the failed Easter Offensive where he was blamed by the Politburo for the offensive's failure. Gi\u00e1p was recalled to Hanoi where he was replaced as field commander of the PAVN and from then on watched subsequent events from the sidelines, with the glory of victory in 1975 going to the chief of the general staff, General V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng. Gi\u00e1p's contribution to the 1975 victory is largely ignored by official Vietnamese accounts.\nLater life.\nSoon after the fall of Saigon, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was established. In the new government, Gi\u00e1p was made Deputy Prime Minister in July 1976. In December 1978 he oversaw the successful Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War which drove the Khmer Rouge from power and ended the Cambodian genocide. In retaliation, Cambodia's ally China responded by invading the Cao Bang province of Vietnam in January 1979 and once again Gi\u00e1p was in overall responsibility for the response, which drove the Chinese out after a month. He finally retired from his post at the Defense Ministry in 1981 and retired from the Politburo in 1982. He remained on the Central Committee and Deputy Prime Minister until he retired in 1991.\nGi\u00e1p wrote extensively on military theory and strategy. His works include \"Big Victory, Great Task\"; \"People's Army, People's War\"; \"\u00d0i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7\"; and \"We Will Win\".\nIn 1995, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara met Gi\u00e1p to ask what happened on 4 August 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident. \"Absolutely nothing\", Gi\u00e1p replied. Gi\u00e1p said that the attack on 4 August 1964, had been imaginary.\nThe final evidence that there had not been any Vietnamese attack against U.S. ships on the night of 4 August 1964 was provided by the release of a slightly sanitized version.\nIn a 1998 interview, William Westmoreland criticized the battlefield prowess of Gi\u00e1p, stating, \"By his own admission, by early 1969, I think, he had lost, what, a half million soldiers? He reported this. Now such a disregard for human life may make a formidable adversary, but it does not make a military genius. An American commander losing men like that would hardly have lasted more than a few weeks.\"\nAmerican historian Derek Frisby criticized Westmoreland's view, which he said reflected a failure in understanding Gi\u00e1p's core philosophy of \"revolutionary war\". According to Frisby, \"Gi\u00e1p understood that protracted warfare would cost many lives but that did not always translate into winning or losing the war. In the final analysis, Gi\u00e1p won the war despite losing many battles, and as long as the army survived to fight another day, the idea of Vietnam lived in the hearts of the people who would support it, and that is the essence of 'revolutionary war'.\" Nixon's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said: \"We fought a military war; our opponents fought a political one. We sought physical attrition; our opponents aimed for our psychological exhaustion. In the process we lost sight of one of the cardinal maxims of guerrilla war: the guerrilla wins if he does not lose. The conventional army loses if it does not win. The North Vietnamese used their armed forces the way a bull-fighter uses his cape \u2014 to keep us lunging in areas of marginal political importance.\"\nCompared to other North Vietnamese leaders who favored an all-out quick offensive in the South to bring victory in a short period like L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n, Gi\u00e1p was relatively cautious, and he believed in a more protracted military struggle, which would not be as costly in manpower. However, he was willing to spend the lives of his soldiers with what American commanders would regard as reckless abandon, if that was what it took to win the war. Gi\u00e1p explained to American journalist Stanley Karnow in 1990:\n\"We were not strong enough to drive out a half-million American troops, that wasn't our aim. Our intention was to break the will of the American government to continue the war. Westmoreland was wrong to expect that his superior firepower would grind us down. If we had focused on the balance of forces, we would have been defeated in two hours. We were waging a people's war . . . America's sophisticated arms, electronic devices and all the rest were to no avail in the end. In war there are two factors\u2014human beings and weapons. Ultimately, though, human beings are the decisive factor.\"\nAfter the conclusion of the Vietnam War, Gi\u00e1p extensively wrote about his military strategy. The subsequent passage from one of his books explains his method of defeating a powerful foreign enemy:\"The war of liberation is a protracted war and a hard war in which we must rely mainly on ourselves\u2014for we are strong politically but weak materially, while the enemy is very weak politically but stronger materially.\"\n\"Guerrilla warfare is a means of fighting a revolutionary war that relies on the heroic spirit to triumph over modern weapons. It is the means whereby the people of a weak, badly equipped country can stand up against an aggressive army possessing better equipment and techniques.\"\n\"The correct tactics for a protracted revolutionary war are to wage guerrilla warfare, to advance from guerrilla warfare to regular warfare and then closely combine these two forms of war; to develop from guerrilla to mobile and then to siege warfare.\"\n\"Accumulate a thousand small victories to turn into one great success.\"In 2009, Gi\u00e1p became a prominent critic of bauxite mining in Vietnam following government plans to open large areas of the Central Highlands to the practice. Gi\u00e1p supported a 1980s study in which experts advised against mining that damaged the environment and national security.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn 4 October 2013, the Communist Party of Vietnam and government officials announced that V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p had died, aged 102, at 18:09 local time, at Central Military Hospital 108 in Hanoi. He was given a state funeral on 12\u201313 October, and his body was laid in state at the national morgue in Hanoi until his burial in his home province of Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh. After his death, several cities in Vietnam renamed some of their most prominent streets after him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Named after the homonymous geographical region, Harald's realm was later to be known as the Kingdom of Norway.\nTraditionally established in 872 and existing continuously for over 1,100 years, the Kingdom of Norway is one of the oldest states of Europe: King Harald V, who has reigned since 1991, is the 64th monarch according to the official list. During interregna, Norway has been ruled by variously titled regents.\nSeveral royal dynasties have possessed the Throne of the Kingdom of Norway: the more prominent include the Fairhair dynasty (872\u2013970), the House of Sverre (1184\u20131319), the House of Oldenburg (1450\u20131481, 1483\u20131533, 1537\u20131818, and from 1905), including branches Holstein-Gottorp (1814\u20131818) and Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg (from 1905), and the House of Bernadotte (1818\u20131905). During the civil war era (1130\u20131240), several pretenders fought each other, and as a consequence, some rulers from this era are not traditionally considered lawful kings and are usually omitted from lists of monarchs. Between 1319 and 1905, Norway was at times part of various unions with neighbouring countries, like The First Swedish\u2013Norwegian union, The Kalmar Union, Denmark-Norway, and Sweden\u2013Norway.\nKings of Norway used many additional titles between 1450 and 1905, such as King of the Wends, King of the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Duke of Holstein, Prince of R\u00fcgen, and Count of Oldenburg. They called themselves \"Konge til Norge\" (\"King of Norway\"), usually with the style \"His Royal Majesty\". With the introduction of constitutional monarchy in 1814, the traditional style \"by the Grace of God\" was extended to \"by the Grace of God and the Constitution of the Kingdom\", but was only briefly in use. The last king to use the \"by the grace of God\" style was Haakon VII, who died in 1957. The King's title today is formally \"Norges Konge\" (\"Norway's King\"), with the style \"His Majesty\".\nKey.\n\"For lists of the prehistoric kings of Norway see List of legendary kings of Norway\"\nFairhair dynasty.\nBesides becoming sole king after his father Harold's death, Eric Bloodaxe was king jointly with his father for three years before the latter's death. After Harald's death, Eric ruled as \"overking\" of his brothers, who also held status as kings and had control over certain regions. Harald Greycloak also ruled as \"overking\" of his brothers. All dates for the kings of the Fairhair dynasty are approximate and/or just scholarly estimates. Slight differences might therefore occur between different sources. The following table uses the dates given in \"Norsk biografisk leksikon\"/\"Store norske leksikon\".\nHouse of Gorm/Earl of Lade.\nThe Danish king Harald Bluetooth had himself hailed as king of Norway after the Battle of Fitjar (c. 961). Besides gaining direct control of Viken in south-eastern Norway, he let Harald Greycloak rule the rest of Norway as king, nominally under himself. Harald Bluetooth later switched his support to Harald Greycloak's rival, Haakon Sigurdsson, Earl of Lade, who eventually captured Harald Greycloak's kingdom. Haakon thereafter ruled Norway (except Viken), at first nominally under Harald. All dates are estimates and subject to interpretation. Haakon is generally held as the ruler of Norway from 970 to 995.\nHouse of Gorm/Earls of Lade (restored).\nAfter the Battle of Svolder, the Danes recaptured Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard. As before, the Danes controlled the petty kingdoms of Viken as vassals, while the two Earls of Lade, Eric Haakonsson and Sweyn Haakonsson, ruled Western Norway and Tr\u00f8ndelag, nominally as earls under Sweyn. Eric is generally held as the de facto ruler of Norway from 1000 to 1015, together with his brother Sweyn, a lesser known figure, with whom he shared his power.\nHouse of Gl\u00fccksburg.\nCarl of Denmark was approved in a referendum as King of Norway on 13 November 1905 and then elected by the Storting on 18 November 1905. He took the regnal name Haakon VII. With him the House of Oldenburg, in the form of its junior branch, resumed occupancy of the throne of Norway.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Icelanders were having trouble selling their faux furs so when the king asked them if they would make a present to him of one of the furs, which happened to be grey, the sailors did not hesitate and the king immediately used it as a cloak. This set an instant fashion trend and before long the Icelanders had sold their entire load of previously unsalable furs to the king's men and the locals. Harald was ever after known as Harald \"Gray-hide\".\nHarald was the son of Eric Bloodaxe and a grandson of Harald Fairhair. His mother was Gunnhild, the sister of King Harald Bluetooth.\nAfter his father's death in 954, Harald and his brothers allied with their uncle, King Harald Bluetooth, against their half-uncle King Haakon the Good. They fought several battles against King Haakon including the Battle of Rastarkalv near the island of Frei in 955 and the Battle of Fitjar in 961.\nAfter King Haakon's death at Fitjar, Harald and his brothers became kings of Norway, but they had little authority outside Western Norway. Harald, by being the oldest, was the most powerful of the brothers. In 961, their uncle King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark traveled to Norway and declared Harald Greycloak to be his vassal king in Norway.\nHarald moved to strengthen his rule by killing the local rulers including Sigurd Haakonsson, Tryggve Olafsson and Gudr\u00f8d Bj\u00f8rnsson. Harald Greycloak thus took power over the country up to and including H\u00e5logaland. Harald established control over the trade route along the Norwegian coast. He also undertook a Viking expedition to Bjarmaland, today the area of Arkhangelsk in northern Russia. Harald soon became less dependent on support from Harald Bluetooth.\nIn 970, he was tricked into coming to Denmark and killed in Hals in the Limfjord in a plot planned by Sigurd Haakonsson's son Haakon, who had become an ally of Harald Bluetooth. Haakon Sigurdsson had become the jarl of Lade after his own father was killed by Harald Greycloak's men in the autumn of 962. The surviving brothers of Harald Greyhide fled the country after his death. With the death of Harald Greycloak, King Harald Bluetooth won back power over Norway and he supported Haakon Sigurdsson as his vassal king.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Before becoming king, Harald spent 15 years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus' and chief of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire. In his chronicle, Adam of Bremen called him the \"Thunderbolt of the North\".\nIn 1030, the fifteen-year-old Harald fought in the Battle of Stiklestad alongside his half-brother Olaf Haraldsson. Olaf sought to reclaim the Norwegian throne, which he had lost to Danish king Cnut two years previously. Olaf and Harald were defeated by forces loyal to Cnut, and Harald was forced into exile to Kievan Rus'. Thereafter, he was in the army of Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, becoming captain, until he moved on to Constantinople with his companions around 1034. In Constantinople, he rose quickly to become the commander of the Byzantine Varangian Guard, seeing action on the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor, Sicily, possibly in the Holy Land, Bulgaria and in Constantinople itself, where he became involved in the imperial dynastic disputes. Harald amassed wealth whilst in the Byzantine Empire, which he shipped to Yaroslav in Kievan Rus' for safekeeping. In 1042, he left the Byzantine Empire, returning to Kievan Rus' to prepare to reclaim the Norwegian throne. In his absence the Norwegian throne had been restored from the Danes to Olaf's illegitimate son Magnus the Good.\nIn 1046, Harald joined forces with Magnus's rival in Denmark, the pretender Sweyn II of Denmark, raiding the Danish coast. Magnus, unwilling to fight his uncle, agreed to share the kingship with Harald, since Harald in turn would share his wealth with him. The co-rule ended abruptly the next year as Magnus died: Harald became the sole ruler of Norway. Domestically, Harald crushed opposition, and outlined the unification of Norway. Harald's reign was one of relative peace and stability, and he instituted a coin economy and foreign trade. Seeking to restore Cnut's \"North Sea Empire\", Harald claimed the Danish throne, and spent nearly every year until 1064 raiding the Danish coast and fighting his former ally, Sweyn. Although the campaigns were successful, he was never able to conquer Denmark.\nNot long after Harald had renounced his claim to Denmark, the former Earl of Northumbria, Tostig Godwinson, brother of English king Harold Godwinson, pledged his allegiance to Harald, inviting him to claim the English throne. Harald assented, invading northern England with 10,000 troops and 300 longships in September 1066, defeating the English regional forces of Northumbria and Mercia in the Battle of Fulford near York on 20 September. Harald was defeated and killed in a surprise attack by Harold Godwinson's forces in the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September, which wiped out his army. Historians often consider Harald's death the end of the Viking Age.\nEpithets.\nHarald's most famous epithet is Old Norse , which has been translated variously as 'hard in counsel', 'tyrannical', 'tyrant', 'hard-ruler', 'ruthless', 'savage in counsel', 'tough', and 'severe'. While Judith Jesch has argued for 'severe' as the best translation, Alison Finlay and Anthony Faulkes prefer 'resolute'. has traditionally been Anglicised as 'Hardrada', though Judith Jesch characterises this form as \"a bastard Anglicisation of the original epithet in an oblique case\". This epithet predominates in the later Icelandic saga-tradition.\nHowever, in a number of independent sources associated with the British Isles, mostly earlier than the Icelandic sagas, Harald is given epithets deriving from Old Norse (literally 'hair-beautiful'). These sources include:\nIn Icelandic sagas the name \"Harald Fairhair\" is more famously associated with an earlier Norwegian king, and twentieth-century historians assumed that the name was attached to Harald Hardrada in error by Insular historians. However, recognising the independence of some of the Insular sources, historians have since favoured the idea that Harald Hardrada was widely known as Harald Fairhair, and indeed now doubt that the earlier Harald Fairhair existed in any form resembling the later saga-accounts.\nSverrir Jakobsson has suggested that 'fairhair' \"might be the name by which King Harald wished himself to be known. It must have been his opponents who gave him the epithet \"severe\" (ON. ), by which he is generally known in thirteenth-century Old Norse kings' sagas\".\nEarly life.\nHarald was born in Ringerike, Norway, in 1015 (or possibly 1016) to \u00c5sta Gudbrandsdatter and her second husband Sigurd Syr. Sigurd was a petty king of Ringerike, and among the strongest and wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands. Through his mother \u00c5sta, Harald was the youngest of three half-brothers to King Olaf Haraldsson (later Saint Olaf). In his youth, Harald displayed traits of a typical rebel with big ambitions, and admired Olaf as his role model. He thus differed from his two older brothers, who were more similar to their father, down-to-earth and mostly concerned with maintaining the farm.\nThe Icelandic sagas, in particular Snorri Sturluson in \"Heimskringla\", claim that Sigurd, like Olaf's father, was a great-grandson of King Harald Fairhair in the male line. Most modern scholars believe that the ancestors attributed to Harald Hardrada's father, along with other parts of the Fairhair genealogy, are inventions reflecting the political and social expectations of the time of the authors (around two centuries after Harald Hardrada's lifetime) rather than historical reality. Harald Hardrada's alleged descent from Harald Fairhair is not mentioned and played no part during Harald Hardrada's own time, which seems odd considering that it would have provided significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to the Norwegian throne.\nFollowing a revolt in 1028, Harald's brother Olaf was forced into exile until he returned to Norway in early 1030. On hearing news of Olaf's planned return, Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway. After a friendly welcome, Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030, in which Harald took part on his brother's side. The battle was part of an attempt to restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne, which had been captured by the Danish king Cnut the Great (Canute). The battle resulted in defeat for the brothers at the hands of those Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut, and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded. Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle.\nExile in the East.\nTo Kievan Rus'.\nAfter the defeat at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald managed to escape with the aid of R\u00f6gnvald Brusason (later Earl of Orkney) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway. He stayed there for some time to heal his wounds, and thereafter (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in Kievan Rus' (referred to in the sagas as \"Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki\" or \"Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 hin mikla\"). He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga (\"Aldeigjuborg\"), arriving there in the first half of 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald. Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces. Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028, and \"Morkinskinna\" says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf. Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the Chudes in Estonia, and the Byzantines, as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people.\nIn Byzantine service.\nAfter a few years in Kievan Rus', Harald and his force of around 500 men moved on south to Constantinople (\"Miklagard\"), the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known today\u00a0\u2013 but not to contemporaries\u00a0\u2013 as the Byzantine Empire), probably in 1033 or 1034, where they joined the Varangian Guard. Although the \"Flateyjarb\u00f3k\" maintains that Harald at first sought to keep his royal identity a secret, most sources agree that Harald and his men's reputation was well known in the east at the time. While the Varangian Guard was primarily meant to function as the emperor's bodyguard, Harald was found fighting on \"nearly every frontier\" of the empire. He first saw action in campaigns against Arab pirates in the Mediterranean Sea, and then in inland towns in Asia Minor / Anatolia that had supported the pirates. By this time, he had, according to Snorri Sturluson (a 12th-century Icelandic historian, poet, and politician), become the \"leader over all the Varangians\". By 1035, the Byzantines had pushed the Arabs out of Asia Minor to the east and southeast, and Harald took part in campaigns that went as far east as the Tigris River and Euphrates River in Mesopotamia, where according to his skald (poet) \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr Arn\u00f3rsson (recounted in the sagas) he participated in the capture of eighty Arab strongholds, a number which historians Sigfus Bl\u00f6ndal and Benedikt Benedikz see no particular reason to question. Although not holding independent command of an army as the sagas imply, it is not unlikely that King Harald and the Varangians at times could have been sent off to capture a castle or town. During the first four years of the reign of Byzantine Emperor Michael IV the Paphlagonian, Harald probably also fought in campaigns against the Pechenegs.\nThereafter, Harald is reported in the sagas to have gone to Jerusalem and fought in battles in the area. Although the sagas place this after his expedition to Sicily, historian Kelly DeVries has questioned that chronology. Whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature would depend on whether it took place before or after the 1036 peace treaty between Michael IV and the Muslim Fatimid Caliph Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah (in reality the Caliph's mother, originally a Byzantine Christian, since the Caliph was a minor), although it is considered unlikely to have been made before. Modern historians have speculated that Harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to Jerusalem (possibly including members of the Imperial family) following the peace agreement, as it was also agreed that the Byzantines were allowed to repair the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Furthermore, this may in turn have presented Harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on Christian pilgrims.\nIn 1038, Harald joined the Byzantines in their expedition to Sicily, in George Maniakes's (the sagas' \"Gyrge\") attempt to reconquer the island from the Muslim Saracens, who had established the Emirate of Sicily on the island. During the campaign, Harald fought alongside Norman mercenaries such as William Iron Arm. According to Snorri Sturluson, Harald captured four towns on Sicily. In 1041, when the Byzantine expedition to Sicily was over, a Lombard-Norman revolt erupted in southern Italy, and Harald led the Varangian Guard in multiple battles. Harald fought with the Catepan of Italy, Michael Dokeianos with initial success, but the Normans, led by their former ally William Iron Arm, defeated the Byzantines in the Battle of Olivento in March, and in the Battle of Montemaggiore in May. After the defeat, Harald and the Varangian Guard were called back to Constantinople, following Maniakes's imprisonment by the emperor and the onset of other more pressing issues. Harald and the Varangians were thereafter sent to fight in the southeastern European frontier in Bulgaria, where they arrived in late 1041. There, he fought in the army of Emperor Michael IV in the Battle of Ostrovo of the 1041 campaign against the Bulgarian uprising led by Peter Delyan, which later gained Harald the nickname the \"Bulgar-burner\" (\"Bolgara brennir\") by his skald.\nHarald was not affected by Maniakes's conflict with Emperor Michael IV, and received honours and respect upon his return to Constantinople. In a Greek book written in the 1070s, the \"Strategikon of Kekaumenos\", Araltes (i.e. Harald) is said to have won the favour of the emperor. The book says that the Byzantine emperor first appointed him \"manglabites\" (possibly identified with the title \"protospatharios\"), a soldier of the imperial guard, after the Sicilian campaign. Following the campaign against the Bulgarians, in which Harald again served with distinction, he received the rank while at Mosynopolis of \"spatharokandidatos\", identified by DeVries as a promotion to the possibly third highest Byzantine rank, but by Mikhail Bibikov as a lesser rank than \"protospatharios\" that was ordinarily awarded to foreign allies to the emperor. The \"Strategikon\" indicates that the ranks awarded to Harald were rather low, since Harald reportedly was \"not angry for just having been appointed to \"manglabites\" or \"spatharokandidatos\"\". According to his skald \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr Arn\u00f3rsson, Harald had participated in eighteen greater battles during his Byzantine service. Harald's favour at the imperial court quickly declined after the death of Michael IV in December 1041, which was followed by conflicts between the new emperor Michael V and the powerful empress Zoe.\nDuring the turmoil, Harald was arrested and imprisoned, but the sources disagree on the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, as well as for requesting marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress because she wanted to marry Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape in the midst of the revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).\nBack to Kievan Rus'.\nHarald became extremely rich during his time in the east, and secured the wealth collected in Constantinople by shipments to Kievan Rus' for safekeeping (with Yaroslav the Wise acting as safekeeper for his fortune). The sagas note that aside from the significant spoils of battle he had retained, he had participated three times in \"polutasvarf\" (loosely translated as \"palace-plunder\"), a term which implies either the pillaging of the palace exchequer on the death of the emperor, or perhaps the disbursement of funds to the Varangians by the new emperor in order to ensure their loyalty. It is likely that the money Harald made while serving in Constantinople allowed him to fund his claim for the crown of Norway. If he participated in \"polutasvarf\" three times, these occasions must have been the deaths of Romanos III, Michael IV, and Michael V, in which Harald would have opportunities, beyond his legitimate revenues, to carry off immense wealth.\nAfter Zoe had been restored to the throne in June 1042 together with Constantine IX, Harald requested to be allowed to return to Norway. Although Zoe refused to allow this, Harald managed to escape into the Bosphorus with two ships and some loyal followers. Although the second ship was destroyed by the Byzantine cross-strait iron chains, Harald's ship sailed safely into the Black Sea after successfully manoeuvring over the barrier. Despite this, Kekaumenos lauds the \"loyalty and love\" Harald had for the empire, which he reportedly maintained even after he returned to Norway and became king. Following his escape from Constantinople, Harald arrived back in Kievan Rus' later in 1042. During his second stay there, he married Elisabeth (referred to in Scandinavian sources as Ellisif), daughter of Yaroslav the Wise and granddaughter of the Swedish king Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung. Shortly after Harald's arrival in Kiev, Yaroslav attacked Constantinople, and it is considered likely that Harald provided him with valuable information about the state of the empire.\nIt is possible that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald's first time in Rus', or that they at least had been acquainted. During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse \"Yet the goddess in Gardarike / will not accept my gold rings\" (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although \"Morkinskinna\" claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev. According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus', requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough. It is in any case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as Henry I of France, Andrew I of Hungary and the daughter of Constantine IX.\nKing of Norway.\nReturn to Scandinavia.\nSeeking to regain for himself the kingdom lost by his half-brother Olaf Haraldsson, Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045, departing from Novgorod (\"Holmgard\") to Staraya Ladoga (\"Aldeigjuborg\") where he obtained a ship. His journey went through Lake Ladoga, down the Neva River, and then into the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea. He arrived in Sigtuna in Sweden, probably at the end of 1045 or in early 1046. When he arrived in Sweden, according to the skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold. In Harald's absence, the throne of Norway had been restored to Magnus the Good, an illegitimate son of Olaf. Harald may actually have known this, and it could have been the reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place. Since Cnut the Great's sons - Harthacnut and Harold Harefoot - had abandoned Norway, Magnus's position as king had been secured. No domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven-year reign. After the death of Harthacnut left the Danish throne vacant, Magnus was also elected king of Denmark, and managed to defeat the Danish royal pretender Sweyn Estridsson.\nHaving heard of Sweyn's defeat, Harald met up with him as well as with the Swedish king Anund Jacob, and the three joined forces against Magnus. Their first military exploit consisted of raiding the Danish coast. The purpose of that was to impress the natives by demonstrating that Magnus offered them no protection, and thus leading them to submit to Harald and Sweyn. Learning about their actions, Magnus knew that their next target would be Norway. Harald may have planned to be taken as king of his father's petty kingdom, and thereafter claim the rest of the country. In any case, the people were unwilling to turn against Magnus, and on hearing news of Harald's schemes, Magnus (abroad at the time) went home to Norway with his entire army. Instead of going to war, Magnus's advisors recommended the young king not fight his uncle, and a compromise was reached in 1046 in which Harald would rule Norway (not Denmark) jointly with Magnus (although Magnus would have precedence). Notably, Harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with Magnus, who at the time was badly in need of funds. During their short co-rule, Harald and Magnus had separate courts and kept to themselves, and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes.\nIn 1047, Magnus and Harald went to Denmark with their leidang forces. Later that year in Jylland, less than a year into their co-rule, Magnus died without an heir. Before his death, he had decided that Sweyn was to inherit Denmark and Harald to inherit Norway. On hearing the news of Magnus's death, Harald quickly gathered the local leaders in Norway and, declaring himself king of Norway as well as of Denmark, prepared ousting his former ally from the Denmark. However, the army and the chieftains, headed by Einar Thambarskelfir, opposed any plans of invading Denmark. Although Harald himself objected to bringing the body of Magnus back to Norway, the Norwegian army prepared to transport his body to Nidaros (now Trondheim), where they buried him next to Saint Olaf in late 1047. Einar, an opponent of Harald, claimed that \"to follow Magnus dead was better than to follow any other king alive\".\nUnder Harald's rule, Norway introduced a royal monopoly on the minting of coins. The coins minted under Harald's rule appear to have been accepted as a commonly used currency (as opposed to continued use of primarily foreign-minted coins). Minting of coins likely provided a substantial part of Harald's annual revenues. Minting of coinage collapsed in Norway in the late 14th century.\nInvasions of Denmark.\nHarald also wanted to re-establish Magnus's rule over Denmark, and in the long term probably sought to restore Cnut the Great's \"North Sea Empire\" in its entirety. While his first proposal to invade Denmark fell through, the next year Harald embarked on what would turn into constant warfare against Sweyn, from 1048 almost yearly until 1064. Similar to his campaigns (then together with Sweyn) against Magnus's rule in Denmark, most of his campaigns against Sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on the Danish coasts. In 1048, he plundered Jutland, and in 1049 he pillaged and burned Hedeby, at the time the most important Danish trade center, and one of the best protected and most populous towns in Scandinavia. Hedeby as a civil town never recovered from Harald's destruction, and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by Slavic tribes in 1066. One of two conventional battles was set to be fought between the two kings later the same year, but, according to Saxo Grammaticus, Sweyn's smaller army was so frightened when approached by the Norwegians that they chose to jump in the water trying to escape; most drowned. Although Harald was victorious in most of the engagements, he was never successful in occupying Denmark.\nThe second, more significant battle, a naval encounter, was the Battle of Nis\u00e5 on 9 August 1062. As Harald had not been able to conquer Denmark despite his raids, he wanted to win a decisive victory over Sweyn. He eventually set out from Norway with a great army and a fleet of around 300 ships. Sweyn had also prepared for the battle, which had been preassigned a time and place. Sweyn did not appear at the agreed time, and Harald thus sent home his non-professional soldiers (\"b\u00f3ndaherrinn\"), which had made up half of his forces. When the dismissed ships were out of reach, Sweyn's fleet finally appeared, possibly also with 300 ships. The battle resulted in great bloodshed as Harald defeated the Danes (70 Danish ships were reportedly left \"empty\"), but many ships and men managed to escape, including Sweyn. During the battle, Harald actively shot with his bow, like most others in the early phase of the battle.\nFatigue and the huge cost of the indecisive battles eventually led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn, and in 1064 (or 1065 according to \"Morkinskinna\") the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement. By the agreement, they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries, and there would be no payments of reparations. In the subsequent winter of 1065, Harald travelled through his realm and accused the farmers of withholding taxes from him. In response, he acted with brutality, and had people maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him. Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his hird, a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords. Harald's contribution to the strengthening of Norway's monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird, thus centralising power away from local warlords.\nDomestic opposition.\nAccording to historian Knut Helle, Harald completed the first phase of what he has termed the \"national territorial unification of Norway\". Having forced his way to the kingship, Harald would have to convince the aristocracy that he was the right person to rule Norway alone. To establish domestic alliances, he married Tora Torbergsdatter of one of the most powerful Norwegian families. The primary opposition to Harald's rule would be the descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson, from the powerful dynasty of Earls of Lade who had controlled Northern Norway and Tr\u00f8ndelag with much autonomy under the Norwegian king. Haakon had even ruled the whole of Norway (nominally under the Danish king) from 975 until 995, when he was killed during the takeover by Olaf Tryggvasson. Even after Haakon's death, his offspring held a certain degree of sovereignty in the north, and by Harald's early reign the family was headed by Einar Thambarskelfir, who was married to Haakon's daughter. While the family had maintained good relations with Magnus, Harald's absolutism and consolidation of the kingship soon led to conflict with Einar.\nIt was from his power-struggle with the Norwegian aristocracy that Harald got himself the reputation that gave him the nickname \"Hardrada\", or \"the hard ruler\". Although the relationship between Harald and Einar was poor from the start, confrontation did not occur before Harald went north to his court in Nidaros. One time in Nidaros, Einar arrived at Harald's court, and in a display of power was accompanied by \"eight or nine longships and almost five hundred men\", obviously seeking confrontation. Harald was not provoked by the incident. Although the sources differ on the circumstances, the next event nonetheless led to the murder of Einar by Harald's men, which threatened to throw Norway into a state of civil war. Although the remaining descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson considered rebellion against the king, Harald eventually managed to negotiate peace with them, and secured the family's submission for the remainder of his reign. By the death of Einar and his son around 1050, the Earls of Lade had outplayed their role as a base of opposition, and Tr\u00f8ndelag was definitely subordinated to Harald's national kingdom.\nBefore the Battle of Nis\u00e5, Harald had been joined by Haakon Ivarsson, who distinguished himself in the battle and gained Harald's favour. Harald reportedly even considered giving Haakon the title of Earl, and Haakon was greatly upset when Harald later backed down from his promise. With a strong hold over the Uplands, Haakon was additionally given the earldom of V\u00e4rmland by the Swedish king Stenkil. In early 1064, Haakon entered the Uplands and collected their taxes, the region thus effectively threatened to renounce their loyalty to Harald in response. The revolt of Haakon and the farmers in the Uplands may have been the main reason why Harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with Sweyn Estridsson. After the agreement, Harald went to Oslo and sent tax collectors to the Uplands, only to find that the farmers would withhold their taxes until Haakon arrived. In response, Harald entered Sweden with an army and quickly defeated Haakon. Still facing opposition from the farmers, Harald embarked on a campaign to crush the areas that had withheld their taxes. Due to the remote location of the region in the interior of the country, the Uplands had never been an integrated part of the Norwegian king's realm. Using harsh measures, Harald burned down farms and small villages, and had people maimed and killed. Starting in Romerike, his campaign continued into Hedmark, Hadeland and Ringerike. Since the regions contained several rich rural communities, Harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates. By the end of 1065 there was probably peace in Norway, as any opposition had either been killed, chased into exile or silenced.\nPolicies.\nHarald's reign was marked by his background as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with a brute force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean. While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have taken this as a sign that, despite his absolute monarchy, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, as well as with Scotland and Ireland. According to the later sagas, Harald founded Oslo, where he spent much time.\nHarald also continued to advance Christianity in Norway, and archaeological excavations show that churches were built and improved during his reign. He also imported bishops, priests and monks from abroad, especially from Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire. A slightly different form of Christianity was thus introduced in Norway from the rest of northern Europe.\nHarald's misusing funds from the pilgrimage to Nidaros as well as his bringing bishops to the country who were either not consecrated in France and England or not consecrated at all, brought him into conflict with Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen. When the Archbishop's legates protested, Harald reportedly responded that \"he did not know of any other archbishop or lord of Norway than the king himself\". Norwegian historian Halvdan Koht has remarked that the \"words seemed as if spoken by a Byzantine despot\". It is possible that Harald maintained contacts with Byzantine emperors after he became king, which could suggest a background for his church policies.\nNorthern explorations.\nOnce he had returned to Norway, Harald seems to have displayed an interest in exploring his own realm, as for instance the \"Morkinskinna\" recounts Harald's trip into the Uplands. Harald is also said to have explored the seas beyond his kingdom, as the contemporary Adam of Bremen reports of such naval expeditions conducted by Harald:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The most enterprising Prince Haraldr of the Norwegians lately attempted this [sea]. Who, having searched thoroughly the length of the northern ocean in ships, finally had before his eyes the dark failing boundaries of the savage world, and, by retracing his steps, with difficulty barely escaped the deep abyss in safety.\u2014\u200a\nKelly DeVries has suggested that Harald \"may even have known of and sought out the legendary land called Vinland, which Viking sailors had discovered only a short time before\", which Adam mentions earlier in the same passage to have been widely reported in Denmark and Norway. H. H. Lamb has on the other hand proposed that the land he reached may have been either Spitsbergen or Novaya Zemlya.\nInvasion of England.\nBackground and preparations.\nAccepting he could not conquer Denmark, Harald switched attention to England; his claim was based on a 1038 agreement between Magnus and its previous ruler, Harthacnut, who died childless in 1042. The agreement stated that if either die, the other would inherit his lands; however, it was unlikely Magnus assumed he would gain the English throne without fighting. Harthacnut himself preferred his half-brother, Edward the Confessor, who became king with the backing of Earl Godwin, father of Harold Godwinson. Plans by Magnus to invade England in 1045 were suspended, while he dealt with an uprising by Sweyn of Denmark.\nAfter Magnus died in 1047, Harald took over his claim; however, Edward kept potential enemies happy by hinting they might succeed him; in addition to Harald, these included Sweyn, and William, Duke of Normandy. In 1058, a fleet under Harald's son Magnus supported a large scale Welsh raid into England, although details are limited. This may have shown Harald that he could not simultaneously fight Denmark and England; this became crucial when Edward died in January 1066, and Harold Godwinson was proclaimed king of England.\nHarold's brother Tostig Godwinson, formerly Earl of Northumbria, now appeared on the scene; hoping to regain his titles and lands, he reportedly approached both William and Sweyn Estridsson for their support. However, since Northern England was the most suitable landing place for a Norwegian invasion, he was more valuable to Harald. Details are limited, but it is suggested Tostig sent a fellow exile, Copsig, to meet with Harald in Norway and agree plans, while he remained in France. If correct, this would also have allowed Tostig to increase both their chances by simultaneously supporting an invasion by William, who also claimed the throne. \nIn March or April 1066, Harald began assembling his fleet at Utv\u00e6r (in the present-day Solund Municipality), in the Sognefjord, a process completed by the start of September 1066; it included his flagship, \"Ormen\", or \"Serpent\". Before leaving Norway, he had Magnus proclaimed king of Norway, and left Tora behind, taking with him Elisiv, his daughters, and Olaf. En route, he stopped at the Norwegian-held islands of Shetland and Orkney, where he collected additional troops, including Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson, the Jarls of Orkney. At Dunfermline, he met Tostig's ally, Malcolm III of Scotland, who gave him around 2,000 Scottish soldiers.\nAlthough he possibly also met Tostig there, most sources suggest they linked up at Tynemouth, on 8 September, Harald bringing around 10\u201315,000 men, on 240\u2013300 longships. Tostig had only 12 ships, his connections being far more significant. The chronicler, John of Worcester, suggests he left Flanders in May or June, raiding the heartland of Harold's estates in southern England, from the Isle of Wight to Sandwich. Having made it seem an attack from Normandy was imminent, he then sailed north, while his brother and most of his troops remained in the south, waiting for William.\nEarly raids, invasion, and Battle of Fulford.\nAfter embarking from Tynemouth, Harald and Tostig probably landed at the River Tees. They then entered Cleveland, and started plundering the coast. They encountered the first resistance at Scarborough, where Harald's demand for surrender was opposed. In the end, Harald resorted to burning down the town, and this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him. After further raiding, Harald and Tostig sailed up the Humber and then the Ouse, disembarking at Riccall on 20 September. News of the early raids had reached the earls Morcar of Northumbria and Edwin of Mercia, and they fought against Harald's invading army south of York at the Battle of Fulford, also on 20 September. The battle was a decisive victory for Harald and Tostig, and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September. This would be the last time a Scandinavian army defeated English forces. The same day as York surrendered to Harald and Tostig, Harold Godwinson arrived with his army in Tadcaster, just from the anchored Norwegian fleet at Riccall. From there, he probably scouted the Norwegian fleet, preparing a surprise attack. As Harald had left no forces in York, Harold Godwinson marched right through the town to Stamford Bridge.\nBattle of Stamford Bridge.\nEarly on 25 September, Harald and Tostig departed their landing place at Riccall with most of their forces, but left a third of their forces behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald. Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle, later termed the Battle of Stamford Bridge, in a state of \"berserkergang\", having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.\nWhen the battle was almost over, some reserve forces from Riccall led by Eystein Orre finally appeared, but they were exhausted as they had run all the way. Eystein picked up Harald's fallen banner, the \"Landwaster\" (\"Land\u00f8y\u00f0an\"), and initiated a final counter-attack. Although they for a moment appeared to almost breach the English line, Eystein was suddenly killed, which left the rest of the men to flee from the battlefield. Among those left at Riccall after the battle, who were allowed to return home peacefully by the English forces, was Harald's son Olaf. Although sources state that Harald's remaining army only filled 20\u201325 ships on the return to Norway, it is likely that this number only accounts for the Norwegian forces. Most of the forces from Scotland and Orkney probably remained at Riccall throughout the battle (the earls Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson are certainly known to have been stationed there the entire time), and has not been counted in the traditional figure.\nHarold Godwinson's victory was short-lived, as only a few weeks later he was defeated by William the Conqueror and killed at the Battle of Hastings. The fact that Harold had to make a forced march to fight Harald Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is widely seen as a primary factor in William's victory at Hastings.\nPersonal life.\nHarald is described by Snorri Sturluson to have been physically \"larger than other men and stronger\". It is said that he had light hair, a light beard, and a long \"upper beard\" (moustache), and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than the other. He also reportedly had big hands and feet, and could measure five ells in height. It is not known whether Snorri's description of Harald's physical appearance actually represents historical facts. The tall stature of Harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson offered Tostig back the earldom of Northumbria, and Harald \"six feet of the ground of England, or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men\" (according to Henry of Huntingdon) or \"six feet of English ground, or seven feet as he was taller than other men\" (according to Snorri Sturluson).\nHarald himself composed skaldic poetry. According to Lee M. Hollander, composing poetry was normal for Norwegian kings, but Harald was the only one who \"showed a decided talent.\" His preoccupation with the poetic form may have motivated him to give privileged attention to Icelanders, and particularly Icelandic skalds. He is portrayed as a man very concerned with the way that his image will be presented and memory shaped. According to one poem, Harald had mastered a number of activities that were considered sports in the Viking Age, in addition to poetry, brewing, horse riding, swimming, skiing, shooting, rowing and playing the harp. The sagas state that Harald and his Varangians at least once took a break during the siege of a town to enjoy sports.\nReligion.\nWith regards to religion, Harald had, according to DeVries, a \"religious inclination towards Christianity\" and was \"publicly close to the Christian Church\", although he was influenced by the Eastern Christian culture of Kievan Rus' (Garderike) and the Byzantine Empire, having spent most of his life there. He was clearly interested in advancing Christianity in Norway, which can be seen by the continued building and improvement of churches throughout his reign. Despite this, DeVries notes that Harald's \"personal morality appears not to have matched the Christian ideal\", citing his marriage arrangements.\nHarald used the Raven banner, originally a symbol of Odin, who was often depicted accompanied by two ravens named Huginn and Muninn.\nIssue.\nHarald married Elisiv of Kiev (c. 1025 \u2013 after 1066) around 1044/45, and they had an unknown number, possibly several children. According to Snorri Sturluson, they had two daughters:\nAccording to the sagas, Harald married Tora Torbergsdatter (c. 1025 \u2013 after 1066) around 1048. Some modern historians have disputed this, since Harald in that case would be in a bigamous marriage, as he was still married to Elisiv. It is nonetheless possible that such a marriage could take place in Norway in the 11th century, and although Harald had two wives, only Elisiv is noted to have held the title of Queen. Harald and Tora had at least two children:\nLegacy.\nBurial.\nA year after his death at Stamford Bridge, Harald's body was moved to Norway and buried at the Mary Church in Nidaros (Trondheim). About a hundred years after his burial, his body was reinterred at the Helgeseter Priory, which was demolished in the 17th century. On 25 September 2006, the 940th anniversary of Harald's death, the newspaper \"Aftenposten\" published an article on the poor state of Norway's ancient royal burial sites, including that of Harald, which is reportedly located underneath a road built across the monastery site. In a follow-up article on 26 September, the Municipality of Trondheim revealed they would be examining the possibility of exhuming the king and reinterring him in Nidaros Cathedral, currently the burial place of nine Norwegian kings, among them Magnus the Good and Magnus Haraldsson, Harald's predecessor and successor respectively. A month later it was reported that the proposal to exhume the king had been scrapped.\nModern memorials.\nTwo monuments have been erected in honour of Harald in Oslo, the city which he is traditionally held to have founded. A bronze relief on granite by Lars Utne depicting Harald on horseback was raised on the eponymously named square \"Harald Hardr\u00e5des plass\" in 1905. In 1950, a large relief by Anne Grimdalen, also of Harald on horseback, was unveiled on the western fa\u00e7ade of the Oslo City Hall.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was owned by Allen B. DuMont Laboratories, a television equipment and television set manufacturer and broadcasting company. DuMont was founded in 1940 and began operation on August 15, 1946.\nThe network was hindered by the cost of broadcasting, a freeze on new television stations in 1948 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and even by the company's partner, Paramount Pictures. Despite its innovations in broadcasting, and launching one of television's biggest stars of the 1950s \u2014 Jackie Gleason \u2014 the network never reached solid finances. Forced to expand on UHF channels when UHF tuning was not yet standard on television sets, DuMont fought an uphill battle for program clearance outside its three owned-and-operated stations: WABD in New York City (which used its founder's initials as its call letters), WTTG in Washington, DC, and WDTV in Pittsburgh. It ultimately ended network operations on August 6, 1956, leaving three main networks other than public broadcasting until the founding of Fox in 1986.\nDuMont's obscurity, caused mainly by the destruction of its extensive program archive by the 1970s, has prompted TV historian David Weinstein to refer to it as the \"forgotten network.\" A few popular DuMont programs, such as \"Cavalcade of Stars\", \"Captain Video\", and Emmy Award winner \"Life Is Worth Living\", appear in television retrospectives or are mentioned briefly in books about American television history. In addition, a collection of programs and promos is available on the Roku streaming television channel under the DuMont name.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAllen B. DuMont Laboratories was founded with $1,000 in 1931 by Allen B. DuMont in a laboratory in his basement. He and his staff were responsible for such early technical innovations as the first consumer electronic television receiver in 1938. Their most revolutionary contribution came when the team extended the life of a cathode ray tube from 24 to 1,000 hours, making television sets practical for consumers. The company's television receivers soon became the standard of the industry. \nDuring World War II, DuMont worked with the U.S. Army in developing radar, which brought in $5 million for the company in 1942.\nEarly sales of television receivers were hampered by the lack of regularly scheduled programming. A few months after selling his first set in 1938, DuMont opened his own New York-area television station (W2XVT) in Passaic, New Jersey. In 1940, the station moved to Manhattan as W2XWV on channel 4 and commenced broadcasting on April 13, 1940. Unlike CBS and NBC, which reduced their television broadcasting during World War II, DuMont continued experimental and commercial broadcasts throughout the war. In 1944, W2XWV received its commercial license, the third in New York, under the call letters WABD. In 1945, it moved to channel 5. On May 19, 1945, DuMont opened experimental W3XWT in Washington, DC., which became commercial station WTTG.\nParamount Pictures became a minority shareholder in DuMont Laboratories when it advanced $400,000 in 1939 for a 40% share in the company. Paramount had television interests of its own, having launched stations in Los Angeles in 1939 and Chicago in 1940. DuMont's association with Paramount would later come back to haunt DuMont.\nSoon after his experimental Washington station signed on, DuMont began experimental coaxial cable hookups between his laboratories in Passaic and his two stations. It is said that one of those broadcasts on the hookup announced that the U.S. had dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. This was later considered the official beginning of the DuMont Network by both Thomas T. Goldsmith, the network's chief engineer and DuMont's best friend, and DuMont himself. Regular network service began on August 15, 1946, on WABD and W3XWT. In November 1946, W3XWT was granted a commercial license, the capital's first, as WTTG, named after Goldsmith. These two DuMont owned-and-operated stations were joined by WDTV (channel 3) in Pittsburgh on January 11, 1949.\nAlthough NBC in New York had station-to-station television links as early as 1940 with WPTZ (KYW) in Philadelphia and WRGB in Schenectady, New York, DuMont received its station licenses before NBC resumed its previously sporadic network broadcasts after the war. ABC had just come into existence as a radio network in 1943 and did not enter network television until 1948 when its flagship station in New York City, WJZ-TV (WABC-TV), began broadcasting. CBS also waited until 1948 to begin network operations, because it was waiting for the Federal Communications Commission to approve its color television system (which it eventually did not, due to its mechanical nature and incompatibility with black and white receivers). Other companies, including Mutual, the Yankee Network, and Paramount, were interested in starting television networks, but were prevented from doing so by restrictive FCC regulations, although the Paramount Television Network had limited success in network operations in the late 1940s and early 1950s.\nProgramming.\nDespite no history of radio programming, no stable of radio stars to draw on like competitors NBC, CBS, and ABC had, and perennial cash shortages, DuMont was an innovative and creative network, its programmers often using its connections with Broadway.\nThe network largely ignored the standard business model of 1950s TV, in which one advertiser sponsored an entire show, enabling it to have complete control over its content. Instead, DuMont sold commercials to several different advertisers, freeing producers of its shows from the veto power held by sole sponsors. This eventually became the standard model for U.S. television. Some commercial time was sold regionally on a co-op basis, while other spots were sold network-wide.\nDuMont also holds another important place in American TV history. WDTV's sign-on made it possible for stations in the Midwest to receive live network programming from stations on the East Coast, and vice versa. Before then, the networks relied on separate regional networks in the two time zones for live programming, and the West Coast received network programming from kinescopes (films shot directly from live television screens) originating from the East Coast. On January 11, 1949, the coaxial cable linking East and Midwest (known in television circles as \"the Golden Spike,\" in reference to the golden spike that united the First transcontinental railroad) was activated. The ceremony, hosted by DuMont and WDTV, was carried on all four networks. WGN-TV (channel 9) in Chicago and WABD in New York were able to share programs through a live coaxial cable feed when WDTV signed on in Pittsburgh, because the station completed the East Coast-to-Midwest chain, allowing stations in both regions to air the same program simultaneously, which is still the standard for American TV. It was another two years before the West Coast got live programming from the East (and the East able to get live programming from the West), but this was the beginning of the modern era of network television.\nThe first broadcasts came from DuMont's 515 Madison Avenue headquarters. The company soon found additional space, including a fully functioning theater, in the New York branch of Wanamaker's department store at Ninth Street and Broadway. Later, a lease on the Adelphi Theatre on 54th Street and the Ambassador Theatre on West 49th Street gave the network a site for variety shows. In 1954, the lavish DuMont Tele-Centre opened in the former Jacob Ruppert's Central Opera House at 205 East 67th Street, today the site of the Fox Television Center and home of WABD successor station WNYW.\nDuMont was the first network to broadcast a film production for TV: \"Talk Fast, Mister\", produced by RKO in 1944. DuMont also aired the first TV situation comedy, \"Mary Kay and Johnny\", as well as the first network-televised soap opera, \"Faraway Hill\". \n\"Cavalcade of Stars\", a variety show hosted by Jackie Gleason, was the birthplace of \"The Honeymooners\" skits (Gleason took his variety show to CBS in 1952, but filmed the \"Classic 39\" Honeymooners episodes at DuMont's Adelphi Theater studio in 1955\u201356). Roman Catholic Bishop Fulton J. Sheen's devotional program \"Life Is Worth Living\" went up against Milton Berle's variety show in many cities, becoming the first show to compete successfully in the ratings against the comedian known as \"Mr. Television.\" In 1952, Sheen won an Emmy Award for \"Most Outstanding Personality\". The network's other notable programs include:\nThe network also was a pioneer in TV programming aimed at minority audiences and featuring minority performers at a time when the other American networks aired few television series aimed at non-whites. Among DuMont's minority programs were \"The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong\", starring film actress Anna May Wong, the first American TV show to star an Asian American person; and \"The Hazel Scott Show\", starring the eponymous singer-pianist in the first American network TV series to be hosted by a black woman.\nAlthough DuMont's programming pre-dated videotape, many DuMont offerings were recorded on the https://. These kinescopes were said to be stored in a warehouse until the 1970s. Actress Edie Adams, the wife of comedian Ernie Kovacs (both regular performers on early television) testified in 1996 before a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of television and video. Adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay. Nevertheless, a number of DuMont programs survive at The Paley Center for Media in New York, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, in the Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia, and in the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago, and several surviving DuMont shows have been released on DVD. \nMuch of what survived was either never properly copyrighted (live telecasts, because they were not set on a fixed medium, were not eligible for copyright at the time, although films of those telecasts could if they contained a proper copyright notice) or lapsed into the public domain in the late 1970s when DuMont's successor-company Metromedia declined to renew the copyrights. \nA large number of episodes of \"Life Is Worth Living\" have been saved, and they are aired weekly on Catholic-oriented cable network, the Eternal Word Television Network, which also makes a collection of them available on DVD. Several companies that distribute DVDs over the internet have released a small number of episodes of \"Cavalcade of Stars\" and \"The Morey Amsterdam Show\". Two more DuMont programs, \"Captain Video and His Video Rangers\" and \"Rocky King, Inside Detective\", have had a small number of surviving episodes released commercially by at least one major distributor of public domain programming. Because so few episodes remain of most DuMont series, they are seldom rerun, even though there is no licensing cost to do so. \nAwards.\nDuMont programs were by necessity low-budget affairs, and the network received relatively few awards from the TV industry. Most awards during the 1950s went to NBC and CBS, who were able to out-spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the relatively new television medium.\nDuring the 1952\u201353 TV season, the aforementioned Bishop Sheen won an Emmy Award for \"Most Outstanding Personality\". Sheen beat out three CBS nominees -- Arthur Godfrey, Edward R. Murrow, and Lucille Ball -- for the honors. Sheen also was nominated for Public Service Emmys in 1952, 1953, and 1954.\nDuMont received an Emmy nomination for \"Down You Go\", a popular game show during the 1952\u201353 television season (in the category \"Best Audience Participation, Quiz, or Panel Program\"). The network was nominated twice for its coverage of professional football during the 1953\u201354 and 1954\u201355 television seasons.\n\"The Johns Hopkins Science Review\", a DuMont public affairs program, was awarded a Peabody Award in 1952 in the Education category. Sheen's Emmy and the \"Science Review\" Peabody were the only national awards the DuMont Network received. Though DuMont series and performers continued to win local TV awards, by the mid-1950s the DuMont network no longer had a national presence.\nRatings.\nThe earliest measurements of TV audiences were performed by the C. E. Hooper company of New York. DuMont performed well in the Hooper ratings; in fact, DuMont's talent program, \"The Original Amateur Hour\", was the most popular series of the 1947\u201348 season. Two seasons later, \"Variety\" ranked DuMont's popular variety series \"Cavalcade of Stars\" as the 10th most popular series.\nIn February 1950, Hooper's competitor A. C. Nielsen bought out the Hooper ratings system. DuMont did not fare well with the change: none of its shows appeared on Nielsen's annual top 20 lists of the most popular series. The aforementioned \"Life is Worth Living\" did receive Nielsen ratings of up to 11.1, meaning that it attracted more than 10 million viewers. Bishop Sheen's one-man program \u2013 in which he discussed philosophy, psychology, and other fields of thought from a Christian perspective \u2013 was the most widely viewed religious series in the history of television. 169 local television stations aired \"Life\", and for three years the program competed successfully against NBC's popular \"The Milton Berle Show\". The ABC and CBS programs that aired in the same timeslot were canceled.\n\"Life is Worth Living\" was not the only DuMont program to achieve double-digit ratings. In 1952, \"Time\" magazine reported that popular DuMont game show \"Down You Go\" had attracted an audience estimated at 16 million viewers. Similarly, DuMont's summer 1954 replacement series, \"The Goldbergs\", achieved audiences estimated at 10 million. Still, these series were only moderately popular compared to NBC's and CBS's highest-rated programs.\nNielsen was not the only company to report TV ratings. Companies such as Trendex, Videodex, and Arbitron had also measured TV viewership. The chart in this section comes from Videodex's August 1950 ratings breakdown, as reported in \"Billboard\" magazine.\nDisputes with AT&amp;T and Paramount.\nDuMont struggled to get its programs aired in many parts of the country, in part due to technical limitations of network lines maintained by telephone company AT&amp;T Corporation. During the 1940s and 1950s, television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links owned by AT&amp;T. The service provider did not have enough circuits to provide signal relay service from the four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time, so AT&amp;T allocated times when each network could offer live programs to its affiliates. In 1950, AT&amp;T allotted NBC and CBS each over 100 hours of live prime time network service, but gave ABC 53 hours, and DuMont 37. AT&amp;T also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines. DuMont was the only television network without a radio network, so it was the only network forced to pay for a service it did not use. DuMont protested AT&amp;T's actions with the Federal Communications Commission, and eventually reached a compromise.\nDuMont's biggest corporate hurdle may have been with the company's own partner, Paramount. Relations between the two companies were strained as early as 1939 when Paramount opened experimental television stations in Los Angeles and Chicago without DuMont's involvement. Dr. DuMont claimed that the original 1937 acquisition proposal required Paramount to expand its television interests \"through DuMont\". Paramount representative Paul Raibourn, who also was a member of DuMont's board of directors, denied that any such restriction had ever been discussed, but Dr. DuMont was vindicated by a 1953 examination of the original draft document.\nDuMont aspired to grow beyond its three stations, applying for new television station licenses in Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1947. This would have given the network five owned-and-operated stations (O&amp;Os), the maximum allowed by the FCC at the time. However, DuMont was hampered by Paramount's two stations -- KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles and WBKB (channel 4, now WBBM-TV on channel 2) in Chicago \u2013 the descendants of the two experimental stations that rankled DuMont in 1940. Although these stations generally did not carry DuMont programming (KTLA did for just one year, 1947 to 1948), and, in fact, competed against DuMont's affiliates in those cities the FCC ruled that Paramount essentially controlled DuMont, which effectively placed the network at the five-station cap. Paramount's exertion of influence over the network's management and the power of its voting stock led the FCC to its conclusion. Thus, DuMont was unable to open additional stations as long as Paramount owned stations or owned a portion of DuMont. Paramount refused to sell.\nIn 1949, Paramount Pictures launched the Paramount Television Network, a service that provided local television stations with filmed television programs. Paramount's network \"undercut the company that it had invested in.\" Paramount did not share its stars, big budgets, or filmed programs with DuMont; the company had stopped financially supporting DuMont in 1941. Although Paramount executives indicated they would produce programs for DuMont, the studio never supplied the network with programs or technical assistance. The acrimonious relationship between Paramount and DuMont climaxed during the 1953 FCC hearings regarding the ABC\u2013United Paramount Theaters merger when Paul Raibourn, an executive at Paramount, publicly derided the quality of DuMont television sets in court testimony.\nEarly troubles.\nDuMont began with one basic disadvantage: unlike NBC, CBS and ABC, it did not have a radio network from which to draw big-name talent, affiliate loyalty, or radio profits to underwrite television operations until the television medium itself became profitable. Most early television licenses were granted to established radio broadcasters, and many longtime relationships with radio networks carried over to the new medium. As CBS and NBC (and to a lesser extent, ABC) gained their footing, they began to offer programming that drew on their radio backgrounds, bringing over the most popular radio stars. Early television station owners, when deciding which network would receive their main affiliation, were more likely to choose CBS's roster of Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, and Ed Sullivan, or NBC's lineup of Milton Berle and Sid Caesar, over DuMont, which offered a then-unknown Jackie Gleason and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen. In smaller markets, with a limited number of stations, DuMont and ABC were often relegated to secondary status, so their programs got clearance only if the primary network was off the air or delayed via kinescope recording (\"tele-transcriptions,\" in DuMont parlance).\nAdding to DuMont's troubles was the FCC's 1948 \"freeze\" on television license applications. This was done to sort out the thousands of applications that had come streaming in, but also to rethink the allocation and technical standards laid down prior to World War II. It became clear soon after the war that 12 channels (\"channel 1\" had been removed from television broadcasting in 1948 for allocation to land-mobile radio) were not nearly enough for national television service. What was to be a six-month freeze lasted until 1952, when the FCC opened the UHF spectrum. The FCC, however, did not require television manufacturers to include UHF capability. To see UHF stations, most consumers had to buy expensive converters. Even then, the picture quality was marginal at best, depending on geographic location. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Tied to this was a decision to restrict VHF allocations in medium- and smaller-sized markets. Meanwhile, television sets would not be \"required\" to have all-channel tuning until 1964, with the passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act.\nForced to rely on UHF to expand, DuMont saw one station after another go dark due to dismal ratings. It bought small, distressed UHF station KCTY (channel 25) in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1954, but ran it for just three months before shutting it down at a considerable loss after attempting to compete with three established VHF stations.\nThe FCC's Hyman H. Goldin said in 1960, \"If there had been four VHF outlets in the top markets, there's no question DuMont would have lived and would have eventually turned the corner in terms of profitability.\"\nDecline and the end of the network.\nDuring the early years of television, there was some measure of cooperation among the four major U.S. networks. However, as television grew into a profitable business, an intense rivalry developed among the networks, just as it had in radio. NBC and CBS competed fiercely for viewers and advertising dollars, a contest neither underfunded DuMont nor ABC could hope to win. According to author Dennis Mazzocco, \"NBC tried to make an arrangement with ABC and CBS to destroy the DuMont network.\" The plan was for NBC and CBS to exclusively offer ABC their most popular series after they had aired on the bigger networks. ABC would become a network of re-runs, but DuMont would be shut out. ABC president Leonard Goldenson rejected NBC executive David Sarnoff's proposal, but did not report it to the Justice Department.\nDuMont survived the early 1950s only because of WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone commercial VHF station in what then was the sixth-largest market in the country after New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations WENS-TV (on the frequency now occupied by WINP-TV) and WKJF-TV (now WPGH-TV) and distant stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Youngstown, Ohio, and Wheeling, West Virginia. There also were external factors such as the FCC's freeze on licenses and intense competition for the remaining VHF licenses in Pittsburgh, including WENS-TV appealing the FCC's granting of the channel 11 license that was eventually affirmed for WIIC-TV (now WPXI), the battle between the Hearst Corporation (then-owners of WCAE) and KQV over the channel 4 license that eventually would become WTAE-TV, and -- perhaps the most impactful one to DuMont's future -- locally based Westinghouse Electric Corporation (owners of radio pioneer KDKA) battling with local interest groups for the channel 13 license that was intended to be a non-commercial license. The FCC also denied CBS's request to be granted the channel 9 allocation in nearby Steubenville, Ohio, and move it to Pittsburgh so Steubenville had a chance to have its own television station. As a result, no other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until WIIC-TV in 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a bargaining chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets.\nDespite its severe financial straits, by 1953 DuMont appeared to be on its way to establishing itself as the third national network. despite a smaller footprint than ABC. While DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, the network could count on only seven primary stations \u2013 its three owned-and-operated stations (\"O&amp;Os) plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) in Denver, and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio.\nIn contrast, by 1953 ABC had a full complement of five O&amp;Os, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network descended from NBC's Blue Network from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty, and generate income to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (UPT) (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off as a result of the \"United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.\" antitrust decision), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger.\nBy this time, DuMont had begun to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS. It allowed its advertisers to choose the locations where their advertising ran, potentially saving them millions of dollars. By contrast, ABC followed NBC's and CBS's practice of forcing advertisers to purchase a large \"must-buy\" list of stations, even though it was only a fourth the size of NBC and CBS.\nABC's fortunes were dramatically altered in February 1953, when the FCC cleared the way for UPT to buy the network. The merger provided ABC with a badly needed cash infusion, giving it the resources to mount \"top shelf\" programming and to provide a national television service on a scale approaching that of CBS and NBC. Through UPT president Leonard Goldenson, ABC also gained ties with the Hollywood studios that more than matched those DuMont's producers had with Broadway.\nRealizing that ABC had more resources than they could even begin to match, DuMont officials were receptive to a merger offer from ABC. Goldenson quickly brokered a deal with Ted Bergmann, DuMont's managing director, under which the merged network would have been called \"ABC-DuMont\" until at least 1958 and would have honored all of DuMont's network commitments. In return, DuMont would get $5 million in cash, guaranteed advertising time for DuMont sets, and a secure future for its staff. \nA merged ABC-DuMont would have been an entity rivaling CBS and NBC, as it would have owned stations in five of the six largest U.S. television markets (excluding only Philadelphia) as well as ABC's radio network. It also would have inherited DuMont's de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh and would have been one of two networks, along with NBC, to have full ownership of a station in the nation's capital. However, it would have had to sell a New York station \u2013 either DuMont's WABD or ABC's flagship WJZ-TV (channel 7, now WABC-TV), probably the former. It also would have had to sell two other stations \u2013 most likely ABC's two smallest O&amp;Os, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and KGO-TV in San Francisco (both broadcasting on channel 7) \u2013 to get under the FCC's limit of five stations per owner.\nHowever, Paramount vetoed the plan almost out of hand due to antitrust concerns. A few months earlier, the FCC had ruled that Paramount controlled DuMont, and there still were some questions about whether UPT had really separated from Paramount.\nWith no other way to readily obtain cash, DuMont sold WDTV to Westinghouse for $9.75 million in late 1954, after Westinghouse decided to give public backing to the public interest groups for the channel 13 allocation in Pittsburgh, allowing the station to launch that spring as educational WQED. While this gave DuMont a short-term cash infusion, it eliminated the leverage the network had to get program clearances in other markets. Without its de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, the company's advertising revenue shrank to less than half that of 1953. By February 1955, DuMont realized it could not continue as a television network. The decision was made to shut down network operations and operate WABD and WTTG as independent stations.\nOn April 1, 1955, most of DuMont's entertainment programs were dropped. Bishop Sheen aired his last program on DuMont on April 26 but later moved it to ABC. By May, just eight programs were left on the network, with only inexpensive shows and sporting events keeping the remains of the network going through the summer. The network also largely abandoned the use of the intercity network coaxial cable, on which it had spent $3 million in 1954 to transmit shows that mostly lacked station clearance. The company only retained network links for live sports programming and utilizing the company's Electronicam process to produce studio-based programming. Electronicam is best remembered for being used by Jackie Gleason's producers for the 39-half-hour episodes of \"The Honeymooners\" that aired on CBS during the 1955\u201356 television season.\nIn August 1955, Paramount, with the help of other stockholders, seized full control of DuMont Laboratories. Shareholders approved a split of the manufacturing and broadcasting operations of the company in August 1955, and the sponsored shows on the network were discontinued. The last non-sports program on DuMont, the game show \"What's the Story\", aired on September 23, 1955. After that, DuMont's network feed was used only for occasional sporting events. The last broadcast on what was left of the DuMont Television Network, a boxing match, aired on August 6, 1956. (The date has also been reported as September 1955, November 1957 or August 4, 1958, with the last broadcast of \"Monday Night Fights\".) According to one source, the final program aired on only five stations nationwide. It appears that the boxing show was syndicated to a few other east coast stations until 1958, but likely not as a production of DuMont or its successor company. Likewise, the remains of DuMont were used to syndicate a high school football Thanksgiving game in 1957; that telecast, the only DuMont broadcast to have been sent in color, was a personal project of Allen DuMont himself, whose hometown team in Montclair, New Jersey, was contending in the game for a state championship.\nDuMont spun off WABD and WTTG as the DuMont Broadcasting Corporation; in requesting the FCC's approval of the reorganization, it told the commission that the network \"could not be operated profitably under the existing system of allocation and control of television broadcast stations and affiliations\". The name was later changed to \"Metropolitan Broadcasting Company\" to distance the company from what was seen as a complete failure. In 1958, John Kluge bought Paramount's shares for $4 million, and in 1961 renamed the company Metromedia. WABD became WNEW-TV and later WNYW. WTTG still broadcasts under its original call letters as a Fox affiliate.\nFor 50 years, DuMont was the only major broadcast television network to cease operations, until CBS Corporation and Time Warner merged two other struggling networks, UPN and The WB, in September 2006, to create The CW Television Network.\nFailed revival of the DuMont brand.\nOn February 22, 2018, Lightning One, Inc., owned by Smashing Pumpkins lead singer Billy Corgan, filed a U.S. trademark application for \"The Dumont Network.\" The application by Lightning One was very likely associated with its ownership of the \"National Wrestling Alliance\" trademark, the moniker of one of the oldest wrestling promotions in the United States. However, according to the registration filing, the trademark for \"The Dumont Network\" as owned by Lightning One was allowed to lapse on July 2, 2020, rendering the trademark dead.\nFate of the DuMont stations.\nAll three DuMont-owned stations still are operating and are owned-and-operated stations (O&amp;O's) of their respective networks, just as when they were part of DuMont. Of the three, only Washington's WTTG still has its original call letters.\nWTTG and New York's WABD (later WNEW-TV, and now WNYW) survived as Metromedia-owned independents until 1986, when they were purchased by the News Corporation to form the nucleus of the new Fox television network. Clarke Ingram, who maintained a DuMont memorial site, has suggested that Fox can be considered a revival, or at least a linear descendant, of DuMont.\nWestinghouse changed WDTV's call letters to KDKA-TV after the pioneering radio station of the same name, and switched its primary affiliation to CBS immediately after the sale. Westinghouse's acquisition of CBS in 1995 made KDKA-TV a CBS owned-and-operated station.\nTwo of the four primary DuMont affiliates would also eventually join Fox. KTTV would be purchased by DuMont descendant Metromedia in 1963 and ended up being one of the charter Fox O&amp;O's alongside WNYW and WTTG. WSYX (the former WTVN-TV), which became a primary ABC affiliate upon DuMont's collapse after serving as a dual affiliate of both networks, added Fox programming to its third digital subchannel in 2021 when present day owners Sinclair Broadcast Group consolidated the intellectual property of LMA sister station WTTE (including its \"Fox 28\" branding) onto WSYX as part of fellow LMA sister station WWHO's conversation to ATSC 3.0. WGN-TV and KWGN-TV (the former KFEL-TV) are both currently owned by Nexstar Media Group as O&amp;O's of The CW.\nDuMont programming library.\nDuMont produced more than 20,000 television episodes from 1946 to 1956. Because they were created prior to the Ampex electronic videotape recorder in late 1956, they were broadcast live in black and white and recorded on film kinescope for West Coast rebroadcast and reruns. By the early 1970s, their vast library of 35mm and 16mm kinescopes wound up in the hands of \"a successor network\" (most likely Metromedia) that reportedly disposed of them in New York City's East River to make warehouse space for videotapes.\nAlthough some films submerged for decades have been successfully recovered (see \"The Carpet from Bagdad\" for example), there have been no salvage-diving efforts to locate or recover the DuMont archive. If it survived in that environment, the films have likely been damaged. Other kinescopes were put through a reclaiming process to recover the silver from the photo emulsion on black-and-white film.\nIt is estimated that about 350 complete DuMont television shows survive, including seven early Jackie Gleason's \"Honeymooners\" comedy sketches from 1951\u20131952. Most of the existing episodes are believed to have come from the personal archives of DuMont's hosts, such as Gleason and Dennis James.\nAffiliates.\nAt its peak in 1954, DuMont was affiliated with around 200 television stations. In those days, television stations were free to \"cherry-pick\" which programs they would air, and many stations affiliated with multiple networks, depending mainly on the number of commercial television stations available in a market at a given time (markets where only one commercial station was available carried programming from all four major networks). Many of DuMont's \"affiliates\" carried very little DuMont programming, choosing to air one or two more popular programs (such as \"Life Is Worth Living\") and/or sports programming on the weekends. Few stations carried the full DuMont program lineup. For example, the promising WKLO-TV (UHF Ch. 21) in the growing Louisville, Kentucky/Indiana market had to split its time between DuMont and ABC-TV. The station lasted only seven months (September 1953 \u2013 April 1954) on the air.\nIn its later years, DuMont was carried mostly on poorly watched UHF channels or had only secondary affiliations on VHF stations. DuMont ended most operations on April 1, 1955, but honored network commitments until August 1956.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The use of FM radio has been associated with higher sound quality in music radio.\nHistory of FM radio in the U.S..\nIn the United States, FM broadcasting stations currently are assigned to 101 channels, designated 87.9 to 107.9\u00a0MHz, within a 20.2\u00a0MHz-wide frequency band, spanning 87.8\u2013108.0\u00a0MHz.\nIn the 1930s investigations were begun into establishing radio stations transmitting on \"Very High Frequency\" (VHF) assignments above 30\u00a0MHz. In October 1937, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced new frequency allocations, which included a band of experimental and educational \"Apex\" stations, that consisted of 75 channels spanning from 41.02 to 43.98\u00a0MHz. Like the existing AM band these stations employed amplitude modulation, however the 40\u00a0kHz spacing between adjacent frequencies was four times as much as the 10\u00a0kHz spacing on the standard AM broadcast band, which reduced adjacent-frequency interference, and provided more bandwidth for high-fidelity programming.\nAlso during the 1930s a competing transmission technology, \"wide-band frequency modulation\", was developed in the United States by Edwin Howard Armstrong, which was promoted as being superior to AM transmissions, in particular due to its high-fidelity and near immunity to static interference. On June 17, 1936 Armstrong formally demonstrated his FM system to the FCC. That year he also set up the first FM radio station, W2XMN in Alpine, New Jersey, to function as a demonstration station. In 1937 the Yankee Network, looking to eventually establish commercial FM operations, was granted a construction permit for an experimental station, W1XOJ, in Paxton, Massachusetts. The first publicized W2XMN broadcast took place on July 18, 1939, which used a high-quality phone line link to rebroadcast a program from WQXR in New York City. On July 24, 1939, W1XOJ inaugurated a regular schedule of 16 hours a day (8 a.m. to midnight). On January 5, 1940, Armstrong, working with the Yankee Network, demonstrated FM broadcasting in a long-distance relay network, via five stations in five states.\nIn May 1940, largely as the result of Armstrong's efforts, the FCC decided to eliminate the Apex band, and authorized an FM band effective January 1, 1941, operating on 40 channels spanning 42\u201350\u00a0MHz. On October 31, 1940, the first 15 commercial station Construction Permit authorizations were issued. On March 1, 1941 W47NV began broadcasting in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming the first fully licensed commercial FM station. There was significant interest in the new FM band by station owners, however, construction restrictions that went into place during World War II limited the growth of the new service.\nFollowing the end of the war, the FCC moved to standardize its frequency allocations. One area of concern was the effects of tropospheric and Sporadic E propagation, which at times reflected station signals over great distances, causing mutual interference. A particularly controversial proposal, spearheaded by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which was headed by David Sarnoff, was that the FM band needed to be shifted to higher frequencies in order to avoid this potential problem. Armstrong charged that this reassignment had the covert goal of disrupting FM radio development, however RCA's proposal prevailed, and on June 27, 1945 the FCC announced the reassignment of the FM band to 80 channels from 88\u2013106\u00a0MHz (which was soon expanded to 100 channels from 88\u2013108\u00a0MHz), while allocating the former FM band frequencies to \"non-government fixed and mobile\" (42\u201344\u00a0MHz), and television channel 1 (44\u201350\u00a0MHz), controversially ignoring the effect of tropospheric and Sporadic E propagation on those services. \nA period of allowing existing FM stations to broadcast on both the original \"low\" and new \"high\" FM bands followed, though as late as 1947, in Detroit, there were only 3,000 FM receivers in use for the new band, and 21,000 for the old band. The dual band transition period ended at midnight on January 8, 1949, at which time all low band transmissions had to end, making obsolete 395,000 receivers already purchased by the public for the original band. Although converters were manufactured allowing low band FM sets to receive high band transmissions, they were complicated to install and often as (or more) expensive than buying a new high band set. The greater expense was the cost for the radio stations converting to the new FM radio band. The FM radio industry did not recover significantly from the setback until the upsurge in high fidelity equipment in the late 1950s.\nIn the early 1960s, FM began to benefit from increased investment, as broadcasters looked to it to expand their markets; television had been built out by this point, and the shift to music as the dominant format of AM in the wake of television and the rise of rock 'n' roll had led to an AM band so crowded that the FCC was limiting many stations to daytime-only operation, a restriction to which FM was not subject. The FCC gave FM two boosts in the early 1960s: first by setting a technical standard for stereo broadcasts, and second by adopting the FM Non-Duplication Rule in 1964, prohibiting broadcasters with an AM and FM license in cities of more than 100,000 from transmitting more than 50% of the same programming on both stations.\nBy the end of the 1970s, 50.1% of radio listeners were listening to FM stations, ending AM's historical lead. By 1982, FM commanded 70% of the general audience, and 84% among the 12- to 24-year-old demographic. The shift in popularity of FM radio over AM in United States during the 1970s has been called by record producer Steve Greenberg \"a seismic technological shift that had torn apart the very idea of the mass audience upon which pop hits depended\". (AM radio would adapt by shifting its focus to talk radio, which would be deregulated in the late 1980s after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine.)\nFM radio channel assignments in the U.S..\nIn the United States, FM broadcasting stations operate on a 20.2\u00a0MHz-wide frequency band, spanning from 87.8\u00a0MHz to 108\u00a0MHz. This is divided into 101 0.2\u00a0MHz-wide channels, which are designated as channels 200 through 300. In actual practice, few except the FCC use these channel numbers; the frequencies are used instead. (A limited number of low power TV stations have been authorized for a supplemental FM broadcast on 87.7\u00a0MHz.)\nTo receive a station, an FM receiver is tuned to the center frequency of the station's channel. The lowest and almost-unused channel, channel 200, extends from 87.8\u00a0MHz to 88.0\u00a0MHz; thus its center frequency is 87.9\u00a0MHz. Channel 201 has a center frequency of 88.1\u00a0MHz, and so on, up to channel 300, which extends from 107.8 to 108.0\u00a0MHz and has a center frequency of 107.9\u00a0MHz.\nBecause each channel is 0.2\u00a0MHz wide, the center frequencies of adjacent channels differ by 0.2\u00a0MHz. Because the lowest channel is centered on 87.9\u00a0MHz, the tenths digit (in MHz) of the center frequency of any FM station in the United States is always an odd number. FM audio for analog television channel 6 is broadcast at a carrier frequency of 87.75\u00a0MHz, and many radios can tune this low; full-power stations ceased analog operations in 2009 under FCC orders, but a very small amount of low-power stations are still operated solely for their right to use this frequency for broadcasting an FM audio carrier signal along with an ATSC 3.0 digital signal broadcasting programming. For the same reason, assignment restrictions between TV stations on channel 6 and nearby FM stations are stringent: there is only one station in the United States (CSN International translator K200AA in Sun Valley, Nevada) licensed to operate on 87.9\u00a0MHz, because it was forced off of another channel. Therefore, in effect, the FM broadcast band comprises only FM channels 201 (88.1\u00a0MHz) through 300 (107.9\u00a0MHz).\nOriginally, FM stations in a market were generally spaced four channels (800\u00a0kHz) apart. This spacing was developed in response to problems perceived on the original FM band, mostly due to deficiencies in receiver technology of the time. With modern equipment, this is widely understood to be unnecessary, and in many countries shorter spacings are used. (See FM broadcast band.) Other spacing restrictions relate to mixing products with nearby television, air-traffic control, and two-way radio systems as well as other FM broadcast stations. The most significant such taboo restricts the allocation of stations 10.6 and 10.8\u00a0MHz apart, to protect against mixing products which will interfere with an FM receiver's standard 10.7\u00a0MHz intermediate frequency stage.\nCommercial broadcasting is licensed only on channels 221 through 300 (the upper 80 channels, frequencies between 92.1 and 107.9\u00a0MHz), with 200 through 220 (the lower 21 channels, frequencies between 87.9 and 91.9\u00a0MHz) reserved for non-commercial educational (NCE) broadcasting. In some \"Twin city\" markets close to the Canada\u2013United States or Mexico\u2013United States border, such as Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario, or San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Baja California, commercial stations operating from those countries target U.S. audiences on \"reserved band\" channels, as neither Canada nor Mexico has such a reservation. Because of this necessary sharing, the FCC reserves a few other channels for such NCE stations.\nFM stations in the U.S. are now assigned based on a table of separation distance values from currently licensed stations, based on station \"class\" (power output, antenna height, and geographical location). These regulations (see Docket 80-90) have resulted in approximately double the number of possible stations, and increases in allowable power levels, over the original bandplan scheme described above. All powers are specified as effective radiated power (ERP), which takes into account the magnifying effect (gain) of certain antenna types.\nThe U.S. is divided into Zone I (roughly the northeastern quarter of the U.S. mainland, excluding the far northern areas), Zone I-A (California south of 40 degrees latitude, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico), and Zone II (all other locations). The highest-power stations are class C in zone II, and class B in the others. There are no B stations in zone II, nor any C stations in the others. (See the list of broadcast station classes.) Canada is also divided in this manner, based on the most highly populated regions.\nHigh power is useful in penetrating buildings, diffracting around hills, and refracting for some distance beyond the horizon. 100,000-watt FM stations can regularly be heard up to 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away, and farther (e.g., 150 miles, 240\u00a0km) if there are no competing signals.\nA few old \"grandfathered\" stations do not conform to these power rules. WBCT (93.7) in Grand Rapids, Michigan, runs 320,000 watts ERP, and can increase to 500,000 watts ERP by the terms of its original license. This huge power level does not usually help to increase range as much as one might expect, because VHF frequencies travel in nearly straight lines over the horizon and off into space. Nevertheless, when there were fewer FM stations competing, this station could be heard near Bloomington, Illinois, almost distant.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nRelated websites"}

{"id": "66064", "revid": "34452882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66064", "title": "American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers", "text": "Non-profit performance-rights organization\nThe American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) () is an American not-for-profit performance-rights organization (PRO) that collectively licenses the public performance rights of its members' musical works to venues, broadcasters, and digital streaming services (music stores).\nASCAP collects licensing fees from users of music created by ASCAP members, then distributes them back to its members as royalties. In effect, the arrangement is the product of a compromise: when a song is played, the user does not have to pay the copyright holder directly, nor does the music creator have to bill a radio station for use of a song.\nIn 2024, ASCAP collected approximately US$1.84 billion in revenue, distributed approximately US$1.7 billion in royalties to rightsholders, and maintained a registry of approximately 20 million works. The organization had approximately 1 million members as of 2024.\nASCAP has drawn negative attention for attempting to enforce licensing fees when songs are used in informal occasions such as campfire singing and open mic nights. It has also been criticized for its high lack of transparency in its operations, and for retaining some royalties brought in from its membership rather than paying them out to the artists.\nHistory.\nASCAP was founded on February 13, 1914, by Victor Herbert, together with composers George Botsford, Silvio Hein, Irving Berlin, Louis Hirsch, John Raymond Hubbell, Gustave Kerker, and Jean Schwartz; lyricist Glen MacDonough; publishers George Maxwell (who served as its first president) and Jay Witmark and copyright attorney Nathan Burkan in New York City, to protect the copyrighted musical compositions of its members, who were mostly writers and publishers associated with Tin Pan Alley. ASCAP's earliest members included the era's most active songwriters, George M. Cohan, Rudolf Friml, Otto Harbach, Jerome Kern, John Philip Sousa, Alfred Baldwin Sloane, James Weldon Johnson, Robert Hood Bowers and Harry Tierney. Subsequently, many other prominent songwriters became members. Composers who could not read and write musical notation were ineligible for membership. This requirement, since dropped, excluded many songwriters in such genres as country. However, an exception was made to admit Irving Berlin.\nIn 1917, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of ASCAP in \"Herbert v. Shanley Co.\" The lawsuit, brought by Herbert, contended that the owner of Shanley's Restaurant in New York City had infringed on Herbert's copyright of \"Sweethearts\" by playing music from the play in the restaurant without permission or compensation for Herbert. Shanley argued that because there was no entrance fee for the restaurant performing the music, the performance was not making a profit and therefore did not require compensation for Herbert. The unanimous decision on the lawsuit, written by associate justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., held that any performance of music for profit, including profits tangentially related to the performance, such as the sale of food and drink, required compensation for the original creators of the music. The decision legitimized ASCAP's continued existence and allowed the organization to more proactively seek compensation for its members.\nIn 1919, ASCAP and the Performing Rights Society of Great Britain (since 1997 known as PRS for Music), signed the first reciprocal agreement for the representation of each other's members' works in their respective territories. Today, ASCAP has global reciprocal agreements and licenses the U.S. performances of hundreds of thousands of international music creators.\nAdvent of radio.\nThe advent of radio in the 1920s brought an important new source of income for ASCAP. The organization initially offered low licensing fees to foster a partnership between the fledgling medium and ASCAP; however, the licensing fees increased 900 percent between 1931 and 1939. ASCAP said the increases were due to radio curtailing the ability of its members to make money through other venues, such as sheet music and record sales, and decreasing how long hit songs remained hits.\nIn 1940, when ASCAP tried to triple its license fees, radio broadcasters prepared to resist their demands by enforcing a boycott of ASCAP, and inaugurating a competing royalty agency, Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI). During a ten-month period lasting from January 1 to October 29, 1941, no music licensed by ASCAP (1,250,000 songs) was broadcast on NBC and CBS radio stations. Instead, the stations played regional music and styles (like rhythm and blues or country) that had been rejected by ASCAP. Upon the conclusion of litigation between broadcasters and ASCAP in October 1941, ASCAP settled for a lower fee than they had initially demanded.\nIn 1941, an antitrust lawsuit brought by the United States Department of Justice resulted in ASCAP and BMI being governed under consent decrees that required both organizations to offer blanket licenses of their catalogs to all at rates negotiated between the parties or set by a federal judge.\nMembership expands.\nASCAP's membership diversified further in the 1940s, bringing along jazz and swing greats. In the 1940s, it was common for ASCAP and BMI to send out field representatives to sign new songwriters and music publishing companies, as the firms were not household names; one such ASCAP employee was Loring Buzzell, who later formed the music publishing company Hecht-Lancaster &amp; Buzzell Music.\nDifferences in BMI's structure, including providing advance payments on songs, and an early embrace of country, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll led to an increase in the organization's market share in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1953, ASCAP filed an antitrust lawsuit against BMI, and instigated a congressional investigation of BMI in 1956. ASCAP lobbied Congress for laws that would bar broadcasters from owning BMI stock in 1958, and provided the impetus to launch payola investigations at the end of the decade. ASCAP and BMI settled an antitrust lawsuit in 1962.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, television was introduced as a new revenue stream for ASCAP, one that maintains its importance today. With the birth of FM radio, new ASCAP members came on board. During this period, ASCAP also initiated a series of lawsuits to recover the position they lost during the boycott of 1941, without success.\nThe early 1960s folk music revival, led by ASCAP member Bob Dylan (later switched to SESAC) made ASCAP a major player in that genre. Dylan's expansion into rock music later that decade gave ASCAP a foothold in that genre. At the same time, ASCAP member Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. started having country hits for ASCAP.\nBy 1970, a new generation of ASCAP board members decided to launch a campaign to attract more songwriters and music publishers away from BMI. The campaign led to Motown Records switching most of its music publishing from BMI to ASCAP in 1971.\nIn June 2009, ASCAP sued AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless in a case that generated considerable public attention over the sale of musical ringtones in an effort to get additional revenue from the sale of ringtones. The organization said that ringtones played in public constituted a performance of a copyrighted work, which required additional payment. Critics worried ASCAP might seek to hold consumers responsible for a ringtone public performance, which ASCAP said it would not do. AT&amp;T, Verizon, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) disagreed with ASCAP's claims, with the EFF filing an \"amicus curiae\" brief with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, contending that ringtones playing in public were no different than consumers listening to a car radio with the windows down and did not constitute a performance. The Court dismissed the suit in October 2009, with judge Denise Cote noting that the suit did not demonstrate ringtones playing in public spaces constituted copyright infringement.\nASCAP licenses over 11,500 local commercial radio stations, more than 2500 non-commercial radio broadcasters and hundreds of thousands of \"general\" licensees (bars, restaurants, theme parks, etc.). It maintains reciprocal relationships with nearly 40 foreign PROs across six continents, and licenses billions of public performances worldwide each year.\nCriticism.\nIn 1995, ASCAP requested royalty payments from the American Camp Association for public performances at its camps. Following public backlash, ASCAP said it only meant to \"demand a fee for performances by professional musicians at large resorts\", and returned the fees paid. However, it has drawn negative attention for cracking down on licensing fees on other occasions as well, such as when it demanded that open mic events need to pay licensing (even if most or all of the songs are original).\nASCAP has also been criticized for its extremely non-transparent operations, including the refusal to release attendance records for board members, the notes from board meetings, and the reasoning behind their weighting formulas which determine how much money a song or composition earns for use on television or radio.\nIn response to its 2009 lawsuit, critics worried that ASCAP may seek to hold consumers responsible for a ringtone public performance.\nFurther controversies arose involving ASCAP in 2009 and 2010. The organization requested that some websites pay licensing fees on embedded YouTube videos, even though YouTube already pays licensing fees, and demanded payment from Amazon.com and iTunes for 30-second streaming previews of music tracks, which traditionally does not require a license, being considered a promotional vehicle for song sales.\nIn June 2010, ASCAP sent letters to its members soliciting donations to fight entities that support weaker copyright restrictions, such as Public Knowledge, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Creative Commons, creating notable controversy as many argued that these licenses are a form of copyright and offer the artist an extra choice. Lawrence Lessig, a co-founder of Creative Commons, responded stating that they are not aiming to undermine copyright, and invited ASCAP for a public debate. The offer was turned down by ASCAP's Paul Williams.\nIt was reported in April 2020, that songwriters and composers were facing delays in receiving royalties. This was delivered via a memo to hundreds of thousands of members from CEO Elizabeth Matthews, who said the global disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic was to blame. This raised contention as those critical of the announcement wondered why the pandemic at that time would affect payments related to the third quarter of 2019. Further, it was revealed that publishers were still being paid royalties on time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 1926 to 1945, he was \"de jure\" emperor of Annam and Tonkin, which were then protectorates in French Indochina, covering the present-day central and northern Vietnam. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i ascended the throne in 1932.\nThe Japanese ousted the Vichy French administration in March 1945 and ruled through B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, who proclaimed the Empire of Vietnam. He abdicated in August 1945 after Japan surrendered.\nFrom 1949 to 1955, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was the chief of state of the anti-communist State of Vietnam. Viewed as a puppet ruler, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was criticized for being too closely associated with France and spending much of his time outside Vietnam. He was eventually ousted in a referendum in 1955 by Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, who was supported by the United States.\nEarly life.\nOn April 28, 1922, when he was 9 years old, he was established as Crown Prince. On June 15, 1922, he and Khai Dinh went to France to participate in a goods exhibition in Marseille. This was the first time he had gone to a country in Western Europe.\nB\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was born as Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y (\u962e\u798f\u6c38\u745e) on 22 October 1913 with the childhood name M\u1ec7 V\u1eefng and the only child of emperor Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh and his concubine Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb C\u00fac. However; there are still many questions about B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's background. According to historical records, Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh was said to be prefer to homosexual and dislike to get closed to women. At that time, Vietnam had been ruling by the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty since 1802. Then, the French colonial government completely conquered the country in 1883 and split Vietnam into three areas: the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin and the colony of Cochinchina, then be the part of Federation of Indochina. The Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty was given nominal rule of Annam and Tonkin.\nOn April 28, 1922, at the age of 9, he was investitured as Crown Prince of East Palace (\u0110\u00f4ng Cung Ho\u00e0ng Th\u00e1i T\u1eed, \u6771\u5bae\u7687\u592a\u5b50). On June 15, 1922, he and his father led the delegation to France to participate in a colonial exhibition (Exposition nationale coloniale) in Marseille. This was the first time he went to an oversea trip in Western Europe.\nEducation in France.\nIn June 1922, prince V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y was adopted by the former governor of Resident-Superior of Annam, Jean Fran\u00e7ois Eug\u00e8ne Charles and his wife, then they sent him to France to study at the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet. In February 1924, he returned to Vietnam to attend the 40th birthday anniversary of his father, then returned to France to continue his studying at Hattemer School in November. He was the first Vietnamese monarch received full western education that would shape his vision about his reign in the future.\nAscending throne.\nOn November 6, 1925, Emperor Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh died and prince Vinh Thuy returned to Vietnam to attend the funeral. On 8 January 1926, Vinh Thuy took the enthronement ceremony and became the 13th emperor of Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty at 12 years old and took the era name \"B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i\" (\"Protector of Grandeur\" or \"Keeper of Greatness\"). He did not yet rule the country directly but through his appointed regent \" T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t H\u00e2n\" while returning to France to continue his study in March of the same year.\nReturn to France.\nThe imperial court also sent a Confucian scholar to France to teach the emperor Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n and Vietnamese etiquette, but French teachers later barred him from doing his duty. After returning to Vietnam to rule, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i himself admitted that \"he almost knew nothing about the history of his dynasty and country even the colonial rule events.\"\nAt France, his adoptive father \"Jean Fran\u00e7ois Eug\u00e8ne Charles\" (former governor of Annam) who was responsible for the emperor's education. When Bao Dai travelled to study in France, emperor Khai Dinh entrusted Charles to look after his son. Every day at noon and after school, Bao Dai went to Charles's house at the Rue des Bourdonnais and was not allowed to go anywhere until the evening. Beside of managing B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's studies at school, Charles he also took Bao Dai on vacation in Vichy or at his private residence in Prades during the summer. Charles likely considered Bao Dai as the part of his family and monitor schedule of Bao Dai strictly to train him to become the future ruler. After morning classes, he had to spent time on doing homework very diligently with the other fellow countrymen.\nIn 1930, Bao Dai started to study at Sciences Po in Paris and lived in his private home at Rue 13 Lamballe Street. According to the newspaper L'Asie Nouvelle (New Asia), Bao Dai developed interesting in sports such as tennis, golf and skiing. To the conservative Vietnamese monarchy, this was the new revolution in the imperial family where the former emperors did not participate in any activities of commoners. The newspaper described him feel more comfortable and suitable with western lifestyle and entertainments in Paris like clubbing and partying rather than political activities or ruling his own country.\nThe young man enjoyed this way of life and it was uneasy to change and adapt with the conservative Vietnamese lifestyle after returning home. In 1932, although there was a proclamation of returning of the Emperor to his country posted at Meridian Gate with millions of Vietnamese people looked forward to it, he was still hesitant because it seemed that he had not yet made up his mind to return to his country.\nLuxury life.\nAccording to historical records, young B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was described as the playboy and the car enthusiast. He also owned many types of cars at the age of 16. The young man had some high-speed cars to drive on the streets of Paris city and on the highway from Cannes to Deauville. He himself was a good and fast driver, comfortable and calm when accelerating, understanding clearly engine's features to impress the others.\nThe French colonial government was also aware of Bao Dai 's lack of the responsibility as the emperor and lack of enthusiasm for returning to Vietnam. Eug\u00e8ne Chatel, secretary of the Governor-General wrote: \"I wonder if the emperor was always trying to delay his return to his country, but through some people close to him, they felt that he was not very eager or hurry to return to rule.\"\nThe archives of the French Governor-General showed that the Hue imperial court and mandarins was extremely impatient with the absence of the emperor, urging The French colonial government to encourage him to come back to rule. The secretary-general of the Governor-General of Indochina, Eug\u00e8ne Chatel, became increasingly frustrated with Bao Dai's hesitation. Chatel wrote many reports to the Ministry of Colonies to call for the need of magnificent ceremony, demanding more money and easier conditions. The future of the dynasty depended on the emperor's return.\nReturn to Vietnam and assassination plot.\nIn September 1932, Bao Dai began his long journey to return to Vietnam on the ship named \"Pr\u00e9sident Doumer\" with farewell ceremony by Minister of Colonies Albert Sarraut who represented the colonial government in Marseille. All of places where the ship docked on the journey would organise grand receptions except in Penang, Malaysia (Straits Settlements) because French secret service received news about the assassination plot. At this time, the Colonial Committee of the French Communist Party met in secret at 120 rue Chateaudun. Eight people were present including one European and seven Vietnamese that planned to assassinate the emperor before his return. This plot was taken at places in Paris and Marseilse, but it was unsuccessful.\nThey tried to conduct terrorist assassination the third time in the Malay Peninsula, but it was discovered. On that day, the ship had to secretly anchor far from the reception venue, but the perpetrator did not show up. The ship continued to sail into Vietnamese territorial water, anchored at Cape Saint-Jacques (now V\u0169ng T\u00e0u) with warships protection.\nBao Dai then transferred to a warship named \"Dumont d'Urville\", which would take him to \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, part of Protectorate of Annam. Besides that, there was two more ships escorted \"Dumont d'Urville\" together with cannons fired and flying flag hanging as the emperor boarding on the warship. Arriving at Da Nang port, he transferred to a gunboat and sailed up the Han River to the city. Finally, he boarded on train and traveled another 100 kilometers to Hue. The emperor later wrote in his memoirs: \"After many years of living in freedom, I felt as if I am now entering a prison...\"\nReign.\nOn September 10, 1932, the emperor began to reform and remove some of outdated and conservative customs of the imperial court. The twenty-year-old emperor held the first traditional court audience in which the top officials came to congratulate him on his return after a long absence. However, the emperor spoke in French, shocking and offending both young officials with nationalistic spirit and the older officials imbued with Confucianist learning. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i reformed the court such as rearranging internal affairs and administration. Then, he abolished some old customs that the previous emperors had established such as his subjects not having to kowtow and allowed to look directly at the emperor which had been considered as lese-majest\u00e9. when the procession arrived, every time the Western officials came to the audience they did not have to clasp their hands and bow but only shook hands with the emperor and native officials did not have to kneel. He banned custom of having excessively long fingernails and long beards by the elderly mandarins.\nDuring the emperor's absence, the his grandmothers and his great-grandmother spend a huge amount of money on gambling and they had to use the emperor's private fund to pay off debts but insufficient. To earn the money, those ladies started to sell the officials titles to their creditors who was also the head of the Council of Ministers (Cabinet). This led to the determination of eliminating bribery in imperial court.\nOn September 19, 1932, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i issued the first decree declaring his authority and affirming the absolute monarchy. This document abolished the old regency council established on November 16, 1925, shortly after death of emperor Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh. The emperor would manage directly the country's affairs and pay attention to the progress of the country. This received praise from French colonial. Previously, the government was governed by a council appointed by the French, so it was completely dependent on the French protectorate. The emperor did not participate in the council's affair, decision making and treated as figurehead .\nHowever, Resident General of Annam appointed by Paris had the right to veto all decisions of the emperor, even the least important ones. Thus, the country's leadership remained unchanged. Moreover, the French official who had a seat in the cabinet or the Council of Ministers, could agree or disagree with the decisions of the cabinet.\nOnly a few months after his return, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i made a tour of the provinces of Annam that had not happened in previous Emperors' reign. The emperor declared directly that he intended to rule alone without a prime minister, thereby expressing his desire to hold real power not only ceremonial role. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i proposed a few reform measures which was less important and moderate in level. He tried to change the direction of the old governance, reform national education, pass a new criminal and civil code, gradually moving the country towards a constitutional monarchy. In particular, he reformed the Annam's House of Representatives and the mandarin system, which later caused opposition from Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m.\nAll taxes were collected and distributed by the French protectorate. The Resident-Superior of Annam would determine the budget of Imperial court and provide the fund to run the government. The Emperor also had an annual allowance from the budget of Annam protectorate which he himself had no right to decide of amount received and each month he needed to have the French governors' signature approved to receive it for spending.\nOn April 8, 1933, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i issued an edict to reorganize the cabinet and take charge himself. He appointed five new ministers who shared the same reformist philosophy as him to replace those. He established the House of Representatives to show his appeals to the French colonial officials and allowed the Tonkin Advisory Council to represent the imperial court in cooperating with the French protectorate government.\nVietnam in World War II.\nDuring the second World War in 1940, the Empire of Japan took over French Indochina while their ally Nazi Germany's invasion of France. Although they did not dissolve the French colonial administration, the occupation authorities directed policy from behind the scenes in a parallel of Vichy France. The Japanese promised not to interfere with the imperial court at Hu\u1ebf. However, after ousting the French in 1945, they forced emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i to declare Vietnamese independence from France as a member of Japan's \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\"; the country then became the Empire of Vietnam.\nB\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, however, appeared to believe that independence was an irreversible course. In 1944, he wrote to General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You have suffered too much during four deadly years, not to understand that the Vietnamese people, who have a history of twenty centuries and an often glorious past, no longer wish, no longer can support any foreign domination or foreign administration...You could understand even better if you were able to see what is happening here, if you were able to sense the desire for independence that has been smoldering in the bottom of all hearts and which no human force can any longer hold back. Even if you were to arrive to re-establish a French administration here, it would no longer be obeyed; each village would be a nest of resistance. every former friend an enemy, and your officials and colonials themselves would ask to depart from this unbreathable atmosphere.\nIndependence declaration and establishment of Empire of Vietnam.\nAfter Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina, the French colonial administration collapsed and the establishment of a new government was supported by Japan as an urgent requirement and the Empire of Vietnam was born in that context. According to the arrangement of the Imperial Japanese Army, emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i met with Japan's supreme advisor, Ambassador Yokoyama Masayuki at Kien Trung Palace to sign the \"Indepencence Declaration of Vietnam\" on March 11, 1945 (this declaration was prepared by Japan and they pressured the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty's mandarins to sign it the night before). The main content of the declaration signed by B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was the abolition of the Paten\u00f4tre Treaty signed with France in 1884, the unification of Tonkin, Annam and Cochinchina, and the abolition of all previous protectorate and unequal treaties with France. However, the empire was de facto the client state of Japan with the slogan of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which was believed to give the Japanese military the right to requisition property throughout Vietnam.\nThe declaration of Vietnam's independence:\nOn April 7, 1945, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i signed the Decree No. 5 approving the establishment of Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim's cabinet. On May 12, he dissolved the House of Representatives of Annam. In June 1945, the Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim government named the country the Empire of Vietnam, using the 3 striped and yellow flag (C\u1edd qu\u1ebb Ly) as the national flag.\nSurrender of Japan.\nOn August 16, 1945, when the Empire of Japan surrendered to the Allies, Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim declared to protect the cabinet of the Empire of Vietnam. On August 18 he created a National Liberation Committee. Following the advice of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i sent a message to the leaders of the Allies (Harry S. Truman, Winston Churchill, Chiang Kai-shek and Charles de Gaulle) requesting recognition of the Empire of Vietnam. On August 18, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i sent a message to De Gaulle requesting recognition of the Empire of Vietnam. However, De Gaulle was not interested in Bao Dai's proposal, because he had compromised with Japan, the enemy of France. De Gaulle expected to support a Vietnamese monarchy without B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, but instead one by V\u0129nh San (former emperor Duy T\u00e2n), who was considered a \"Gaullist\" (an enthusiastic supporter of De Gaulle). All letters that B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i sent to other countries (the US, China, the UK ...etc...) were also not responded to because, according to the 1943 Cairo Declaration, the Allied countries would not recognize any government established by the Japanese Empire in the occupied areas.\nBy August 24, the August Revolution had broken out throughout the country. With the encouragement of prime minister Ph\u1ea1m Kh\u1eafc H\u00f2e, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i responded to the Privy Council that he decided to abdicate to avoid being an \"obstacle to the liberation of the country\".\nAbdication.\nIn 1945, the August Revolution succeeded and the Viet Minh forced the Imperial Vietnamese government to hand over power to them. Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i decided to abdicate, then he sent a telegram to the \"People's Committee for National Salvation\" in Hanoi: \"In response to the Committee's call, I am ready to abdicate. Before this decisive moment in the nation's history, 'United we stand, Divided we fall'. I am ready to sacrifice all interests, so that national unity can be achieved, and request that the committee's representatives come to Hue soon for governmental takeover.\"\nOn August 22, the Viet Minh seized power in Hanoi and many other places in the country. The emperor still hoped to remain on the throne by cooperating with the Viet Minh to form a new cabinet under a constitutional monarchy. Then he issued an edict inviting the Viet Minh leader to Hue to form a cabinet.\nOn the morning of August 23, two Viet Minh envoys, Tr\u1ea7n Huy Li\u1ec7u and C\u00f9 Huy C\u1eadn arrived at the Imperial City of Hu\u1ebf. At the request of these two people, emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i read the Abdication Declaration before thousands of people gathered at the Meridian Gate and handed over the imperial seal, sword and the other royal treasures to Tran Huy Lieu in afternoon of August 30, 1945. He became citizen \"V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y\". This marked the end of a thousand years of Vietnamese monarchy.\nPost-abdication life.\nParticipating in Republic.\nLater, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i received the letter from H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh inviting him to be the supreme advisor of the new government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that he later accepted.\nOn September 2, at 5:00 am, two days after the abdication ceremony, citizen V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y left Hue for Hanoi, with the position of advisor to the government and President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh waiting for him. The convoy consisted of two cars. The first car carrying V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y was accompanied by Minister of Labor Le Van Hien. The other car carried Prince Vinh Can, cousin of B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i. After receiving the seal and sword, Tran Huy Lieu's delegation set off for Hanoi the day before. The new state did not have any cars, so the delegation used the former emperor's two private cars. \nAfter his abdication, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was treated very well and financially supported by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On September 4, 1945, V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y arrived in Hanoi to take his position. On September 5, President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as well as Chairman of the Provisional Government welcomed the former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i at the Tonkin Palace (now State Guest House). On September 10, President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh signed Decree No. 23/SL appointing citizen V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y as \"Supreme Advisor of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Vietnam\". He was one of the 7 members of the Constitution Drafting Committee leaded by H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh.\nOn January 6, 1946, V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y was elected as a delegate to the first National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On March 7, one day after the signing of Ho\u2013Sainteny Agreement, he was always by President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's side to officially receive French representative Sainteny and pay him a return visit. On March 8, 1946, the Government Council met and decided to send a diplomatic delegation to Chongqing (Republic of China) and France. On March 11, the Government council appointed advisor V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y as head of the delegation to Chongqing with Nghi\u00eam K\u1ebf T\u1ed5, a member of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party; Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Cong Truyen, a representative of the Viet Minh, a member of the Propaganda Committee of the People's Committee of the North; Ha Phu Huong, a representative of the Vietnam Democratic Party (part of Viet Minh), a member of the Propaganda Committee of the People's Committee of the Central Region.\nExile in Hong Kong.\nOn March 16, 1946, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was assigned to join the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Chongqing to visit Republic of China. But he did not return home afterwards, but separated from the delegation to Kunming and then Hong Kong. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i accepted to go to Chongqing but as a former emperor traveling, not as the leader of the delegation. Therefore, Nghiem Ke To, a member of the Vietnam Nationalist Party, was the head of the delegation.\nLater, Pham Khac Hoe was also sent by President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh to Hong Kong to persuade B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i to return but before departing, he heard that B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i had agreed to side with France, so Hoe cancelled the trip. The H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh' government also sent a high-ranking government official named Ho Duc Linh to bring gold and foreign currency to B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i and persuade him to return to the country, but was unsuccessful.\nHe also frequently visited casinos and dance clubs in Hong Kong under the name \"Mr. Wang Kunney\". In Hong Kong, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i met with many political characters, including General George C. Marshall, the US representative, later brought the agreement with B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i to President Harry S. Truman. According to the French intelligence agency, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i himself asked for their help after he had spent all his money in Hong Kong. The French envoys continued to provide him with financial support, giving B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i 5,000 Hong Kong dollars each month that made him able to enjoy life of luxury and wealth. He bought an English-style building near Stanley Beach, often receiving guests in Causeway Bay, letting them stay at the Hongkong Hotel or at the Paramount or Saint-Francis. Later, when he sold his private property in Hong Kong, he received a sum of up to one million Indochinese piastres. Shortly after, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i wrote a letter back to the country to resign from his position as \"Supreme Advisor\" in the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\nReturn to power and Indochina War.\nB\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i spent nearly a year as \"supreme advisor\" to the DRV, during which period Vietnam descended into armed conflict between rival Vietnamese factions and the French. He left this post in 1946 after communists abandoned him in China. He moved to Hong Kong, where the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh both attempted unsuccessfully to solicit him for political support.\nEventually a coalition of Vietnamese anti-communists (including future South Vietnamese leader Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m and members of political/religious groups such as the Cao Dai, H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o, and VNQD\u0110) formed a National Union and declared to support B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i on the condition he would seek independence for Vietnam. This persuaded him to reject Vi\u1ec7t Minh overtures and enter into negotiations with the French. On 7 December 1947, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i officially signed the first of the Ha Long Bay Accords with France. Despite ostensibly committing France to Vietnamese independence, it was considered minimally binding and transferred no actual authority to Vietnam. The agreement was promptly criticized by National Union members, including Di\u1ec7m. In a possible attempt to escape the resulting political tension, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i travelled to Europe and commenced on a four-month pleasure tour which earned him the sobriquet \"night club emperor\". After persistent efforts by the French, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was persuaded to return from Europe and sign a second Ha Long Bay Agreement on 5 June 1948. This contained similarly weak promises for Vietnamese independence and had as little success as the first agreement. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i once again travelled to Europe whilst warfare in Vietnam continued to escalate.\nAfter months of negotiations with French President Vincent Auriol, he finally signed the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Accords on 8 March 1949, which led to the establishment of the State of Vietnam with B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i becoming the Chief of State (\u570b\u9577, \"Qu\u1ed1c tr\u01b0\u1edfng\") on 14 June 1949; the French also oversaw the creation of the Domain of the Crown where he was still officially considered to be the Emperor, this territory existed until 1955.\nHowever, the country was still only partially autonomous, with France initially retaining effective control of the army and foreign relations. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i himself stated in 1950: \"What they call a B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i solution turned out to be just a French solution... the situation in Indochina is getting worse every day\".\nAs Di\u1ec7m and other hardcore nationalists were disappointed in the lack of autonomy and refused high government posts, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i mainly filled his government with wealthy figures strongly connected to France. He then spent his own time in the resort towns of Da Lat, Nha Trang, and Bu\u00f4n Ma Thu\u1ed9t, largely avoiding the process of governing. All this contributed to his reputation as a French puppet and a rise in popular support for the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, whose armed insurgency against the French-backed regime was developing into a full-fledged civil war. Nonetheless, in 1950 he attended a series of conferences in Pau, France where he pressed the French for further independence. The French granted some minor concessions to the Vietnamese, which caused a mixed reaction on both sides.\nIn addition to the increasing unpopularity of the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i government, the communist victory in China in 1949 also led to a further revival of the fortunes of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. When China and the Soviet Union recognized the DRV government, the United States reacted by extending diplomatic recognition to B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's government in March 1950. This and the outbreak of the Korean War in June led to U.S. military aid and active support of the French war effort in Indochina, now seen as anti-communist rather than colonialist. Despite this, the war between the French colonial forces and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh started to go badly for the French, culminating in a major victory for the Vi\u1ec7t Minh at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7. This led to the negotiating of a peace deal between the French and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh on 21 July 1954, known as the Geneva Accords, which partitioned Vietnam at the 17th parallel. The north side was given to the DRV, with the State of Vietnam receiving the south. Before that, the State of Vietnam gained complete independence from France on June 4. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i remained \"Head of State\" of South Vietnam, but moved to Paris and appointed Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m as his prime minister.\nSecond removal from power.\nAt first, Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m exercised no influence over South Vietnam: the Vi\u1ec7t Minh still had de facto control of somewhere between sixty and ninety percent of the countryside (by French estimates), whilst the rest was dominated by the various religious sects. Meanwhile, the new capital of Saigon was under the total control of criminal group B\u00ecnh Xuy\u00ean. According to Colonel Lansdale, it had paid B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i a \"staggering sum\" for control of local prostitution and gambling and of Saigon's police force.\nRegardless, Di\u1ec7m's forces embarked on a campaign against the B\u00ecnh Xuy\u00ean, with fighting breaking out in the streets on 29 March 1955. In an attempt to protect his clients, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i ordered Di\u1ec7m to travel to France, but he was disobeyed and Di\u1ec7m eventually succeeded in pushing his opponents out of the city. Using a divide and conquer strategy, Di\u1ec7m then employed a mixture of force and bribery to sway the remaining religious sects to his side.\nNow with a broad range of support, a new Popular Revolutionary Committee (formed by Di\u1ec7m's brother Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu) was able to call for a referendum to remove B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i and establish a republic with Di\u1ec7m as president. The campaign leading up to the referendum was punctuated by personal attacks against the former emperor, whose supporters had no way to refute them since campaigning for B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was forbidden.\nThe referendum was criticized as being fraudulent. The official results showed a tally of 98.9% in favor of a republic, with the number of votes for a republic exceeding the total number of registered voters by 155,025 in Saigon, while the total number of votes exceeded the total number of registered voters by 449,084, and the number of votes for a republic exceeded the total number of registered voters by 386,067.\nB\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was removed from power, with Di\u1ec7m declaring himself president of the new Republic of Vietnam on 26 October 1955.\nLife in exile.\nHe lived in Cannes, then moved to Alsace. In 1963, former Empress consort Nam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng died in Chabrignac.\nIn 1957, while in Alsace, he met Christiane Bloch-Carcenac, with whom he had an affair until 1970. From this relationship he gave birth to his last child, Patrick-\u00c9douard Bloch, born in 1958 who is still living in Alsace.\nAfter moving to France, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i no longer controlled the economic system to benefit himself as before, many his businesses in Vietnam were confiscated by Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m. Being watched by the tax authorities and no longer having financial support from the French government, he had to sell his assets gradually. Around 1960s, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's huge fortune was gradually dwindled. Many castles, expensive planes, luxury cars, etc... had to be sold to pay off the outstanding debts. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i only received a small subsidy from President Giscard's government of 8,000 francs/month.\nIn 1972, after spending all his assets, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i lived with Monique Baudot, a French woman 30 years younger than him and they got married in 1982. In 1988, after a period of discussion with the parish priest of Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i converted to Catholicism, taking the Christian name Jean-Robert. In 1988, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was baptised in France as Roman Catholic.\nIn 1972, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i issued a public statement from exile, appealing to the Vietnamese people for national reconciliation, stating, \"The time has come to put an end to the fratricidal war and to recover at last peace and accord\". At times, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i maintained residence in southern France, and in particular in Monaco, where he sailed often on his private yacht, one of the largest in Monte Carlo harbor. He still reportedly held great influence among local political figures in the Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb and Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean provinces of Hu\u1ebf. The Communist government of North Vietnam sent representatives to France hoping that B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i would become a member of a coalition government which might reunite Vietnam, in the hope of attracting his supporters in the regions wherein he still held influence. \nIn 1982, on the occasion of the opening of the imperial Family Association abroad, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i visited the United States for the first time. In Sacramento, California, he was awarded with a golden key symbolizing the town and the title of \"honorary citizen\" of the city by the mayor of Westminster, California. He also visited and congratulated the ceremonies of the Vietnamese Buddhist and Caodaist communities in California and the Vietnamese American communities in Texas. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i also took this opportunity to ask the opinions of the Vietnamese communities living in the United States about solutions for national reconciliation. As a result of these meetings, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i publicly spoke out against the presence of American troops in South Vietnam, and he criticized President Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u's regime in South Vietnam. He called for all political factions to create a free, neutral, peace-loving government which would resolve the tense situation that had taken form in the country.\nThroughout B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's life in both Vietnam and in France, he remained unpopular among the Vietnamese populace as he was considered a political puppet for the French colonialist regime, for lacking any form of political power, and for his cooperation with the French and for his pro-French ideals. The former emperor clarified, however, that his reign was always a constant battle and a balance between preserving the monarchy and the integrity of the nation versus fealty to the French authorities. Ultimately, power devolved away from his person and into ideological camps and in the face of Diem's underestimated influences on factions within the empire.\nDeath.\nB\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i died at a military hospital in Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris on 30 July 1997. He was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Passy.\nB\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i lived his last years quietly in a small apartment at 29, rue Fresnel, 16th arrondissement, Paris. All his once-massive wealth and power were gone, and he lived on a monthly allowance of 20,000 Francs from the French government.\nHe died at 5:00\u00a0a.m. on July 31, 1997, at the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce Military Hospital, at the age of 83. Former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was the longest-lived emperor of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty. He was also the longest-lived deposed emperor in the modern world.\nB\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's funeral was held at 11:00\u00a0a.m. on August 6, 1997, at the Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot church at 35 avenue Marceau, 16th arrondissement, Paris and his coffin was buried at Passy Cemetery on Trocad\u00e9ro hill.\nResponding to the BBC about this event, Ms. Monique said: \"Today I am very sad. Of course, first and foremost because my husband has just passed away. But today the history of the Nguyen Dynasty of Vietnam has also ended. I pray for my husband.\"\nMarriages and children.\nOn 20 March 1934, age 20, at the imperial city of Hu\u1ebf, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i married Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Th\u1ecb Lan (died 15 September 1963, Chabrignac, France), a commoner from a wealthy Vietnamese Catholic family. After the wedding, she was given the title Empress Nam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng.\nThe couple had five children, two sons and three daughters:\nAlthough B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i later had additional children with other women, these are the only ones listed in the clan genealogy.\nMistresses.\nNam Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng was granted the title of empress in 1945. By one count, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i had relationships with eight women and fathered 13 children. Those named \"Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng\" are daughters, while those named \"B\u1ea3o\" are sons.\nEvaluation of B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i.\nIn Vietnam.\nThe Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) considered him to be a traitor. After he was once again helped by France as the Head of State of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh said in an interview with Chinese media: \"V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y brought the French invading army back to Vietnam and killed more compatriots. V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y is a true traitor. The French colonists conspired to restore slavery in Vietnam. V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y is the confidant of the colonists. Although Vietnamese law is very tolerant to those who have lost their way, they will severely punish the traitorous orphans. The Vietnamese people are determined to defeat all colonial conspiracies and fight for true independence and reunification.\"\nOn one hand, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i remains a highly discussed figure. The CPV labels him a traitor, but does not treat him as harshly as subsequent leaders of the later South Vietnam; his role continues to be studied, ranging from a somewhat sympathetic figure to the Vi\u1ec7t Minh to a moderate figure who tried to avoid war, given B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i himself agreed to abdicate in 1945 to give power for the Vi\u1ec7t Minh.\nVietnamese diaspora.\nMost Overseas Vietnamese, who are ardently anti-communist, didn't consider B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i positively, partly due to his weak-willed reputation and inability to confront with the communist threat, as well as his reclusive life and his perceived cowardice. His role is also studied by the diaspora, although recent studies had questioned the perception due to perceived bias by both the Vietnamese diaspora and the CPV.\nB\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i coins.\nThe last \"cash\" coin ever produced in the world bears the name of B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n. There are three types of this coin. Large cast piece with 10 v\u0103n inscription on the reverse, medium cast piece with no reverse inscription, and small struck piece. All were issued in 1933.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(BMI) is a performance rights organization in the United States. It collects blanket license fees from businesses that use music, entitling those businesses to play or sync any songs from BMI's repertoire of over 22.4 million musical works. On a quarterly basis, BMI distributes the money to songwriters, composers, and music publishers as royalties to those members whose works have been performed.\nIn FY 2022, BMI collected $1.573 billion in revenues and distributed $1.471 billion in royalties. BMI's repertoire includes over 1.4 million songwriters and 22.4 million compositions. BMI is the biggest performing rights organization in the United States and is one of the largest such organizations in the world.\nBMI songwriters create music in virtually every genre. BMI represents artists such as Patti LaBelle, Selena, Miley Cyrus, Lil Wayne, Lil Nas X, Birdman, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Eminem, Rihanna, Shakira, Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion, Ed Sheeran, Karol G, J Balvin, Sam Cooke, Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Fats Domino and Dolly Parton; bands such as Evanescence, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Linkin Park, Twenty One Pilots and Fifth Harmony; and composers such as Harry Gregson-Williams, John Williams, Danny Elfman, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, and the Sherman Brothers.\nIn 1961, BMI co-founded the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop, which fosters new musical theater writing talent. Notable alumni have included Alan Menken, Maury Yeston, Robert Lopez, Jeanine Tesori, and the songwriting team of Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. In recognition of its contributions to musical theater, the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop has won both a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award.\nHistory.\nIn the 1930s, radio was coming to prominence as a source of musical entertainment that threatened to weaken record sales and opportunities for \"live\" acts. The Great Depression was already draining artist revenues from recordings and live performances. ASCAP, the pre-eminent royalty/licensing agency for more than two decades, required radio stations to subscribe to \"blanket\" licenses granting ASCAP a fixed percentage of each station's revenue, regardless of how much music the station played from ASCAP's repertoire. In 1939, ASCAP announced a substantial increase in the revenue share licensees would be required to pay. BMI was founded by the National Association of Broadcasters to provide a lower-cost alternative to ASCAP. As such, BMI created competition in the field of performing rights, providing an alternative source of licensing for all music users.\nThe vast majority of U.S. radio stations, and all three radio networks, refused to renew their ASCAP licenses for 1941, choosing to forgo playing ASCAP music entirely and relying on the BMI repertoire. In February 1941, similar to the agreement it had made with ASCAP, the Department of Justice and BMI entered into a consent decree, requiring certain changes to BMI's business model, including giving licensees the option of paying only for the music they actually used instead of buying a blanket license. The U.S. District Court in Milwaukee was chosen by the Justice Department to supervise the decree for both BMI and ASCAP.\nCompeting against the strongly established ASCAP, BMI sought out artists that ASCAP tended to overlook or ignore. BMI also purchased the rights to numerous catalogs held by independent publishers or whose ASCAP contracts were about to expire. To attract newer writers, BMI proposed to compensate songwriters and publishers on the basis of a fixed fee per performance, as opposed to ASCAP's two-tier system, which discriminated against less-established songwriters. Despite its original motivation regarding radio station royalties and its focus on radio station revenues versus artist revenues, BMI became the first performing rights organization in the United States to represent songwriters of blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel (black genres, performers, and writers that ASCAP did not want to represent), country, folk, Latin, and\u2014ultimately\u2014rock and roll. During the 1940s and 1950s, BMI was the primary licensing organization for country artists and R&amp;B artists, while ASCAP centered on more established Pop artists. Also during that time, BMI expanded its repertoire of classical music, and now represents the majority of the members of the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Letters and the winners of 31 Pulitzer Prizes for Music.\nBMI's practice of selling only \"blanket licenses\", rather than licenses for individual songs, led to a major antitrust law dispute between BMI and CBS, that resulted in the 1979 case, \"Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc.\", in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the prohibition of \"price fixing\" by the Sherman Act was not strictly literal, and should be interpreted in light of the economic efficiencies an agreement brings.\nIn July 2017, BMI renewed long-term partnership with C3 Presents, the world's largest music festival producer.\nIn October 2022, BMI announced that it would transition from its historical not-for-profit structure to a for-profit model in order to invest in growth and technology modernization. It agreed to be acquired by an investor group led by New Mountain Capital in November 2023, and the deal closed on February 8, 2024.\nBusiness.\nBMI issues licenses to users of music, including:\nBMI tracks public performances from among a repertoire of more than 22.4 million musical works.

{"id": "66067", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66067", "title": "Harald Gille", "text": "King of Norway from 1130 to 1136\nHarald Gille (, c. 1102 \u2212 14 December 1136), also known as Harald IV, was king of Norway from 1130 until his death. His byname Gille is probably from mga \" Gilla Cr\u00edst\"\u00a0'servant of Christ'.\nBackground.\nHarald was born ca. 1102 in Ireland or the Hebrides, more likely the former. According to the sagas, he became familiar with Norway through an acquaintance with Norwegian merchants including R\u00f6gnvald Kali Kolsson, who would later become Earl of Orkney. Around 1127, Harald went to Norway and declared he was an illegitimate son of the former king, Magnus Barefoot, who had visited Ireland just before his death in 1103. This is not implausible because other descendants of Magnus are reported in Irish sources and he is known to have been particularly fond of at least one Irish woman. Harald consequently claimed to be a half-brother of the reigning king, Sigurd the Crusader. Harald appears to have submitted successfully to the ordeal by fire. The alleged relationship was acknowledged by Sigurd on condition that Harald did not claim any share in the government of the kingdom during his lifetime or that of his son Magnus. Living on friendly terms with the king, Harald kept this agreement until Sigurd's death in 1130.\nReign.\nHarald was in T\u00f8nsberg when he heard of King Sigurd's death. He called together a meeting at the Haugating (from the Old Norse word \"haugr\" meaning hill or burial mound). At this Thing, Harald was chosen king over half the country. King Magnus was obliged to divide the kingdom with Harald into two parts.\nThe kingdom accordingly was so divided that each of them should have the half part of the kingdom which King Sigurd had possessed. They ruled the country for some time in peace. After four years of uneasy peace, Magnus began to openly prepare for war on Harald. On 9 August 1134 he defeated Harald in a decisive Battle at Fyrisleif in and Harald fled to Denmark. Subsequently, Magnus disbanded his army and traveled to Bergen to spend the winter there. Harald then returned to Norway with a new army and meeting little opposition, reached Bergen before Christmas. Since Magnus had few men, the city fell easily to Harald's army on 7 January 1135. Magnus was captured and dethroned. His eyes were put out, and he was thrown into prison. Harald now ruled the country until 1136, when he was murdered by Sigurd Slembe, another alleged illegitimate son of Magnus Barefoot.\nPersonal life.\nHarald was married to Ingrid Ragnvaldsdotter, daughter of Ragnvald Ingesson, the son and heir of Inge the Elder. Harald had a son, Inge I of Norway, with her. According to the sagas, Harald had previously been married to Bja\u00f0\u01ebk, mother of his son, Eystein II of Norway. Among Harald's concubines was Thora Guttormsdotter (\"\u00de\u00f3ra Guthormsd\u00f3ttir\"), the daughter of Guttorm Gr\u00e5barde, who was the mother of Sigurd II of Norway. He also had a son, Magnus Haraldsson of Norway, who died in 1145 at 10 years of age. All four sons were kings of Norway.\nHistorical context.\nApproximately from his accession to the throne, the civil wars period of Norwegian history started, that lasted from 1130 to 1217. During this period there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts were the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between Church and King. There were two main parties, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into parties of Bagler and Birkebeiner. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the head figure of the party in question, to oppose the rule of the king from the contesting party.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He became heir apparent to the Norwegian throne when his father was elected King Haakon VII of Norway in 1905. He was the first heir to the Norwegian throne to be brought up in Norway since Olav IV in the 14th century, and his parents made sure that he was given as Norwegian an upbringing as possible. In preparation for his future role, he attended both civilian and military schools. In 1929, he married his first cousin, Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden. During World War II, his leadership was much appreciated, and he was appointed Norwegian Chief of Defence in 1944. Olav became king following the death of his father in 1957.\nHis considerate, down-to-earth style made Olav immensely popular, resulting in the nickname ('The People's King'). In a 2005 poll by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, Olav was voted \"Norwegian of the Century\".\nBirth and early life.\nOlav was born on 2 July 1903 as Prince Alexander Edward Christian Frederik in Appleton House on the royal Sandringham Estate, Flitcham, United Kingdom. His parents were Prince Carl, second son of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark (later King Frederick VIII), and Princess Maud, youngest daughter of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, who was the eldest son of Britain's Queen Victoria. In 1905, Carl was elected as Norway's first independent king in 518 years. The fact that Carl already had a son gave him an advantage over the other candidates, as it assured the continuance of the new royal line. When Carl accepted his election, he took the name Haakon VII. The king gave his two-year-old son the Norwegian name Olav after Olav Haakonsson, the last independent king of Norway before its union with Denmark. It was also chosen in honour of Saint Olaf, the first effective king of Norway and a symbol of Norwegian independence and pride. \nOlav was thus the first heir to the throne since the Middle Ages to have been raised in Norway, and his parents went to considerable length to give him as Norwegian an upbringing as possible. Unlike his father, who was a naval officer, Olav chose to complete his main military education in the army. He graduated from the three-year Norwegian Military Academy in 1924, with the fourth-best score in his class. Olav then studied jurisprudence and economics for two years at Balliol College, Oxford.\nDuring the 1930s, Crown Prince Olav was a naval cadet serving on the minelayer/cadet training ship \"Olav Tryggvason\". Olav moved up the ranks of the Norwegian armed forces in the army from an initial rank of first lieutenant to captain in 1931 and colonel in 1936.\nHe was an accomplished athlete. Olav jumped from the Holmenkollen ski jump in Oslo and competed in sailing regattas. He won a gold medal in sailing at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and remained an active sailor into old age.\nOn 21 March 1929 in Oslo, he married his first cousin Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden with whom he had two daughters, Ragnhild and Astrid, and one son, Harald. As exiles during World War II, Crown Princess M\u00e4rtha and the royal children lived in Washington, DC, where she struck up a close friendship with Franklin Roosevelt. She died in 1954, before her husband ascended the throne.\nThe British Film Institute houses an early film, made in 1913, in which a miniature car (a \"baby Cadillac\") commissioned by Queen Alexandra for Crown Prince Olav tows a procession of Londoners through the streets of the capital, before being delivered to a pair of \"royal testers\" of roughly Olav's age. The car is a battery-powered, one-third size replica on a four-foot wheelbase, and is on permanent loan to the Norsk Teknisk Museum in Oslo.\nWorld War II.\nAs Crown Prince, Olav had received extensive military training and had participated in most major Norwegian military exercises. That made him perhaps one of the most knowledgeable Norwegian military leaders, and he was respected by other Allied leaders for his knowledge and leadership skills. During a visit to the United States before the war, he and his wife had established a close relationship with President Roosevelt. Those factors would prove to be important for the Norwegian fight against the attacking German forces. In 1939, Crown Prince Olav was appointed an admiral of the Royal Norwegian Navy and a general of the Norwegian Army.\nDuring World War II, Olav stood by his father's side in resisting the German occupation of Norway. During the campaign he was a valuable advisor both to civilian and military leaders. When the Norwegian government decided to go into exile, he offered to stay behind with the Norwegian people, but that was declined. He reluctantly followed his father to the United Kingdom, where he and his staff and servants and aides continued to be a key advisor to the government-in-exile and his father. One source states that Olav helped \"to build and lead a free fighting force\" and made radio broadcasts in England. \nOlav made several visits to Norwegian and Allied troops in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. In 1944, he was appointed to the post of Norwegian Chief of Defence and after the war he led the Norwegian disarmament of the German occupying forces. On 13 May 1945, Crown Prince Olav and five government ministers returned to a liberated Norway. The arrival was documented in a newsreel by British Path\u00e9 News.\nHis war decorations from other nations, including the War Crosses of Norway, France, Greece and the Netherlands; the US Legion of Merit; and the French M\u00e9daille Militaire, are testament to the international recognition of his contribution to the war against Nazi Germany. \nReign.\nHaakon was injured in an accident in 1955; his son Olav served as regent until his death. Haakon died at the Royal Palace in Oslo on 21 September 1957. He was 85 years old. After his death, Olav succeeded him as Olav V. \nOlav reigned as a \"People's King,\" and became extremely popular, despite the fact that he had no queen consort (his wife, M\u00e4rtha of Sweden, died in 1954). He liked to drive his own cars and would drive in the public lane even though, as king, he was allowed to drive in bus lanes. When driving was restricted during the 1973 energy crisis, King Olav wanted to lead by example even though he would have been well within his rights to drive. While going on a skiing trip, he dressed up in his skiing outfit and boarded the Holmenkollbanen suburban railway carrying his skis on his shoulder. When later asked how he dared to go out in public without bodyguards, he replied that \"he had 4 million bodyguards\", the population of Norway at the time.\nFor his athletic ability and role as King, Olav earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1968, the Medal for Outstanding Civic Achievement in 1970 and was made Name of the Year in 1975. He had a strong interest in military matters and took his role as titular Commander-in-Chief very seriously. As well as his ceremonial roles in the Norwegian Army, he also served as Colonel-in-Chief of the Green Howards (Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Yorkshire Regiment), the British regiment named for his grandmother Queen Alexandra.\nThe King represented Norway extensively abroad during his reign, conducting state visits to both neighbouring countries and more distant destinations such as Ethiopia and Iran. King Olav V opened the 14th World Scout Jamboree in July 1975 in the presence of 17,259 Scouts from 94 countries.\nAlthough the constitution nominally vested Olav with executive power, he was not responsible for exercising it. In practice, his role was almost entirely ceremonial and representative. This not only followed practices dating from the definitive establishment of parliamentary rule in Norway in 1884, but also precedent set by his father. His acts were not valid without the countersignature of a minister\u2013usually the Prime Minister\u2013who then became politically responsible for the act in question. While he had the right to appoint the government, in practice it was impossible for him to appoint a government solely of his choosing or keep it in office against the will of the Storting. Nonetheless, like his father before him, he commanded great moral authority as a symbol of the nation's unity.\nIllness and death.\nDuring the summer of 1990, the King suffered from health problems, but recovered somewhat during Christmas the same year. At the age of 87, on 17 January 1991, while residing in the Royal Lodge Kongsseteren in Oslo, he became ill and died in the evening of a heart attack. An interview given by King Harald V and hints in a biography by Jo Benkow, who was the President of the Storting at that time, mention the possibility that King Olav suffered great trauma upon learning of the outbreak of the first Gulf War, which began on the day he died. Olav's son succeeded him as King Harald V.\nOn the night of his death and for several days up until the state funeral, Norwegians mourned publicly, lighting hundreds of thousands of candles in the courtyard outside the Royal Palace in Oslo, with letters and cards placed amongst them. The National Archives have preserved all these cards.\nFuneral.\nThe state funeral of King Olav V was held on 30 January 1991. During the funeral procession from the Royal Palace to Oslo Cathedral, more than 100,000 people lined up along Karl Johans gate to pay their respects. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland gave the eulogy at the funeral, before the casket was moved to Akershus Fortress where a private service was held.\nOlav was finally laid to rest next to his wife M\u00e4rtha in the green sarcophagus of the Royal Mausoleum.\nLegacy.\nKing Olav's leadership during the Second World War made him a symbol of Norwegian independence and national unity. As King Olav's wife, Princess M\u00e4rtha, died of cancer, the King Olav V's Prize for Cancer Research was established in 1992.\nA 2005 poll by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation named King Olav \"Norwegian of the Century\".\nIn popular culture.\nViktor Andersen portrayed the two-year-old Prince Alexander (Olav) in the 2009 NRK drama series \"Harry &amp; Charles.\" Actor Anders Baasmo Christiansen was chosen to portray Crown Prince Olav in the 2016 drama \"The King's Choice\" while Tobias Santelmann portrayed Olav in the 2021 NRK drama \"Atlantic Crossing\". In the period drama \"The Commoner\", which premiered in 2025 on Amazon Prime Video, Anders Baasmo Christiansen again portrayed Olav, this time during his reign as King of Norway.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66069", "revid": "50254362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66069", "title": "Harald V", "text": "King of Norway since 1991\nHarald V (, ; born 21 February 1937) is King of Norway, reigning since 1991.\nA member of the House of Gl\u00fccksburg, Harald was the third child and only son of King Olav V of Norway and Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden. He was second in the line of succession at the time of his birth, behind his father. In 1940, as a result of the German occupation during World War II, the royal family went into exile. Harald spent part of his childhood in Sweden and the United States. He returned to Norway in 1945, and subsequently studied for periods at the University of Oslo, the Norwegian Military Academy, and Balliol College, Oxford. A keen sportsman, Harald represented Norway in sailing at the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Olympic Games, and later became patron of World Sailing.\nFollowing the death of his paternal grandfather King Haakon VII in 1957, Harald became crown prince as his father became King Olav V. He married Sonja Haraldsen in 1968; their relationship having initially been controversial due to her status as a commoner. They have two children, their elder child M\u00e4rtha Louise and their younger child Haakon, who is heir apparent due to the male-preference primogeniture used in Norway at the time of his birth. In 1990, when his father's health started declining, Harald became regent and thus took most of the powers of the monarchy while Olav remained the \"de facto\" monarch. Following his father's death in 1991, Harald officially ascended to the throne. He was the first Norwegian monarch born in Norway since Olav IV in 1367, a span of nearly 600 years.\nKey events in Harald's reign were the start of the 21st century and third millennium and the 2011 Norway attacks. During his reign, he has also suffered from health problems, with his son, Crown Prince Haakon, acting as regent four times between 2003 and 2024. Since 2024, Harald has been Norway's oldest-reigning monarch, surpassing his father; since the death of Elizabeth II in 2022, he is also the oldest-reigning monarch in Europe.\nEarly life and education.\nBirth.\nHarald was born at the Skaugum estate during the reign of his grandfather King Haakon VII and was baptised in the Royal Chapel of the Royal Palace in Oslo on 31 March 1937 by Bishop Johan Lunde. His godparents were: his paternal grandparents King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway; his maternal grandparents Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden; his maternal uncle King Leopold III of Belgium; Queen Mary and King George VI of the United Kingdom; and Crown Princess Ingrid of Denmark. His parents already had two daughters, Princess Ragnhild and Princess Astrid.\nAt the time of Harald's birth, he was second in line of succession to the Norwegian throne following his father, Crown Prince Olav.\nSecond World War.\nIn 1940 the entire royal family had to flee Oslo because of the German invasion. It was deemed safer for the family to split up. The King and Crown Prince Olav would remain in Norway and the Crown Princess was to make her way to Sweden with the three children. The latter party reached Sweden on the night of 10 April, but although Crown Princess M\u00e4rtha was Swedish-born, they encountered problems at the border station. According to Princess Astrid and others who were present, they were admitted only after the driver threatened to ram the border gate. Another account does not describe the escape so dramatically. However, when the King and Crown Prince inquired of Swedish foreign minister Christian G\u00fcnther whether they could sleep one night in Sweden without being interned, their request was refused.\nHarald spent the following days in S\u00e4len before moving to Prince Carl Bernadotte's home in Fr\u00f6tuna on 16 April. On 26 April the group moved to Drottningholm in Stockholm. King Gustaf V has been accounted to have had an amicable relationship with his Norwegian guests, but the topic of the war in Norway was not to be raised. However, influential Swedish politicians, including Minister of Justice Westman, wanted the Crown Princess and Prince Harald to be sent back to Norway so he could be proclaimed King by the Germans. After the King and Crown Prince had to leave Norway on 7 June they felt Sweden might not be the best place for the rest of the family, and started planning for them to go to the United States. On 17 August the Crown Princess and her children left for the United States from Petsamo, Finland, aboard the United States Army transport ship .\nHarald, his mother, and his sisters lived in Washington, D.C. during the war, while his father, Crown Prince Olav, and his grandfather, King Haakon, stayed in London with the Norwegian government-in-exile. One of the notable events he remembers from that time is standing behind Franklin D. Roosevelt when he was sworn in for his fourth term on the South Portico of the White House in 1945. Such childhood experiences are reflected in a trace of an American accent when he speaks English. The Doris Kearns Goodwin book \"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and the Home Front in World War II\" contains a picture of the King (then Prince) playing with FDR's dog, Fala, on the North Lawn of the White House in 1944.\nHarald visited Norwegian servicemen training in the United States. The prince also made visits outside America, travelling north to visit Norwegian personnel at the training base \"Little Norway\" in Ontario, Canada. He attended The White Hall Country School from 1943. Prince Harald returned to Norway with his family at the war's end in 1945.\nReturn.\nIn the autumn of 1945 he was enrolled in third grade of Smestad skole as the first member of the royal family to attend a public (state) school.\nHis Confirmation took place on 10 May 1953 at the Chapel of Akershus Castle.\nAmidst this when he was only 17 years old in 1954, his mother died of cancer. The Crown Princess's death was a tremendous loss for him and his family as well as for Norway, and he named his daughter M\u00e4rtha to honour her memory. Four years later in 1958 he would lose his maternal grandmother, Princess Ingeborg of Denmark.\nCrown Prince.\nIn 1955 he graduated from Oslo katedralskole and in the autumn of that year, Harald began studies at the University of Oslo. He later attended the Cavalry Officers' Candidate School at Trandum, followed by enrollment at the Norwegian Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1959. On 21 September 1957 at the death of his grandfather, Harald became crown prince at the age of 20 and he attended the Council of State for the first time six days later and took the oath to the Constitution of Norway on 21 February 1958. In the same year, he also served as regent in the King's absence for the first time.\nIn 1960, Harald entered Balliol College, Oxford where he studied history, economics and politics. He was a keen rower during his student days at Oxford and was taught to row by fellow student and friend Nick Bevan, later a leading British school rowing coach. In 1960, he also made his first official journey abroad, visiting the United States in connection with the fiftieth anniversary of the American Scandinavian Foundation. An avid sailor, Harald represented Norway in the yachting events of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964, Mexico City in 1968, and Munich in 1972. The Crown Prince carried the Norwegian flag at the opening parade of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Harald is an honorary president of the International Soling Association.\nMarriage.\nHarald married Sonja Haraldsen at Oslo Domkirke in Oslo on 29 August 1968. The pair had dated for nine years, but Olav was reluctant to allow his son to marry a commoner. Olav only relented when Harald told his father that if he was not allowed to marry Sonja he would not marry at all. This would have ended the reign of his family and the Norwegian monarchy, as Harald was the sole heir to the throne. The couple had two children, Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise and Crown Prince Haakon, heir apparent to the Norwegian throne.\nReign.\nOn the death of his father on 17 January 1991, Harald succeeded to the Norwegian throne. He became the first Norwegian-born monarch since Olav IV died in 1387, a gap of 604 years. Harald is the sixth King of Norway to bear that name, and the first in 855 years. The five other kings who have borne the name are Harald Fairhair, Harald Greycloak, Harald Bluetooth, Harald Hardrada, and Harald Gille. Harald Bluetooth is usually not given a number in the Norwegian list of kings, therefore Harald is 'only' numbered as \"Harald V\". King Harald made the decision to use his grandfather and father's royal motto, \"Alt for Norge\". The King also chose to continue the tradition of royal benediction, a tradition that had been introduced with his father, and was consecrated together with Queen Sonja in the Nidaros Cathedral on 23 June 1991.\nThe reign of King Harald has been marked by modernization and reform for the Norwegian Royal family. The King has cooperated closely with Queen Sonja and the Crown Prince in making the royal household more open to the Norwegian public and the Norwegian media. King Harald's decision to accept two more commoners into the royal family, Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Ari Behn, has been interpreted as a sign of modernization and adjustment. Under King Harald and Queen Sonja's leadership, comprehensive renovation projects on the Bygd\u00f8y Royal Estate, the Royal Palace, the royal stables and Oscarshall have also taken place. The latter three have also been opened to the public and tourists. Together with Queen Sonja, the king has also for decades attempted to establish a palace museum in Oslo.\nConstitutional role.\nWhile the Constitution vests the King with executive power, he is not politically responsible for exercising it. This is in accordance not only with provisions of the Constitution, but with conventions established since the definitive establishment of parliamentary rule in Norway in 1884. His acts are not valid without the countersignature of a member of the Council of State (cabinet)\u2013usually the Prime Minister\u2013and proceedings of the Council of State are signed by all of its members. Although he nominally has the power of veto, no Norwegian king has exercised it since the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905. Even then, the King's veto power is suspensive, not absolute as is the case with British monarchs. A royal veto can be overridden if the Storting passes the same bill following a general election.\nWhile the Constitution nominally vests the King with the power to appoint the government, in practice it is impossible for a King to keep a government in office against the will of Parliament. By convention, the King appoints the leader of the parliamentary bloc with the majority as prime minister. When the parliamentary situation is unclear, the King relies on the advice of the President of Parliament and the sitting prime minister. Unlike most constitutional monarchs, Harald does not have the power to dissolve Parliament; the Constitution does not allow snap elections.\nThe King meets with the Council of State at the Royal Palace every Friday. He also has weekly meetings with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He receives foreign envoys, and formally opens parliament every October delivering a speech from the throne during each opening. He travels extensively throughout Norway and makes official state visits to other countries, as well as receiving and hosting guests.\nUntil 2012, the King of Norway was, according to the constitution, the formal head of the Church of Norway. The constitutional amendment of 21 May 2012 made the King no longer the formal head, but he is still required to be of the Evangelical Lutheran religion.\nOn 8 May 2018, the King's constitutional status as holy was dissolved, while leaving his sovereign immunity intact.\nSporting role.\nIn 1994, both the King and Crown Prince Haakon played roles during the opening ceremony of the Lillehammer Olympics. The King opened the games, while the Crown Prince lit the cauldron, paying tribute to both the King and his grandfather as Olympians. The King has also represented Norway at opening ceremonies of Olympic Games, among them Torino and Beijing. However, he was not present in Vancouver; the Crown Prince attended instead, with the King and Queen attending later in the games.\nWith his sailing crew he won World Championship bronze, silver and gold medals, in 1988, 1982 and 1987, respectively. In July 2005, the King and his crew aboard the royal sailboat \"Fram XV\" won the gold medal at the European Championships in Sweden. In the 2007 World Championship the King came in sixth place.\nRecent years.\nKing Harald's leadership during Norwegian national crises, such as the New Year's Day Storm (1992), July 2011 massacre, 2020 Gjerdrum landslide, and particularly the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020 to March 2022), have been met with both national and international acclaim.\nIn 2015, he became the world's first reigning monarch to visit Antarctica, specifically the Norwegian dependency Queen Maud Land. In 2016, King Harald V competed with a team for the sailing World Championships on Lake Ontario, Toronto. The king came second in the classic fleet category. He was dubbed \"Sailor-King\" by Canada's \"National Post\" as he slept on board his yacht \"Sira\".\nIn 2016 Harald, in a speech marking 25 years on the throne, sought to unify Norwegians coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as \"girls who love girls, boys who love boys and girls and boys who love each other.\"\nSince the start of the twenty-first century, King Harald has been unable to perform his duties as sovereign due to ill health on a few occasions: from December 2003 to mid-April 2004 due to urinary bladder cancer, from April to early June 2005 due to aortic stenosis, and in 2020 due to cardiac surgery (replacement of a heart valve). Crown Prince Haakon served as the country's regent on these occasions, including giving the King's Speech at the State opening of parliament in 2020.\nWhen the King and Queen turned 80 years old in 2017, the King decided to open the former royal stables to the public as a gift to his wife, the Queen. The new venue was named The Queen Sonja Art Stable and is the first institution owned by the royal family which is permanently open to the public. King Harald was made Name of the Year by the newspaper \"VG\" in 2017.\nOn 17 January 2021, King Harald celebrated 30 years on the Norwegian throne. On 11 September 2022, he visited Denmark to celebrate Margrethe II's Golden Jubilee. Harald was hospitalized in August 2022 with a fever, being again admitted to hospital that December for an infection. He was also hospitalized for an infection once again in May 2023 just before Constitution Day. On 15 September 2023 he also attended the celebrations of Carl XVI Gustaf's Golden Jubilee in Stockholm, Sweden. In October 2023, Harald tested positive for coronavirus, having previously tested positive for the disease in March 2022. Since the death of Elizabeth II in 2022, Harald is Europe's oldest hereditary reigning monarch, at the age of . Since 9 September 2024 he is the oldest monarch in over 1,150 years of Norwegian monarchy, living longer than his father Olav V, who died at the age of 87 years and 199 days.\nOn 31 January 2024, the royal palace announced that King Harald was on \"sick leave\" until 2 February due to a respiratory infection. On 27 February, while on holiday in Malaysia, he was again hospitalized on the resort island of Langkawi; he was admitted to the royal suites of Sultanah Maliha Hospital, a government hospital and the only major hospital on the island, and had a temporary pacemaker implanted due to a low heart rate. During his hospitalization, he was accorded protection and security similar to that of a reigning state ruler of Malaysia by the Malaysian government. The Norwegian ambassador and high ranking Malaysian officials including the Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kedah State Councillor, Director General of Malaysian Ministry of Health, and Langkawi Island Police Chief were present at the hospital. The hospital compound were put under the highest security perimeters by the Royal Malaysian Police. He was discharged on 3 March and was transported back to Norway on a medical evacuation flight to continue his recovery in a hospital, during which he would be on sick leave for two weeks. He received a permanent pacemaker on 12 March. Two days later, he was discharged but remained on sick leave. He resumed his duties on 22 April, with the royal household saying that his official activities would be reduced in light of his condition.\n\"Rebel Royals\".\nIn the Netflix documentary \"Rebel Royals\" featuring his daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway and son-in-law Durek Verrett, Verrett accused Harald, Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon of not \"knowing what racism was\" and said the king and queen hated everything he did and \"would always let M\u00e4rtha know\" he was the wrong boyfriend for her. Verrett said the first time that King Harald asked about his experiences of racism was when \"Oprah with Meghan and Harry\" aired, and that \"they didn't want a family discussion because they didn't want to treat me that way. They wanted to have a family discussion because they were afraid I might be the next one on Oprah.\" Norwegian media called the documentary and Verrett's statements a \"character assassination of the king and queen.\" Norwegian commentators said Verrett and M\u00e4rtha Louise \"are making fools of themselves.\"\nIn a speech during the 2025 Stortingsmiddag (dinner with members of the Storting) at the Royal Palace, Harald responded to the release of the documentary by jokingly proposing a sequel entitled \"\" (The King minute by minute).\nHonours and medals.\nThe King is a four-star general, an admiral, and formally the Supreme Commander of the Norwegian Armed Forces. The infantry battalion His Majesty the King's Guard are considered the King's and the Royal Family's bodyguards. They guard the Royal residences, including the Royal Palace, the Crown Prince Residence at Skaugum, and the Royal Mausoleum at Akershus Castle.\nNational honours and medals.\nThe King is Grand Master of the Royal Norwegian Order of Saint Olav and the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit.\nThe mark \u00b0 indicates honours mentioned on his official website http:// (see also https://).\nForeign honours.\nIn the British Army, Harald V was appointed an honorary general in 1994, and he was the final Colonel-in-Chief of the Green Howards. He is also an honorary Colonel in the British Royal Marines. He is patron of the Anglo-Norse Society in London, formerly together with Queen Elizabeth II, his second cousin. Harald is in the line of succession to the British throne, because of his descent from King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. He is a Stranger Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter, an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, and a Recipient of the Royal Victorian Chain, as well as numerous other orders of chivalry.\nNorthern European countries.\nThe mark \u00b0 indicates honours mentioned on his official website http:// (see also https://)\nOther countries.\nThe mark \u00b0 indicates honours mentioned on his official website http:// (see also https://)\nMiscellaneous honours.\nStill a prince at the time, Harald visited Mococa in the 1960s, receiving the title https:// on 28 February 1964.\nHarald V received an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law from Oxford University in 2006 (as did his father, King Olav, in 1937, and his grandfather, King Haakon, in 1943). The King also received honorary doctorates from Heriot-Watt University in Scotland in 1994, the University of Strathclyde in Scotland in 1985, Waseda University in Japan in 2001, and Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington, in 2015.

O'Bannon and co-produced by The Jim Henson Company and Hallmark Entertainment, originally for the Nine Network. It premiered in North America on the Sci-Fi Channel's \"SciFi Friday\" segment on 19 March 1999 (at 8:00 pm EST), as the network's anchor series. The Jim Henson Company is credited with the many alien looks, make-up and prosthetics; two regular characters on the show, the animatronic puppets Rygel and Pilot, were entirely Henson Creature Shop creations.\nAlthough the series was planned for five seasons, it was abruptly cancelled after production had ended on its fourth season, thus finishing the series on a cliffhanger. Co-producer Brian Henson later secured the rights to \"Farscape\", paving the way for a three-hour miniseries, \"\", which Henson himself directed. In 2007, it was announced that the creator was returning for a web series, though production has been repeatedly delayed. In December 2008, a comic book miniseries was released, in-continuity with both the television show and the potential online series.\nOverview.\n\"Farscape\" features a diverse ensemble cast of characters who are initially escaping from corrupt authorities in the form of a militaristic organization called the Peacekeepers. The protagonists live inside a large bio-mechanical ship called Moya which is a living entity. In the first episode, they are joined by the main character, John Crichton (Ben Browder), a modern-day American astronaut who accidentally flies into a wormhole near Earth during an experimental space flight. On the same day, another stranger is picked up by Moya: a Peacekeeper named Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black). Despite his best intentions, Crichton makes enemies, including the show's most prominent antagonist: Scorpius. There are a few standalone plots, and the show gradually unfolds progressive story arcs, beginning with the crew's recapture by the Peacekeepers, followed by Crichton's search to find another wormhole back to Earth, and an eventual arms race for wormhole technology weapons. Secondary arcs explore the ways the characters change due to their influences and adventures together, most notably Crichton and his obsession with wormhole technology, his relationship with Aeryn, and the neural clone of Scorpius in his brain that haunts him.\nProduction and broadcast.\nThe series was originally conceived in the early 1990s by Rockne S. O'Bannon and Brian Henson under the title \"Space Chase\". The series is told in a serialized format, with each episode involving a self-contained story while contributing to a larger storyline. Nearly the entire cast originates from Australia and New Zealand, except for American actor Ben Browder.\n\"Farscape\"'s characters frequently make use of slang such as \"frell\", \"dren\" and \"hezmana\" as a substitute for English expletives.\n\"Farscape\" first ran on the Australian TV Channel Nine Network and the Canadian YTV channel, then in the US on the Sci-Fi Channel and on BBC Two in the United Kingdom. The series' original broadcast on Sci-Fi was noted for its erratic scheduling, with hiatuses lasting months often occurring mid-season. For example, the final four episodes of Season 1 aired beginning in January 2000, nearly four months after the broadcast of the preceding episode; the final four episodes of Season 3 were separated from the rest of the season by a gap of more than six months.\nEach episode cost more than $1 million to make.\nPlot.\nSeason One.\nEarth astronaut John Crichton is unexpectedly hurled to an unknown part of the Milky Way galaxy via a wormhole. He finds himself in the middle of an escape attempt by Moya, a living spaceship, from the militaristic Peacekeepers, who had been using her as a prison transport. In the chaos, Crichton's space capsule has an accidental collision with a Peacekeeper fighter which results in the death of its pilot. Crichton's ship and another Peacekeeper fighter are brought into Moya's hold. Although the escape is successful, the Peacekeeper Captain, Bialar Crais, fixates on Crichton as the murderer of the pilot\u2014his brother\u2014and begins a campaign to chase Crichton down.\nThe various crew have no common goal, each only wishing to go home. Unfortunately, to evade Crais' pursuit, they have to travel into the Uncharted Territories, and thus have no idea how to get home. The other crew also have little respect for Crichton, seeing him only as a \"primitive hoo-man\" who does not understand even the basic tenets of life in space.\nVarious episodes explore the characters' backstories. Aeryn, the fighter pilot, begins to learn that the Peacekeepers are not always as correct as she had believed. Zhaan is forced to bring up the dark side she had worked to suppress. D'Argo admits he was framed for his wife's murder and has no idea where his child is. Rygel confronts his former jail keeper and torturer. A new character joins the crew, Chiana, a teenage thief on the run from her own repressive culture. And Moya herself becomes pregnant after a Peacekeeper experiment is accidentally activated.\nMeanwhile, Crichton continues to research the wormhole that brought him here. He is forced to sell what little progress he has made to an alien mechanic as payment for repairs on the Farscape module. He is also lured into a wormhole that seems to lead directly back to Earth, only to find the entire situation is a construct created by mysterious aliens called the Ancients, who are testing to see if Earth is suitable for colonization.\nTowards the end of the season, Aeryn is injured and the crew is forced to go to a Peacekeeper base to seek medical help. Crichton disguises himself as a Peacekeeper to gain access, but the base's commander, Scorpius, instantly sees through the ruse and imprisons Crichton, calling Crais to come collect him. Under torture, Crichton discovers that the Ancients placed specialized knowledge of wormholes in his subconscious mind\u2014knowledge that Scorpius is particularly eager to access. The other Moya crew members launch a rescue attempt.\nMeanwhile, Moya gives birth to her baby, discovering that the child, named Talyn, is a volatile hybrid warship designed by the Peacekeepers instead of the usual peaceful Leviathan. Upon Crais' arrival, Scorpius takes over his command. Crais defects to Moya to save himself, accepting along the way that Crichton had not meant to kill his brother. But this is only a cover to steal Talyn and escape on his own. Having grown much closer over the course of the season, the crew work together to escape Scorpius\u2014a plan that ends with Crichton and D'Argo floating in space, running out of air.\nSeason Two.\nThe crew of Moya are now on the run from Scorpius, who wants the wormhole knowledge locked in Crichton's brain for his own purposes. To avoid him the crew are forced into some unwise decisions and alliances, which often result in wacky, mind-altering hijinks for the crew.\nMoya encounters an independent Sebacean colony (Sebaceans being the race from which Peacekeepers are drawn), where the heir to the throne has been genetically poisoned by her younger brother so that she cannot procreate with any Sebacean male, which would allow him to take the throne instead. Recognising Crichton as a possible substitute to ensure the continued independence of her world, the Empress insists he , or else she will hand him over to Scorpius. Terrified of Scorpius after his experiences on the base, Crichton is . Aeryn, who has been growing attached to Crichton, finds herself jealous.\nDespite various plots by Peacekeepers and an agent of their enemies the Scarrans, the Moya crew manage to wheedle their way out once again, although the Princess is indeed left pregnant. Meanwhile, D'Argo and Chiana begin a relationship based mostly on sex, and Zhaan is tasked with protecting Moya by the Leviathian's creator-gods. Crichton to kill Scorpius, but finds himself unable to do it, blocked by some unknown cause.\nThat cause is revealed when Crichton is kidnapped by Scarrans\u00a0\u2013 during his torture on the base, Scorpius had implanted Crichton with a neural chip that contains a clone of his personality, designed to track down the wormhole knowledge and protect Crichton and Scorpius both until that knowledge is found. Crichton nicknames the clone Harvey and it begins to manifest as hallucinations to him.\nThe half-crazed mystic Stark\u00a0\u2013 whom Crichton had met while jailed at the base\u00a0\u2013 returns with information about D'Argo's son, Jothee. The boy is one of a lot of slaves, and they can rescue him by buying the entire lot. To afford to do that they will need to . The crew put a plan into action, which is complicated when Scorpius arrives. Scorpius has captured the slaves, but promises to give them Jothee if Crichton will turn himself in. Under intense pressure from the neural clone, Crichton does so.\nD'Argo is , and the crew move into action to save Crichton. Even Crais and Talyn . The rescue is successful, although Moya is severely damaged and Crichton is nearly insane from the effects of the neural clone. At the medical colony to fix them both, the clone takes control of Crichton, seemingly killing Aeryn just as she admits her love for him. With Aeryn dead, Crichton wants the chip removed once and for all. At the same time, Scorpius catches up with them again, killing the doctor and announcing that the chip has completed its work and found the wormhole knowledge. He removes the chip and leaves Crichton incapacitated at the hospital.\nSeason Three.\nHaving survived Scorpius' attack, the doctor saves Crichton by using biological material from a suitable donor\u00a0\u2013 an alien called an Interon which may be a cousin species to humans. Scorpius fools Crais into thinking he is dead to cover his escape with the neural chip, and Zhaan revives Aeryn, but at the cost of her own life. Feeling guilty over the death of the Interon donor, Crichton has the donor's still living relative brought aboard\u00a0\u2013 an arrogant scientist called Jool.\nInvestigating another wormhole, Moya belonging to a race called Pathfinders, experts in wormholes. the last of her life to separate the ships, adding more guilt to Crichton's conscience. He also discovers that despite the chip's removal, the personality clone Harvey remains in his mind.\nDue to a harrowing encounter with another escaped prisoner with a cloning device, Crichton ends up twinned\u00a0\u2013 a duplicate created so that there are two Crichtons, both equal and original. Talyn is attacked by the new Peacekeeper Commando chasing the crew \u2013 Xhalax Sun, Aeryn's mother. To escape her, Moya and Talyn starburst in opposite directions, splitting the crew, with one Crichton on each ship.\nOn Moya, tensions rise over D'Argo's breakup with Chiana, Jool's grating personality, and Crichton's increasing obsession with wormholes. An encounter with an alien Energy Rider also instils precognitive abilities in Chiana (or possibly only activates already present abilities). Meanwhile, Scorpius tries to access the wormhole data, but finds that the chip now contains a neural clone of Crichton, who refuses to allow Scorpius access.\nOn Talyn, Crais explains that Xhalax wants to recapture him as a renegade Peacekeeper, and to recapture Talyn as a powerful warship. After a vicious battle, Aeryn allows Crais to kill her mother. Crichton discovers that the mechanic, Furlow, has the wormhole data he gave her in the first season, and intends to sell it to the Scarrans. With the help of the Ancients, Crichton unlocks the wormhole knowledge just enough to destroy the Scarran ship, but suffers radiation exposure and .\nWhen the two crews finally reunite, Aeryn cannot face the remaining Crichton, and Talyn is becoming increasingly violent and uncontrollable. Crichton resolves to destroy the wormhole information that Scorpius has by and then crippling the project from within. In return for his help, Scorpius grants the Moya crew leniency for their crimes. But high-ranking Peacekeeper Commandant Grayza interferes, claiming that the Moya crew's continued freedom is an embarrassment and Scorpius' own obsession with wormhole tech does not outweigh their criminal record.\nCrichton finally decides that the only way to end Scorpius' project is to . Crais orders Talyn to starburst inside the ship, killing them both and destroying the entire Command Carrier. Believing they are finally free from pursuit, the crew buries Talyn's remains and splits up to go their own ways. But at the last second, a strange old woman formerly imprisoned on the Command Carrier informs Crichton that Aeryn is pregnant, and Moya is sucked into a wormhole, leaving Crichton once again alone in space.\nSeason Four.\nAlone for months, Crichton has had nothing to do but obsess over Aeryn and wormholes. He finally makes a breakthrough on the latter when he meets a supposed Leviathan specialist, Sikozu, on the run from her employers. When Chiana and Rygel also return, they , where Jool, D'Argo and the old woman \u2013 Noranti \u2013 have joined an Interon archaeological dig. They find artefacts that suggest a connection between humans, Sebaceans and Interons. Commandant Grayza interrupts, having taken Scorpius prisoner and \"kills\" him to show good faith to Crichton. Crichton wants nothing to do with her and .\nCrichton finds that Aeryn has made a deal with Scorpius to let him on Moya after he saved her life. Crichton keeps Scorpius imprisoned but remains paranoid that his former enemy is planning something. Despite Aeryn's desire to reconcile, he pushes her away, even going so far as to suppress his feelings with drugs. A Scarran agent invades Moya, since the Scarrans and Peacekeepers are in an arms race to acquire Crichton's wormhole knowledge.\nCrichton is instead kidnapped by an Ancient whom he nicknames Einstein, who explains to him the catastrophic danger if wormhole tech falls into the wrong hands. Returning from that meeting, the entire Moya crew accidentally ends up on Earth, providing humans with their first confirmed contact with extraterrestrials and alien technology. Crichton is finally home but finds that the world is too paranoid and distrustful to accept his alien friends due to 9/11 and the fact that the US government only wants to monopolize alien tech and knowledge for global domination. He has also been so affected by his experiences that he cannot relax there \u2013 a situation not helped when an agent of Grayza attacks and kills several of Crichton's friends. He decides the only thing he can do is leave again but he succeeds in convincing his father to make alien tech and knowledge to be shared equally globally much to the dismay of the US government.\nThe crew comes across a secret meeting between Grayza and a Scarran minister, at which Grayza sells out D'Argo's people in return for peace. In disrupting the meeting Aeryn is captured. Desperate to rescue her, Crichton promises to give Scorpius the wormhole tech in return for his help. They and rescue Aeryn but Scorpius is captured in the attempt. Crichton is happy to leave him there but the neural clone Harvey informs them that Scorpius already has the wormhole tech and may reveal it to the Scarrans under torture. The crew of Moya are forced to launch yet another attempt to either rescue or kill Scorpius.\nThey at the Scarrans' most important base, Katratzi, claiming to want to sell the tech to the highest bidder. Instead they start a riot between the Scarrans' various servant races, using a nuclear bomb and escape again. The Scarrans launch an attack against Earth \u2013 partly in retaliation but also to secure a source of Strelitzia plants. The plants are vital to a Scarran augmentation process and Crichton had inadvertently revealed to the Scarrans that they can be found on Earth. The peacekeepers promise to protect Earth in exchange for allegiance but Crichton disagrees since it means dragging humanity into perpetual war between two galactic powers. Crichton's only option to save his home world is to destroy the wormhole that leads there, leaving him stranded in space forever. Before destroying the wormhole, he says goodbye to his father and reveals that he has put a recording on the Moon near the site of the first Moon landing, containing technological data necessary for humanity to reach the stars in the future and protect themselves against alien threat.\nThat done, Scorpius returns to the Peacekeepers and the Moya crew go to the ocean planet Qujaga to recover. While there, Aeryn reveals that the pregnancy \u2013 formerly kept in stasis \u2013 has now been released and they are going to have a baby. Crichton proposes to her and she accepts. At the last second they are attacked by random aliens, who appear to kill them both.\nThe Peacekeeper Wars.\nThinking that Crichton is dead and the wormhole tech gone with him, Scorpius deliberately starts a war with the Scarrans in the hope that the element of surprise will be on their side. The tactic is unsuccessful, and the Scarrans are on the verge of overwhelming the Peacekeepers. When the Peacekeeper Grand Chancellor considers surrender, Grayza kills him and takes over to make sure the war continues.\nOn Qujaga the aliens, called Eidolons, realise that killing Crichton and Aeryn was a mistake and reanimate them. Scorpius instantly realizes this and abandons the war to track him down, hoping to acquire the wormhole tech once and for all as the only way of stopping the Scarrans. Crichton again refuses. Meanwhile, the crew discover that the Eidolons are in fact a lost colony of the people of Arnessk, and have an innate ability to bring peace to others. If they can find more of their people, they will be able to stop the war.\nMoya, with Scorpius and Sikozu in tow, heads back to Arnessk, where the ancient people have been revived and are working with Jool. They agree to help, but Scarran Emperor Staleek attacks, destroying the base and killing Jool. Staleek doesn't want peace \u2013 he wants victory. Only one Eidolon remains, who is able to transmit the ability to Stark, and the crew escape the Scarrans with the help of D'Argo's son Jothee.\nThey return to Qujaga to find that the Peacekeeper-Scarran war has reached the planet. Crichton and the others must get through the battle to reach the remaining Eidolons on the planet and pass the techniques of peace to them, all while both sides are still after him for wormhole technology. Once there, Crichton and Aeryn are finally able to marry and Aeryn gives birth, but D'Argo is fatally wounded in the escape and dies offscreen.\nRealising that neither side will take no for an answer, Crichton returns to Einstein and convinces him to unlock the knowledge, which Crichton then uses to launch a wormhole weapon \u2013 a black hole that will grow and grow until it destroys everything in the universe. Both Grayza and Staleek finally realise that this weapon is too dangerous for anyone to possess, and they agree to a ceasefire. Crichton is able to stop the black hole, but falls into a coma as a result.\nWith the war finally over, the Eidolons help broker a peace treaty between the two sides, but Crichton is still in a coma. He is finally brought out of it when Aeryn places his new baby in his arms. The new family looks out onto the now peaceful galaxy, naming the baby D'Argo in honour of their friend, and promising the universe belongs to him.\nCharacters.\nRecurring characters.\nAs the series progressed, a revolving cast of characters joined the crew of Moya.\nReception.\nAwards and distinctions.\nBetween 2000 and 2002, \"Farscape\" won three Saturn Awards for Best Syndicated/Cable TV Series and one Best TV Actor (Browder). Additionally, in 1999, it received nominations for Best TV Actress (Claudia Black) and Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television (Virginia Hey). In 2002, it received nominations for Best TV Actress (Black), Best Supporting TV Actor (Anthony Simcoe), and Best Supporting TV Actress (Gigi Edgley).\nOn 14 July 2005, ' received a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. In 2004 and 2007, \"Farscape\" was ranked #4 on \"TV Guides Top Cult Shows Ever.\nIn 2012, \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed the show at #22 in the \"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years,\" calling it \"one of the trippiest space sagas ever, with portions of some episodes taking place in Crichton's subconscious\" and remarking, \"Before \"Battlestar Galactica\" popularized \"frak\" as geek slang, there was \"Farscape\"'s very liberal use of \"frell\".\"\nEmpireOnline ranked it #45 of \"the 50 greatest TV shows of all time\" in February 2013.\nCancellation.\nIn September 2002, the Sci-Fi Channel (then-owned by Vivendi Universal) opted to withdraw its funding of the fifth season, canceling the show, just before the first half of the fourth season finished airing. The Sci-Fi Channel concluded that the series was too expensive to renew, as ratings had declined during the fourth season.\nFurthermore, The Jim Henson Company had been acquired by EM.TV &amp; Merchandising AG in 2000 and by 2002 they were experiencing significant financial difficulties. According to the DVD featurette \"Save Farscape\", Henson, Kemper, and Ben Browder announced the cancellation during an online chat with fans, and within hours fans had mounted a campaign to restore the show or transfer it to another network. Early plans to scrap the sets after production were postponed after news of the cancellation broke, partly as a result of the fan campaign. The sets were put in storage pending a possible future revival of the show.\nCartoonist Bill Amend, creator of the syndicated comic strip \"FoxTrot\", addressed the series' cancellation in an 8 October 2002 strip wherein the character Jason Fox petitioned to have the Sci-Fi channel renew \"Farscape\". Soon after the strip ran, Amend remarked that it \"generated more e-mails from readers than anything else I've done in the past. I had no idea that so many people owned computers, even I shudder to think what the mail boxes at the Sci-Fi Channel must be like these days.\"\nThe 2010 DVD release of the series on A&amp;E Home Video includes footage of producer David Kemper addressing the cast on the final day of shooting, in which he read a draft of a column for \"TV Guide\" by critic Matt Roush, who wrote that, in his opinion, the premature cancellation of \"Farscape\" will be looked upon by future generations in the same light as science fiction fans look upon NBC's cancellation of the original \"\" in 1969.\n\"Farscapes cancellation received considerable notice by news media. Thanks to the attention generated by the fan campaign, various financial backers in Europe offered their support to Brian Henson, and in 2004, The Jim Henson Company produced a three-hour mini-series to wrap up the series storyline entitled '.\nAnalysis.\n\"Farscape\" aired at a time when \"Star Trek\" was in decline. \"Farscape\", like the later \"Firefly\" and \"Battlestar Galactica\" (2004), was a spaceship-centered show that sought to distance itself from the \"Star Trek\" formula. \"Farscape\" featured a main character who constantly riffed on pop culture and a diverse cast of criminal fugitives; the series began as relatively unconnected episodes, but in later seasons transitioned into a complex plot with a dense mythology. Some reviewers, such as \"The A.V. Club\", praised the animatronic puppetry. Others, such as \"Entertainment Weekly\", were initially put off by the puppets and by the show as a whole. \"Space.com\" called it \"unlike anything that had come before it... bold, brilliant and a little bonkers\". According to a \"Vice\" reviewer, the show was ahead of its time in terms of feminist sci-fi.\nJames Gunn has credited \"Farscape\" as an inspiration for his \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" films.\n\"Stargate SG-1\" parody/homage.\nFollowing the series' cancellation, Ben Browder and Claudia Black were both cast as series regulars on \"Stargate SG-1\" during its final two seasons. At the start of season nine, when Black's character (Vala Mal Doran) first meets Browder's character (Cameron Mitchell), she tells him: \"I know we haven't met. That I'm sure I would remember.\"\nIn the 200th episode of the series, which was entitled \"200\", Vala, an alien who develops a skewed interest in Earth pop culture, pitches an idea for a film to a producer, who immediately recognises it as \"The Wizard of Oz\". After pitching a second idea which the producer recognises as \"Gilligan's Island\", he advises her that if she is going to rip something off, it should be something more obscure. This leads into a parody of \"Farscape\", with Black reprising her role of Aeryn Sun, and various \"SG-1\" characters dressed as D'Argo, Stark, Chiana, and Rygel. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) stands in for John Crichton, an in-joke referencing the resemblance between Browder and Shanks. Shanks was originally intended to play Stark in the episode, with Browder reprising the role of Crichton, but the parts were switched the day before filming at the behest of the actors. The scene also parodies the wide array of pseudo-swear words used in the show. The producer recognises all the stories that Black's character proposes, until she pitches the Farscape pastiche. As an in-joke, he says: \"Okay. You got me. I have no idea what that is.\"\nMultimedia.\nDVD releases.\nFor Region 1 releases, AD Vision originally issued \"Farscape\" in a series of two-episode discs for the first season, then two-disc volumes, five volumes per season for the remaining three, which were later collected into full season box sets. They later re-released the series in larger four-disc volumes under the \"Starburst Edition\" moniker, three volumes per season with additional extras not available on the original volume sets. All of these sets are long out of print.\n\"\" was released to DVD in January 2005 by Lions Gate Entertainment.\nA&amp;E Home Video released a \"Farscape\" Complete Series Collection and individual season sets. It includes a two-disc collection of featurettes, most of which were recycled from ADV's old DVD sets but notably adding \"Farscape Undressed\", a \"Farscape\" special that was created between the second and third seasons to catch up fans on the events that had happened up to that point. \"The Peacekeeper Wars\" is not included in the complete series set because Lions Gate still retains the rights to the miniseries although upon its release, US retailer Best Buy had a limited number of complete series sets which did include \"The Peacekeeper Wars\" as a store exclusive. The two miniseries discs were identical to those of the normal Lions Gate release and were included in the last DVD case along with the two discs of bonus material that normally come with the complete series set.\nThe Region 2 and Region 4 box sets contain Seasons 1\u20134 as well as the \"Peacekeeper Wars\" television film.\nBlu-ray release.\nAll four seasons were released on Blu-ray in North America and Europe on 15 November 2011 by New Video/A&amp;E. The four seasons were released in a choice of complete boxed set or individual seasons in North America, and as a boxed set only in Europe. As the original 35mm prints used to create the series are missing, 576i/25 frames per second PAL master videotapes were used as the source material to create the transfer. Software algorithms were used to upscale the standard definition image to Blu-ray's 1080p resolution specification. The audio on the Blu-ray release is uncompressed DTS Master Audio, improving on the previous compressed Dolby Digital tracks on DVD.\nLike the previous DVD release, owing to licensing issues, the set does not include \"Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars\".\nAs with the U.S. DVD reissue in 2009, there are 31 commentary tracks and all the special features were carried over from the previously released DVD editions. The Blu-ray release also includes a recently filmed exclusive HD featurette, \"Memories of Moya\", featuring interviews with the cast and production staff as they reminisce about their time on \"Farscape\".\nOn November 5, 2013, a 15th anniversary set was released on Blu-ray.\nOn November 19, 2019, a second Blu-ray set was released, this time by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and this time, it included \"Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars\", but excluding the comic included in A&amp;E's 2013 Blu-ray release.\nOn November 21, 2023, a third Blu-ray set was released, this time by Shout! Studios.\nOther releases.\nIn January 2008, seasons 1 and 2 were made available for download through Apple's iTunes Store for customers in the United States. Season 3 was added in March 2008, with Season 4 following in May. The episodes can be purchased individually or as entire seasons. The \"Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars\" miniseries has yet to be made available through iTunes.\nBeginning in January 2011, seasons one through four were also available on the Netflix \"Watch Instantly\" service. As of 2013[ [update]], seasons one through four were no longer available on Netflix, as they unexpectedly did not renew. However, from 11 November 2013 through 5 November 2016, all four seasons were once again available for online streaming. The miniseries \"Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars\" is also available from Netflix on DVD.\nAs of February\u00a02, 2014[ [update]], Hulu offered two of the four seasons on their streaming service as well.\nAs of August 2023, all four seasons as well as \"Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars\" are available on various streaming platforms like Tubi, YouTube PrimeTime, Xumo TV &amp; Peacock . They are also continually broadcast on the Farscape channel on Sling TV, Shout Factory TV and others.\nThe running order of the first half of the first season on Netflix is different from the DVD release. While there are times when shows are broadcast in a different order from what was intended and they then try to correct many years later for the sake of building up stories and characters, but for continuity, it would seem that the DVD releases are proper as opposed to Netflix. One specific instance is that D'Argo's Qualta blade is transformed as a munitions weapon by the second or third episode from the Netflix release, yet several episodes later, that was revealed for the first time that it had that ability.\nWebisodes.\nOn 15 July 2007, it was announced that Farscape would return in ten webisode installments. The episodes are expected to be a few minutes long each and may eventually be broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel. The webisodes were to have been launched as early as fall 2007. In an interview with \"TV Guide\", Brian Henson stated that the webisodes will be 3\u20136 minutes long and may feature John and Aeryn's son, D'Argo Sun-Crichton. \"TV Guide\" also reported that Ben Browder is in talks to appear in the webisodes. Sci-Fi Wire reported that Brian Henson and Rockne O'Bannon would pen the episodes.\nSeveral news sources have reported that the web series may lead to an on-air revival of the series, but Sci Fi general manager Dave Howe said that there were no plans to revive the show. Brian Henson has stated that he hopes the webisodes would lead to a TV sequel.\nAt the \"Farscape\" Convention in November 2007, Rockne S. O'Bannon stated that the webisodes would likely be released in 2008. Farscape star Ben Browder told SCI FI Wire that he looked forward to reprising the role of astronaut John Crichton in the webisodes. The 2008 writers' strike put a damper on the plans, and Browder said that it was too early to figure out to what extent he would be involved. Browder said that he had a brief discussion with Henson about the Web series at the 2007 Comic-Con International in San Diego:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They haven't come to me with any specifics yet, and I don't read anything into that. But at Comic-Con, Brian discussed it and said, 'Yeah, we're still figuring it out.' The writers' strike happened immediately after that, ... and a lot of things went on hold, and it will take a little while before a number of things get going again.\nAt Comic-Con 2008, Rockne O'Bannon announced that the ongoing \"Farscape\" comic series would tie into the upcoming webisodes. The first comic was scheduled for release in November 2008. On 4 December 2008, O'Bannon told MTV \"There's a new character that you'll meet in the very first comic book who ends up a significant player in the webisodes. Villain or hero? I'm not saying!\"\nOn 10 June 2009, Maureen Ryan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" announced via Twitter, \"Farscape webisodes are 'still in play.' they're still being developed but not yet at script stage.\"\nAt the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, Brian Henson stated that the webisodes were \"ready to go\" but that they were still looking for financing on the project.\nAt the 10th Anniversary Farscape Convention in Los Angeles, 2009, Brian Henson again stated that they are still waiting for funding. Ben Browder was asked how the fans could help with funding, and said he wasn't sure what could be done.\nThe \"Final Frelling Farscape Convention\", was held on 17 November 2011 at the Marriott LAX hotel in Los Angeles.\nMinisodes.\nChris Hardwick of The Nerdist Podcast announced in March 2012 that The Nerdist YouTube channel would host re-cut \"Farscape\" episodes in the form of minisodes. The first minisode, hosted by Ben Browder, went online on 14 July 2012.\nLiterature.\nBoxtree in the UK and Tor Books in the U.S. published three \"Farscape\" novels: \"House of Cards\" by Keith R.A. DeCandido, \"Dark Side of the Sun\" by Andrew Dymond, and \"Ship of Ghosts\" by David Bischoff. A fourth novel was commissioned to be written by DeCandido but did not surface after the show's cancellation.\nScott K. Andrews' \"Uncharted Territory: An Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide To Farscape\" (Virgin Publishing 2002, ) covered Farscape's first three seasons exhaustively. Paul Simpson wrote \"The Illustrated Farscape Companion\" series for Titan Books, one book per season (Book 1 with David Hughes; Books 2 and 3 with photographer Ruth Thomas) with exclusive official content.\n\"The Creatures of Farscape: Inside Jim Henson's Creature Shop\", released in 2004, offered a colorful look inside the famous creature shop that created the stunning array of creatures and make-up effects. It includes previously unseen and behind the scenes images, exclusive contributions from the show's stars and make-up artists, and a foreword by executive producer Brian Henson.\n\"Farscape Forever! Sex, Drugs and Killer Muppets\" released 28 September 2005; in which Science fiction and fantasy authors analyse several aspects of the TV series. Contributors include Martha Wells on characters Crichton and D'Argo's buddy relationship, P. N. Elrod on the villains she loves to hate, and Justina Robson on sex, pleasure, and feminism. Topics range from a look at how Moya was designed and an examination of vulgarity and bodily functions to a tourist's budget guide to the \"Farscape\" universe.\nShortly after season 3 began airing, Titan Magazines released a \"Farscape\" magazine. Available bi-monthly, the magazine was published from April/May 2001 through the 12th issue of April/May 2003. The magazine had a in-depth material, including interviews with the cast and crew, behind the scenes information on many episodes, original fiction (by O'Bannon, DeCandido, Greg Cox, John Kenneth Muir, and others), and a regular column by David Kemper. There were two versions of the magazine produced each issue, with the only difference being the front cover, and the magazine also had two special issues\u2014a season 3 special (issue 7), and the final issue (issue 12) containing an episode guide for the four seasons to date, as well as sketches for ideas and the \"Horizons\" fiction.\n\"Horizons\" fiction.\nIn the final issue of its run, the \"Farscape\" magazine published a piece of fiction written by series creator Rockne S. O'Bannon. Set a long time after the end of the fourth season, this details the subsequent adventures of the Moya crew. Since \"Horizons\" was written before the \"Peacekeeper Wars\" miniseries, there are some plot inconsistencies.\nComics.\nWildstorm Productions.\nDuring 2002, Wildstorm Productions produced a two-part \"Farscape\" comic entitled \"War Torn\", with the first part available in April and the second in May. The comics featured two stories, each spanning both issues. \"War Torn\", the main story, featured the Moya crew becoming ensnared in a war between two planets over a third, and took up roughly three quarters of the comic. \"Fourth Horseman \u2013 featuring Chiana\" was a Chiana-only story as she came across old friends and foes on the run from the Nebari. Both stories seem to have been set during Season 2. The second issue also included a double-page spread of some of the preliminary sketches.\nBOOM! Studios.\n\"Farscape\" returned to the comic form in 2008 through a partnership between The Jim Henson Company and BOOM! Studios that fit into established Farscape canon following \"The Peacekeeper Wars\". Three 4-issue miniseries (\"The Beginning of the End of the Beginning\", \"Strange Detractors\", and \"Gone and Back\") were published from December 2008 through June 2009 before a monthly \"Farscape\" series began in July 2009. The ongoing series ran for 24 issues over four story arcs: \"Tangled Roots\" (4 issues), \"Red Sky at Morning\" (4 issues), \"Compulsions\" (4 issues), and \"The War for the Uncharted Territories\" (12 issues).\nIn addition to the main series, BOOM! also published three 4-issue miniseries between April 2009 and March 2010 under the \"Farscape: Uncharted Tales\" title. \"D'Argo's Lament\" took place during the third season of the television series while \"D'Argo's Trial\" and \"D'Argo's Quest\" took place between the third and fourth seasons.\nFollowing the conclusion of \"Uncharted Tales\", BOOM! published an 8-issue miniseries titled \"Farscape: Scorpius\" from April 2010 through November 2010 which takes place concurrently with the main comic series and ends with a crossover between the two titles.\nThe 4-issue story arc series were published in a hardcover format in 2009. Later stories were published in a softcover format in 2011.\nA 25th anniversary one-shot comic was published in August 2024.\nGames.\nA video game based on the television series was produced by Red Lemon Studios and released mid-2002 for Microsoft Windows. Set during the first season, the game featured voice acting by the original cast of the television series. Reviews of the game, however, were generally negative, with many reviewers citing poor gameplay mechanics.\nA \"Farscape\" table-top role-playing game was released by Alderac Entertainment Group in 2002. It uses the d20 System and includes creatures not appearing in the established television universe. The game also features an original short story by Keith R. A. DeCandido set during the first season, after the episode \"The Flax\" and entitled \"Ten Little Aliens\". The game was nominated for ENnie awards for \"Best Graphic Design and Layout\" and \"Best d20 Game\" in 2003.\nContinuation.\nIn February 2014, it was reported that a screenplay for a new \"Farscape\" film was in development. At WonderCon in April 2014, Rockne S. O'Bannon confirmed to Nerdacy that a \"Farscape\" film is in development but in very early stages. In an interview with The Paley Center for Media in late 2017, O'Bannon confirmed that work on a film is still ongoing.\nIn August 2018, in an interview by \"https://\", Brian Henson talked about what's holding up the return of \"Farscape\". \"I've been trying really hard with \"Farscape\". And I'm going to keep trying. It's just not quite right still.\" He added, \"It's one of those instances where it's us, the creators, who need to keep working on it. And feeling no: that didn't work that time. No, it's still not quite working. It's really down to us.\"\nAt the 2018 \"Jim Henson's Creature Shop Challenge Live!\", Brian Henson said: {\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It might be in public or private ownership, be accessible to all, or have restrictions in place. Although primarily concerned with visual art, art museums are often used as a venue for other cultural exchanges and artistic activities, such as lectures, jewelry, performance arts, music concerts, or poetry readings. Art museums also frequently host themed temporary exhibitions, which often include items on loan from other collections.\nTerminology.\nAn institution dedicated to the display of art can be called an art museum or an art gallery, and the two terms may be used interchangeably. This is reflected in the names of institutions around the world, some of which are considered art galleries, such as the National Gallery in London and Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, and some of which are considered museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo.\nThe phrase \"art gallery\" is also sometimes used to describe businesses which display art for sale, but these are not art museums.\nHistory.\nPrivate collections.\nThroughout history, large and expensive works of art have generally been commissioned by religious institutions or political leaders and been displayed in temples, churches, and palaces. Although these collections of art were not open to the general public, they were often made available for viewing for a section of the public. In classical times, religious institutions began to function as an early form of art gallery. Wealthy Roman collectors of engraved gems and other precious objects, such as Julius Caesar, often donated their collections to temples. It is unclear how easy it was in practice for the public to view these items.\nIn Europe, from the Late Medieval period onwards, areas in royal palaces, castles, and large country houses of the social elite were often made partially accessible to sections of the public, where art collections could be viewed. At the Palace of Versailles, entrance was restricted to people of certain social classes who were required to wear the proper apparel, which typically included the appropriate accessories, silver shoe buckles and a sword, could be hired from shops outside. The treasuries of cathedrals and large churches, or parts of them, were often set out for public display and veneration. Many of the grander English country houses could be toured by the respectable for a tip to the housekeeper, during the long periods when the family were not in residence.\nSpecial arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with most of the paintings of the Orleans Collection, which were housed in a wing of the Palais-Royal in Paris and could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy, the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the 18th century onwards, and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The Capitoline Museums began in 1471 with a donation of classical sculpture to the city of Rome by the Papacy, while the Vatican Museums, whose collections are still owned by the Pope, trace their foundation to 1506, when the recently discovered \"Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons\" was put on public display. A series of museums on different subjects were opened over subsequent centuries, and many of the buildings of the Vatican were purpose-built as galleries. An early royal treasury opened to the public was the Green Vault of the Kingdom of Saxony in the 1720s.\nPrivately funded museums open to the public began to be established from the 17th century onwards, often based around a collection of the cabinet of curiosities type. The first such museum was the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, opened in 1683 to house and display the artefacts of Elias Ashmole that were given to Oxford University in a bequest.\nPublic museums.\nThe Kunstmuseum Basel, through its lineage which extends back to the Amerbach Cabinet, which included a collection of works by Hans Holbein the Younger and purchased by the city of Basel in 1661, is considered to be the first museum of art open to the public in the world.\nIn the second half of the 18th century, many private collections of art were opened to the public, and during and after the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, many royal collections were nationalized, even where the monarchy remained in place, as in Spain and Bavaria.\nIn 1753, the British Museum was established and the Old Royal Library collection of manuscripts was donated to it for public viewing. In 1777, a proposal to the British government was put forward by MP John Wilkes to buy the art collection of the late Sir Robert Walpole, who had amassed one of the greatest such collections in Europe, and house it in a specially built wing of the British Museum for public viewing. After much debate, the idea was eventually abandoned due to the great expense, and twenty years later, the collection was bought by Tsaritsa Catherine the Great of Russia and housed in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\nThe Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) was opened to the public in 1779 and the Medici collection in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery). The opening of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre during the French Revolution in 1793 as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection marked an important stage in the development of public access to art by transferring the ownership to a republican state; but it was a continuation of trends already well established.\nThe building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries were opened to the public in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. In Great Britain, however, the corresponding Royal Collection remained in the private hands of the monarch, and the first purpose-built national art galleries were the Dulwich Picture Gallery, founded in 1814 and the National Gallery, London opened to the public a decade later in 1824. Similarly, the National Gallery in Prague was not formed by opening an existing royal or princely art collection to the public, but was created from scratch as a joint project of some Czech aristocrats in 1796.\nThe Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. is generally considered to have been the first art museum in the United States. It was originally housed in the Renwick Gallery, built in 1859. Now a part of the Smithsonian Institution, the Renwick housed William Wilson Corcoran's collection of American and European art. The building was designed by James Renwick Jr. and finally completed in 1874. It is located at 1661 Pennsylvania Avenue NW. Renwick designed it after the Louvre's Tuileries addition. At the time of its construction, it was known as \"the American Louvre\".\nUniversity museums and galleries.\nUniversity art museums and galleries constitute collections of art developed, owned, and maintained by all kinds of schools, community colleges, colleges, and universities. This phenomenon exists in the West and East, making it a global practice. Although easily overlooked, there are over 700 university art museums in the US alone. This number, compared to other kinds of art museums, makes university art museums perhaps the largest category of art museums in the country. While the first of these collections can be traced to learning collections developed in art academies in Western Europe, they are now associated with and housed in centers of higher education of all types.\nGalleries as a specific section in museums.\nThe word \"gallery\" being originally an architectural term, the display rooms in museums are often called \"public galleries\". Also frequently, a series of rooms dedicated to specific historic periods (e.g. Ancient Egypt) or other significant themed groupings of works (e.g. the gypsotheque or collection of plaster casts as in the Ashmolean Museum) within a museum with a more varied collection are referred to as specific galleries, e.g. \"Egyptian Gallery\" or \"Cast Gallery\".\nVisual art not shown in a gallery.\nWorks on paper, such as drawings, pastels, watercolors, prints, and photographs are typically not permanently displayed for reasons of conservation. Instead, public access to these materials is provided by a dedicated print room located within the museum. Murals or mosaics often remain where they have been created (in situ), although many have also been removed to galleries. Various forms of 20th-century art, such as land art and performance art, also usually exist outside a gallery. Photographic records of these kinds of art are often shown in galleries, however. Most museums and large art galleries own more works than they have room to display. The rest are held in reserve collections, on or off-site.\nA sculpture garden is similar to an art gallery, presenting sculpture in an outdoor space. Sculpture has grown in popularity with sculptures installed in open spaces on both a permanent and temporary basis.\nArchitecture.\nMost larger paintings from about 1530 onwards were designed to be seen either in churches or palaces, and many buildings built as palaces now function successfully as art museums. By the 18th century additions to palaces and country houses were sometimes intended specifically as galleries for viewing art, and designed with that in mind. The architectural form of the entire building solely intended to be an art gallery was arguably established by Sir John Soane with his design for the Dulwich Picture Gallery in 1817. This established the gallery as a series of interconnected rooms with largely uninterrupted wall spaces for hanging pictures and indirect lighting from skylights or roof lanterns.\nThe late 19th century saw a boom in the building of public art galleries in Europe and America, becoming an essential cultural feature of larger cities. More art galleries rose up alongside museums and public libraries as part of the municipal drive for literacy and public education.\nOver the middle and late twentieth century, earlier architectural styles employed for art museums (such as the Beaux-Arts style of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City or the Gothic and Renaissance Revival architecture of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum) succumbed to modern styles, such as Deconstructivism. Examples of this trend include the Guggenheim Museum in New York City by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao by Frank Gehry, Centre Pompidou-Metz by Shigeru Ban, and the redesign of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art by Mario Botta. Some critics argue these galleries defeat their purposes because their dramatic interior spaces distract the eye from the paintings they are supposed to exhibit.\nCultural aspects.\nMuseums are more than just mere 'fixed structures designed to house collections.' Their purpose is to shape identity and memory, cultural heritage, distilled narratives and treasured stories. Many art museums throughout history have been designed with a cultural purpose or been subject to political intervention. In particular, national art galleries have been thought to incite feelings of nationalism. This has occurred in both democratic and non-democratic countries, although authoritarian regimes have historically exercised more control over administration of art museums. Ludwig Justi was for example dismissed as director of the Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery) in Berlin in 1933 by the new Nazi authorities for not being politically suitable.\nThe question of the place of the art museum in its community has long been under debate. Some see art museums as fundamentally elitist institutions, while others see them as institutions with the potential for societal education and uplift. John Cotton Dana, an American librarian and museum director, as well as the founder of the Newark Museum, saw the traditional art museum as a useless public institution, one that focused more on fashion and conformity rather than education and uplift. Indeed, Dana's ideal museum would be one best suited for active and vigorous use by the average citizen, located near the center of their daily movement. In addition, Dana's conception of the perfect museum included a wider variety of objects than the traditional art museum, including industrial tools and handicrafts that encourage imagination in areas traditionally considered mundane. This view of the art museum envisions it as one well-suited to an industrial world, indeed enhancing it. Dana viewed paintings and sculptures as much less useful than industrial products, comparing the museum to a department store. In addition, he encouraged the active lending-out of a museum's collected objects in order to enhance education at schools and to aid in the cultural development of individual members of the community. Finally, Dana saw branch museums throughout a city as a good method of making sure that every citizen has access to its benefits. Dana's view of the ideal museum sought to invest a wider variety of people in it, and was self-consciously not elitist.\nSince the 1970s, a number of political theorists and social commentators have pointed to the political implications of art museums and social relations. Pierre Bourdieu, for instance, argued that in spite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts, people's artistic preferences (such as classical music, rock, traditional music) strongly tie in with their social position. So called cultural capital is a major factor in social mobility (for example, getting a higher-paid, higher-status job). The argument states that certain art museums are aimed at perpetuating aristocratic and upper class ideals of taste and excludes segments of society without the social opportunities to develop such interest. The fine arts thus perpetuate social inequality by creating divisions between different social groups. This argument also ties in with the Marxist theory of mystification and elite culture.\nFurthermore, certain art galleries, such as the National Gallery in London and the Louvre in Paris are situated in buildings of considerable emotional impact. The Louvre in Paris is for instance located in the former Royal Castle of the ancient regime, and is thus clearly designed with a political agenda. It has been argued that such buildings create feelings of subjugation and adds to the mystification of fine arts. Research suggests that the context in which an artwork is being presented has significant influence on its reception by the audience, and viewers shown artworks in a museum rated them more highly than when displayed in a \"laboratory\" setting\nOnline museums.\nMuseums with major web presences.\nMost art museums have only limited online collections, but a few museums, as well as some libraries and government agencies, have developed substantial online catalogues. Museums, libraries, and government agencies with substantial online collections include:\nOnline art collections.\nThere are a number of online art catalogues and galleries that have been developed independently of the support of any individual museum. Many of these, like American Art Gallery, are attempts to develop galleries of artwork that are encyclopedic or historical in focus, while others are commercial efforts to sell the work of contemporary artists.\nA limited number of such sites have independent importance in the art world. The large auction houses, such as Sotheby's, Bonhams, and Christie's, maintain large online databases of art which they have auctioned or are auctioning. Bridgeman Art Library serves as a central source of reproductions of artwork, with access limited to museums, art dealers, and other professionals or professional organizations.\nFolksonomy.\nThere are also online galleries that have been developed by a collaboration of museums and galleries that are more interested with the categorization of art. They are interested in the potential use of folksonomy within museums and the requirements for post-processing of terms that have been gathered, both to test their utility and to deploy them in useful ways.\nThe steve.museum is one example of a site that is experimenting with this collaborative philosophy. The participating institutions include the Guggenheim Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\nOrganizations.\nThere are relatively few local/regional/national organizations dedicated specifically to art museums. Most art museums are associated with local/regional/national organizations for the arts, humanities or museums in general. Many of these organizations are listed as follows:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the second largest desert in Australia after the Great Victoria Desert and encompasses an area of . The Gibson Desert lies to the south and the Tanami Desert lies to the east of the Great Sandy Desert.\nFeatures.\nThe Great Sandy Desert contains large ergs, often consisting of longitudinal dunes.\nIn the north-east of the desert there is a meteorite impact crater, the Wolfe Creek crater.\n\"Fairy circles\", which are circular patches of land barren of plants, varying between in diameter and often encircled by a ring of stimulated growth of grass, are found in the western part of the desert, in the Pilbara region. It has not yet been proven what causes these formations, but one theory suggests that they have been built and inhabited by Australian harvester termites since the Pleistocene.\nPopulation.\nThe region is sparsely populated. The main populations consist of Aboriginal Australian communities and mining centres. The Aboriginal people of the desert fall into two main groups, the Martu in the west and the Pintupi in the east. Linguistically, they are speakers of multiple Western Desert languages. Many of these Indigenous people were forcibly removed from their lands during the late 18th, 19th, and the early 20th centuries, to be relocated to other settlements, such as Papunya in the Northern Territory. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, some of the original inhabitants returned. Young adults, from the Great Sandy Desert region, travel to and work in the Wilurarra Creative programs to maintain and develop their culture, and a greater sense of community.\nClimate.\nRainfall is low throughout the coast and, especially further north, is strongly seasonal. Areas near the Kimberley have an average rainfall that exceeds , but can be patchy. Many dry years end with a monsoon cloud mass or a tropical cyclone. Like many of Australia's deserts, precipitation is high by desert standards, but with the driest regions recording total rainfall a little below . The heat of Australia\u2019s ground surface, in turn, creates a massive evaporation cycle, which partially explains the higher-than-normal desert rainfall. This region is one which gives rise to the heat lows, which help drive the NW monsoon. Almost all the rain regionally comes from monsoon thunderstorms, or the occasional tropical cyclone rain depression.\nAnnually, for most of the area, there are about 20\u201330 days where thunderstorms form. However, in the north and bordering the Kimberley, 30-40 per year is the average.\nSummer daytime temperatures are some of the highest in Australia. Regions further south average , except when monsoonal cloud cover is active. Several people have died in this region during seasonal flooding, after their vehicles were stuck or broken down on remote dirt roads. Conversely, a few travellers have had their vehicles malfunction during the hottest times of the year, with dehydration, sun exposure and heatstroke being the predominant causes of death. Winters are short and warm; temperatures range from .\nFrost does not occur in most of the area. The regions bordering the Gibson Desert in the far southeast may record a light frost or two every year. Away from the coast winter nights can still be chilly in comparison to the warm days.\nEconomy.\nIndigenous art is a huge industry in central Australia. Mines, most importantly the Telfer gold mine and Nifty copper mine, and cattle stations are found in the far west. Telfer is one of the largest gold mines in Australia. The undeveloped Kintyre uranium deposit lies south of Telfer.\nFauna and flora.\nThe vegetation of the Great Sandy Desert is dominated by spinifex.\nAnimals in the region include feral camels and dingoes. Other mammalian inhabitants include bilbies, mulgara, marsupial moles, rufous hare-wallabies, and red kangaroos. \nVaried types of lizards occur here, such as goannas (including the large perentie), thorny devils, and bearded dragons.\nSome of the bird-life found within the desert include the rare Alexandra's parrot, the mulga parrot and the scarlet-chested parrot.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "66078", "revid": "44744109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66078", "title": "Auction bridge", "text": "Card game of the trick-taking family\nAuction bridge was the first form of bridge in which players bid to declare a contract in their chosen trump suit or no trumps. It was first recorded as being played in Bath around 1904. The Bath Club and Portland Club met in 1908 and issued a super-set of rules for Bridge that covered the bidding and penalty for failing to make a contract in Auction Bridge. Early forms were rudimentary and unbalanced and the British and Americans could not agree over the bidding ranking and use of artificial bids, resulting in The Whist Club of New York and The Portland Club issuing competing sets of rules.\nBy the 1920s, \"Royal Auction Bridge with the New Count\" had fixed most of the problems. After books on the new game were published by leading Bridge authors it quickly became popular and replaced what remained of Whist and earlier forms of Bridge. It also replaced 500 in much of the US after that game died out around 1920. \nIn 1925, aboard the , Harold Vanderbilt play tested his version of Contract Bridge, which used the same rules as Auction Bridge for the bidding and play but featured completely new scoring tables. After quickly becoming popular in Southampton and Newport, Vanderbilt's Contract Bridge was adopted by the Whist Club Of New York in 1927 and the Portland Club in 1929; by the end of 1929 it was the only bridge game being played in the clubs of NY and London. \nNow known as just Auction Bridge, the game continued to be played socially for many decades.\nHistory.\nIt is not certain to whom auction bridge should be credited. A letter in \"The Times\" (London), January 16, 1905, signed by Oswald Crawfurd, describes auction bridge as first played in 1904.\nBidding was not common in England, though it had been used in Dummy Whist, Quadrille, Solo Whist, and Five Hundred. \nA book by \"John Doe\" (Francis Reginald Roe), published in Allahabad, India, in 1899, puts forward auction bridge as an invention of three members of the Indian Civil Service stationed at an isolated community, designed as a three-handed form of bridge to compensate the lack of a fourth player. Their key contribution was the concept of competitive bidding for the declaration.\nIn the earlier superseded Auction Bridge rules, the dealer opens the bidding and must declare to win at least the odd trick in a trump suit or at notrump. The penalty for a 1S opening was capped at -100, even if it went 7 off doubled.\nIn UK Auction Bridge, as it was a gambling game, bids were ranked by point value of the contract then level. So, 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 (8 points) beats 3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660 (6 points) but 4&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2660 (8 points) beats 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Cards/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2665 (8 points) because it is a higher level. This meant an overbid could not reduce the value of the contract at stake. Conversely, Americans ranked bids by level and then suit, as in modern Contract Bridge. \nDuring World War I a variant called Plafond (ceiling) was created in France by adding the idea of a \"contract\", wherein only tricks bid and made counted towards Game or Slam, while overtricks were bonuses scored above the line. Plafond was successful in France and parts of Canada, particularly among expert players, because accurate high-level bidding was rewarded. It was played by Vanderbilt, but Plafond failed to gain acceptance in New York.\nPlay.\nThe bidding and play are the same as Contract Bridge.\nScoring.\nAuction Bridge New Count scoring is as follows:\nTricks (below the line)\nBonuses (above the line)\nDoubles\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers, that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.\nOnline shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever they want. The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly. Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores. This way they save time and the cost of traveling. A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.\nShoppers' shopping experiences may vary. They are based on a variety of factors including how the customer is treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nIn antiquity, marketplaces and fairs were established to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. People would shop for goods at a regular market in nearby towns. However, the transient nature of stalls and stall-holders meant the consumers needed to make careful inspection of goods prior to purchase. In ancient Greece, the agora served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods.\nAncient Rome utilized a similar marketplace known as the forum. Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. Trajan's Market at Trajan's forum, built around 100-110CE, was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with tabernae that served as retail shops, situated on four levels. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shopfront. In the Roman world, the central market primarily served the local peasantry. Those who lived on the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating their need to attend local markets.\nShopping lists are known to have been used by Romans. One such list was discovered near Hadrian's Wall dated back to 75\u2013125 CE and written for a soldier.\nMiddle Ages.\nArchaeological evidence suggests that the British engaged in minimal shopping in the early Middle Ages. Instead, they provided for their basic needs through subsistence farming practices and a system of localised personal exchanges. However, by the late Middle Ages, consumers turned to markets for the purchase of fresh produce, meat and fish and the periodic fairs where non-perishables and luxury goods could be obtained. Women were responsible for everyday household purchases, but most of their purchasing was of a mundane nature. For the main part, shopping was seen as a chore rather than a pleasure.\nRelatively few permanent shops were to be found outside the most populous cities. Instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen. Itinerant vendors such as costermongers, hucksters and peddlers operated alongside markets, providing the convenience of home delivery to households, and especially to geographically isolated communities.\nIn the more populous European cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. Specialist retailers such as mercers and haberdashers were known to exist in London, while grocers sold \"miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines.\" However, these shops were primitive. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than \"rude booths.\"\nThe medieval shopper's experience was very different from that of the contemporary shopper. Interiors were dark and shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Glazed windows in retail environments, were virtually unknown during the medieval period. Goods were rarely out on display; instead retailers kept the merchandise at the rear of the store and would only bring out items on request. The service counter was virtually unknown and instead, many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.\nIn Britain, medieval attitudes to retailing and shopping were negative. Retailers were no better than hucksters, because they simply resold goods, by buying cheaper and selling dearer, without adding value of national accounts. Added to this were concerns about the self-interest of retailers and some of their more unethical practices. Attitudes to spending on luxury goods also attracted criticism, since it involved importing goods which did little to stimulate national accounts, and interfered with the growth of worthy local manufacturers.\nShopping for pleasure.\nThe modern phenomenon of shopping for pleasure is closely linked to the emergence of a middle class in the 17th and 18th-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or bourgeoisie stimulated demand for luxury goods and began to purchase a wider range of luxury goods and imported goods, including: Indian cotton and calico; silk, tea and porcelain from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. The act of shopping came to be seen as a pleasurable pastime or form of entertainment.\nBy the 17th-century, produce markets gradually gave way to shops and shopping centres; which changed the consumer's shopping experience. The New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the Strand was one such example of a planned shopping centre. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. Restoration London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield.\nMuch pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying conspicuous consumption and private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good. This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of Bernard Mandeville's influential work \"Fable of the Bees\" in 1714, in which he argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.\nThese trends gathered momentum in the 18th century, as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household, and the new status of goods as status symbols, related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility. The pottery inventor and entrepreneur, Josiah Wedgewood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes. One of his preferred sales techniques was to stage expansive showcases of wares in this private residences or in a rented hall, to which he invited the upper classes.\nAs the 18th-century progressed, a wide variety of goods and manufactures were steadily made available for the urban middle and upper classes. This growth in consumption led to the rise of 'shopping' - a proliferation of retail shops selling particular goods and the acceptance of shopping as a cultural activity in its own right. Specific streets and districts became devoted to retail, including the Strand and Piccadilly in London.\nThe rise of window shopping as a recreational activity accompanied the use of glass windows in retail shop-fronts. By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Britain, Europe and in the Antipodes in what became known as the \"arcade era.\" Typically, these arcades had a roof constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Inside the arcade, individual stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices.\nDesigned to attract the genteel middle class, retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos of daily street life; a place shoppers could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, promenading in these arcades became a popular pastime for the emerging middle classes.\nIn Europe, the Palais-Royal, which opened in 1784, became one of the earliest examples of the new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, caf\u00e9s, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building. In London, one of the first to use display windows in shops was retailer, Francis Place, who experimented with this new retailing method at his tailoring establishment in Charing Cross, where he fitted the shop-front with large plate glass windows. Although this was condemned by many, he defended his practice in his memoirs, claiming that he:\nsold from the window more goods...than paid journeymen's wages and the expenses of housekeeping.\nRetailers designed attractive shop fronts to entice patronage, using bright lights, advertisements and attractively arranged goods. The goods on offer were in a constant state of change, due to the frenetic change in fashions. A foreign visitor commented that London was \"a world of gold and silver plate, then pearls and gems shedding their dazzling lustre, home manufactures of the most exquisite taste, an ocean of rings, watches, chains, bracelets, perfumes, ready-dresses, ribbons, lace, bonnets, and fruits from all the zones of the habitable world\".\nEvolution of stores: from arcades to department stores.\nIn the second half of the 19th-century, shops transitioned from 'single-function' shops selling one type of good, to the department store where a large variety of goods were sold. As economic growth, fueled by the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the 19th-century, steadily expanded, the affluent bourgeois middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group was the catalyst for the emergence of the retail revolution of the period.\nThe term, \"department store\" originated in the United States. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops. A number of major department stores opened across the US, Britain and Europe from the mid nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; Selfridges of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; Bloomingdale's in 1861; Sak's in 1867; J.C. Penney in 1902; of France in 1852 and Galeries Lafayette of France in 1905.\nThe first reliably dated department store to be established, was Harding, Howell &amp; Co, which opened in 1796 on Pall Mall, London. This venture was described as being a public retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the business partnership was dissolved. Department stores were established on a large scale from the 1840s and 50s, in France, the United Kingdom and the US. French retailer, Le Bon Marche, is an example of a department store that has survived into current times Originally founded in 1838 as a lace and haberdashery store, it was revamped mid-century and opened as a department store in 1852.\nMany of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.\nShopping venues.\nShopping hubs.\nA larger commercial zone can be found in many cities, more formally called a central business district, but more commonly called \"downtown\" in the United States, or the \"high street\" in Britain, and souks in Arabic speaking areas.\nShopping hubs, or shopping centers, are collections of stores; that is a grouping of several businesses in a compact geographic area. It consists of a collection of retail, entertainment and service stores designed to serve products and services to the surrounding region.\nTypical examples include shopping malls, town squares, flea markets and bazaars.\nTraditionally, shopping hubs were called bazaars or marketplaces; an assortment of stalls lining streets selling a large variety of goods.\nThe modern shopping centre is now different from its antecedents, the stores are commonly in individual buildings or compressed into one large structure (usually called \"Mall\" in the USA).\nThe first modern shopping mall in the US was The Country Club Plaza in Kansas City which opened in 1922, from there the first enclosed mall was designed by Victor http:// and opened in 1956 as Southdale Centre in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.\nMalls peaked in America in the 1980s-1990s when many larger malls (more than 37,000 sq m in size) were built, attracting consumers from within a 32\u00a0km radius with their luxurious department stores.\nDifferent types of malls can be found around the world. \"Superregional malls\" are very large malls that contain at least five department stores and 300 shops. This type of mall attracts consumers from a broad radius (up to a 160-km). A \"regional mall\" can contain at least two department stores or \"anchor stores\". One of the biggest malls in the world is the one near Miami, called \"Sawgrass Mills Mall\": it has 2,370,610 square feet (220,237 m2) of retail selling space, with over 329 retail outlets and name brand discounters.\nThe smaller malls are often called open-air strip centres or mini-marts and are typically attached to a grocery store or supermarket.\nThe smaller malls are less likely to include the same features of a large mall such as an indoor concourse, but are beginning to evolve to become enclosed to comply with all weather and customer preferences.\nStores.\nStores are divided into multiple categories of stores which sell a selected set of goods or services. Usually they are tiered by target demographics based on the disposable income of the shopper. They can be tiered from cheap to pricey.\nSome shops sell secondhand goods. Often the public can also sell goods to such shops. In other cases, especially in the case of a nonprofit shop, the public donates goods to these shops, commonly known as thrift stores in the United States, charity shops in the United Kingdom, or op shops in Australia and New Zealand. In give-away shops goods can be taken for free. In antique shops, the public can find goods that are older and harder to find. Sometimes people are broke and borrow money from a pawn shop using an item of value as collateral. College students are known to resell books back through college textbook bookstores. Old used items are often distributed through surplus stores.\nVarious types of retail stores that specialize in the selling of goods related to a theme include bookstores, boutiques, candy shops, liquor stores, gift shops, hardware stores, hobby stores, pet stores, pharmacies, sex shops and supermarkets.\nOther stores such as big-box stores, hypermarkets, convenience stores, department stores, general stores, dollar stores sell a wider variety of products not horizontally related to each other.\nHome shopping.\nHome mail delivery systems and modern technology (such as television, telephones, and the Internet), in combination with electronic commerce, allow consumers to shop from home. There are three main types of home shopping: mail or telephone ordering from catalogs; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as periodicals, TV and radio); and online shopping. Online shopping has completely redefined the way people make their buying decisions; the Internet provides access to a lot of information about a particular product, which can be looked at, evaluated, and comparison-priced at any given time. Online shopping allows the buyer to save the time and expense, which would have been spent traveling to the store or mall. According to technology and research firm Forrester, mobile purchases or mcommerce will account for 49% of ecommerce, or $252 billion in sales, by 2020\nNeighborhood shopping.\nConvenience stores are common in North America, and are often called \"bodegas\" in Spanish-speaking communities or \"d\u00e9panneurs\" in French-speaking ones. Sometimes peddlers and ice cream trucks pass through neighborhoods offering goods and services. Also, garage sales are a common form of second hand resale.\nNeighbourhood shopping areas and retailers give value to a community by providing various social and community services (like a library), and a social place to meet. Neighbourhood retailing differs from other types of retailers such as destination retailers because of the difference in offered products and services, location and popularity. Neighbourhood retailers include stores such as; Food shops/marts, dairies, Pharmacies, Dry cleaners, Hairdressers/barbers, Bottle shops, Caf\u00e9s and take-away shops . Destination retailers include stores such as; Gift shops, Antique shops, Pet groomers, Engravers, Tattoo parlour, Bicycle shops, Herbal dispensary clinics, Art galleries, Office Supplies and framers. The neighbourhood retailers sell essential goods and services to the residential area they are located in. There can be many groups of neighbourhood retailers in different areas of a region or city, but destination retailers are often part of shopping malls where the numbers of consumers is higher than that of a neighbourhood retail area. The destination retailers are becoming more prevalent as they can provide a community with more than the essentials, they offer an experience, and a wider scope of goods and services.\nParty shopping.\nThe party plan is a method of marketing products by hosting a social event, using the event to display and demonstrate the product or products to those gathered, and then to take orders for the products before the gathering ends.\nShopping activity.\nShopping seasons.\nShopping frenzies are periods of time where a burst of spending occurs, typically near holidays in the United States, with Christmas shopping being the biggest shopping spending season, starting as early as October and continuing until after Christmas.\nSome religions regard such spending seasons as being against their faith and dismiss the practice. Many contest the over-commercialization and the response by stores that downplay the shopping season often cited in the War on Christmas.\nThe National Retail Federation (NRF) also highlights the importance of back-to-school shopping for retailers which comes second behind holiday shopping, when buyers often buy clothing and school supplies for their children. In 2017, Americans spent over $83 billion on back-to-school and back-to-college shopping, according to the NRF annual survey.\nSeasonal shopping consists of buying the appropriate clothing for the particular season. In winter people bundle up in warm layers and coats to keep warm, while in summer people wear less clothing to stay cooler in the heat. Seasonal shopping now revolves a lot around holiday sales and buying more for less. Stores need to get rid of all of their previous seasonal clothing to make room for the new trends of the upcoming season. The end-of-season sales usually last a few weeks with prices lowering further towards the closing of the sale. During sales items can be discounted from 10% up to as much as 50%, with the biggest reduction sales occurring at the end of the season. Holiday shopping periods are extending their sales further and further with holidays such as Black Friday becoming a month-long event stretching promotions across November . These days shopping doesn't stop once the mall closes, as people have more access to stores and their sales than ever before with the help of the internet and apps. Today many people research their purchases online to find the cheapest and best deal with one third of all shopping searches on Google happen between 10:00 pm and 4:00 am. Shoppers are now spending more time consulting different sources before making a final purchasing decision. Shoppers once used an average of five sources for information before making a purchase, but numbers have risen to as high as 12 sources in 2014.\nSpree shopping.\nSpree shopping, or \u2018going on a shopping spree\u2019, is an individual period of intense and indulgent shopping involving many purchases, which differs from both normal shopping and compulsive shopping in its scope and purpose. One study reportedly showed that the pleasure centers of the brain were stimulated during a shopping spree similarly to the stimulation experienced during sexual activity. A shopping spree may be \"especially problematic for those whose immediate release of tension is followed by subsequent feelings of guilt, sadness, anger, or despair over what turned out to be an unwanted purchase\".\nPricing and negotiation.\nHistorically, prices were established through a system of barter or negotiation. The first retailer to adopt fixed prices is thought to be the retailers operating out of the Palais-Royal complex in the 18th-century. These retailers adopted a system of high price maintenance in order to cultivate images of luxury. For their upper class clientele, fixed prices spared them from hassle of bartering.\nThe pricing technique used by most retailers is \"cost-plus pricing\". This involves adding a markup amount (or percentage) to the retailers' cost. Another common technique is \"manufacturers suggested list\" pricing. This simply involves charging the amount suggested by the manufacturer and usually printed on the product by the manufacturer.\nIn retail settings, \"psychological pricing\" or \"odd-number pricing\" are both widely used. Psychological pricing which refers to a range of tactics, designed to have a positive psychological impact. For example, price tags using the terminal digit \"9\" (e.g., 9.99, 19.99, or 199.99) can be used to signal price points and bring an item in at just under the consumer's reservation price. However, in Chinese societies, prices are generally either a round number or sometimes some lucky number. This creates price points.\nIn a fixed-price system, consumers may still use bargaining or \"haggling\"; a negotiation about the price. Economists see this as determining how the transaction's total economic surplus will be divided between consumers and producers. Neither party has a clear advantage because the threat of no sale exists, in which case the surplus would vanish for both.\nWhen shopping online, it can be more difficult to negotiate price given that you are not directly interacting with a sales person. Some consumers use price comparison services to locate the best price and/or to make a decision about who or where to buy from to save money.\n\"Window shopping\".\n\"Window shopping\" is a term referring to the browsing of goods by a consumer with or without the intent to purchase. Window shopping is often practised by a particular segment, known as the recreation-conscious or hedonistic shopper. Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's engagement in the purchase process, and recreational shoppers are those consumers who see the act of shopping as a form of enjoyment. Other consumers use window shopping as part of their planning activity for a later purchase.\nShowrooming, the practice of examining merchandise in a traditional retail store without purchasing it, but then shopping online to find a lower price for the same item, has become an increasingly prevalent problem for traditional retailers as a result of online competitors, so much so that some have begun to take measures to combat it.\nUtility cycling.\nIn countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He led the French Army to victory at the nine-month-long Battle of Verdun, for which he was called \"the Lion of Verdun\" (). After the failed Nivelle Offensive and subsequent mutinies, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief and succeeded in restoring control. P\u00e9tain remained in command for the rest of the war and emerged as a national hero. During the interwar period, he was head of the peacetime French Army, commanded joint Franco-Spanish operations during the Rif War and served twice as a government minister. During this time he was known as (\"the Old Marshal\").\nOn 16 June 1940, with the imminent Fall of France and the government desire for an armistice, Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned, recommending to President Albert Lebrun that he appoint P\u00e9tain in his place, which he did that day, while the government was at Bordeaux. The government then resolved to sign armistice agreements with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The entire government subsequently moved briefly to Clermont-Ferrand, then to the town of Vichy in central France. It voted to transform the French Third Republic into the French State, better known as Vichy France, an authoritarian puppet regime that was allowed to govern the southeast of France and which collaborated with the Axis powers. After Germany and Italy occupied all of France in November 1942, P\u00e9tain's government worked closely with the German military administration.\nAfter the war, P\u00e9tain was tried and convicted for treason. He was originally sentenced to death, but due to his age and World War I service his sentence was commuted to life in prison. His journey from military obscurity, to hero of France during World War I, to collaborationist ruler during World War II, led his successor Charles de Gaulle to declare that P\u00e9tain's life was \"successively banal, then glorious, then deplorable, but never mediocre\".\nP\u00e9tain, who was 84 years old when he became Prime Minister and later Head of State, remains both the oldest person to become the head of government and the oldest person to become the head of state of France.\nEarly life.\nP\u00e9tain was born into a peasant family in Cauchy-\u00e0-la-Tour, in the Pas-de-Calais department, northern France, on 24 April 1856. He was one of five children of Omer-Venant P\u00e9tain (1816\u20131888), a farmer, and Clotilde Legrand (1824\u20131857), and was their only son. His father had previously lived in Paris, where he worked for photography pioneer Louis Daguerre, before returning to the family farm in Cauchy-\u00e0-la-Tour following the Revolution of 1848. One of his great-uncles, a Catholic priest, Father Abbe Lefebvre (1771\u20131866), served in the \"Grande Arm\u00e9e\" during the Napoleonic Wars.\nP\u00e9tain's mother died when he was 18 months old, and he was raised by relatives after his father remarried. He attended the Catholic boarding school of Saint-Bertin in the nearby town of Saint-Omer, where he was an excellent student, showing an aptitude for geography and arithmetic. In 1875, with the intention of preparing for the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, P\u00e9tain enrolled in the Dominican college of Albert-le-Grand in Arcueil.\nEarly military career.\nP\u00e9tain was admitted to Saint-Cyr in 1876, beginning his career in the French Army. Between graduating in 1878 and 1899, he served in various garrisons with different battalions of the chasseurs, the elite light infantry of the French Army. Thereafter, he alternated between staff and regimental assignments.\nP\u00e9tain's career progressed slowly, as he rejected the French Army philosophy of the furious infantry assault, arguing instead that \"firepower kills\". His views were later proved to be correct during the First World War. He was promoted to captain in 1890 and major (\"chef de bataillon\") in 1900. In March 1904, by then serving in the 104th Infantry, he was appointed adjunct professor of applied infantry tactics at the \"\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre\", and following promotion to lieutenant-colonel was promoted to professor on 3 April 1908. He was brevetted to colonel on 1 January 1910.\nUnlike many French officers, P\u00e9tain served mainly in mainland France, never French Indochina or any of the African colonies, although he participated in the Rif campaign in Morocco. As colonel, he was given command of the 33rd Infantry Regiment at Arras on 25 June 1911; a young lieutenant, Charles de Gaulle, who served under him, later wrote that his \"first colonel, P\u00e9tain, taught (him) the Art of Command\". In the spring of 1914, he was given command of a brigade (still with the rank of colonel). By then aged 58 and having been told he would never become a general, P\u00e9tain had bought a villa for retirement.\nFirst World War.\nBeginning of war.\nP\u00e9tain led his brigade at the Battle of Guise (29 August 1914). The following day, he was promoted to brigade general to replace brigade general Pierre Peslin, who had taken his own life. He was given command of the 6th Division in time for the First Battle of the Marne; little over a month later, in October 1914, he was promoted yet again and became XXXIII Corps commander. After leading his corps in the spring 1915 Artois Offensive, in July 1915 he was given command of the Second Army, which he led in the Champagne Offensive that autumn. He acquired a reputation as one of the more successful commanders on the Western Front.\nBattle of Verdun.\nP\u00e9tain commanded the Second Army at the start of the Battle of Verdun in February 1916. During the battle, he was promoted to Commander of Army Group Centre, which contained a total of 52 divisions. Rather than holding down the same infantry divisions on the Verdun battlefield for months, akin to the German system, he rotated them out after only two weeks on the front lines. His decision to organise truck transport over the \"Voie Sacr\u00e9e\" to bring a continuous stream of artillery, ammunition, and fresh troops into besieged Verdun also played a key role in grinding down the German onslaught to a final halt in July 1916. In effect, he applied the basic principle that was a mainstay of his teachings at the \u00c9cole de Guerre (War College) before World War I: \"le feu tue!\" or \"firepower kills!\"\u00a0\u2013 in this case meaning French field artillery, which fired over 15 million shells on the Germans during the first five months of the battle. Although P\u00e9tain did say \"On les aura!\" (an echoing of Joan of Arc, roughly: \"We'll get them!\"), the other famous quotation often attributed to him \u2013 \"Ils ne passeront pas!\" (\"They shall not pass\"!) \u2013 was actually uttered by Robert Nivelle who succeeded him in command of the Second Army at Verdun in May 1916. At the very end of 1916, Nivelle was promoted over P\u00e9tain to replace Joseph Joffre as French Commander-in-Chief.\nMutiny.\nBecause of his high prestige as a soldier's soldier, P\u00e9tain served briefly as Army Chief of Staff (from the end of April 1917). He then became Commander-in-Chief of the entire French army, replacing General Nivelle, whose Chemin des Dames offensive failed in April 1917 and thereby provoked widespread mutinies in the French Army. They involved, to various degrees, nearly half of the French infantry divisions stationed on the Western Front. P\u00e9tain restored morale by talking to the men, promising no more suicidal attacks, providing rest for exhausted units, home furloughs, and moderate discipline. He held 3400 courts martial; 554 mutineers were sentenced to death but over 90% had their sentences commuted. The mutinies were kept secret from the Germans and their full extent and intensity were not revealed until decades later. Gilbert and Bernard find multiple causes:\nThe immediate cause was the extreme optimism and subsequent disappointment at the Nivelle offensive in the spring of 1917. Other causes were pacifism, stimulated by the Russian Revolution and the trade-union movement, and disappointment at the nonarrival of American troops.\nP\u00e9tain conducted some successful but limited offensives in the latter part of 1917, while the British carried out an offensive at Passchendaele that autumn. P\u00e9tain, instead, held off from major French offensives until the Americans arrived in force on the front lines, which did not happen until the early summer of 1918. He was also waiting for the new Renault FT tanks to be introduced in large numbers, hence his statement at the time: \"J'attends les chars et les Am\u00e9ricains\" (\"I am waiting for the tanks and the Americans.\")\nEnd of World War I.\nThe year 1918 saw major German offensives on the Western Front. The first of these, Operation Michael in March 1918, threatened to split the British and French forces apart, and, after P\u00e9tain had threatened to retreat on Paris, the Doullens Conference was called. Just prior to the main meeting, Prime Minister Clemenceau claimed he heard P\u00e9tain say \"les Allemands battront les Anglais en rase campagne, apr\u00e8s quoi ils nous battront aussi\" (\"the Germans will beat the English in open country, then they'll beat us as well\"). He reported this conversation to President Raymond Poincar\u00e9, adding \"surely a general should not speak or think like that?\" Haig recorded that P\u00e9tain had \"a terrible look. He had the appearance of a commander who had lost his nerve\". P\u00e9tain believed \u2013 wrongly \u2013 that Gough's Fifth Army had been routed like the Italians at Caporetto. At the Conference, Ferdinand Foch was appointed as Allied Generalissimo, initially with powers to co-ordinate and deploy Allied reserves where he saw fit. P\u00e9tain eventually came to the aid of the British and secured the front with forty French divisions.\nP\u00e9tain proved a capable opponent of the Germans both in defence and through counter-attack. The third offensive, \"Bl\u00fccher\", in May 1918, saw major German advances on the Aisne, as the French Army commander (Humbert) ignored P\u00e9tain's instructions to defend in depth and instead allowed his men to be hit by the initial massive German bombardment. By the time of the last German offensives, Gneisenau and the Second Battle of the Marne, P\u00e9tain was able to defend in depth and launch counter offensives, with the new French tanks and the assistance of the Americans. Later in the year, P\u00e9tain was stripped of his right of direct appeal to the French government and requested to report to Foch, who increasingly assumed the co-ordination and ultimately the command of the Allied offensives. On the day of the armistice, P\u00e9tain wanted to continue offensive operations into Germany to prevent another war but was overruled by Foch.\nAfter the war ended P\u00e9tain was made Marshal of France on 21 November 1918.\nInterwar period.\nRespected hero of France.\nP\u00e9tain ended the war regarded \"without a doubt, the most accomplished defensive tactician of any army\" and \"one of France's greatest military heroes\" and was presented with his baton of Marshal of France at a public ceremony at Metz by President Poincar\u00e9 on 8 December 1918. He was summoned to be present at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919. His job as Commander-in-Chief came to an end with peace and demobilisation, and with Foch out of favour after his quarrel with the French government over the peace terms, it was P\u00e9tain who, in January 1920, was appointed Vice-Chairman of the revived \"Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la Guerre\" (Supreme War Council). This was France's highest military position, whose holder was Commander-in-Chief designate in the event of war and who had the right to overrule the Chief of the General Staff (a position held in the 1920s by P\u00e9tain's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Buat and Debeney), with P\u00e9tain holding the vice chairmanship until 1931. P\u00e9tain was encouraged by friends to go into politics, although he protested that he had little interest in running for an elected position. He nevertheless tried and failed to get himself elected President following the November 1919 elections.\nShortly after the war, P\u00e9tain had placed before the government plans for a large tank and air force, but \"at the meeting of the \"Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la D\u00e9fense Nationale\" of 12 March 1920, the Finance Minister, Fran\u00e7ois-Marsal, announced that although P\u00e9tain's proposals were excellent they were unaffordable\". In addition, Fran\u00e7ois-Marsal announced reductions \u2013 in the army from fifty-five divisions to thirty, in the air force, and did not mention tanks. It was left to the Marshals, P\u00e9tain, Joffre, and Foch, to pick up the pieces of their strategies. The General Staff, now under General Edmond Buat, began to think seriously about a line of forts along the frontier with Germany, and their report was put forward on 22 May 1922. The three Marshals supported this. The cuts in military expenditure meant that taking the offensive was now impossible and a defensive strategy was all they could have.\nRif War.\nP\u00e9tain was appointed Inspector-General of the Army in February 1922, and produced, in concert with the new Chief of the General Staff, General Marie-Eug\u00e8ne Debeney, the new army manual entitled \"Provisional Instruction on the Tactical Employment of Large Units\", which soon became known as 'the Bible'. On 3 September 1925, P\u00e9tain was appointed sole Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in Morocco to launch a major campaign against the Rif tribes, in concert with the Spanish Army, which was successfully concluded by the end of October. He was subsequently decorated in Toledo by King Alfonso XIII with the Spanish \"Medalla Militar\".\nVocal critic of defence policy.\nIn 1924 the National Assembly was elected on a platform of reducing the length of national service to one year, to which P\u00e9tain was almost violently opposed. In January 1926, the Chief of Staff, General Debeney, proposed to the \"Conseil\" a \"totally new kind of army. Only 20 infantry divisions would be maintained on a standing basis\". Reserves could be called up when needed. The \"Conseil\" had no option in the straitened circumstances but to agree. P\u00e9tain disapproved of the whole thing, pointing out that North Africa still had to be defended and in itself required a substantial standing army. But he recognised, after the new Army Organisation Law of 1927, that the tide was flowing against him. He would not forget that the Radical leader, \u00c9douard Daladier, even voted against the whole package, on the grounds that the Army was still too large.\nOn 5 December 1925, after the Locarno Treaty, the \"Conseil\" demanded immediate action on a line of fortifications along the eastern frontier to counter the already proposed decline in manpower. A new commission for this purpose was established, under Joseph Joffre, and called for reports. In July 1927 P\u00e9tain himself went to reconnoitre the whole area. He returned with a revised plan and the commission then proposed two fortified regions. The Maginot Line, as it came to be called, (named after Andr\u00e9 Maginot the former Minister of War) thereafter occupied a good deal of P\u00e9tain's attention during 1928, when he also travelled extensively, visiting military installations up and down the country. P\u00e9tain had based his strong support for the Maginot Line on his own experience of the role played by the forts during the Battle of Verdun in 1916.\nCaptain Charles de Gaulle continued to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of P\u00e9tain throughout these years. He even allegedly named his eldest son after the Marshal, although it is more likely that he named his son after his family ancestor Jean Baptiste Philippe de Gaulle, before finally falling out over the authorship of a book he had said he had ghost-written for P\u00e9tain.\nElection to the \"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\".\nIn 1928, P\u00e9tain had supported the creation of an independent air force removed from the control of the army, and on 9 February 1931, following his retirement as Vice-Chairman of the Supreme War Council, he was appointed Inspector-General of Air Defence. His first report on air defence, submitted in July that year, advocated increased expenditure. In 1931 P\u00e9tain was elected a Fellow of the \"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\". By 1932 the economic situation had worsened and \u00c9douard Herriot's government had made \"severe cuts in the defence budget... orders for new weapons systems all but dried up\". Summer manoeuvres in 1932 and 1933 were cancelled due to lack of funds, and recruitment to the armed forces fell off. In the latter year General Maxime Weygand claimed that \"the French Army was no longer a serious fighting force\". \u00c9douard Daladier's new government retaliated against Weygand by reducing the number of officers and cutting military pensions and pay, arguing that such measures, apart from financial stringency, were in the spirit of the Geneva Disarmament Conference.\nIn 1938, P\u00e9tain encouraged and assisted the writer Andr\u00e9 Maurois in gaining election to the \"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\" \u2013 an election which was highly contested, in part due to Maurois' Jewish origin. Maurois made a point of acknowledging with thanks his debt to P\u00e9tain in his 1941 autobiography, \"Call no man happy\"\u00a0\u2013 though by the time of writing their paths had sharply diverged, P\u00e9tain having become Head of State of Vichy France while Maurois went into exile and sided with the Free French.\nMinister of War.\nPolitical unease was sweeping the country and, on 6 February 1934, the Paris police fired on a group of far-right rioters outside the Chamber of Deputies, killing 14 and wounding a further 236. President Lebrun invited 71-year-old Doumergue to come out of retirement and form a new \"government of national unity\". On 8 February, P\u00e9tain was invited to join the new French cabinet as Minister of War, which he only reluctantly accepted after many representations.\nHis important success that year was in getting Daladier's previous proposal to reduce the number of officers repealed. He improved the recruitment programme for specialists and lengthened the training period by reducing leave entitlements. However, Weygand reported to the Senate Army Commission that year that the French Army still could not resist a German attack. Marshals Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey and Hubert Lyautey (the latter died suddenly in July) added their names to the report. After the autumn manoeuvres, which P\u00e9tain had reinstated, a report was presented to P\u00e9tain that officers had been poorly instructed, had little basic knowledge and no confidence. He was also told by Maurice Gamelin that, if the plebiscite in the Territory of the Saar Basin went for Germany, \"it would be a serious military error\" for the French Army to intervene. P\u00e9tain responded by again petitioning the government for further funds for the army.\nDuring this period, he repeatedly called for a lengthening of the term of compulsory military service for conscripts from two to three years, to no avail. P\u00e9tain accompanied President Lebrun to Belgrade for the funeral of King Alexander, who had been assassinated on 6 October 1934 in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a Bulgarian nationalist from IMRO. Here he met Hermann G\u00f6ring and the two men reminisced about their experiences in the Great War. \"When G\u00f6ring returned to Germany he spoke admiringly of P\u00e9tain, describing him as a 'man of honour'\".\nCritic of government policy.\nIn November, the Doumergue government fell. P\u00e9tain had previously expressed interest in being named Minister of Education (as well as of War), a role in which he hoped to combat what he saw as the decay in French moral values. Now, however, he refused to continue in Flandin's short-lived government as Minister of War and stood down \u2013 in spite of a direct appeal from Lebrun himself. At this moment an article appeared in the newspaper \"Le Petit Journal\", calling for P\u00e9tain as a candidate for a dictatorship. 200,000 readers responded to the paper's poll. P\u00e9tain came first, with 47,000, ahead of Pierre Laval's 31,000 votes. These two men travelled to Warsaw for the funeral of the Polish Marshal Pi\u0142sudski in May 1935 (and another cordial meeting with G\u00f6ring). Although \"Le Petit Journal\" was conservative, P\u00e9tain's high reputation was bipartisan; socialist L\u00e9on Blum called him \"the most human of our military commanders\". P\u00e9tain did not get involved in non-military issues when in the Cabinet, and unlike other military leaders he did not have a reputation as an extreme Catholic or a monarchist.\nHe remained on the \"Conseil superieur\". Weygand had been at the British Army 1934 manoeuvres at Tidworth Camp in June and was appalled by what he had seen. Addressing the \"Conseil\" on the 23rd, P\u00e9tain claimed that it would be fruitless to look for assistance to the United Kingdom in the event of a German attack. On 1 March 1935, P\u00e9tain's famous article appeared in the \"Revue des deux mondes\", where he reviewed the history of the army since 1927\u201328. He criticised the reservist system in France, and her lack of adequate air power and armour. This article appeared just five days before Adolf Hitler's announcement of Germany's new air force and a week before the announcement that Germany was increasing its army to 36 divisions. On 26 April 1936, the general election results showed 5.5\u00a0million votes for the Popular Front parties against 4.5\u00a0million for the Right on an 84% turnout. On 3 May, P\u00e9tain was interviewed in \"Le Journal\", where he launched an attack on the Franco-Soviet Pact, on Communism in general (France had the largest communist party in Western Europe), and on those who allowed Communists intellectual responsibility. He said that France had lost faith in her destiny. P\u00e9tain was now in his 80th year.\nSome argue that P\u00e9tain, as France's most senior soldier after Foch's death, should bear some responsibility for the poor state of French weaponry preparation before World War II. Others say that P\u00e9tain was one of many on a large committee responsible for national defence, and interwar governments frequently cut military budgets. In addition, with the restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty there seemed no urgency for vast expenditure until the advent of Hitler. It is argued that while P\u00e9tain supported the massive use of tanks he saw them mostly as infantry support, leading to the fragmentation of the French tank force into many types of unequal value spread out between mechanised cavalry (such as the SOMUA S35) and infantry support (mostly the Renault R35 tanks and the Char B1 bis). Modern infantry rifles and machine guns were not manufactured, with the sole exception of a light machine-rifle, the Mle 1924. The French heavy machine gun was still the Hotchkiss M1914, obsolete when compared to the new automatic weapons of German infantry. A modern infantry rifle was adopted in 1936 but very few of these MAS-36 rifles had been issued to the troops by 1940. A well-tested French semiautomatic rifle, the MAS 1938\u201339, was ready for adoption but it never reached the production stage until after World War II as the MAS 49. French artillery had not been modernised since 1918. The result of all these failings is that the French Army had to face the invading enemy in 1940 with the dated weaponry of 1918. P\u00e9tain had been made Minister of War in 1934, but could not reverse 15 years of inactivity and constant cutbacks. French aviation entered the War in 1939 without even the prototype of a bomber aeroplane capable of reaching Berlin and coming back. French industrial efforts in fighter aircraft were dispersed among several firms (Dewoitine, Morane-Saulnier and Marcel Bloch), each with its own models.\nBattle of France.\nReturn to government.\nIn March 1939, P\u00e9tain was appointed French ambassador to the newly recognized Nationalist government of Spain. P\u00e9tain had taught the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco \"many years ago at France's war college\" and was sent to Spain \"in the hope he would win his former pupil away from Italian and German influence.\" When World War II began in September, Daladier offered P\u00e9tain a position in his government, which P\u00e9tain turned down. However, after Germany invaded France, P\u00e9tain joined the new government of Paul Reynaud on 18 May 1940 as Deputy Prime Minister. Reynaud hoped that the hero of Verdun might instill a renewed spirit of resistance and patriotism in the French Army. Reportedly Franco advised P\u00e9tain against leaving his diplomatic post in Madrid, to return to a collapsing France as a \"sacrifice\".\nBy 26 May, the Allied lines had been shattered, and British forces had begun evacuating at Dunkirk. French commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand expressed his fury at British retreats and the unfulfilled promise of British fighter aircraft. He and P\u00e9tain regarded the military situation as hopeless. Colonel de Villelume subsequently stated before a parliamentary commission of inquiry in 1951 that Reynaud, as Premier of France, said to P\u00e9tain on that day that they must seek an armistice. Weygand said that he was in favor of saving the French army and that he \"wished to avoid internal troubles and above all anarchy\". Churchill's man in Paris, Edward Spears, urged the French not to sign an armistice, saying that if French ports were occupied by Germany, the United Kingdom would have to bomb them. Spears reported that P\u00e9tain did not respond immediately but stood there \"perfectly erect, with no sign of panic or emotion. He did not disguise the fact that he considered the situation catastrophic. I could not detect any sign in him of broken morale, of that mental wringing of hands and incipient hysteria noticeable in others.\" P\u00e9tain later remarked to Reynaud about this statement: \"your ally now threatens us.\"\nOn 5 June, following the fall of Dunkirk, there was a Cabinet reshuffle. Reynaud brought into his War Cabinet as Undersecretary for War the newly promoted Brigadier-General de Gaulle, whose 4th Armoured Division had launched one of the few French counterattacks the previous month. P\u00e9tain was displeased at de Gaulle's appointment. By 8 June, Paris was threatened, and the government was preparing to depart, although P\u00e9tain was opposed to such a move. During a cabinet meeting that day, Reynaud argued that before asking for an armistice, France would have to get the United Kingdom permission to be relieved from their accord of March 1940 not to sign a separate cease-fire. P\u00e9tain replied that \"the interests of France come before those of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom got us into this position, let us now try to get out of it.\" .\nFall of France.\nOn 10 June, the government left Paris for Tours. Weygand, the Commander-in-Chief, now declared that \"the fighting had become meaningless\". He, Minister of Finance Paul Baudouin, and several other members of the government were already set on an armistice. On 11 June, Churchill flew to the Ch\u00e2teau du Muguet, at Briare, near Orl\u00e9ans, where he put forward first his idea of a Breton redoubt, to which Weygand replied that it was just a \"fantasy\". Churchill then said the French should consider \"guerrilla warfare\". P\u00e9tain then replied that it would mean the destruction of the country. Churchill then said the French should defend Paris and reminded P\u00e9tain of how he had come to the aid of the British with forty divisions in March 1918, and repeated Clemenceau's words: I will fight in front of Paris, in Paris, and behind Paris. To this, Churchill subsequently reported, P\u00e9tain replied quietly, and with dignity that he had in those days, a strategic reserve of sixty divisions; now, there were none, and the British ought to be providing divisions to aid France. Making Paris into a ruin would not affect the final event. At the conference P\u00e9tain met de Gaulle for the first time in two years. P\u00e9tain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that P\u00e9tain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the Battle of the Marne in 1914, he replied that there was \"no comparison\" with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that P\u00e9tain was right about that much at least.\nOn 12 June, after a second session of the conference, the cabinet met and Weygand again called for an armistice. He referred to the danger of military and civil disorder and the possibility of a Communist uprising in Paris. P\u00e9tain and Minister of Information Prouvost urged the cabinet to hear Weygand out because \"he was the only one really to know what was happening\".\nChurchill returned to France on 13 June for another conference at Tours. Baudouin met his plane and immediately spoke to him of the hopelessness of further French resistance. Reynaud then put the cabinet's armistice proposals to Churchill, who replied that \"whatever happened, we would level no reproaches against France.\" At that day's cabinet meeting, P\u00e9tain strongly supported Weygand's demand for an armistice and read out a draft proposal to the cabinet where he spoke of the need to stay in France, to prepare a national revival, and to share the sufferings of our people. It is impossible for the government to abandon French soil without emigrating, without deserting. The duty of the government is, come what may, to remain in the country, or it could not longer be regarded as the government. Several ministers were still opposed to an armistice, and Weygand immediately lashed out at them for even leaving Paris. Like P\u00e9tain, he said he would never leave France.\nThe government moved to Bordeaux on 14 June, where French governments had fled German invasions in 1870 and 1914. By coincidence, that evening in Bordeaux, de Gaulle dined in the same restaurant as P\u00e9tain; he came over to shake his hand in silence and they never met again.\nThe Assembly, both Senate and Chamber, were also at Bordeaux and immersed themselves in the armistice debate. At cabinet on 15 June, Reynaud urged that France follow the Dutch example, that the Army should lay down its arms so that the fight could be continued from abroad. P\u00e9tain was sympathetic. P\u00e9tain was sent to speak to Weygand (who was waiting outside, as he was not a member of the cabinet) for around fifteen minutes. Weygand persuaded him that Reynaud's suggestion would be a shameful surrender. Chautemps then put forward a 'fudge' proposal, an enquiry about terms. The Cabinet voted 13\u20136 for the Chautemps proposal. Admiral Darlan, who had been opposed to an armistice until 15 June, now became a key player, agreeing provided the French fleet was kept out of German hands.\nP\u00e9tain replaces Reynaud.\nOn Sunday, 16 June 1940, President Roosevelt's reply to President Lebrun's requests for assistance came with only vague promises and saying that it was impossible for the President to do anything without Congressional approval. P\u00e9tain then drew a letter of resignation from his pocket, an act which was certain to bring down the government (he had persuaded Weygand to come to Bordeaux by telling him that 16 June would be the decisive day). Lebrun persuaded him to stay until Churchill's reply had been received. After lunch, Churchill's telegram arrived agreeing to an armistice provided the French fleet was moved to British ports, a suggestion which was not acceptable to Darlan, who argued that it was outrageous and would leave France defenseless.\nThat afternoon, the British Government offered joint nationality for Frenchmen and Britons in a Franco-British Union. Reynaud and five ministers thought these proposals acceptable. The others did not, seeing the offer as insulting and a device to make France subservient to the United Kingdom, as a kind of extra Dominion. Contrary to President Albert Lebrun's later recollection, no formal vote appears to have been taken at Cabinet on 16 June. The outcome of the meeting is uncertain. Ten ministers wanted to fight on and seven favoured an armistice (but these included the two Deputy Prime Ministers P\u00e9tain and Camille Chautemps, and this view was also favoured by the Commander-in-Chief General Weygand). Eight were initially undecided but swung towards an armistice.\nLebrun reluctantly accepted Reynaud's resignation as Prime Minister on 17 June, Reynaud recommending to the President that he appoint Marshal P\u00e9tain in his place, which he did that day, while the government was at Bordeaux. P\u00e9tain already had a ministerial team ready:\nHead of the French State.\nThe armistice of 1940.\nA new Cabinet with P\u00e9tain as head of government was formed, with Henry du Moulin de Labarth\u00e8te as the Cabinet Secretary. At midnight on 17 June 1940, Baudouin asked the Spanish Ambassador to submit to Germany a request to cease hostilities at once and for Germany to make known its peace terms. At 12:30\u00a0am, P\u00e9tain made his first broadcast to the French people.\n\"The enthusiasm of the country for the Mar\u00e9chal was tremendous. He was welcomed by people as diverse as Claudel, Gide, and Mauriac, and also by the vast mass of untutored Frenchmen who saw him as their saviour.\" General de Gaulle, no longer in the Cabinet, had arrived in London on 17 June and made a call for resistance from there on 18 June, a call that was heard by comparatively few.\nCabinet and Parliament still argued between themselves on the question of whether to retreat to North Africa. On 18 June, \u00c9douard Herriot (who would later be a prosecution witness at P\u00e9tain's trial) and Jeanneney, the presidents of the two Chambers of Parliament, as well as Lebrun said they wanted to go. P\u00e9tain said he was not departing. On 20 June, a delegation from the two chambers came to P\u00e9tain to protest at the proposed departure of President Lebrun. The next day, they went to Lebrun himself. In the event, only 26 deputies and 1 senator headed for Africa, among them those with Jewish backgrounds, Georges Mandel, Pierre Mend\u00e8s France, and the former Popular Front Education Minister, Jean Zay. P\u00e9tain made a broadcast again to the French people on that day.\nOn 22 June 1940, France signed an armistice at Compi\u00e8gne that gave Germany control over the north and west of the country, including Paris and all of the Atlantic coastline, but left the rest, around two-fifths of France's prewar territory, unoccupied. Paris remained the \"de jure\" capital. On 29 June, the French government moved to Clermont-Ferrand where the first discussions of constitutional changes were mooted, with Pierre Laval having personal discussions with President Lebrun, who had, in the event, not left France. On 1 July, the government, finding Clermont too cramped, moved to Vichy at Baudouin's suggestion, the empty hotels there being more suitable for the government ministries.\nConstitutional change.\nThe Chamber of Deputies and Senate, meeting together as a \"Congr\u00e8s\", held an emergency meeting on 10 July to ratify the armistice. At the same time, the draft constitutional proposals were tabled. The presidents of both Chambers spoke and declared that constitutional reform was necessary. The Congress voted 569\u201380 (with 18 abstentions) to grant the Cabinet the authority to draw up a new constitution, effectively \"voting the Third Republic out of existence\". Nearly all French historians, as well as all postwar French governments, consider this vote to be illegal; not only were several deputies and senators not present, but the constitution explicitly stated that the republican form of government could not be changed, though it could be argued that a republican dictatorship was installed. On the next day, P\u00e9tain formally assumed near-absolute powers as \"Head of State\".\nP\u00e9tain was reactionary by temperament and education, and quickly began blaming the Third Republic and its endemic corruption for the French defeat. His regime soon took on clear authoritarian\u00a0\u2013 and in some cases, fascist\u00a0\u2013 characteristics. The republican motto of \"Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9\" (\"Freedom, equality, brotherhood\") was replaced with \"Travail, famille, patrie\" (\"Work, family, fatherland\"). He issued new constitutional acts which abolished the presidency, indefinitely adjourned parliament, and also gave him full power to appoint and fire ministers and civil service members, pass laws through the Council of Ministers, and designate a successor (he chose Laval). Though P\u00e9tain publicly stated that he had no desire to become \"a Caesar\", by January 1941, P\u00e9tain held virtually all governing power in France; nearly all legislative, executive, and judicial powers were either \"de jure\" or \"de facto\" in his hands. One of his advisors commented that he had more power than any French leader since Louis XIV. Fascistic and revolutionary conservative factions within the new government used the opportunity to launch an ambitious programme known as the \"R\u00e9volution nationale\", which rejected much of the former Third Republic's secular and liberal traditions in favour of an authoritarian and paternalist society. P\u00e9tain, amongst others, took exception to the use of the term \"revolution\" to describe what he believed to be an essentially conservative movement, but otherwise participated in the transformation of French society from \"Republic\" to \"State\". He added that the new France would be \"a social hierarchy... rejecting the false idea of the natural equality of men.\"\nThe new government immediately used its new powers to order harsh measures, including the dismissal of republican civil servants, the installation of exceptional jurisdictions, the proclamation of antisemitic laws, and the imprisonment of opponents and foreign refugees. Censorship was imposed, and freedom of expression and thought were effectively abolished with the reinstatement of the crime of \"felony of opinion\". P\u00e9tain was always aware of civil discontent over Vichy rule.\nOn 24 June the British government stated that France had broken its agreement with the United Kingdom. At the beginning of the war it had been agreed that neither the United Kingdom nor France would make a separate peace.:559 The United Kingdom was prepared to release France from the agreement, providing the French fleet sailed forthwith to British harbours or to a neutral country, so it was out of reach of the Germans, pending negotiations:367. Notwithstanding the agreement between the United Kingdom and France and in complete disregard of her obligations to the United Kingdom, France allowed her fleet to fall into Germany's hands:537. Further, Reynaud agreed with the United Kingdom that if peace was made with Germany, German airmen who were prisoners of war would be sent to the United Kingdom:497. Again, the P\u00e9tain government did not honour this pledge and the German airmen, many of whom had been shot down by the RAF, were returned to Germany:497.\nIn a radio address to the country on 12 August 1941, P\u00e9tain stated:\"From several regions of France, I have felt an ill-wind rising for some time... the authority of my government is contested... a genuine malaise is gripping the French people\".The regime organised a \"L\u00e9gion Fran\u00e7aise des Combattants,\" which included \"Friends of the Legion\" and \"Cadets of the Legion\", groups of those who had never fought but were politically attached to the new regime. P\u00e9tain championed a rural and reactionary France that spurned internationalism. As a retired military commander, he ran the country on military lines.\nState collaboration with Germany.\nWithin months, P\u00e9tain signed antisemitic ordinances. This included the Law on the status of Jews, prohibiting Jews from exercising numerous professions, and the Law regarding foreign nationals of the Jewish race, authorizing the detention of foreign Jews. P\u00e9tain's government was nevertheless internationally recognised, notably by the U.S., at least until the German occupation of the rest of France. Neither P\u00e9tain nor his successive deputies, Laval, Pierre-\u00c9tienne Flandin, or Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan, gave significant resistance to requests by the Germans to indirectly aid the Axis powers.\nWhen Hitler met P\u00e9tain at Montoire in October 1940 to discuss the French government's role in the new \"European Order\", the handshake he offered to Hitler caused much uproar in London, and probably influenced the United Kingdom's decision to lend Free France naval support for their operations in Gabon. Furthermore, France even remained formally at war with Germany, albeit opposed to the Free French. Following the British attacks of July and September 1940 (Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, Dakar), the French government became increasingly fearful of the British and took the initiative to collaborate with the occupiers. P\u00e9tain accepted the government's creation of a collaborationist armed militia (the \"Milice\") under the command of Joseph Darnand, who, along with German forces, led a campaign of repression against the French resistance (\"Maquis\").\nP\u00e9tain admitted Darnand into his government as Secretary of the Maintenance of Public Order (\"Secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat au Maintien de l'Ordre\"). In August 1944, P\u00e9tain tried to distance himself from the crimes of the \"Milice\" by writing Darnand a letter of reprimand for the organisation's \"excesses\". Darnand sarcastically replied that P\u00e9tain should have \"thought of this before\".\nP\u00e9tain's government acquiesced to Axis demands for large supplies of manufactured goods and foodstuffs, and also ordered French troops in the French colonial empire (in Dakar, Syria, Madagascar, Oran, and Morocco) to defend sovereign French territory against any aggressors, Allied or otherwise.\nP\u00e9tain's motives are a topic of wide conjecture. Winston Churchill had spoken to Reynaud during the impending fall of France, saying of P\u00e9tain, \"... he had always been a defeatist, even in the last war [World War I].\"\nOn 11 November 1942, German forces invaded the unoccupied zone of Southern France in response to Allied landings in North Africa and Admiral Darlan's agreement to support the Allies. Although the French government nominally remained in existence, civilian administration of almost all France being under it, P\u00e9tain became nothing more than a figurehead, as the Germans had negated the pretence of an \"independent\" government at Vichy. P\u00e9tain however remained popular and engaged in a series of visits around France as late as 1944, when he arrived in Paris on 28 April in what Nazi propaganda newsreels described as a \"historic\" moment for the city. Large crowds cheered him in front of the H\u00f4tel de Ville and in the streets.\nExile to Sigmaringen.\nOn 17 August 1944, the Germans, in the person of Cecil von Renthe-Fink, \"special diplomatic delegate of the F\u00fchrer to the French Head of State\", asked P\u00e9tain to allow himself to be transferred to the northern zone. P\u00e9tain refused and asked for a written formulation of this request. Renthe-Fink renewed his request twice on the 18th, then returned on the 19th, at 11:30, accompanied by General Alexander Neubronn von Eisenberg, who told him that he had \"formal orders from Berlin\". The written text was submitted to P\u00e9tain: \"The Reich Government instructs the transfer of the Head of State, even against his will\". Faced with the Marshal's continued refusal, the Germans threatened to bring in the Luftwaffe to bomb Vichy. After having requested the Swiss envoy Walter Stucki to bear witness to the Germans' blackmail, P\u00e9tain submitted. When Renthe-Fink entered the Marshal's office at the H\u00f4tel du Parc with General Neubronn \"at 7:30 p.m.\", the Head of State was supervising the packing up of his suitcases and papers. The next day, 20 August 1944, P\u00e9tain was taken against his will by the German army to Belfort.\nFollowing the liberation of France, on 8 September 1944, P\u00e9tain and other members of the French cabinet at Vichy were relocated by the Germans to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany, where they became a government-in-exile until April 1945. P\u00e9tain, however, having been forced to leave France, refused to participate in this government and Fernand de Brinon now headed the \"government commission\". In a note dated 29 October 1944, P\u00e9tain forbade de Brinon to use the Marshal's name in any connection with this new government, and on 5 April 1945, P\u00e9tain wrote a note to Hitler expressing his wish to return to France. No reply ever came. However, on his birthday almost three weeks later, he was taken to the Swiss border. Two days later (26 April 1945) he crossed the French frontier.\nPostwar life.\nTrial before the High Court.\nThe provisional government, headed by de Gaulle, placed P\u00e9tain on trial for treason, the trial taking place from 23 July to 15 August 1945. Dressed in the uniform of a Marshal of France, P\u00e9tain remained silent through most of the proceedings after an initial statement that denied the right of the High Court as it was constituted to try him. De Gaulle later reflected upon the proceedings: Too often, the discussions took on the appearance of a partisan trial, sometimes even a settling of scores, when the whole affair should have been treated only from the standpoint of national defence and independence.\nAt the end of P\u00e9tain's trial, he was convicted on all charges, including \"indignit\u00e9 nationale\". The jury sentenced him to death and confiscation of his property. Due to his advanced age, the court asked that the sentence not be carried out. De Gaulle, who was President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic at the end of the war, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment on the grounds of age. After his conviction, the court stripped P\u00e9tain of all military ranks and honours, not including the distinction of Marshal of France.\nFearing riots at the announcement of the sentence, de Gaulle ordered that P\u00e9tain be immediately transported on the former's private aircraft to Fort du Portalet in the Pyrenees, where he remained from 15 August to 16 November 1945. The government later transferred him to the Fort de Pierre-Lev\u00e9e citadel on the \u00cele d'Yeu, a small island off the French Atlantic coast.\nImprisonment.\nOver the following years P\u00e9tain's lawyers and many foreign governments and dignitaries, including Queen Mary and the Duke of Windsor, appealed to successive French governments for P\u00e9tain's release, but given the unstable state of Fourth Republic politics, no government was willing to risk unpopularity by releasing him. As early as June 1946, U.S. president Harry S. Truman interceded in vain for his release, even offering to provide political asylum in the U.S. A similar offer was later made by the Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco.\nAlthough P\u00e9tain had still been in good health for his age at the time of his imprisonment, by late 1947, he suffered from memory lapses. By January 1949, his lucid intervals were becoming fewer and fewer. On 3 March 1949, during a meeting of the Council of Ministers of France, many of its members, \"self-proclaimed heroes of the Resistance\", in the words of biographer Charles Williams, had a fierce argument about a medical report recommending that he be moved to Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce (a military hospital in Paris), a measure to which Prime Minister Henri Queuille had previously been sympathetic. By May, P\u00e9tain required constant nursing care, and often suffered from hallucinations, e.g. that he was commanding armies in battle, or that naked women were dancing around his room. By the end of 1949, P\u00e9tain was suffering from severe cognitive impairment, with only occasional moments of lucidity. He was also beginning to suffer from heart problems and was no longer able to walk without assistance. Plans were made for his death and funeral.\nOn 8 June 1951, President Vincent Auriol, informed that P\u00e9tain did not have much longer to live, commuted his sentence to confinement in hospital; the news was kept secret until after the elections on 17 June, but by then, P\u00e9tain was too ill to be moved to Paris.\nDeath and burial.\nP\u00e9tain died in a private home in Port-Joinville on the \u00cele d'Yeu on 23 July 1951, at the age of 95. His body was buried in a local cemetery (\"Cimeti\u00e8re communal de Port-Joinville\"). Calls were made to relocate his remains to the grave prepared for him at Verdun.\nSurrounded by thujas and cypresses, the simple white granite slab topped with a wooden cross is in front of the west wall of the cemetery, facing away from the sea in the opposite direction to the 1,700 other tombs, a positioning linked to the fact that he was convicted of \"Indignit\u00e9 nationale\", a sanction which did not prevent him from being buried in his military uniform and that the mention of Marshal of France was engraved in black capital letters.\nIn February 1973, P\u00e9tain's coffin housing his remains was stolen from the \u00cele d'Yeu cemetery by extremists who demanded that President Georges Pompidou consent to its re-interment at Douaumont ossuary among the war dead of the Battle of Verdun. Police recovered the coffin a few days later, and it was ceremoniously reburied with a presidential wreath on the \u00cele d'Yeu where it had been buried before.\nA small museum glorifying P\u00e9tain, the Historical Museum of the \u00cele d'Yeu, displays writings and personal items of P\u00e9tain, such as his deathbed, his clothes and his cane. The museum is not publicized and rarely opens, according to its manager, to \"avoid trouble\".\nEponymy.\nMount P\u00e9tain, nearby P\u00e9tain Creek, and P\u00e9tain Falls, forming the P\u00e9tain Basin on the Continental Divide in the Canadian Rockies, were named after him in 1919, while nearby summits were given the names of other French generals (Foch, Cordonnier, Mangin, Castelnau and Joffre). The names referring to P\u00e9tain were removed in 2021 and 2022, leaving the features unnamed.\nHengshan Road, in Shanghai, was \"Avenue P\u00e9tain\" between 1922 and 1943. There is a Petain Road in Singapore in the Little India neighbourhood. Pinardville, a traditionally French-Canadian neighborhood of Goffstown, New Hampshire, has a Petain Street dating from the 1920s, alongside parallel streets named for other World War I generals, John Pershing, Douglas Haig, Ferdinand Foch, and Joseph Joffre.\nNew York Canyon of Heroes.\nOn 26 October 1931, P\u00e9tain was honored with a ticker-tape parade down Manhattan's Canyon of Heroes. In 2017, the New York City Mayor's Office considered removing the sidewalk ribbon denoting the parade for P\u00e9tain, given his collaborationist government in World War II.\nPersonal life.\nP\u00e9tain was a bachelor until his sixties and known for his womanising. After World War I P\u00e9tain married his mistress, Eug\u00e9nie Hardon (1877\u20131962), on 14 September 1920; they remained married until the end of P\u00e9tain's life. After rejecting P\u00e9tain's first marriage proposal, Hardon had married and divorced Fran\u00e7ois de H\u00e9rain by 1914 when she was 35. At the opening of the Battle of Verdun in 1916 P\u00e9tain is said to have been fetched during the night from a Paris hotel by a staff officer who knew that he could be found with Eug\u00e9nie Hardon. She had no children by P\u00e9tain but already had a son from her first marriage, Pierre de H\u00e9rain, whom P\u00e9tain strongly disliked.\nHonours and awards.\nFrench.\nMarshal of France: 21 November 1918 (the sole award retained following his trial in 1945)\n\"Following honours and decorations withdrawn following conviction for high treason in 1945:\"\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nAmong a vast number of books and articles about P\u00e9tain, the most complete and documented biographies are:"}

{"id": "66086", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66086", "title": "DR-DOS", "text": "MSDOS-like operating system\nDR-DOS is a disk operating system for IBM PC compatibles, originally developed by Gary A. Kildall's Digital Research, Inc. and derived from Concurrent PC\u00a0DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86. Upon its introduction in 1988, it was the first DOS that attempted to be compatible with IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS.\nIts first release was version 3.31, named so that it would match MS-DOS's then-current version. DR DOS 5.0 was released in 1990 as the first to be sold in retail; it was critically acclaimed and led to DR DOS becoming the main rival to Microsoft's MS-DOS, who quickly responded with its own MS-DOS 5.0 but releasing over a year later. It introduced a graphical user interface layer called ViewMAX. DR DOS 6.0 was released in 1991; then with Novell's acquisition of Digital Research, the following version was named Novell DOS 7.0 in 1994. After another sale, to Caldera, updated versions were released partly open-source under the Caldera moniker, and briefly as OpenDOS. The last version for desktops, Caldera DR-DOS 7.03, was released in 1999, after which the software was sold to Embedded Systems by Caldera and then by DeviceLogics.\nHistory.\nOrigins in CP/M.\nDigital Research's original CP/M for the 8-bit Intel 8080- and Z80-based systems spawned numerous spin-off versions, most notably CP/M-86 for the Intel 8086/8088 family of processors. Although CP/M had dominated the market since the mid-1970s, and was shipped with the vast majority of non-proprietary-architecture personal computers, the IBM PC in 1981 brought the beginning of what was eventually to be a massive change.\nIBM originally approached Digital Research in 1980, seeking an x86 version of CP/M. However, there were disagreements over the contract, and IBM withdrew. Instead, a deal was struck with Microsoft, who purchased another operating system, 86-DOS, from Seattle Computer Products (SCP). This became Microsoft MS-DOS and IBM PC\u00a0DOS. 86-DOS's command structure and application programming interface imitated that of CP/M 2.2 (with BDOS 2.2). Digital Research threatened legal action, claiming PC\u00a0DOS/MS-DOS to be too similar to CP/M. In early 1982, IBM settled by agreeing to sell Digital Research's x86 version of CP/M, CP/M-86, alongside PC\u00a0DOS. However, PC\u00a0DOS sold for while CP/M-86 had a $240 price tag. The proportion of PC buyers prepared to spend six times as much to buy CP/M-86 was very small, and the limited availability of compatible application software, at first in Digital Research's favor, was only temporary.\nDigital Research fought a long losing battle to promote CP/M-86 and its multi-tasking multi-user successors MP/M-86 and Concurrent CP/M-86, and eventually decided that they could not beat the Microsoft-IBM lead in application software availability, so they modified Concurrent CP/M-86 to allow it to run the same applications as MS-DOS and PC\u00a0DOS.\nThis was shown publicly in December 1983 and shipped in March 1984 as Concurrent DOS 3.1 (a.k.a. CDOS with BDOS 3.1) to hardware vendors. While Concurrent DOS continued to evolve in various flavors over the years to eventually become Multiuser DOS and REAL/32, it was not specifically tailored for the desktop market and too expensive for single-user applications. Therefore, over time two attempts were made to sideline the product:\nIn 1985, Digital Research developed DOS\u00a0Plus 1.0 to 2.1, a stripped-down and modified single-user derivative of Concurrent DOS 4.1 and 5.0, which ran applications for both platforms, and allowed switching between several tasks as did the original CP/M-86. Its DOS compatibility was limited, and Digital Research made another attempt, this time a native DOS system. This new disk operating system was launched in 1988 as DR\u00a0DOS.\nAlthough DRI was based in Pacific Grove and later in Monterey, California, USA, the work on DOS\u00a0Plus started in Newbury, Berkshire in the UK, where Digital Research Europe had its OEM Support Group located since 1983. Beginning in 1986, most of the operating system work on Concurrent DOS 386 and XM, Multiuser DOS, DR\u00a0DOS and PalmDOS was done in Digital Research's European Development Centre (EDC) in Hungerford, Berkshire. Later on some work was also done by Digital Research GmbH in Munich, Germany.\nFirst DR\u00a0DOS version.\nAs requested by several OEMs, Digital Research started a plan to develop a new DOS operating system addressing the defects left by MS-DOS in 1987. Of particular importance was a million dollar deal with Kazuhiko \"Kay\" Nishi of ASCII Corporation, who had previously been instrumental in opening the Japanese OEM market for Microsoft. The first DR\u00a0DOS version was released on May 28, 1988. Version numbers were chosen to reflect features relative to MS-DOS; the first version promoted to the public was DR\u00a0DOS 3.31, which offered features comparable to Compaq MS-DOS 3.31 with large disk support (FAT16B a.k.a. \"BIGDOS\"). DR\u00a0DOS 3.31 reported itself as \"IBM PC\u00a0DOS 3.31\", while the internal BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System) kernel version was reported as 6.0, single-user nature, reflecting its origin as derivative of Concurrent DOS 6.0 with the multitasking and multiuser capabilities as well as CP/M API support stripped out and the XIOS replaced by an IBM-compatible DOS-BIOS. The system files were named DRBIOS.SYS (for the DOS-BIOS) and DRBDOS.SYS (for the BDOS kernel), the disk OEM label used was \"DIGITAL\u2420\".\nDR\u00a0DOS offered some extended command line tools with command line help, verbose error messages, sophisticated command line history and editing (HISTORY directive) as well as support for file and directory passwords built right into the kernel. It was also cheaper to license than MS-DOS, and was ROMable right from the start. The ROMed version of DR\u00a0DOS was also named ROS (ROM Operating System). DRI was approached by a number of PC manufacturers who were interested in a third-party DOS, which prompted several updates to the system.\nAt this time, MS-DOS was only available to OEMs bundled with hardware. Consequently, DR\u00a0DOS achieved some immediate success when it became possible for consumers to buy it through normal retail channels beginning with version 3.4x.\nKnown versions are DR\u00a0DOS 3.31 (BDOS 6.0, June 1988, OEM only), 3.32 (BDOS 6.0, August 17, 1988, OEM only), 3.33 (BDOS 6.0, September 1, 1988, OEM only), 3.34 (BDOS 6.0, OEM only), 3.35 (BDOS 6.0, October 21, 1988, OEM only), 3.40 (BDOS 6.0, January 25, 1989), 3.41 (BDOS 6.3, June 1989, OEM and retail). Like MS-DOS, most of them were produced in several variants for different hardware. While most OEMs kept the DR\u00a0DOS name designation, 2001\u00a0Sales, Inc. marketed it under the name EZ-DOS 3.41 (also known as EZ-DOS 4.1).\nDR\u00a0DOS 5.0.\nDR\u00a0DOS version 5.0 (code-named \"Leopard\") was released in May 1990, still reporting itself as \"PC\u00a0DOS 3.31\" for compatibility purposes, but internally indicating a single-user BDOS 6.4 kernel. (Version 4 was skipped to avoid being associated with the relatively unpopular MS-DOS 4.0.) This introduced ViewMAX, a GEM-based GUI file management shell. ViewMAX's startup screen would present the slogan \"Digital Research - We make computers work\". DR\u00a0DOS 5.0 also introduced the patented BatteryMAX power management system, bundled disk-caching software (DRCACHE), a remote file transfer tool (FILELINK), a cursor shape configuration utility (CURSOR), and offered a vastly improved memory management system (MemoryMAX). For compatibility purposes, the DR\u00a0DOS 5.0 system files were now named IBMBIO.COM (for the DOS-BIOS) and IBMDOS.COM (for the BDOS kernel) and due to the advanced loader in the boot sector could be physically stored anywhere on disk. The OEM label in the boot sectors was changed to \"IBM\u2420\u24203.3\".\nDR\u00a0DOS 5.0 was the first DOS to include load-high capabilities. The kernel and data structures such as disk buffers could be relocated in the High Memory Area (HMA), the first 64\u00a0KB of extended memory which are accessible in real mode. This freed up the equivalent amount of critical \"base\" or conventional memory, the first 640\u00a0KB of the PC's RAM \u2013 the area in which all DOS applications run.\nAdditionally, on Intel 80386 machines, DR\u00a0DOS's EMS memory manager allowed the operating system to load DOS device drivers into upper memory blocks, further freeing base memory.\nDR\u00a0DOS 5.0 was the first DOS to integrate such functionality into the base OS (loading device drivers into upper memory blocks was already possible using third-party software like QEMM). This allowed it, on 286 systems with supported chipsets and on 386 systems, to provide significantly more free conventional memory than any other DOS. Once drivers for a mouse, multimedia hardware and a network stack were loaded, an MS-DOS/PC\u00a0DOS machine typically might only have had 300 to 400\u00a0KB of free conventional memory \u2013 too little to run much late-1980s software. In contrast to this, DR\u00a0DOS 5.0, with a little manual tweaking, could load all this and still keep all of its conventional memory free \u2013 allowing for some necessary DOS data structures, as much as 620\u00a0KB out of the 640\u00a0KB. With MEMMAX\u00a0+V, the conventional memory region could even be extended into unused portions of the graphics adapter card typically providing another 64 to 96\u00a0KB more free DOS memory.\nBecause DR\u00a0DOS left so much conventional memory available, some old programs using certain address wrapping techniques failed to run properly as they were now loaded unexpectedly (or, under MS-DOS, \"impossibly\") low in memory \u2013 inside the first 64\u00a0KB segment (known as \"low memory\"). Therefore, DR\u00a0DOS 5.0's new MEMMAX\u00a0-L command worked around this by pre-allocating a chunk of memory at the start of the memory map in order for programs to load above this barrier (but with less usable conventional memory then). By default, MEMMAX was configured for +L, so that applications could take advantage of the extra memory.\nDR\u00a0DOS 6.0 / Competition from Microsoft.\nFaced with substantial competition in the DOS arena, Microsoft responded with an announcement of a yet-to-be released MS-DOS 5.0 in May 1990. This would be released in June 1991 and include similar advanced features to those of DR\u00a0DOS. It included matches of the DR's enhancements in memory management.\nAlmost immediately in September 1991, Digital Research responded with DR\u00a0DOS 6.0, code-named \"Buxton\". DR\u00a0DOS 6.0, while already at BDOS level 6.7 internally, would still report itself as \"IBM PC\u00a0DOS 3.31\" to normal DOS applications for compatibility purposes.\nThis bundled in SuperStor on-the-fly disk compression, to maximize available hard disk space, and file deletion tracking and undelete functionality by Roger A. Gross.\nDR\u00a0DOS 6.0 also included a task-switcher named TASKMAX with support for the industry-standard task-switching API to run multiple applications at the same time. In contrast to Digital Research's Multiuser DOS (successor of Concurrent DOS in the multi-user products line), which would run DOS applications in pre-emptively multitasked virtual DOS machines, the DR\u00a0DOS 6.0 task switcher would freeze background applications until brought back into the foreground. While it ran on x86-machines, it was able to swap to XMS memory on 286+ machines. TASKMAX did support some Copy &amp; Paste facility between applications.\nVia the task-switcher API, graphical user interfaces such as ViewMAX or PC/GEOS could register as the task manager menu and thereby replace the TASKMAX text mode menu, so that users could switch between tasks from within a GUI.\nMicrosoft responded with MS-DOS 6.0, which again matched some features of DR\u00a0DOS 6.0.\nIn December 1991, a pre-release version of Windows 3.1 was found to return a non-fatal error message if it detected a non-Microsoft DOS. This check came to be known as the AARD code. It was a simple matter for Digital Research to patch DR\u00a0DOS 6.0 to circumvent the AARD code 'authenticity check' in the Windows 3.1 beta by rearranging the order of two internal tables in memory (with no changes in functionality), and the patched version, named \"business update\", was on the streets within six weeks of the release of Windows 3.1. With the detection code disabled, Windows ran perfectly under DR\u00a0DOS and its successor Novell DOS. The code was present but disabled in the released version of Windows 3.1.\nIn July 1992, Digital Research Japan released DR\u00a0DOS 6.0/V, a Japanese DOS/V compatible version of DR\u00a0DOS 6.0. A Korean version appears to have been available as well.\nPalmDOS.\nIn 1992 Digital Research, still under its old name but already bought by Novell in July 1991, also embarked on a spin-off product code-named \"Merlin\" and later released as NetWare PalmDOS 1, which, as its name implies, was a very resource-light DR\u00a0DOS 6.0 derivative aimed at the emerging Palmtop/PDA market.\nPalmDOS was the first operating system in the family to support the new BDOS 7.0 kernel with native DOS compatible internal data structures instead of emulations thereof. Replacing the DOS emulation on top of a CP/M kernel by a true DOS compatible kernel helped a lot in improving compatibility with some applications using some of DOS' internal data structures and also was the key in reducing the resident size of the kernel code even further\u2014a particular requirement for the PDA market. On the other hand, introducing a genuine Current Directory Structure (CDS) imposed a limit on the depth of working directories down to 66 characters (as in MS-DOS/PC\u00a0DOS), whereas previous issues of DR\u00a0DOS had no such limitation due to their internal organization of directories as relative links to parent directories instead of as absolute paths. PalmDOS still reported itself as \"PC\u00a0DOS 3.31\" to applications in order to keep the kernel small and not run into compatibility problems with Windows, which would expect the DOSMGR API to be implemented for any DOS version since 5.0.\nAs well as a ROM-executing kernel, PalmDOS had palmtop-type support for features such as PCMCIA PC Cards (with DPMS support), power management (BatteryMAX and the $IDLE$ device driver with its patented dynamic idle detection by Gross and John P. Constant), MINIMAX task switcher support for PIM (Personal Information Modules) applications stored and executed from ROM via XIP (Execute-In-Place), etc.\nThe PCMCIA stack for PalmDOS was partially written by Ian H. S. Cullimore, the original instigator of the PCMCIA/PC Card movement.\nNovell DOS 7 / Contribution by Novell.\nNovell DOS was Novell Corporation's name for DR\u00a0DOS during the period when Novell sold DR\u00a0DOS, after the acquisition of Digital Research in 1991. Regarding features and performance, it was typically at least one release ahead of MS-DOS. In 1993, PC\u00a0DOS 6.1, MS-DOS 6.2 and PC\u00a0DOS 6.3 were trumped by Novell's DOS 7.\nNovell CEO Robert J. Frankenberg's strategy included \"major trimming\", selling off products like transactional database Btrieve and killing others such as Novell DOS and WordPerfect's multimedia Main Street children's titles. Novell licensed technology from Stac Electronics for use in Novell DOS and its network operating system NetWare. Novell sold the product line off to Caldera on July 23, 1996, after it approached Novell looking for a DOS operating system to bundle with its OpenLinux distribution.\nMarc Perkel claimed to have had inspired Novell in February 1991 to buy Digital Research and develop something he envisioned as \"NovOS\". Novell had actually bought Digital Research in July 1991 with a view to using DR's product line as a lever in their comprehensive strategy to break the Microsoft monopoly. (This was part of a massive and ultimately disastrous spending spree for Novell: they bought WordPerfect Corporation at about the same time, some of Borland's products, and invested heavily in Unix as well.) The planned \"DR\u00a0DOS 7.0\", internally named \"Panther\", intended to trump Microsoft's troubled MS-DOS 6.0, was repeatedly delayed, while Novell was working on an optionally loadable Unix-like multi-user security extension (with, if loaded, file commands like BACKUP, DELPURGE, MOVE, TOUCH, TREE, UNDELETE, XATTRIB, XCOPY, XDEL and XDIR supporting an otherwise disabled /U:name command line option to select specific users or groups, compatible with Multiuser DOS) and two new graphical user interfaces (ViewMAX 3, a derivative of GEM, and \"Star Trek\", a true port of Apple's System 7.1 to run under the new DR\u00a0DOS multitasker named \"Vladivar\").\nWhen DR\u00a0DOS eventually arrived in December 1993 (with localized versions released in March 1994), renamed Novell DOS 7 (a.k.a. \"NWDOS\"), and without these three components, it was a disappointment to some. It was larger and lacked some finishing touches, but was nevertheless seen as best DOS by many industry experts.\nIn Germany, Novell DOS 7 was aggressively marketed with the slogan \"\" (\"Don't trust any DOS below 7\") in the press and with free demo floppies in computer magazines. The campaign aimed at 20% of the DOS market and resulted in about 1.5 million copies sold until February 1994 and more than 3000 dealers interested to carry the product. Novell DOS 7 was available through various OEMs, a dedicated mail order shop and authorized dealers.\nA major functional addition was Novell's second attempt at a peer-to-peer networking system, Personal NetWare (PNW). This was better than its predecessor, NetWare Lite (NWL), but it was incompatible with Microsoft's networking system, now growing popular with support in Windows for Workgroups, OS/2, and Windows NT. A considerable amount of manual configuration was needed to get both to co-exist on the same PC, and Personal NetWare never achieved much success.\nSince Novell DOS 7 implemented the DOSMGR API and internal data structures had been updated, its BDOS 7.2 kernel could report with a DOS version of 6.0 and OEM ID \"IBM\" without risking compatibility problems with Windows. Most tools would report this as \"PC\u00a0DOS 6.1\", because IBM PC\u00a0DOS 6.1 also reported as DOS 6.0 to applications.\nNovell DOS 7 introduced much advanced memory management including new support for DPMI (DOS Protected Mode Interface) and DPMS (DOS Protected Mode Services) as well as more flexible loadhigh options. It also introduced support for \"true\" pre-emptive multitasking of multiple DOS applications in virtual DOS machines (VDM), a component originally named MultiMAX. This was similar to Multiuser DOS, but now on the basis of a natively DOS compatible environment, similar to Windows 386 Enhanced Mode, but without a GUI. By default, the bundled TASKMGR would behave similar to the former DR\u00a0DOS 6.0 TASKMAX. However, if EMM386 was loaded with the option /MULTI, EMM386 would load a natively 32-bit 386 Protected Mode operating system core providing API support for pre-emptive multitasking, multi-threading, hardware virtualization and domain management of virtual DOS machines. This API could be used by DR\u00a0DOS-aware applications. If TASKMGR was run later on, it would use this API to instance the current 16-bit DOS system environment, create virtual DOS machines and run applications in them instead of using its own Real Mode task-switcher support. The multitasker was compatible with Windows, so that tasks started before launching Windows could be seen as tasks under Windows as well.\nNovell DOS 7 and Personal NetWare 1.0 also shipped with NetWars, a network-enabled 3D arcade game.\nNovell DOS 7 and Personal NetWare required several bug-fix releases (D70xyy with x=language, yy=number) and were not completely stable when the next development occurred. With beta versions of Microsoft's \"Chicago\" (what would later become Windows 95) in sight, Novell wound down further development on Novell DOS 7 in September 1994 and stopped maintenance in January 1996 after more than 15 updates.\nAfter Novell.\nWhen Caldera approached Novell looking for a DOS operating system to bundle with their OpenLinux distribution, Novell sold the product line off to Caldera on July 23, 1996, by which time it was of little commercial value to them.\nBetween the Caldera-owned DR-DOS and competition from IBM's PC\u00a0DOS 6.3, Microsoft moved to make it impossible to use or buy the subsequent Windows version, Windows 95, with any DOS product other than their own. Claimed by them to be a purely technical change, this was later to be the subject of a major lawsuit brought in Salt Lake City by Caldera with the help of the Canopy Group. Microsoft lawyers tried repeatedly to have the case dismissed but without success. Immediately after the completion of the pre-trial deposition stage (where the parties list the evidence they intend to present), there was an out-of-court settlement on January 7, 2000, for an undisclosed sum. This was revealed in November 2009 to be $280 million.\nIn August 1996, the US-based Caldera, Inc. was approached by Roger A. Gross, one of the original DR-DOS engineers, with a proposal to restart DR-DOS development and to make Windows 95 run on DR-DOS which would help the court case. Following a meeting in September 1996 in Lindon, Utah, USA, between Gross, Ransom H. Love, Bryan Wayne Sparks and Raymond John Noorda, Gross was hired and tasked to set up a new subsidiary in the UK. On September 10, 1996, Caldera announced the coming release of OpenDOS (COD) and their intent to also release the source code to the system, and Caldera UK Ltd. was incorporated on September 20, 1996. Gross hired some of the original developers of the operating system from the Novell EDC as well as some new talents to continue work on the operating system in a converted barn at the periphery of Andover, Hampshire, UK, nearby the former Digital Research and Novell EDC. Besides other improvements and enhancements all over the system, a string of new key features were added subsequently over the course of the next two years, including a TCP/IP stack (derived from LAN WorkPlace for DOS / NetWare Mobile), a graphical 32-bit DOS Protected Mode HTML 3.2 web-browser DR-WebSpyder (originally based on source code from the Arachne web browser by Michal Pol\u00e1k) with LAN and modem dialup, a POSIX Pthreads extension to the multi-tasker by Andy T. Wightman, long filename (LONGNAME) support by Edward N. Hill Jr., as well as LBA and FAT32 support (DRFAT32) by Matthias R. Paul. Gross also hired Andrew Schulman (who had been, with Geoff Chappell, instrumental in identifying the AARD code in 1992) to work as a consultant and, in Andover, assist Paul in his work on \"WinGlue\", a secret project to create a version of DR-DOS compatible with Windows 95, 98 and 98 SE and replace its MS-DOS 7.xx component. This was demonstrated at CeBIT in March 1998, and later, in a small team, developed into \"WinBolt\", both versions of DR-DOS, which remained unreleased as of 2023[ [update]], but played an important role in the court case.\nCaldera UK officially released Caldera OpenDOS 7.01 on February 3, 1997, but this version was just Novell DOS 7 update 10 (as of December 1994) compiled only with the necessary adaptations to incorporate the new name in display messages as well as in environment variables and file names. It was missing a year's worth of patches which had been developed for the Novell DOS updates 11 (January 1995) to 15.2 (January 1996). This was due to parts of the Novell DOS sources having been lost at Novell meanwhile. Consequently, this version still reported an internal BDOS version of 7.2, identical to Novell DOS 7. The new suite also lacked the SETFIFO command, which had been added with one of the Novell DOS updates, as well as Fifth Generation's Search&amp;Destroy virus scanner and FastBack Plus 2.0 utility, which previously came bundled with Novell DOS. Instead it came bundled with a newer version of PNUNPACK and brought a much advanced version of NetWars.\nParts of OpenDOS 7.01 were released as open source in form of the M.R.S. kit (for Machine Readable Sources) in May 1997, but with license terms mostly incompatible with existing open-source licenses. The source was then closed again as Gross felt this would undermine the commercial aspirations of the system.\nAfter beta releases in September and November 1997, the next official release came in December 1997, with the name changed to Caldera DR-OpenDOS 7.02, soon followed by a further release in March 1998, when the DR-DOS name returned as Caldera DR-DOS 7.02, now for the first time written with a hyphen. Version 7.02 (now reporting itself as BDOS 7.3) incorporated improved BIOS and BDOS issues, developed by Paul, adding many new boot and configuration options, integrating many compatibility enhancements, bug-fixes and optimizations for size and speed, and re-implementing all fixes of the missing Novell DOS updates. The BIOS improved the coexistence of DR-DOS with Windows 9x and its support for third-party disk compression drivers such as Microsoft's DriveSpace. It introduced a diagnostics mode (activated by Scroll Lock), integrated debugger support (with DEBUG=ON and a debugger loaded before or from within CONFIG.SYS) and more flexible CONFIG.SYS tracing capabilities via the /// hotkeys and the TRACE and TIMEOUT commands, thereby also improving the integration of alternative command line shells such as 4DOS. Together with LOADER, SYS /DR:ext and the CHAIN directive, it brought enhanced multi-configuration support for DR/D/CONFIG.ext files and came with enhancements to the BASIC-like CONFIG.SYS language for more powerful boot menus, convenient user interaction and programmatical acting upon conditions (CPU386), return codes and error levels (ERROR, ONERROR). It also allowed to change the SCROLLOCK, CAPSLOCK, INSERT and VERIFY settings as well as the SWITCHAR, YESCHAR, NOCHAR and RESUMECHAR characters. Various behavioural details could be controlled with new parameters /Q (Quiet), /L (Lowercase), /Y (Yes) and /S (Switch) for SWITCHES. Further, it provided optional support for a LPT4: device and allowed to configure the built-in COMx: and LPTx: devices as well as to change the PRN: and AUX: defaults. The handling of environment variables in CONFIG.SYS was improved and new load-high facilities included such as the HIFILES/FILESHIGH and HIFCBS/FCBSHIGH options to relocate file handles and FCB structures into UMBs, which typically gave between 1 and 4\u00a0KB (and up to 15\u00a0KB) more free conventional memory compared to previous versions, or the HISHELL/SHELLHIGH SIZE directive to control the pre-allocation of HMA memory for COMMAND.COM, which helped to avoid memory fragmentation and thereby typically gave between 5 and 8\u00a0KB more continuous HMA memory for HMA-capable third-party drivers to work with in conjunction with third-party command line shells, which could not load into the HMA as COMMAND.COM with its /MH option. At a reduced memory footprint version 7.02 also brought an enhanced NLS 4.xx sub-system by Paul to allow multiple, distributed and possibly user-configured COUNTRY.SYS files to be used by the system at the same time in a hierarchical model. This also gave dynamic parser support for MS-DOS/PC\u00a0DOS COUNTRY.SYS file formats in addition to DR-DOS' own COUNTRY.SYS formats, and it introduced support for the ISO 8601 international date format (including automatic detection) and the then-new Euro currency. Some DR-DOS files such as IBMBIO.COM, IBMDOS.COM and COUNTRY.SYS carried misleading file extensions for compatibility reasons; with DR-DOS 7.02 they were enhanced to incorporate a fat binary-style safety feature devised by Paul so that they would exit gracefully when called inappropriately. DR-DOS 7.02 was fully Year 2000 compliant and provided special support to work with buggy system BIOSes. It also came with an updated FDISK, which could partition and format FAT32 volumes (but not yet work with LBA). The sources of the Novell patches for the external tools and drivers had meanwhile been found in Germany and could thus be retro-fitted into the system as well, so that DR-DOS 7.02 finally not only caught up with Novell DOS 7, but was a true step forward. The release was followed by various updates in June, August and September 1998.\nThe updated internal BDOS version number introduced a new problem: some legacy third-party applications with special support for Novell DOS, which were no longer being updated, stopped working. SETVER already allowed Novell DOS to disguise itself as DOS versions by file name and globally and, specifying a magic sub-version of 255, it would even disable its own internal BDOS version check in order to cope with programs specifically probing for \"DR-DOS\". The modified kernel and SETVER driver by Paul would, in an hierarchical model, also support load paths in order to distinguish between multiple executables of the same file name, and it introduced an extended mode, in which SETVER could not only fake DOS versions, but also BDOS kernel versions. Sub-versions of 128 to 255 would be reported as DOS sub-versions 0 to 127 to applications, but with the BDOS version check disabled, while sub-versions 100 to 127 could be used to fake different BDOS versions, whereas the DOS revision number (typically set to 0 in a static, pre-boot patchable data structure) would be taken as the reported sub-version instead, so that SETVER /G /X 6.114 would allow versions of DR-DOS since 7.02 to still report themselves as a \"DOS 6.0\" and with a faked BDOS version 7.2 (114 decimal = 72 hexadecimal), thereby masquerading as Novell DOS 7 / OpenDOS 7.01.\nWhile otherwise beneficial, the new HIFILES triggered a compatibility problem in the DOS-UP feature of the third-party memory manager QEMM 8, which was hard-wired to expect a chunk of five handle structures in conventional memory under DR-DOS (as with previous versions up to 7.01), whereas version 7.02 by design left eight handles in low memory when loading high files in order to maintain full compatibility with older versions of Windows 3.xx. Compatibility with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 had not been affected by this. A maintenance fix was devised to patch a single byte in IBMBIO.COM in order to switch the behaviour and optionally re-invoke the old chunking. This freed some 150 bytes of conventional memory and enabled full compatibility with DOS-UP, but at the same time broke compatibility with older versions of Windows 3.xx when using the HIFILES feature, and vice versa. The patch named IBMBIO85.SCR continued to work with newer versions of DR-DOS.\nIn August 1998 the US-based Caldera, Inc. created two new subsidiaries, Caldera Systems, Inc. for the Linux business, and Caldera Thin Clients, Inc. for the embedded and thin-client market.\nAnother version, DR-DOS 7.03 (still with BDOS 7.3 and reporting itself to applications as \"PC\u00a0DOS 6.0\" for compatibility purposes), was pre-released at Christmas 1998 and then officially released on January 6, 1999, by Caldera UK. It came with significantly improved memory managers (in particular enhanced DPMI support in conjunction with the multitasker) and other enhancements, such as added DEVLOAD and DRMOUSE utilities, but a changed OEM label in the boot sector of volumes formatted under DR-DOS could also cause problems under other operating systems (which can be circumvented by NOVOLTRK). DR-DOS 7.03 would become the last version of DR-DOS also tailored for desktop use.\nCaldera, Inc. wanted to relocate the DR-DOS business into the US and closed the highly successful UK operation in February 1999 after Gross resigned and set up iCentrix to develop the MarioNet split web browser. Development was then moved into the US (which never worked out due to a total lack of expertise in this field at Caldera US), and the DR-DOS line fell to its branch company, Caldera Thin Clients, which was renamed Lineo, Inc. on July 20, 1999. DR-WebSpyder was renamed Embrowser and was said to be ported to Linux. Lineo re-released DR-DOS 7.03 in June and September 1999, still branded as \"Caldera DR-DOS\" and without any changes, but otherwise focussed on Linux for embedded systems, based on a stripped-down version of OpenLinux named Embedix.\nAmong the latest and independently developed versions of DR-DOS were OEM DR-DOS 7.04 (as of August 19, 1999) and 7.05 (as of November 30, 1999), still branded as \"Caldera DR-DOS\". These were variants of the system consisting only of the kernel and command shell. With a specialized native implementation of FAT32 and large hard disk support they could be found bundled with Ontrack's Easy Recovery 5 in 2000, replacing the dynamically loadable DRFAT32 redirector driver, which still came with Easy Recovery 4. They were also used for Seagate Technology's SeaTools and the CD imaging software Nero Burning ROM. While still reporting a BDOS 7.3 internally, these were the first versions to report themselves as \"PC\u00a0DOS 7.10\" to applications in order to indicate integrated FAT32 support. Designed to be mostly backwards-compatible, the DR-DOS 7.04/7.05 IBMBIO.COM could be combined with the DR-DOS 7.03 IBMDOS.COM in order to give the desktop-approved DR-DOS 7.03 kernel LBA capabilities and work with drives larger than 8 GB. For specific OEM requirements, DR-DOS 7.06 (as of December 14, 1999) by Wightman combined the kernel files into a single binary executable, so that, similar to IO.SYS of Windows 98, it could be booted by MS-DOS 7.10 boot sectors (but no longer by DR-DOS boot sectors). DR-DOS 7.07 (with BDOS 7.4/7.7) by Paul introduced new bootstrap loaders and updated disk tools in order to combine support for CHS and LBA disk access, the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file systems, and the differing bootstrapping conventions of DR-DOS, PC\u00a0DOS, MS-DOS, Windows, REAL/32 and LOADER into a single NEWLDR MBR and boot sector, so that the code would continue to load any version of DR-DOS down to 3.31 (and since DR-DOS 7.04 also with FAT32 support), but could also be used to launch the PC\u00a0DOS or MS-DOS system files, including those of Windows 9x and PC\u00a0DOS 7.10. At the same time the kernel could not only be booted by the new sectors, but also by any previously DR-DOS formatted disks, as well as off disks with existing PC\u00a0DOS or MS-DOS boot sectors and a variety of other boot-loaders, thereby easing the coexistence and setup of multi-boot scenarios in conjunction with other operating systems.\nLater versions.\nIn 2002, Lineo was bought out, and some of Lineo's former managers purchased the name and formed a new company, DRDOS, Inc. dba DeviceLogics L.L.C. They have continued to sell DR-DOS for use in embedded systems. DR-DOS 8.0 was released on March 30, 2004, featuring FAT32 and large disk support, the ability to boot from ROM or Flash, multitasking and a DPMI memory manager. This version was based on the kernel from version 7.03.\nThe company later released DR-DOS 8.1 (with better FAT32 support) in autumn 2005. This version was instead based on OpenDOS 7.01.xx. DR-DOS 8.1 was withdrawn for GPL violations (see Controversies).\nAside from selling copies of the operating system, the DRDOS, Inc. website lists a buyout option for DR-DOS; the asking price is \nThe OpenDOS 7.01 source code was a base for \"The DR-DOS/OpenDOS Enhancement Project\", set up in July 2002 in an attempt to bring the functionality of DR-DOS up to parity with modern PC non-Windows operating systems. The project's added native support for large disks (LBA) and the FAT32 file system, and several other enhancements, including improved memory management and support for the new FAT32+ file system extension which allows files of up to 256 GB in size on normal FAT partitions. DR-DOS 7.01.08 WIP (work in progress) was released on July 21, 2011.\nFrom 2023 on the last Enhanced DR-DOS release 7.01.08 WIP was ported to an open source build tool chain, which makes the kernel and command interpreter cross-buildable from operating systems other than DOS. The kernel can be built as a single binary \"KERNEL.SYS\" to make it compatible with boot loaders supporting the FreeDOS kernel. It received several bug fixes and updates and as of October 2024 is under active maintenance.\nControversies.\nIn October 2005, it was discovered that DR-DOS 8.1 included several utilities from FreeDOS as well as other sources, and that the kernel was an outdated version of the Enhanced DR-DOS kernel. DR\u00a0DOS, Inc. failed to comply with the GNU General Public License (GPL) by not crediting the FreeDOS utilities to their authors and including the source code. After complaints from FreeDOS developers (including the suggestion to provide the source code, and hence comply with the GPL), DR\u00a0DOS, Inc. instead withdrew version 8.1, and also the unaffected 8.0, from its website.\nCommands.\nAPPEND, ASSIGN, BATCH, DBG, DELQ, ERA, ERAQ, MORE and SUBST have been among the internal commands supported since DR\u00a0DOS 3.31. DR\u00a0DOS 5.0 removed BATCH and added HILOAD. GOSUB, IDLE, RETURN and SWITCH were added as internal commands with DR\u00a0DOS 6.0. ASSIGN and SUBST were changed to become external commands with DR\u00a0DOS 6.0. ECHOERR and PAUSEERR existed as internal commands in DR\u00a0DOS 6.0 (and in Multiuser DOS), but were not normally enabled. MORE remained an internal command up to including PalmDOS, but was changed to an external command with Novell DOS 7. DBG was removed with Novell DOS 7, LOADHIGH, LH and TRUENAME were added as internal commands. APPEND was still an internal command in DR\u00a0DOS 6.0, but was changed to an external command with Novell DOS 7.\nInternal commands.\nThe following list of internal commands is supported by DR\u00a0DOS 6.0:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBatch processing subcommands.\nBatch processing subcommands of DR\u00a0DOS 6.0 include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal commands.\nDR\u00a0DOS 6.0 supports the following external commands:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are typically mission-driven planned communities, which administer a formal process for awarding artist residencies. A typical mission might include providing artists with the time, space, and support to create, fostering community among artists, and providing arts education, including lectures and workshops.\nEarly 20th century American guest-host models include MacDowell in Peterborough, New Hampshire and Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, New York. Two primary organizations serving artist colonies and residential centres are Res Artis in Amsterdam, and the Alliance of Artists Communities, in Providence, Rhode Island. Taiwan's Intra Asia Network is a less formal body working to advance creative communities and exchanges throughout Asia. Collectively, these groups oversee most of the world's active artists' colonies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFormative period in Europe.\nSome painters were renowned within artistic circles for settling down permanently in a single village, most notably Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet at Barbizon, Robert Wylie at Pont-Aven, Otto Modersohn at Worpswede, Heinrich Otto at Willinghausen, and Claude Monet at Giverny. They were not necessarily leaders, although these artists were respected and held a certain moral authority in their respective colonies. There were also regular 'colony hoppers' who moved about the art colonies of Europe in a nomadic fashion. Max Liebermann, for instance, painted at Barbizon, Dachau, Etzenhausen and at least six short-lived Dutch colonies; Frederick Judd Waugh worked in Barbizon, Concarneau, Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing, St Ives and Provincetown in the United States; Evert Pieters was active at Barbizon, Egmond, Katwijk, Laren, Blaricum, Volendam, and Oosterbeek; Elizabeth Armstrong Forbes painted at Pont-Aven, Zandvoort, Newlyn and St Ives.\nArt colonies initially emerged as village movements in the 19th and early 20th century. It is estimated that between 1830 and 1914, some 3,000 professional artists participated in a mass movement away from urban centres into the countryside, residing for varying lengths of time in over 80 communities. These colonies are typically characterized according to year-round permanence and population size. Thus, transient colonies had annually fluctuating populations of artists, often painters who visited for just a single summer season, in places, such as Honfleur, Giverny, Katwijk, Frauenchiemsee, Volendam, and Willingshausen. Semi-stable colonies are characterized by their semi-permanent mix of visiting and resident artists who bought or built their own homes and studios. Examples would include Ahrenshoop, Barbizon, Concarneau, Dachau, St. Ives, Laren, and Skagen. Finally, stable colonies are characterized by their large groups of permanent full-time resident artists who bought or built their own homes and studios, in places such as Egmond, Sint-Martens-Latem, Newlyn, and Worpswede.\nWhile artist colonies appeared across Europe, as well as in America and Australia, the majority of colonies were clustered in the Netherlands, Central Germany, and France (encircling Paris). Overall, artists of thirty-five different nationalities were represented throughout these colonies, with Americans, Germans and British forming the largest participating groups. This gave socialising a cosmopolitan flavour: \"Russia, Sweden, England, Austria, Germany, France, Australia and the United States were represented at our table, all as one large family, and striving towards the same goal,\" the painter Annie Goater penned in 1885 in an essay on her recent experiences at one French colony.\nVillages can also be classified according to the nationalities they attracted. Barbizon, Pont-Aven, Giverny, Katwijk, Newlyn, and Dachau drew artists from around the world and had a pronounced international flavour. Americans were always a major presence at Rijsoord, Egmond, Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing, Laren, and St Ives; Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing went through a Scandinavian phase in the 1880s; and Germans were the largest group after the indigenous Dutch at Katwijk. On the other hand, foreigners were rare at Sint-Martens-Latem, Tervuren, Nagybanya, Kronberg, Staithes, Worpswede, and Willingshausen, while Skagen hosted mainly Danes and a few other Scandinavians.\nThe greater number of early European art colonies were to be casualties of the First World War. Europe was no longer the same place socially, politically, economically and culturally, and art colonies seemed a quaint anachronism in an abrasively modernist world. However, a small proportion did endure in one or another form, and owe their continuing existence to cultural tourism. The colonies of Ahrenshoop, Barbizon, Fischerhude, Katwijk, Laren, Sint-Martens-Latem, Skagen, Volendam, Willingshausen, and Worpswede not only still operate in a modest fashion, but run their own museums where, besides maintaining historic collections of work produced at the colony, they organise exhibition and lecture programs. If they have not fared as well, several former major colonies such as Concarneau and Newlyn are remembered via small yet significant collections of pictures held in regional museums. Other colonies succumbed during the late twentieth century to cultural entrepreneurs who have redeveloped villages in the effort to simulate, within certain kitsch parameters, the 'authentic' appearance of the colony during its artistic heyday. This is not always successful, with Giverny, Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing, Kronberg, Le Pouldu, Pont-Aven, Schwaan, and Tervuren probably being among the most insensitively commercialised of the former art colonies.\nArt commune.\nAn art commune is a communal living situation colony where collective art is produced as a function of the group's activities. Contemporary art communes are scattered around the world, yet frequently aloof to widespread attention due to displeasure or discomfort with mainstream society. In the 1960s and 1970s art communes such as Friedrichshof (also known as Aktionsanalytische Organisation) flourished. Creative art was enthusiastically produced within such groups, which became gathering points for the counterculture movement.\nFrom a sociological viewpoint the art producing communes of the 1970s failed to sustain themselves, owing largely to the fact that they tended to have open memberships, which eventually attracted people with social problems. These problems then spread and become too difficult for these autonomous entities to handle, although some groups, such as the former Kunsthaus Tacheles, continued to flourish.\nToday's art communes are a mix of artists, drifters, collectivists, activists, dadaists, and hangers on. Such groups are more politically and ideologically diverse than their mid-20th century counterparts, which has led to many art communes becoming more mainstream commercial entities.\nUnited States.\nEarly model.\nSome art colonies are organized and planned, while others arise because some artists like to congregate, finding fellowship and inspiration\u2014and constructive competition\u2014in the company of other artists.\nThe American Academy in Rome, founded in 1894 originally as the American School of Architecture, which in the following year joined with the American School of Classical Studies, is often cited as the early model for what would become the modern arts and humanities colony. Its well-funded, well-organized campus, and extensive program of fellowships, were soon replicated by early 20th-century artist colonies and their wealthy benefactors.\nNortheast United States.\nNew Hampshire.\nThe MacDowell Colony in Peterborough was founded in 1907 by composer Edward MacDowell and his wife, Marian. MacDowell was inspired by the American Academy in Rome, and its mission to provide American artists with a home base at the centre of classical traditions and primary sources. MacDowell, who was a trustee of the American Academy, believed that a rural setting, free from distractions, would prove to be creatively valuable to artists. He also believed that discussions among working artists, architects and composers would enrich their work.\nNew York.\nThomas and Wilhelmina Weber Furlong of the Art Students League of New York named their private summer residence the Golden Heart Farm art colony when they opened it in the summer of 1921. Located in upstate New York on Lake George, the colony and its artists in residence were at the center of the American modernist movement as important artists from Manhattan traveled to Golden Heart Farm to escape the city and study with the couple.\nAnother famous colony, Yaddo in Saratoga Springs was founded soon after. Spencer Trask and his wife Katrina Trask conceived the idea of Yaddo in 1900, but the first residency program for artists did not formally initiate until 1926.\nThe Woodstock Art Colony in the town of the same name began as two colonies. Originally known as Byrdcliffe, it was founded in 1902 by Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead, Hervey White, and Bolton Brown. Two years later, Hervey White renamed it the Maverick Colony, after seceding from Byrdcliffe in 1904. The town of Woodstock remains an active center of art galleries, music, and theatrical performances.\nThe Roycroft community was an influential Arts and Crafts art colony that included both artisans and artists. Founded by Elbert Hubbard in 1895, in the village of East Aurora, New York, near Buffalo its artisans were influential on the development of early 20th-century American furniture, books, lamps and metalwork. The colony drew from the Saturday Sketch Club for many of its artists, as the club was located near a cabin used by Buffalo art students who specialized in outdoor oil painting.\nIn 1973, Edna St. Vincent Millay's sister Norma created the Millay Colony for the Arts at the historic site of Steepletop in Austerlitz.\nBy the early 1970s, East Hampton had developed a reputation as a vibrant artists' colony. A growing community of unconventional and experimental artists, writers, and performers established seasonal residences and shared spaces, fostering a bohemian atmosphere. The Hamptons continues to attract artists and creative professionals, helping to solidify its status as an influential center for the visual and performing arts.\nMassachusetts.\nThe Provincetown art colony came into being when Charles Webster Hawthorne opened his Cape Cod School of Art there in the summer of 1899. The art school attracted other artists, and expanded the colony, which led to the foundation of the Provincetown Art Association. By 1916, a \"Boston Globe\" headline reported the \"Biggest Art Colony in the World at Provincetown.\" Provincetown claims to be the oldest continuously operating artist's colony in the United States.\nRhode Island.\nThe Fort Thunder art commune was located in a warehouse on the second floor of a pre-Civil War former textile factory in the Olneyville district of Providence, Rhode Island. Started by artists and musicians Mat Brinkman and Brian Chippendale in 1995 and would be demolished to create a parking lot for a Shaw's grocery store and a Staples in 2002.\nSouthern United States.\nFlorida.\nIn Delray Beach, Florida, a seasonal Artists and Writers Colony existed during the winter months from the mid-1920s until the early 1950s. The Delray Beach enclave was noted for attracting many famous cartoonists of the era.\nMaryland.\nIn Nottingham, the Mid-Atlantic Plein Aire Company, most notable for the involvement of artist William David Simmons, remains active. Now known as the Mid-Atlantic Plein Air Painters Association (MAPAPA), its mission remains the same: to educate and expose local artists and the general public with classical painting traditions.\nMidwestern United States.\nMichigan.\nThe Ox-Bow School of Art and Artists' Residency was founded in Saugatuck in 1910 by Frederick Fursman and Walter Marshall Clute, both faculty from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). Fursman and Clute's vision was to create a respite where faculty and students could immerse themselves completely in artmaking, surrounded by a supportive community of artists and an inspired landscape of natural dunes, woods and water.\nWestern United States.\nArizona.\nThe desert town of Sedona, Arizona, became a Southwest artists' colony in the mid-20th century. Dadaist Max Ernst and Surrealist Dorothea Tanning arrived from New York in the late 1940s, when the town was populated by less than 500 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants, and small Native American communities. Amid the Wild West setting, Ernst built a small cottage by hand in Brewer Road, and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Yves Tanguy. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists, and for Ernst\u2014who compiled his book \"Beyond Painting\" and completed his sculptural masterpiece \"Capricorn\" while living there. The environment also inspired Egyptian sculptor Nassan Gobran to move there from Boston and become head of the art department at Verde Valley School.\nIn Southern Arizona in the early and mid-twentieth century, the Historic Fort Lowell enclave outside of Tucson, Arizona, became an artistic epicenter. The adobe ruins of the abandoned nineteenth century United States Cavalry fort had been adapted by Mexican-Americans into a small village called \"El Fuerte.\" During the 1920s, 30s and 40s, artists, writers and intellectuals, attracted by the rural elegance and stark landscape of the Sonoran Desert, and romanticism of the adobe ruins began buying, redesigning and building homes in this small community. Notable artists included Dutch-born artist Charles Bolsius, Black Mountain College instructor and photographer Hazel Larson Archer, architectural designer and painter Veronica Hughart, early modernist Jack Maul, French writers and artists Ren\u00e9 Cheruy and Germaine Cheruy, and noted anthropologists Edward H. Spicer and Rosamond Spicer\nThe small historic town of Jerome, Arizona was once a thriving copper mining town of 15,000. When the mining company Phelps Dodge closed the United Verde Mine and its related operations in 1953, the number of residents plummeted to 100. To prevent Jerome from disappearing entirely, the remaining residents turned to tourism and retail. To further encourage tourism, the residents sought National Historic Landmark status, which the federal government granted in 1967. Today, by sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the twenty-first century include art galleries, working public studios, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants. Many residents are full-time artists, writers, and musicians.\nCalifornia.\nJames Franklin Devendorf was one of the founders of the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club to support artistic works. The artists at Carmel-by-the-Sea, California coalesced in 1905 and incorporated their art gallery and meeting rooms a year later as the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club. They staged annual and special exhibitions, which attracted distinguished visiting artists from across the country, and provided professional instruction in painting, sculpture, and crafts. At the urging of his former student Jennie V. Cannon, William Merritt Chase was persuaded to teach his last summer school here in 1914. Between 1919 and ca.1948 it was the largest art colony on the Pacific Coast of the United States. In 1927, the Carmel Art Association replaced the Arts and Crafts Club and thrives today as the nexus of for the art community on the Peninsula of Monterey, California and Big Sur. The Carmel Art Institute was established in 1938, and included among its instructors Armin Hansen and Paul Dougherty. John Cunningham began at the Institute when he helped teach a painting class for Hansen when he fell ill. In 1940, Hansen and the Whitman transferred ownership of the institute to Cunningham and his wife.\nNew Mexico.\nThe Taos art colony in Taos, New Mexico is an example of more organic development. The semi-desert landscape, clear skies and stunning light, and the cultural richness of both Hispanic and Pueblo Indian cultures in and around Taos attracted many artists throughout the 20th century. Joseph Henry Sharp visited Taos on an 1883 sketching trip and later shared his enthusiasm for the area while studying in Paris with artists Bert G. Phillips and Ernest L. Blumenschein. As a result of a broken wagon wheel while en route to Mexico on September 3, 1898, the two artists stayed in the Taos area instead. Back in Paris, Blumenschein met Eangar I. Couse and told him of Taos. Oscar E. Berninghaus and Herbert Dunton joined the Taos artists,comprising the \"Founding\" group of six. On July 1, 1915, the Taos Society of Artists held its first meeting. In 1916 Mabel Dodge, the New York socialite, and her husband, artist Maurice Sterne, moved to Taos, where Mabel started Taos' literary colony and recruited many artists to relocate there. Georgia O\u2019Keeffe first visited Taos in 1929, visited the area every summer, and moved permanently to Abiquiu, New Mexico in 1946. Other famous artists who frequented Taos are Ansel Adams and D.H. Lawrence.Once artists began settling and working in Taos, others came, art galleries and museums were opened and the area became an artistic center\u2014though not a formal, funded art colony providing artists with aid, as Yaddo and MacDowell do.\nNorth America.\nUnited States.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEurope.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNote: Art colonies have only started to be investigated by scholars, with the chief historical studies consisting of Michael Jacobs and Nina L\u00fcbbren's work listed below.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is not a government institution, but its main sponsor is the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It is often referred to as the Tate Museum. The name \"Tate\" is used also as the operating name for the corporate body, which was established by the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 as \"The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery\".\nThe gallery was founded in 1897 as the National Gallery of British Art. When its role was changed to include the national collection of modern art as well as the national collection of British art, in 1932, it was renamed the Tate Gallery after sugar magnate Henry Tate of Tate &amp; Lyle, who had laid the foundations for the collection. The Tate Gallery was housed in the current building occupied by Tate Britain, which is situated in Millbank, London. In 2000, the Tate Gallery transformed itself into the current-day Tate, consisting of a network of four museums: Tate Britain, which displays the collection of British art from 1500 to the present day; Tate Modern, also in London, which houses the Tate's collection of British and international modern and contemporary art from 1900 to the present day; Tate Liverpool (founded in 1988), which has the same purpose as Tate Modern but on a smaller scale; and Tate St Ives in Cornwall (founded in 1993), which displays modern and contemporary art by artists who have connections with the area. All four museums share the Tate Collection. One of the Tate's most publicised art events is the awarding of the annual Turner Prize to a British visual artist, which takes place at Tate Britain every other year (taking place at venues outside of London in alternate years).\nHistory and development.\nThe original Tate was called the National Gallery of British Art, situated on Millbank, Pimlico, London at the site of the former Millbank Prison. The idea of a National Gallery of British Art was first proposed in the 1820s by Sir John Leicester, Baron de Tabley. It took a step nearer when Robert Vernon gave his collection to the National Gallery in 1847. A decade later John Sheepshanks gave his collection to the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum), known for years as the National Gallery of Art (the same title as the Tate Gallery had). Forty years later Sir Henry Tate who was a sugar magnate and a major collector of Victorian art, offered to fund the building of the gallery to house British Art on the condition that the State pay for the site and revenue costs. Henry Tate also donated his own collection to the gallery. It was initially a collection solely of modern British art, concentrating on the works of modern\u2014that is Victorian era\u2014painters. It was controlled by the National Gallery until 1954.\nFollowing the death of Sir Hugh Lane in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915, an oversight in his will meant that the collection of European modern art he had intended to go to Dublin controversially went to the Tate instead, which expanded its collection to include foreign art and continued to acquire contemporary art. In 1926 and 1937, the art dealer and patron Joseph Duveen paid for two major expansions of the gallery building. His father had earlier paid for an extension to house the major part of the Turner Bequest, which in 1987 was transferred to a wing paid for by Sir Charles Clore. Henry Courtauld also endowed Tate with a purchase fund. By the mid 20th century, it was fulfilling a dual function of showing the history of British art as well as international modern art. In 1954, the Tate Gallery was finally separated from the National Gallery.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the visual arts department of the Arts Council of Great Britain funded and organised temporary exhibitions at the Tate Gallery including, in 1966, a retrospective of Marcel Duchamp. Later, the Tate began organising its own temporary exhibition programme. In 1979 with funding from a Japanese bank a large modern extension was opened that would also house larger income generating exhibitions. In 1987, the Clore Wing opened to house the major part of the Turner bequest and also provided a 200-seat auditorium. (The \"Centenary Development\", in 2001, provided improved access and public amenities)\nIn 1988, an outpost in north west England opened as Tate Liverpool. This shows various works of modern art from the Tate collection as well as mounting its own temporary exhibitions. In 2007, Tate Liverpool hosted the Turner Prize, the first time this has been held outside London. This was an overture to Liverpool's being the European Capital of Culture 2008.\nIn 1993, another offshoot opened, Tate St Ives. It exhibits work by modern British artists, particularly those of the St Ives School. Additionally the Tate also manages the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden, which opened in 1980.\nNeither of these two new Tates had a significant effect on the functioning of the original London Tate Gallery, whose size was increasingly proving a constraint as the collection grew. It was a logical step to separate the \"British\" and \"Modern\" aspects of the collection, and they are now housed in separate buildings in London. The original gallery is now called Tate Britain and is the national gallery for British art from 1500 to the present day, as well as some modern British art. Tate Modern, in Bankside Power Station on the south side of the Thames, opened in 2000 and now exhibits the national collection of modern art from 1900 to the present day, including some modern British art.\nIn the late 2000s, the Tate announced a new development project to the south of the existing building. According to the museum this new development would \"transform Tate Modern. An iconic new building will be added at the south of the existing gallery. It will create more spaces for displaying the collection, performance and installation art and learning, all allowing visitors to engage more deeply with art, as well as creating more social spaces for visitors to unwind and relax in the gallery.\" Arts philanthropist John Studzinski donated more than \u00a36million to the project. The extension to Tate Modern opened in 2016 as The Switch House and, in 2017, was renamed the Blavatnik Building after Anglo-Ukrainian billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, who contributed a \"substantial\" amount of its \u00a3260m cost.\nThe youngest person to be awarded a residency at the Tate is Travis Alabanza.\nTate Digital.\nTate Digital is the name of the department responsible for Tate's website and other public-facing digital projects. Since its launch in 1998, Tate's website site has provided information on all four physical Tate galleries (Tate Britain, Tate St Ives, Tate Liverpool and Tate Modern) under the same domain. Other resources include illustrated information on all works in Tate's Collection of British and Modern, Contemporary and international art, all of Tate's research publications, and articles from the magazine \"Tate Etc.\" BT was the primary sponsor of Tate Online from 2001 to 2009.\nTate Online has been used as a platform for Internet art exhibits, termed \"Net Art\", which are organised as part of Tate's \"Intermedia Art\" initiative covering new media art. 13 net art exhibitions have been shown since the initiative started in 2000 including Tate in Space (2002) which was nominated in the Interactive Art category for the 2003 BAFTA Interactive awards.\nAdministration and funding.\nTate receives annual funding from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It is administered by a board of trustees, who are responsible for the running of the gallery and appoint the Director (for a period of seven years). Under the Charities Act 1993, the Tate is an exempt charity accountable directly to Government rather than the Charity Commission for financial returns etc. However, the Trustees are still expected to follow the broad responsibilities of charity trustees, and may be subject to Charity Commission oversight on these elements of their activities.\nMaria Balshaw has been Director of Tate since 2017, succeeding Sir Nicholas Serota (1988 to 2017). Under the Director, Kerstin Mogull has been managing director of Tate since January 2014, succeeding Alex Beard.\nVarious bodies have been set up to support the Tate including Tate Members for the general public, where a yearly fee gives rights such as free entry to charging exhibitions and members' rooms. There is also Tate Patrons for a higher subscription fee and the Tate Foundation. There are a number of corporate sponsors. In addition individual shows are often sponsored.\nTate now spends around \u00a31 million of its general funds each year on purchasing acquisitions and their related costs. The Outset Contemporary Art Fund was established in 2003, by Tate patrons Yana Peel and Candida Gertler. In collaboration with the Frieze Art Fair, the fund buys works from the fair for the Tate's collections. Other funds for acquisitions are raised by Tate funding groups such as the Members, the Patrons and the American Patrons of Tate and its sub-committees, the North American Acquisitions Committee and Latin American Acquisitions Committee. The American Patrons were renamed in 2013 to reflect their expanding geographical base of support; since 1999, this support group alone has raised more than $100 million.\nIn 2010, a photography acquisitions committee was launched. In 2012, the Tate established a South Asian acquisitions committee to collect contemporary and modern art from India and surrounding countries, as well as a committee for works from Russia, Eastern Europe and the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States).\nLogo and brand.\nThe Tate logo was designed by international brand consultancy Wolff Olins in 2000 as part of a larger rebranding effort focused around the idea \"look again, think again.\" The museum uses a range of logos that move in and out of focus, \"suggesting the dynamic nature of Tate \u2013 always changing but always recognizable\" Variations include a standard logo, a blurred version, a faded version and a halftone version consisting of dots rather than smooth fading. An update on the brand, designed by North, was released in 2016.\nDirectors.\nThe head of the Tate (formally the National Gallery of British Art and the Tate Gallery) is currently titled the Director. Until 1917, they were styled the Keeper.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located on The Mound in central Edinburgh, close to Princes Street. The building was designed in a neoclassical style by William Henry Playfair, and first opened to the public in 1859.\nThe gallery houses Scotland's national collection of fine art, spanning Scottish and international art from the beginning of the Renaissance up to the start of the 20th century.\nThe National is run by National Galleries Scotland, a public body that also owns the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Because of its architectural similarity, the National is frequently confused by visitors with the neighbouring Royal Scottish Academy Building (RSA), a separate institution which works closely with the National.\nHistory.\nThe origins of Scotland's national collection lie with the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, founded in 1819. It began to acquire paintings, and in 1828 the Royal Institution building opened on The Mound. In 1826, the Scottish Academy was founded by a group of artists who, dissatisfied with its policies, seceded from the Royal Institution, and in 1838 it became the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA). A key aim of the RSA was the founding of a national collection. It began to build up a collection and from 1835 rented exhibition space within the Royal Institution building.\nIn the 1840s, plans were put in place for a new building to house the RSA. The noted Scottish architect William Henry Playfair was commissioned to prepare designs, and on 30 August 1850, Prince Albert laid the foundation stone. The building was originally divided along the middle, with the east half housing the exhibition galleries of the RSA, and the western half containing the new National Gallery of Scotland, formed from the collection of the Royal Institution. In 1912 the RSA moved into the Royal Institution building, which remains known as the Royal Scottish Academy Building. When it re-opened, the gallery concentrated on building its permanent collection of Scottish and European art for the nation of Scotland.\nIn the early 21st century, the National Galleries launched the Playfair Project, a scheme to create a new basement entrance to the National Gallery in Princes Street Gardens and an underground connecting space, called the Weston Link, between the gallery and the renovated Royal Scottish Academy building. The new underground space opened in 2004.\nIn 2012, the gallery's umbrella organisation, National Galleries of Scotland, underwent a rebranding exercise, and National Gallery of Scotland was renamed the Scottish National Gallery.\nIn 2023, the organisation was rebranded once more, and adopted the shorter name \"National Galleries Scotland\". Each of its galleries was also rebranded and the Scottish National Gallery is now billed as \"National Galleries Scotland: National\".\nBuilding.\nWilliam Playfair's building\u2014like its neighbour, the Royal Scottish Academy\u2014was designed in the form of an ancient Greek temple. While Playfair designed the RSA in the Doric order, the National Gallery building is in the Ionic order. The main east and west elevations have plain pilastrading with the higher central transverse block having hexastyle Ionic porticoes. Paired Ionic columns in antis are flanked by tetrastyle Ionic porticoes at north and south. The design reflects the building's original dual purpose being divided longitudinally with the exhibition galleries of the RSA to the east and the National Gallery to the west.\nPlayfair worked to a much more limited budget than the RSA project, and this is reflected in his comparatively austere architectural style. He may have drawn inspiration from an 1829 scheme for an arcade of shops by Archibald Elliot II, son of Archibald Elliot. Playfair's National Gallery was laid out in a cruciform plan; he originally planned to build towers at the corners of the transverse central block, but these were abandoned during the project. When the RSA moved into the former Royal Institution building in 1912, the Office of Works Architect for Scotland, William Thomas Oldrieve remodelled the NGS interior to house the National Gallery collection exclusively.\nIn the 1970s, when the gallery was under the direction of the Department of the Environment, the internal accommodation was extended. An upper floor was added at the south end in 1972, creating five new small galleries, and in 1978 a new gallery was opened in the basement to house the Gallery's Scottish Collection.\nThe new Princes Street Gardens entrance and underground space opened in 2004 was designed by John Miller and Partners. Construction took five years and cost \u00a332 million. The area contains a lecture theatre, education area, shop, restaurant, an interactive gallery, and a link to the RSA building.\nIn January 2019, construction work began on a project to alter the lower level areas and to create extended exhibition space. It is planned that the Princes Street Gardens entrance will become the main entrance of the gallery; to facilitate access, East Princes Street Gardens is being re-landscaped with sloping paths and 52 trees have been felled, to be replaced with 22 newly planted saplings. The redevelopment is delayed until at least late 2022, as a result of asbestos being found in part of the structure and due to the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResearch.\nThe research facilities at the Scottish National Gallery include the Prints and Drawings Collection of over 30,000 works on paper, from the early Renaissance to the late nineteenth century; and the reference-only Research Library. The Research Library covers the period from 1300 to 1900 and holds approximately 50,000 volumes of books, journals, slides, and microfiches, as well as some archival material relating to the collections, exhibitions and history of the National Gallery. The Print Room or Research Library can be accessed by appointment.\nCollection.\nAt the heart of the National Gallery's collection is a group of paintings transferred from the Royal Scottish Academy. This includes masterpieces by Jacopo Bassano, Van Dyck and Giambattista Tiepolo. The National Gallery did not receive its own purchase grant until 1903.\nIn the Gallery's main ground floor rooms are displayed a number of major large-scale canvases such as Benjamin West's \"Alexander III of Scotland Rescued from the Fury of a Stag\" (1786), Rubens's \"The Feast of Herod\" (1633 or c.1637-38) and a pair of paintings by Titian, \"Diana and Actaeon\" and \"Diana and Callisto\" (purchased jointly with the National Gallery, London). The Scottish National Gallery has also jointly acquired one of Canova's sculptures of The Three Graces with the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nThe Scottish National Gallery has a notable collection of works by Scottish artists, including several landscapes by Alexander Nasmyth, and several works by Sir Henry Raeburn \u2014 of particular note his portraits of Alexander Ranaldson Macdonell and Sir Walter Scott), and his celebrated painting, \"The Skating Minister\". There are also a number of works by artists of the Glasgow School such as James Guthrie. The Gallery also holds a collection of works by English painters, such as Constable's \"The Vale of Dedham\" and a sizeable collection of water colours by Turner which are traditionally displayed in January. \"The Monarch of the Glen\", a painting considered to depict the grandeur of the wildlife and scenery of the Scottish Highlands, is also held in the gallery, the work of the English painter Sir Edwin Landseer.\nNotable works.\nKey works of art displayed at the National Gallery include:\nOther artists represented in the collection include:"}

Founded in 1861, it is Australia's oldest and most visited art museum.\nWith over 76,000 works in its collection, the NGV has the largest collection of any Australian gallery. The NGV houses its collection across two sites: NGV International, located on St Kilda Road in the Melbourne Arts Precinct of Southbank, and the , located nearby at Federation Square. The NGV International building, designed by Sir Roy Grounds, opened in 1968, and was redeveloped by Mario Bellini before reopening in 2003. It houses the gallery's international art collection and is on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, designed by Lab Architecture Studio, opened in 2002 and houses the gallery's Australian art collection.\nA third site, The Fox: NGV Contemporary, is planned to open in the Melbourne Arts Precinct in 2028, and will be Australia's largest contemporary art gallery.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nIn 1850, the Port Phillip District of New South Wales was granted separation, officially becoming the colony of Victoria on 1 July 1851. In the wake of a gold rush the following month, Victoria emerged as Australia's richest colony, and Melbourne, its capital, Australia's largest and wealthiest city. With Melbourne's rapid growth came calls for the establishment of a public art gallery, and in 1859, the Government of Victoria pledged \u00a32000 for the acquisition of plaster casts of sculpture. These works were displayed in the Museum of Art, opened by Governor Sir Henry Barkly in May 1861 on the lower floor of the south wing of the public Library (now the State Library of Victoria) on Swanston Street. Further money was set aside in the early 1860s for the purchase of original paintings by British and Victorian artists. These works were first displayed in December 1864 in the newly opened Picture Gallery, which remained under the curatorial administration of the Public Library until 1882. Grand designs for a building fronting Lonsdale and Swanston streets were drawn by Nicholas Chevalier in 1860 and Frederick Grosse in 1865, featuring an enormous and elaborate library and gallery, but these visions were never realised.\nOn 24 May 1874, the first purpose-built gallery, known as the McArthur Gallery, opened in the McArthur room of the State Library, and the following year, the Museum of Art was renamed the National Gallery of Victoria. The McArthur Gallery was only ever intended as a temporary home until the much grander vision was to be realised. However such an edifice did not eventuate and the complex was instead developed incrementally over several decades.\nThe National Gallery of Victoria Art School, associated with the gallery, was founded in 1867 and remained the leading centre for academic art training in Australia until about 1910. The School's graduates went on to become some of Australia's most significant artists. This later became the VCA (Victorian College of the Arts), which was bought by the University of Melbourne in 2007 after it went bankrupt.\nIn 1887, the Buvelot Gallery (later Swinburne Hall) was opened, along with the Painting School studios. In 1892, two more galleries were added: Stawell (now Cowen) and La Trobe.\nIn 1888, the gallery purchased Lawrence Alma-Tadema's 1871 painting \"The Vintage Festival\" for \u00a34000, its most expensive acquisition of the 19th century.\n20th century.\nThe gallery's collection was built from both gifts of works of art and monetary donations. The most significant, the Felton Bequest, was established by the will of Alfred Felton and from 1904, has been used to purchase over 15,000 works of art.\nSince the Felton Bequest, the gallery had long held plans to build a permanent facility; however, it was not until 1943 that the State Government chose a site, Wirth's Park, just south of the Yarra River. \u00a33 million was put forward in February 1960 and Roy Grounds was announced as the architect.\nIn 1959, the commission to design a new gallery was awarded to the architectural firm Grounds Romberg Boyd. In 1962, Roy Grounds split from his partners Frederick Romberg and Robin Boyd, retained the commission, and designed the gallery at 180 St Kilda Road (now known as NGV International). The new bluestone clad building was completed in December 1967 and Victorian premier Henry Bolte officially opened it on 20 August 1968. One of the features of the building is the Leonard French stained glass ceiling, one of the world's largest pieces of suspended stained glass, which casts colourful light on the floor below. The water-wall entrance is another well-known feature of the building.\nIn 1997, redevelopment of the building was proposed, with Mario Bellini chosen as architect and an estimated project cost of $161.9 million. The design was extensive, creating all new galleries leaving only the exterior, the central courtyard and Great Hall intact. The plans included doing away with the water wall, but following public protests organised by the National Trust of Victoria, the design was altered to include a new one slightly forward of the original. During the redevelopment, many works were moved to a temporary external annex known as 'NGV on Russell', at the State Library with its entrance on Russell Street.\n21st century.\nA major fundraising drive was launched on 10 October 2000 to redevelop the ageing St Kilda Road building and although the state government committed the majority of the funds, private donations were sought in addition to federal funding. The drive achieved its aim and secured $15 million from the Ian Potter Foundation on 11 July 2000, $3 million from Loti Smorgon, $2 million from the Clemenger Foundation, and $1 million each from James Fairfax and the Pratt Foundation.\nNGV on Russell closed on 30 June 2002 to make way for the staged opening of the new St Kilda Road gallery. It was officially opened by premier Steve Bracks on 4 December 2003.\nThe Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia in Federation Square was designed by Lab Architecture Studio to house the NGV's Australian art collection. It opened in 2002. As such, the NGV's collection is now housed in two separate buildings, with Grounds' building renamed NGV International.\nFrom 15 December 2024 to 21 April 2025, the NGV hosted a Yayoi Kusama exhibition, which was the largest exhibition the NGV had ever dedicated to a single living artist, with the exhibition traversing the entire ground floor of NGV International and spilling out onto St Kilda Road; the exhibition drew 570,537 attendees over its run, making it the highest attended ticketed exhibition in the NGV's history and the highest attended visual art exhibition held in Australia, with over 24% of visitors who attended the exhibition coming from interstate or overseas.\nLocations.\nSt Kilda Road: NGV International.\nNGV international is located at 180 St Kilda Rd and houses the NGV's European, Asian, Oceanic and American art collections. It houses a number of permanent displays, arranged by region and chronology. It also has a large ground-floor space used for temporary exhibitions, and contemporary art spaces on level 3 are also used for temporary exhibitions. The building is surrounded by a moat and fountains, while the main entrance features a famous water wall, which has been used to display the art of Keith Haring and others. At the rear of NGV International is a sculpture garden, which hosts an annual large-scale installation through the NGV Architecture Commission.\nIan Potter Centre: NGV Australia.\nNGV Australia is located in the at Federation Square. The building houses the NGV's Australian collection, with a permanent display presenting a chronological history of Australian art and a selection of the galley's 25,000 Australian works. NGV Australia has a particular focus on Indigenous Australian art, and alongside the permanent displays presents temporary exhibitions relating to Australian art and history.\nThe Fox: NGV Contemporary.\nIn 2018, the State Government of Victoria announced a new contemporary art gallery would be built behind the Arts Centre and the existing NGV International building. The Government spent $203 million to begin the project, including $150 million to purchase the former Carlton and United Breweries building for the new gallery. The new building is part of a major new $1.7 billion redevelopment of the surrounding Melbourne Arts Precinct which is planned to include 18,000 square metres of new public space, new space for contemporary art and design exhibitions, and a new home for the Australian Performing Arts Gallery. The Ian Potter Foundation pledged $20 million for the new building. The masterplan for the precinct was approved in 2022. The public space is being designed by architecture firms HASSELL and SO-IL with a new elevated garden connecting Hamer Hall and Southbank Boulevard.\nThe winner of the design competition for the NGV Contemporary was announced in March 2022 as Angelo Candalepas and Associates. In April it was announced that billionaires Paula and Lindsay Fox had donated $100 million to the NGV Contemporary project in the largest ever donation to an Australian art museum, and that the gallery would be named The Fox: NGV Contemporary. The new gallery will have 13,000 square metres of exhibition space and is planned to open in 2028. It will be Australia's largest contemporary gallery.\nCollection.\nAsian art.\nThe NGV's Asian art collection began in 1862, one year after the gallery's founding, when Frederick Dalgety donated two Chinese plates. The Asian collection has since grown to include significant works from across the continent.\nAustralian art.\nThe NGV's Australian art collection encompasses Indigenous (Australian Aboriginal) art and artefacts, Australian colonial art, Australian Impressionist art, 20th century, modern and contemporary art. The first curator of Australian Art was Brian Finemore, from 1960 until his death in 1975.\nThe 1880s saw the birth and development of the Heidelberg School (also known as Australian Impressionism) in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, and the NGV was well-placed to acquire some of the movement's key artworks, including Tom Roberts' \"Shearing the Rams\" (1890), Arthur Streeton's \"The purple noon's transparent might\" (1896), and Frederick McCubbin's \"The Pioneer\" (1904).\nThe Australian collection includes works by Del Kathryn Barton, Charles Blackman, Clarice Beckett, Arthur Boyd, John Brack, Angela Brennan, Rupert Bunny, Louis Buvelot, Ethel Carrick, Nicholas Chevalier, Charles Conder, Olive Cotton, Grace Crowley David Davies, Destiny Deacon, William Dobell, Julie Dowling, Russell Drysdale, E. Phillips Fox, Rosalie Gascoigne, John Glover, Eugene von Guerard, Fiona Hall, Louise Hearman, Joy Hester, Hans Heysen, Emily Kame Kngwarreye, George W. Lambert, Sydney Long, John Longstaff, Frederick McCubbin, Helen Maudsley, Tracey Moffatt, Jan Nelson, Hilda Rix Nicholas, Sidney Nolan, John Perceval, Patricia Piccinini, Margaret Preston, Thea Proctor, Hugh Ramsay, David Rankin, Tom Roberts, John Russell, Grace Cossington Smith, Ethel Spowers, Arthur Streeton, Clara Southern, Jane Sutherland, Violet Teague, Jenny Watson, Fred Williams and others.\nA large number of works were donated by Dr. Joseph Brown in 2004 which form the Joseph Brown Collection.\nSelected works\nInternational art.\nThe NGV's international art collection encompasses European and international paintings, fashion and textiles, photography, prints and drawings, Asian art, decorative arts, Mesoamerican art, Pacific art, sculpture, antiquities and global contemporary art. It has strong collections in areas as diverse as old masters, Greek vases, Egyptian artefacts and historical European ceramics, and contains the largest and most comprehensive range of artworks in Australia.\nThe international collection includes works by Arbus, Bernini, Bonnard, Bordone, Canaletto, C\u00e9zanne, Constable, Correggio, Dal\u00ed, Degas, Delaunay, van Dyck, Emin, Gainsborough, Gentileschi, El Greco, Lange, Manet, Matisse, Memling, Modigliani, Monet, Moore, Munch, Picasso, Pissarro, Pittoni, Poussin, Rembrandt, Renoir, Ribera, Riley, Rothko, Rubens, Soulages, Tiepolo, Tintoretto, Titian, Turner, Uccello, Veronese and others.\nOne of the highlights of the NGV's international collection is Auguste Rodin's first cast of his iconic sculpture \"The Thinker\", executed in 1884. The NGV is also home to the only portrait of Lucrezia Borgia known to have been painted from life, dated to approximately 1515 and attributed to Dosso Dossi.\nSelected works\nPhotography.\nIn 1967, the NGV established the first curatorial department dedicated to photography in an Australian public gallery, one of the first in the world. It now holds over 15,000 works. In that same year, the Gallery acquired the photography collection's first work, \"Surrey Hills street\" 1948 by David Moorehttp:// and in 1969 the first international work was acquired, \"Nude\" 1939 by Franti\u0161ek Drtikolhttps://. The first photographer to exhibit solo at the NGV was Mark Strizic in 1968. Jennie Boddington, a filmmaker, was appointed first full-time curator of photography in 1972, possibly only the third such appointment amongst world public institutions.\nPrints and drawings.\nThe NGV's Department of Prints and Drawings is responsible for one third of the gallery's collection. Highlights among the department's holdings include one of the world's largest collections of engravings and woodcuts by D\u00fcrer. The NGV is also said to have one of the most impressive collections of works by William Blake, including 36 of the 102 watercolours he worked on up until his death in 1827 to illustrate the \"Divine Comedy\" by Dante, the largest number of works from this series held by any gallery in the world. Rembrandt and Goya are also well-represented, and the Australian collection contains a detailed account of the history of graphic arts in Australia.\nThe NGV no longer dedicates a space to exhibiting works from the Prints and Drawings collection, though some works on paper are rotated within the permanent collection galleries and may appear in exhibitions. Works in the collection may be viewed by appointment in the department's Print Study Room.\nSelected works\nControversies.\nAs a \"National Gallery\".\nWhen plans for the construction of the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra became firmly established in the 1960s, Australia's state galleries removed the word \"national\" from their names (for example, the National Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney became the Art Gallery of New South Wales). This naming convention dated back to the 19th century when Australia's colonies were self-governing political entities and had yet to federate. Only the NGV has retained \"national\" in its name. This has proven to be somewhat contentious, given that the NGV is technically not a national gallery, and occasionally there have been calls for it to follow the example of the other state galleries.\nWithdrawal of \"Chlo\u00e9\".\nIn May 1883, when the National Gallery of Victoria opened on a Sunday for the first time, a public debate erupted over the propriety of displaying a female nude portrait on the Sabbath. The painting in question, French artist Jules Joseph Lefebvre's \"Chlo\u00e9\" (1875), had been loaned to the gallery that month, and was \"cautiously displayed in a dim corner\". Nonetheless, \"Chlo\u00e9\" became \"Melbourne's \"femme fatale\"\", and after three weeks of scandal, was withdrawn and hidden from the public. It eventually found a permanent home at Melbourne's Young and Jackson Hotel, down the road from the NGV on Swanston Street.\nSlaughtered Cow happening.\nIn 1975, painter and performance artist Ivan Durrant deposited a cow carcass in the NGV forecourt. Durrant later stated that it was part of a performance art piece intended to shock those who might be horrified by the death of the animal while also happy to consume meat. At the time, the NGV denounced the piece as a \"sick and disgusting act\".\nPicasso theft.\nA famous event in the gallery's history occurred in 1986 with the theft of Pablo Picasso's painting \"The Weeping Woman\" (1936). A person or group identifying themselves as the \"Australian Cultural Terrorists\" claimed responsibility for the theft, stating that the painting was stolen in protest against the perceived poor treatment of the arts by the state government of the time. They sought as a ransom the establishment of an art prize for young artists. The painting was found undamaged in a railway locker two weeks later and returned to the gallery.\n\"Piss Christ\".\nDuring a retrospective of Andres Serrano's work at the NGV in 1997, the then Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, George Pell, sought an injunction from the Supreme Court of Victoria to restrain the gallery from publicly displaying \"Piss Christ\", which was not granted. Some days later, one patron attempted to remove the work from the gallery wall, and two teenagers later attacked it with a hammer. Gallery officials reported receiving death threats in response to \"Piss Christ\". NGV Director Timothy Potts cancelled the show, allegedly out of concern for a Rembrandt exhibition that was also on display at the time. Supporters argued that the controversy over \"Piss Christ\" is an issue of artistic freedom and freedom of speech.\nSpecial exhibitions.\nAn exhibition known as \"The Field\" opened the gallery's new premises on St Kilda Road in 1968. Reflecting the influence of abstract art, particularly New York-inspired hard edge and color field painting, it featured 74 works by forty (mostly emerging young) Australian painters and sculptors. Described as a radical departure from the gallery's more traditional program, it signified more broadly a growing internationalisation of the Australian art world. The NGV held an exhibition titled \"The Field Revisited\" in 2018 to mark its 50th anniversary.\nMelbourne Winter Masterpieces.\nThe NGV has held several large exhibitions known as Melbourne Winter Masterpieces exhibitions, starting with \"Impressionists: Masterpieces from the Musee d'Orsay\" in 2004.\nMelbourne Now.\nIn 2013 the NGV launched \"Melbourne Now\", an exhibition which celebrated the latest art, architecture, design, performance and cultural practice to reflect the complex cultural landscape of creative Melbourne. \"Melbourne Now\" ran from 22 November 2013 \u2013 23 March 2014 and attracted record attendances of 753,071.\nA decade after the original exhibition, a second edition of Melbourne Now ran from 24 March 2023 to 20 August 2023 at the Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia. The exhibition, which celebrated home-grown art and design from over 200 Victorian-based emerging and established artists, designers, studios and firms, drew 433,575 attendees, which made the exhibition one of the most popular exhibitions at the Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia.\nNGV Triennial.\nFollowing the success of \"Melbourne Now\", in March 2014 the NGV announced a major new initiative, the NGV Triennial. Beginning in the Summer of 2017, it is intended as a large-scale celebration of the best of contemporary international art and design. The inaugural Triennial ran from 15 December 2017 to 15 April 2018, and drew almost 1.3 million visitors during its run, making it the most attended exhibition in the gallery's history until then.\nThe 2020\u201321 NGV Triennial opened on 19 December 2020 and closed on 18 April 2021. The exhibition, which attracted more than 548,000 visitors during its run, showcased works by more than 100 artists, designers and collectives from 30 countries, with 34 newly commissioned works from a mixture of both Australian and international artists.\nThe 2023\u201324 NGV Triennial, running from 3 December 2023 until 7 April 2024, featured over 75 projects by 100 artists, designers and collectives from over 30 countries. The exhibition attracted 1,063,675 visitors during its run, making it one of the most popular exhibitions in the NGV\u2019s history.\nPublications.\nThe \"Art Journal of the National Gallery of Victoria\", usually referred to as the \"Art Journal\", was first published as \"The Quarterly Bulletin of the National Gallery of Victoria\" in 1945, changing its name and frequency in 1959 to the \"Annual Bulletin of the National Gallery of Victoria\", then to the \"Art Bulletin of Victoria\" in 1967\u201368 (edition 9) (abbreviated to ABV, edition 42). For edition 50 in 2011, in its 50th year of publication and 150th anniversary of the gallery, the name was changed to its present name.\nThe NGV also publishes a bi-monthly magazine, \"NGV Magazine.\"\nDirectors of the NGV.\nDirectors of the NGV since its inception:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The institution was founded in 1930 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (1875\u20131942), a prominent American socialite, sculptor, and art patron after whom it is named.\nThe Whitney focuses on collecting and preserving 20th- and 21st-century American art. Its permanent collection, spanning the late-19th century to the present, comprises more than 25,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, films, videos, and artifacts of new media by more than 3,500 artists. It places particular emphasis on exhibiting the work of living artists as well as maintaining institutional archives of historical documents pertaining to modern and contemporary American art, including the Edward and Josephine Hopper Research Collection (the museum is the largest repository of Edward Hopper's artwork and archival materials in the world), the Sanborn Hopper Archive, and the Arshile Gorky Research Collection, among others.\nFrom 1966 to 2014, the Whitney was located at 945 Madison Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side in a building designed by Marcel Breuer and Hamilton P. Smith. The museum closed in October 2014 to relocate to its current building, which was designed by Renzo Piano, at 99 Gansevoort Street and opened on May 1, 2015, expanding the museum exhibition space to .\nThe museum organizes the Whitney Biennial, a bi-annual exhibition showcasing the work of emerging American artists, considered the longest-running and most important survey of contemporary art in the United States. The museum also heads the Whitney Independent Study Program, which began in 1968, to support artists, critics and art historians by \"encouraging the theoretical and critical study of the practices, institutions, and discourses that constitute the field of culture\". In 2023, with 768,000 visitors, the Whitney was the 31st most-visited museum in the United States and the 89th most-visited art museum in the world.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nGertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, the museum's namesake and founder, was a well-regarded sculptor and serious art collector. As a patron of the arts, she began acquiring art in 1905, and had achieved some success with the Whitney Studio and Whitney Studio Club, New York\u2013based exhibition spaces she operated from 1914 to 1928 to promote the works of \"avant garde\" and unrecognized American artists. Whitney favored the radical art of the American artists of the Ashcan School such as John Sloan, George Luks, and Everett Shinn, as well as others such as Edward Hopper, Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Charles Sheeler, and Max Weber.\nWith the aid of her assistant, Juliana R. Force, Whitney collected nearly 700 works of American art. In 1929, she offered to donate over 500 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but the museum declined the gift. This, along with the apparent preference for European modernism at the recently opened Museum of Modern Art, led Whitney to start her own museum, exclusively for American art, in 1929.\nWhitney Library archives from 1928 reveal that during this time, the Studio Club used the gallery space of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong of the Art Students League to exhibit traveling shows featuring modernist work. The Whitney Museum of American Art was founded in 1930; at this time architect Noel L. Miller was converting three row houses on West 8th Street in Greenwich Village\u2014one of which, 8 West 8th Street had been the location of the Studio Club\u2014to be the museum's home, as well as a residence for Whitney. The museum opened November 18, 1931. Juliana Force became the museum's first director, and under her guidance, it concentrated on displaying the works of new and contemporary American artists. She declared at the opening, \"There may be pictures here that you do not like, but they are here to stay, so you may as well get used to them.\"\nIn 1954, the museum left its original location and moved to a small structure on 54th Street connected to and behind the Museum of Modern Art on 53rd Street. On April 15, 1958, a fire on MOMA's second floor that killed one person forced the evacuation of paintings and staff on MOMA's upper floors to the Whitney. Among the paintings evacuated was \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\", which was on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago.\nMove to the Upper East Side.\nIn 1961, the Whitney began seeking a site for a larger building. In 1966, it settled at the southeast corner of Madison Avenue and 75th Street on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The building, planned and built 1963\u20131966 by Marcel Breuer and Hamilton P. Smith in a distinctively modern style, is easily distinguished from the neighboring townhouses by its staircase fa\u00e7ade made of granite stones and its trapezoidal windows. In 1967, Mauricio Lasansky showed \"The Nazi Drawings\". The exhibition traveled to the Whitney, where it appeared with shows by Louise Nevelson and Andrew Wyeth as the first exhibits in the new museum.\nThe institution grappled with space problems for decades. In 1967, the museum opened a satellite space called the Art Resources Center (ARC). Originally intended to be located in the South Bronx, the ARC opened on Cherry Street on the Lower East Side. From 1973 to 1983, the Whitney operated a branch at 55 Water Street, a building owned by Harold Uris, who gave the museum a lease for $1 a year. In 1983, Philip Morris International installed a Whitney branch in the lobby of its Park Avenue headquarters. In 1981, the museum opened an exhibition space in Stamford, Connecticut, housed at Champion International. In the late 1980s, the Whitney entered into arrangements with Park Tower Realty, IBM, and the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, setting up satellite museums with rotating exhibitions in their buildings' lobbies. Each museum had its own director, with all plans approved by a Whitney committee.\nThe institution attempted to expand its landmark building in 1978, commissioning UK architects Derek Walker and Norman Foster to design a tall tower alongside it, the first of several proposals from leading architects, but each time, the effort was abandoned, because of the cost, the design, or both. To secure additional space for the museum's collections, then-director Thomas N. Armstrong III developed plans for a 10-story, $37.5 million addition to the main building. The proposed addition, designed by Michael Graves and announced in 1985, drew immediate opposition. Graves had proposed demolishing the flanking brownstones down to the East 74th Street corner for a complementary addition. The project gradually lost the support of the museum's trustees, and the plans were dropped in 1989. In 1988, a satellite branch was opened at 33 Maiden Lane. Between 1995 and 1998, the building underwent a renovation and expansion by Richard Gluckman. In 2001, Rem Koolhaas was commissioned to submit two designs for a $200 million expansion. Those plans were dropped in 2003, causing director Maxwell L. Anderson to resign. New York restaurateur Danny Meyer opened Untitled, a restaurant in the museum, in March 2011. The space was designed by the Rockwell Group.\nMove downtown.\nThe Whitney developed a new main building, designed by Renzo Piano, in the West Village and Meatpacking District in lower Manhattan. The new museum, at the intersection of Gansevoort and Washington Streets, was built on a previously city-owned site and marks the southern entrance to the High Line park. Construction began in 2010, and the project cost $422 million. After an April 30, 2015, ceremonial ribbon-cutting attended by Michelle Obama and Bill de Blasio, the new building opened on May 1, 2015. Robert Silman Associates was the structural engineer; Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles provided MEP services; Ove Arup &amp; Partners was the lighting/daylighting engineer; and Turner Construction LLC served as construction manager.\nThe new structure spans and eight stories that include the city's largest column-free art gallery spaces, an education center, theater, a conservation laboratory, and a library and reading rooms. Two of the floors are fully devoted to the museum's permanent collection. The only permanent artwork commissioned for the site\u2014its four main elevators\u2014were conceived by Richard Artschwager. The new building's collection comprises over 600 works by over 400 artists. Observation decks on the floors five through eight are linked by an outdoor staircase.\nThe new building is much more expansive and open than the old ones. As one \"New York Times\" review described the building:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe museum needed to raise $760 million for the building and its endowment. In May 2011, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced it had entered into an agreement to occupy the Madison Avenue building for at least eight years starting in 2015, easing the Whitney's burden of having to finance two large museum spaces. The occupation of the old space was later postponed to 2016.\n2018\u20132019 protests.\nThe Board of Trustees has come under criticism since November 2018 by groups including Decolonize This Place, the Chinatown Art Brigade, and W.A.G.E., for vice chair Warren Kanders' ownership of the company Safariland, which manufactured tear gas used against the late-2018 migrant caravans; 120 scholars and critics published an open letter to the Whitney Museum asking for the removal of Kanders from the museum board; additional signatories after the letter's initial posting included almost 50 artists who have been selected for the 2019 Whitney Biennial. A series of nine weeks of protest by Decolonize This Place highlighted the use of Safariland weapons against protestors and others in Palestine and other places.\nOn July 17, 2019, calls for Kanders's resignation were renewed following Artforum's publication of an essay, \"The Tear Gas Biennial\", by Hannah Black, Ciar\u00e1n Finlayson, and Tobi Haslett. On July 19, four artists (Korakrit Arunanondchai, Meriem Bennani, Nicole Eisenman, and Nicholas Galanin) published a letter, also in Artforum, asking their work to be withdrawn from the exhibition. (The first artist to withdraw was Michael Rakowitz, who withdrew his work before the Biennial opened.) A day later, a second wave of artists (Eddie Arroyo, Christine Sun Kim, Agustina Woodgate, and Forensic Architecture) also withdrew.\nOn July 25, 2019, Warren B. Kanders announced his resignation from the Board of Trustees of the Whitney Museum. Kanders cited no wish to play a role in the museum's demise and urged fellow trustees to step up and assume leadership of the Whitney.\nCollection.\nThe museum displays paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, installation art, video, and photography.\nThe original 600 works in the permanent collection grew to about 1,300 with the opening of the second building in 1954. This number grew to around 2,000 following its move to the Breuer building on Madison Avenue in 1966. It began collecting photography in 1991. Today, spanning the late 19th century to the present, the collection contains more than 25,000 artworks by upwards of 3,500 artists. Artists represented include Josef Albers, Joe Andoe, Edmund Archer, Donald Baechler, Thomas Hart Benton, Lucile Blanch, Jonathan Borofsky, Louise Bourgeois, Frank Bowling, Sonia Gordon Brown, Charles Burchfield, Alexander Calder, Suzanne Caporael, Norman Carton, Carolina Caycedo, Ching Ho Cheng, Talia Chetrit, Ann Craven, Anna Craycroft, Dan Christensen, Greg Colson, Susan Crocker, Ronald Davis, Stuart Davis, Mira Dancy, Lindsey Decker, Martha Diamond, Richard Diebenkorn, Daniella Dooling, Arthur Dove, Loretta Dunkelman, William Eggleston, Helen Frankenthaler, Georgia O'Keeffe, Arshile Gorky, Keith Haring, Grace Hartigan, Marsden Hartley, Robert Henri, Carmen Herrera, Eva Hesse, Hans Hofmann, Edward Hopper, Richard Hunt, Jasper Johns, Corita Kent, Franz Kline, Terence Koh, Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Ronnie Landfield, Roy Lichtenstein, John Marin, Knox Martin, John McCracken, John McLaughlin, Robert Motherwell, Bruce Nauman, Louise Nevelson, Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland, Paul Pfeiffer, Jackson Pollock, Larry Poons, Maurice Prendergast, Kenneth Price, Robert Rauschenberg, Man Ray, Mark Rothko, Morgan Russell, Albert Pinkham Ryder, Cindy Sherman, John Sloan, Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, and hundreds of others.\nEvery two years, the museum hosts the Whitney Biennial, an international art show which displays many lesser-known artists new to the American art scene. It has displayed works by many notable artists, and has featured unconventional works, such as a 1976 exhibit of live body builders, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nIn addition to its traditional collection, the Whitney has a website, Artport, that features \"Net Art\" that changes regularly. The Whitney will not sell any work by a living artist because it could damage that artist's career, but it will trade a living artist's work for another piece by the same artist.\nLibrary.\nThe Frances Mulhall Achilles Library is a research library originally built on the collections of books and papers of founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, and the Whitney Museum's first director, Juliana Force. The library operates in the West Chelsea area of New York City. It contains Special Collections and the Whitney Museum Archives. The archives contain the Institutional Archives, Research Collections, and Manuscript Collections. The Special Collections consist of artists' books, portfolios, photographs, titles in the Whitney Fellows Artist and Writers Series (1982\u20132001), posters, and valuable ephemera that relate to the permanent collection. The Institutional Archives include exhibition records, photographs, curatorial research notes, artist's correspondence, audio and video recordings, and trustees' papers from 1912 to the present.\nHighlights:\nBooks and materials in the library can be accessed in the museum's database.\nIndependent Study Program.\nThe Whitney Independent Study Program (ISP) was founded in 1968 by Ron Clark. The Whitney ISP has helped start the careers of artists, critics, and curators including Jenny Holzer, Andrea Fraser, Julian Schnabel, Kathryn Bigelow, Roberta Smith, and F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres, as well as many other well-known cultural producers. The program includes both art history and studio programs. Each year, the ISP selects 14\u201316 students for the Studio Program (artists), 3\u20134 for the Curatorial Program (curators) and 6\u20137 for the Critical Studies Program (scholars and researchers). It is a nine-month program that includes both visiting and hired artists, art historians, and critics, and involves the reading of theory. Clark retired in 2023 and Gregg Bordowitz was selected as his replacement.\nIn October 2018, the ISP celebrated its 50th anniversary. The event took place over two days, from Friday, October 19, to Saturday, October 20, 2018, and featured a series of panels and talks focused on critical theory, contemporary art, and cultural critique. The first day began with the panel \"(Re)constructing Histories,\" featuring Nora Alter, Naomi Beckwith, Emily Jacir, Tom McDonough, and Sadia Shirazi, moderated by Kenneth White. This was followed by a talk by Hal Foster. After a midday break, the panel \"Institution and Its Discontents\" included presentations by Huey Copeland, Rosalyn Deutsche, Andrea Fraser, Hans Haacke, and Fred Wilson, moderated by Alex Alberro. Johanna Burton delivered a talk following the panel. The evening concluded with the panel \"Pedagogy and Critical Practice,\" which brought together Emily Apter, Gregg Bordowitz, Eva Diaz, Mary Kelly, and Devin Kenny, moderated by Trista Mallory.\nThe second day opened with the panel \"Media and Its Apparatuses,\" featuring Anthony Cokes, Jonathan Crary, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Laura Mulvey, and Ben Young, moderated by Soyoung Yoon. This was followed by a talk from Jennifer A. Gonzalez. After a short break, Sharon Hayes gave a talk, leading into the final panel, \"Activism and Critique,\" which featured David Harvey, Chantal Mouffe, Martha Rosler, and Gayatri Spivak, moderated by Cassandra Guan. A number of participants, marked with an asterisk in the original program, were regular seminar leaders and visiting faculty.\nNotable alumni.\n1960s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1970s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1980s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1990s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernance.\nFunding.\nAs of March 2011, the Whitney's endowment was $207 million; the museum expected to raise $625 million from its capital campaign by 2015. As of June 2016, the endowment had grown to $308 million.\nHistorically, the operating performance has been essentially breakeven. The museum restricts the use of its endowment fund for yearly operating expenses to 5% of the fund's value. The Whitney has historically depended on private collectors and donors for acquisitions of new art. In 2008, Leonard A. Lauder gave the museum $131 million, the biggest donation in the Whitney's history. Donations for new purchases dropped to $1.3 million in 2010 from $2.7 million in 2006.\nDirectors.\nThe museum's director is Scott Rothkopf (since 2023). Former directors include Adam D.

Ross (1991\u20131997), Thomas Armstrong III (1974\u20131990), and Juliana Force (1931\u20131948).\nBoard of trustees.\nFor years, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney supported the museum single-handedly, as did her daughter, Flora Whitney Miller, after her, and until 1961, its board was largely family-run. Flora Payne Whitney served as a museum trustee, then as vice president. From 1942 to 1974, she was the museum's president and chair, after which she served as honorary chair until her death in 1986. Her daughter Flora Miller Biddle served as president until 1995. Her book \"The Whitney Women and the Museum They Made\" was published in 1999.\nIn 1961, the need for outside support finally forced the board to add outside trustees, including bankers Roy Neuberger and Arthur Altschul. David Solinger became the Whitney's first outside president in 1966.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

MoMA's collection spans the late 19th century to the present, and includes over 200,000 works of architecture and design, drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, prints, illustrated and artist's books, film, as well as electronic media.\nThe institution was conceived in 1929 by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Lillie P. Bliss, and Mary Quinn Sullivan. Initially located in the Heckscher Building on Fifth Avenue, it opened just days after the Wall Street Crash. The museum was led by A. Conger Goodyear as president and Abby Rockefeller as treasurer, with Alfred H. Barr Jr. as its first director. Under Barr's leadership, the museum's collection rapidly expanded, beginning with an inaugural exhibition of works by European modernists. Despite financial challenges, including opposition from John D. Rockefeller Jr., the museum moved to several temporary locations in its early years, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. eventually donated the land for its permanent site. In 1939, the museum moved to its current location on West 53rd Street designed by architects Philip L. Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone. A new sculpture garden, designed by Barr and curator John McAndrew, also opened that year.\nFrom the 1930s through the 1950s, MoMA became a host to several landmark exhibitions, including Barr's influential \"Cubism and Abstract Art\" in 1936. Nelson Rockefeller became the museum's president in 1939, playing a key role in its expansion and publicity. David Rockefeller joined the board in 1948 and continued the family's close association with the museum until his death in 2017. In 1953, Philip Johnson redesigned the garden, which subsequently became the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. In 1958, a fire at MoMA destroyed a painting by Claude Monet and led to the evacuation of other artworks. In later decades, the museum was among several institutions to aid the CIA in its efforts to engage in cultural propaganda during the Cold War. Major expansions in the 1980s and the early 21st century, including the selection of Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi for a significant renovation, nearly doubled MoMA's space for exhibitions and programs. The 2000s saw the formal merger with the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, and in 2019, another major renovation added significant gallery space.\nThe museum has been instrumental in shaping the history of modern art, particularly modern art from Europe. In recent decades, MoMA has expanded its collection and programming to include works by traditionally underrepresented groups. The museum has been involved in controversies regarding its labor practices, and the institution's labor union, founded in 1971, has been described as the first of its kind in the U.S. The MoMA Library includes about 300,000 books and exhibition catalogs, more than 1,000 periodical titles and more than 40,000 files of ephemera about individual artists and groups. The archives hold primary source material related to the history of modern and contemporary art. In 2023, MoMA was visited by over 2.8 million people, making it the 15th most-visited art museum in the world and the 6th most-visited museum in the United States.\nAttendance.\nThe museum attracted 2,190,440 visitors in 2022, making it the 4th most-visited museum in the United States, and the third most-visited U.S. art museum. This attendance was 89 percent higher than in 2021, but still well below the pre-COVID attendance in 2019.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1929\u20131939).\nThe idea for the Museum of Modern Art was developed in 1929 primarily by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr., and two of her friends, Lillie P. Bliss and Mary Quinn Sullivan. They became known variously as \"the Ladies\" or \"the adamantine ladies\". They rented modest quarters for the new museum in the Heckscher Building at 730 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and it opened to the public on November 7, 1929, nine days after the Wall Street Crash.\nAbby Rockefeller had invited A. Conger Goodyear, the former president of the board of trustees of the Albright Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, to become president of the new museum. Abby became treasurer. At the time, it was America's premier museum devoted exclusively to modern art, and the first of its kind in Manhattan to exhibit European modernism. One of Rockefeller's early recruits for the museum staff was the noted Japanese-American photographer Soichi Sunami (at that time best known for his portraits of modern dance pioneer Martha Graham), who served the museum as its official documentary photographer from 1930 until 1968.\nGoodyear enlisted Paul J. Sachs and Frank Crowninshield to join him as founding trustees. Sachs, the associate director and curator of prints and drawings at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University, was referred to in those days as a \"collector of curators\". Goodyear asked him to recommend a director, and Sachs suggested Alfred H. Barr Jr., a promising young prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Under Barr's guidance, the museum's holdings quickly expanded from an initial gift of eight prints and one drawing. Its first successful loan exhibition was in November 1929, displaying paintings by Van Gogh, Gauguin, C\u00e9zanne, and Seurat.\nFirst housed in six rooms of galleries and offices on the 12th floor of Manhattan's Heckscher Building, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, the museum moved into three more temporary locations within the next 10 years. Abby Rockefeller's husband, John D. Rockefeller Jr., was adamantly opposed to the museum (as well as to modern art itself) and refused to release funds for the venture, which had to be obtained from other sources and resulted in the frequent shifts of location. Nevertheless, he eventually donated the land for the current site of the museum, plus other gifts over time, and thus became in effect one of its greatest benefactors. Under Alfred H. Barr Jr.'s direction, MoMA embraced a multidisciplinary approach to modern art by being the first museum to establish departments dedicated to photography and film.\nDuring that time, the museum initiated many more exhibitions of noted artists, such as the lone Vincent van Gogh exhibition on November 4, 1935. Containing an unprecedented 66 oils and 50 drawings from the Netherlands, as well as poignant excerpts from the artist's letters, it was a major public success due to Barr's arrangement of the exhibit, and became \"a precursor to the hold van Gogh has to this day on the contemporary imagination\".\n1930s to 1950s.\nThe museum also gained international prominence with the hugely successful and now famous Picasso retrospective of 1939\u201340, held in conjunction with the Art Institute of Chicago. In its range of presented works, it represented a significant reinterpretation of Picasso for future art scholars and historians. This was wholly masterminded by Barr, a Picasso enthusiast, and the exhibition lionized Picasso as the greatest artist of the time, setting the model for all the museum's retrospectives that were to follow. \"Boy Leading a Horse\" was briefly contested over ownership by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In 1941, MoMA hosted the ground-breaking exhibition, \"Indian Art of the United States\", curated by Frederic Huntington Douglas and Rene d'Harnoncourt, that changed the way Native American arts were viewed by the public and exhibited in art museums.\nAbby Rockefeller's son Nelson was selected by the board of trustees to become its president, in 1939, at the age of 30; he was a flamboyant leader and became the prime instigator and funding source of MoMA's publicity, acquisitions, and subsequent expansion into new headquarters on 53rd Street. His brother, David Rockefeller, joined the museum's board of trustees in 1948, and took over the presidency when Nelson was elected governor of New York in 1958.\nDavid Rockefeller subsequently employed noted architect Philip Johnson to redesign the museum garden, and named it in honor of his mother, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. The Rockefeller family and he have retained a close association with the museum throughout its history, with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund funding the institution since 1947. Both David Rockefeller Jr. and Sharon Percy Rockefeller (wife of former senator Jay Rockefeller) sit on the board of trustees. After the Rockefeller Guest House at 242 East 52nd Street was completed in 1950, some MoMA functions were held in the house until 1964.\nIn 1937, MoMA had shifted to offices and basement galleries in the Time-Life Building in Rockefeller Center. Its permanent and current home, now renovated, designed in the International Style by the modernist architects Philip L. Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone, opened to the public on May 10, 1939, attended by an illustrious company of 6,000 people, and with an opening address via radio from the White House by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nIn 1958, workers re-clad the MoMA building's second floor with a glass facade overlooking the sculpture garden.\n1958 fire.\nOn April 15, 1958, a fire on the second floor destroyed an Monet \"Water Lilies\" painting (the current Monet \"Water Lilies\" was acquired shortly after the fire as a replacement). The fire was started by workmen installing air conditioning, who were smoking near paint cans, sawdust, and a canvas drop cloth. One worker was killed by the fire, and several firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation.\nMost of the paintings on the floor had previously been removed from the work area, although large paintings including the Monet had remained in place. Art works on the third and fourth floors were evacuated to the Whitney Museum of American Art, which abutted on the 54th Street side. Among the paintings that were rescued was \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\", which had been on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago. Visitors and employees trapped above the fire were evacuated to the roof, and then jumped to the roof of an adjoining townhouse.\n1960s to 1980s.\nIn 1969, the MoMA was at the center of a controversy over its decision to withdraw funding from the iconic antiwar poster \"And Babies\". In 1969, the Art Workers Coalition, a group of New York City artists who opposed the Vietnam War, in collaboration with Museum of Modern Art members Arthur Drexler and Elizabeth Shaw, created an iconic protest poster called \"And babies\". The poster uses an image by photojournalist Ronald L. Haeberle and references the My Lai Massacre. The MoMA had promised to fund and circulate the poster, but after seeing the poster, MoMA pulled financing for the project at the last minute. MoMA's board of trustees included Nelson Rockefeller and William S. Paley (head of CBS), who reportedly \"hit the ceiling\" on seeing the proofs of the poster. The poster was included shortly thereafter in MoMA's \"Information\" exhibition of July 2 to September 20, 1970, curated by Kynaston McShine.\nIn 1971, after protests outside the museum meant to spur inclusion of African Americans Richard Hunt was the first African American sculptor to have a major solo retrospective at the museum.\nIn 1983, the museum more than doubled its gallery space, increased the curatorial department by 30%, and added an auditorium, two restaurants, and a bookstore in conjunction with the construction of the 56-story Museum Tower adjoining the museum. Architect C\u00e9sar Pelli led the design project for the expansion. Despite these expansion projects, MoMA's physical space had never been able to accommodate its growing collection.205\nOn June 14, 1984, the Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.), a demonstration of 400 women artists, was held in front of the newly renovated Museum of Modern Art to protest the lack of female representation in its opening exhibition, \"An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture\". The exhibition featured 165 artists. Only 14 of those were women.\n1990s and 2000s renovation.\nBy the end of the 20th century, MoMA had 100,000 objects in its collection, an increase from the 40,000 items it had in 1970. After the Dorset Hotel adjacent to the museum was placed for sale in 1996, MoMA quickly purchased it. The next year, the museum began planning a major renovation and expansion,205 selecting Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi in December 1997. The project nearly doubled the space for MoMA's exhibitions and programs, and features of space.205 Taniguchi's initial plan called for two structures, one each to the west and east of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, which was to be enlarged from its original configuration. The Peggy and David Rockefeller Building on the western portion of the site houses the main exhibition gallerie, while the Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Education and Research Building provides space for classrooms, auditoriums, teacher-training workshops, and the museum's expanded library and archives.207\nMoMA began the year 2000 with the activation of a 1999 agreement formalizing its affiliation with the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, an independent contemporary art organization which had been founded in nearby Long Island City, Queens, New York in 1971. An agreement provided for a 10-year merger process, allowing gradual coordination and consolidation of programming and staff. The location in Queens, a re-purposed former public school, would remain open to the public indefinitely, as an experimental exhibition and performance space. In addition, the PS1 space would be available while the 53rd Street complex was closed for major renovations.\nMoMA broke ground on the 53rd Street project in May 2001. Over the next year, the museum gradually closed two-thirds of its galleries and moved some of its exhibits online. The Midtown building closed completely in May 2002; the next month, MoMA relocated its public-facing operations to a temporary facility called MoMA QNS in Long Island City, Queens.\nThe overall project, including an increase in MoMA's endowment to cover operating expenses, cost $858 million in total; the renovation of the Midtown Manhattan building alone cost $425 million. During the project, new gallery space was added on the first floor of the adjacent Museum Tower, and mechanical spaces and equipment within the tower were added or relocated. MoMA reopened on November 20, 2004.\nThe renovation received mixed reception. John Updike wrote in \"The New Yorker\" that the new structure \"has the enchantment of a bank after hours, of a honeycomb emptied of honey and flooded with a soft glow\", while Roberta Smith of \"The New York Times\" said MoMA had an \"overly refined building, whose poor layout shortchanges the world's greatest collection of Modern art\". Witold Rybczynski of \"Slate\" wrote: \"Most of what has been written about the new MoMA has lauded its minimalist interiors, which, even if they don't exactly disappear, have an opulently ethereal quality. [...] Yet this urban building is not experienced only from inside\u2014and, seen from the sidewalk, Taniguchi's architecture does anything but fade away.\"\nMoMA, which owned a lot at 53 West 53rd Street west of its existing building, sold it to developer Gerald D. Hines for $125 million in January 2007. Hines planned to build a skyscraper called Tower Verre on the site. Work on the tower was delayed because of a lack of funding following the Great Recession.\n2010s to present.\nIn 2010, MoMA completed its merger with the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, New York, formally renaming it as MoMA PS1.\nIn 2011, MoMA acquired an adjacent building that housed the American Folk Art Museum on West 53rd Street. The building had been completed in 2001 to designs by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects and was sold in connection with a financial restructuring of the Folk Art Museum. In January 2014, MoMA decided to raze the American Folk Art Museum, which was between MoMA's existing structure and the proposed tower at 53 West 53rd Street. The architectural community protested the planned demolition in part because that building was relatively new, having been completed in 2001. MoMA decided to proceed with the demolition because the American Folk Art Museum was in the way of MoMA's planned expansion, which included exhibition space within 53 West 53rd Street. The tower, designed by Jean Nouvel and called 53W53, received construction approval in 2014.\nAround the same time as 53W53 was approved, MoMA unveiled its expansion plans, which encompass space in 53W53, as well as an annex on the former site of the American Folk Art Museum. The expansion plan was developed by the architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Gensler. Following a controversy over the plans, MoMA split the plan into three phases in January 2016. The plan added of gallery space to 53W53, in a new annex designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and in the existing building, as well as expanded lobbies. In June 2017, the first phase of the $450 million expansion was completed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe museum expansion project increased the publicly accessible space by 25% compared to when the Tanaguchi building was completed in 2004. The expansion allowed for even more of the museum's collection of nearly 200,000 works to be displayed. The new spaces also allow visitors to enjoy a relaxing sit-down in one of the two new lounges, or even have a fully catered meal. The two new lounges include \"The Marlene Hess and James D. Zirin Lounge\" and \"The Daniel and Jane Och Lounge\". The goal of this renovation is to help expand the collection and display of work by women, Latinos, Blacks, Asians, and other marginalized communities. In connection with the renovation, MoMA shifted its approach to presenting its holdings, moving away from separating the collection by disciplines such as painting, design, and works on paper toward an integrated chronological presentation that encompasses all areas of the collection.\nThe Museum of Modern Art closed for another round of major renovations from June to October 2019. Upon reopening on October 21, 2019, MoMA added of gallery space, bringing its total floor area to .\nExhibition houses.\nThe MoMA occasionally has sponsored and hosted temporary exhibition houses, which have reflected seminal ideas in architectural history.\nCollections.\nThe MoMA is organized around six curatorial departments: Architecture and Design, Drawings and Prints, Film, Media and Performance, Painting and Sculpture, and Photography.\nThe MoMA's holdings include more than 150,000 individual pieces in addition to roughly 22,000 films and 4 million film stills. (Access to the collection of film stills ended in 2002, and the collection is stored in a vault in Hamlin, Pennsylvania.). The collection houses such important and familiar works as the following:\nSelected collection highlights.\nIt also holds works by a wide range of influential European and American artists including Auguste Rodin, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Joan Mir\u00f3, Aristide Maillol, Piet Mondrian, Marcel Duchamp, Paul Klee, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Seraphine Louis, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, Georgia O'Keeffe, Morris Hirshfield, Edward Hopper, Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Arshile Gorky, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, Bill Traylor, Roy Lichtenstein, Jean-Michel Basquiat and hundreds of others.\nPhotography.\nThe MoMA photography collection consists of over 25,000 works by photographers, journalists, scientists, entrepreneurs, and amateurs, and is regarded as one of the most important in the world.\nThe Department of Photography was founded by Beaumont Newhall in 1940 and developed a world-renowned art photography collection under Edward Steichen (curator 1947\u20131961). Steichen's most notable and lasting exhibit, named \"The Family of Man\", was seen by 9 million people. In 2003, the \"Family of Man\" photographic collection was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in recognition of its historical value.\nSteichen's hand-picked successor, John Szarkowski (curator 1962\u20131991), guided the department with several notable exhibitions, including 1967s New Documents that presented photographs by Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, and Garry Winogrand and is said to have \"represented a shift in emphasis\" and \"identified a new direction in photography: pictures that seemed to have a casual, snapshot-like look and subject matter so apparently ordinary that it was hard to categorize\". Under Szarkowski, it focused on a more traditionally modernist approach to the medium, one that emphasized documentary images and orthodox darkroom techniques.\nPeter Galassi (curator 1991\u20132011) worked under his predecessor, whereas Quentin Bajac (curator 2013\u20132018) was hired from the outside. The current \"David Dechman Senior Curator of Photography\" is Roxana Marcoci, PhD.\nFilm.\nIn 1932, museum founding director Alfred Barr stressed the importance of introducing \"the only great art form peculiar to the 20th century\" to \"the American public which should appreciate good films and support them\". Museum Trustee and film producer John Hay Whitney became the first chairman of the museum's Film Library from 1935 to 1951. The collection Whitney assembled with the help of film curator Iris Barry was so successful that in 1937 the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences commended the museum with an award \"for its significant work in collecting films ... and for the first time making available to the public the means of studying the historical and aesthetic development of the motion picture as one of the major arts\".\nThe first curator and founder of the film library was Iris Barry, a British film critic and author whose three decades of work in collecting films and presenting them in artistic and historical contexts gained recognition for the cinema. Barry and her successors, including Margareta Akermark, built a collection comprising some 8000 titles.\nExiled film scholar Siegfried Kracauer worked at the MoMA film archive on a psychological history of German film between 1941 and 1943. The result of his study, \"\" (1947), traces the birth of Nazism from the cinema of the Weimar Republic and helped lay the foundation of modern film criticism.\nUnder the Museum of Modern Art Department of Film, the film collection includes more than 25,000 titles and ranks as one of the world's finest museum archives of international film art. The department owns prints of many familiar feature-length movies, including \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Vertigo\", but its holdings also contains many less-traditional pieces, including Andy Warhol's eight-hour \"Empire\", Fred Halsted's gay pornographic \"L.A. Plays Itself\" (screened before a capacity audience on April 23, 1974), various TV commercials, and Chris Cunningham's music video for Bj\u00f6rk's \"All Is Full of Love\".\nLibrary.\nThe MoMA library is located in Midtown Manhattan, with offsite storage in Long Island City, Queens. The noncirculating collection documents modern and contemporary art, including painting, sculpture, prints, photography, film, performance, and architecture from 1880\u2013present. The collection includes 300,000 books, 1,000 periodicals, and 40,000 files about artists and artistic groups. Over 11,000 artist books are in the collection. The libraries are open by appointment to all researchers. The library's catalog is called \"Dadabase\". Dadabase includes records for all of the material in the library, including books, artist books, exhibition catalogs, special collections materials, and electronic resources. The MoMA's collection of artist books includes works by Ed Ruscha, Marcel Broodthaers, Susan Bee, Carl Andre, and David Horvitz.\nAdditionally, the library has subscription electronic resources along with Dadabase. These include journal databases (such as JSTOR and Art Full Text), auction results indexes (ArtFact and Artnet), the ARTstor image database, and WorldCat union catalog.\nArchitecture and design.\nMoMA's Department of Architecture and Design was founded in 1932 as the first museum department in the world dedicated to the intersection of architecture and design. The department's first director was Philip Johnson who served as curator between 1932 and 1934 and between 1946 and 1954. The next departmental head was Arthur Drexler, who was curator from 1951 to 1956 and then served as head until 1986.\nThe collection consists of 28,000 works including architectural models, drawings, and photographs. One of the highlights of the collection is the Mies van der Rohe Archive. It also includes works from such legendary architects and designers as Frank Lloyd Wright, Paul L\u00e1szl\u00f3, the Eameses, Betty Cooke, Isamu Noguchi, and George Nelson. The design collection contains many industrial and manufactured pieces, ranging from a self-aligning ball bearing to an entire Bell 47D1 helicopter. In 2012, the department acquired a selection of 14 video games, the basis of an intended collection of 40 that is to range from \"Pac-Man\" (1980) to \"Minecraft\" (2011).\nManagement.\nAttendance.\nMoMA attracted 706,060 visitors in 2020, a drop of sixty-five percent from 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It ranked twenty-fifth on the List of most visited art museums in the world in 2020.\nMoMA has seen its average number of visitors rise from about 1.5-million a year to 2.5-million after its new granite and glass renovation. In 2009, the museum reported 119,000 members and 2.8-million visitors over the previous fiscal year. MoMA attracted its then highest-ever number of visitors, 3.09 million, during its 2010 fiscal year; however, attendance dropped 11 percent to 2.8 million in 2011. Attendance in 2016 was 2.8 million, down from 3.1 million in 2015.\nThe museum was open every day since its founding in 1929, until 1975, when it closed one day a week (originally Wednesdays) to reduce operating expenses. In 2012, it again opened every day, including Tuesday, the one day it has traditionally been closed.\nAdmission.\nThe Museum of Modern Art charges an admission fee of $30 per adult. Upon MoMA's reopening in 2004, its admission cost increased from $12 to $20, making it one of the most expensive museums in the city. However, it has free entry for New York State residents every Friday from 5:30pm to 8:30pm, as part of the Uniqlo Friday Nights program. Many New York area college students also receive free admission to the museum.\nFinances.\nA private non-profit organization, MoMA is the seventh-largest U.S. museum by budget; its annual revenue is about $145 million. In 2011, the museum reported net assets (which does not include the value of the art) of just over $1 billion.\nUnlike most museums, the museum eschews government funding, instead subsisting on a fragmented budget with a half-dozen different sources of income, none larger than a fifth. Before the 2008 financial crisis, the MoMA's board of trustees sold its equities and had an all-cash position. An $858 million capital campaign funded the 2002\u201304 expansion, with David Rockefeller donating $77 million in cash. In 2005, Rockefeller pledged an additional $100 million toward the museum's endowment. In 2012, Standard &amp; Poor's, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, raised its long-term rating for the museum as it benefited from the fundraising of its trustees. After construction expenses for the new galleries are covered, the Modern estimates that some $65 million will go to its $650 million endowment.\nMoMA spent $32 million to acquire art for the fiscal year ending in June 2012.\nMoMA employed about 815 people in 2007. The museum's tax filings from the past few years suggest a shift among the highest paid employees from curatorial staff to management. The museum's director Glenn D. Lowry earned $1.6 million in 2009 and lives in a rent-free $6 million apartment above the museum.\nMoMA was forced to close in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Citing the coronavirus shutdown, MoMA fired its art educators in April 2020. In May 2020, it was reported that MoMA would reduce its annual budget from $180 to $135 million starting July 1. Exhibition and publication funding was cut by half, and staff reduced from around 960 to 800.\nStrike MoMA is a 2021 movement to strike the museum targeting what its supporters have called the \"toxic philanthropy\" of the museum's leadership.\nArt repatriation.\nThe MoMA has been involved in several claims initiated by families for artworks lost in the Holocaust which ended up in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.\nIn 2009, the heirs of German artist George Grosz filed a lawsuit seeking restitution of three works by Grosz, and the heirs of filed a lawsuit demanding the return of the painting by Pablo Picasso, entitled \"Boy Leading a Horse\" (1905\u20131906).\nAnother controversy involved Pablo Picasso's painting \"Boy Leading a Horse\" (1905\u201306), donated to MoMA by William S. Paley in 1964. The status of the work as being sold under duress by its German Jewish owners in the 1930s was in dispute. The descendants of the original owners sued MoMA and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which has another Picasso painting, \"Le Moulin de la Galette\" (1900), once owned by the same family, for return of the works. In 2009, both museums reached a confidential settlement with the descendants before the case went to trial and retained their respective paintings. Both museums had claimed from the outset to be the proper owners of these paintings, and that the claims were illegitimate. In a joint statement, the two museums wrote: \"we settled simply to avoid the costs of prolonged litigation, and to ensure the public continues to have access to these important paintings.\"\nIn another case, after a decade-long court fight, in 2015 the MoMA returned a painting entitled \"Sand Hills\" by German artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner to the Fischer family which had been left behind by Max Fischer when he fled Germany for the US in 1935.\nIn February 2024 the \"New York Times\" reported that MoMa had secretly restituted Marc Chagall's \"Over Vitebsk\" to the heirs of Franz Matthiesen in 2021 and that the restitution involved a $4 million payment to the museum. The painting had passed through the Nazi dealer Kurt Feldhausser and the Wehye Gallery and its provenance was disputed. The museum initially stated that the acquisition was not problematic, because its provenance researcher believed that the Matthiesen transfer was a repayment for debt, and not related to Nazi persecution of the Jews. However the museum later reversed its position.\nKey people.\nOfficers and the board of trustees.\nCurrently, the board of trustees includes 46 trustees and 15 life trustees. Even including the board's 14 \"honorary\" trustees, who do not have voting rights and do not play as direct a role in the museum, this amounts to an average individual contribution of more than $7 million. The Founders Wall was created in 2004, when MoMA's expansion was completed, and features the names of the actual founders in addition to those who gave significant gifts; about a half-dozen names have been added since 2004. For example, Ileana Sonnabend's name was added in 2012, even though she was only 15 when the museum was established in 1929.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBoard of trustees.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLife trustees:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHonorary trustees:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66109", "revid": "50751168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66109", "title": "Eclipse cycle", "text": "Calculation and prediction of eclipses\nEclipses may occur repeatedly, separated by certain intervals of time: these intervals are called eclipse cycles. The series of eclipses separated by a repeat of one of these intervals is called an eclipse series.\nEclipse conditions.\nEclipses may occur when Earth and the Moon are aligned with the Sun, and the shadow of one body projected by the Sun falls on the other. So at new moon, when the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun, the Moon may pass in front of the Sun as viewed from a narrow region on the surface of Earth and cause a solar eclipse. At full moon, when the Moon is in opposition to the Sun, the Moon may pass through the shadow of Earth, and a lunar eclipse is visible from the night half of Earth. The conjunction and opposition of the Moon together have a special name: syzygy (Greek for \"junction\"), because of the importance of these lunar phases.\nAn eclipse does not occur at every new or full moon, because the plane of the Moon's orbit around Earth is tilted with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic): so as viewed from Earth, when the Moon appears nearest the Sun (at new moon) or furthest from it (at full moon), the three bodies are usually not exactly on the same line.\nThis inclination is on average about 5\u00b0\u20099\u2032, much larger than the apparent \"mean\" diameter of the Sun (32\u2032\u20092\u2033), the Moon as viewed from Earth's surface directly below the Moon (31\u2032\u200937\u2033), and Earth's shadow at the mean lunar distance (1\u00b0\u200923\u2032).\nTherefore, at most new moons, Earth passes too far north or south of the lunar shadow, and at most full moons, the Moon misses Earth's shadow. Also, at most solar eclipses, the apparent angular diameter of the Moon is insufficient to fully occlude the solar disc, unless the Moon is around its perigee, i.e. nearer Earth and apparently larger than average. In any case, the alignment must be almost perfect to cause an eclipse.\nAn eclipse can occur only when the Moon is on or near the plane of Earth's orbit, i.e. when its ecliptic latitude is low. This happens when the Moon is around either of the two orbital nodes on the ecliptic at the time of the syzygy. Of course, to produce an eclipse, the Sun must also be around a node at that time \u2013 the same node for a solar eclipse or the opposite node for a lunar eclipse.\nRecurrences.\nUp to three eclipses may occur during an eclipse season, a one- or two-month period that happens twice a year, around the time when the Sun is near the nodes of the Moon's orbit.\nAn eclipse does not occur every month, because one month after an eclipse the relative geometry of the Sun, Moon, and Earth has changed.\nAs seen from the Earth, the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node, the draconic month, is less than the time it takes for the Moon to return to the same ecliptic longitude as the Sun: the synodic month. The main reason is that during the time that the Moon has completed an orbit around the Earth, the Earth (and Moon) have completed about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204413 of their orbit around the Sun: the Moon has to make up for this in order to come again into conjunction or opposition with the Sun. Secondly, the orbital nodes of the Moon precess westward in ecliptic longitude, completing a full circle in about 18.60 years, so a draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month. In all, the difference in period between synodic and draconic month is nearly &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20443 days. Likewise, as seen from the Earth, the Sun passes both nodes as it moves along its ecliptic path. The period for the Sun to return to a node is called the eclipse or draconic year: about 346.6201 days, which is about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204420 year shorter than a sidereal year because of the precession of the nodes.\nIf a solar eclipse occurs at one new moon, which must be close to a node, then at the next full moon the Moon is already more than a day past its opposite node, and may or may not miss the Earth's shadow. By the next new moon it is even further ahead of the node, so it is less likely that there will be a solar eclipse somewhere on Earth. By the next month, there will certainly be no event.\nHowever, about 5 or 6 lunations later the new moon will fall close to the opposite node. In that time (half an eclipse year) the Sun will have moved to the opposite node too, so the circumstances will again be suitable for one or more eclipses.\nPeriodicity.\nThe periodicity of solar eclipses is the interval between any two solar eclipses in succession, which will be either 1, 5, or 6 synodic months. It is calculated that the Earth will experience a total number of 11,898 solar eclipses between 2000 BCE and 3000 CE. A particular solar eclipse will be repeated approximately after every 18 years 11 days and 8 hours (6,585.32 days) of period, but not in the same geographical region.\nA particular geographical region will experience a particular solar eclipse in every 54 years 34 days period. Total solar eclipses are rare events, although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average.\nRepetition of solar eclipses.\nFor two solar eclipses to be almost identical, the geometric alignment of the Earth, Moon and Sun, as well as some parameters of the lunar orbit should be the same. The following parameters and criteria must be repeated for the repetition of a solar eclipse:\nThese conditions are related to the three periods of the Moon's orbital motion, viz. the synodic month, anomalistic month and draconic month, and to the anomalistic year. In other words, a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the Moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical. The Moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. This happens after the period called the saros. Gamma (how far the Moon is north or south of the ecliptic during an eclipse) changes monotonically throughout any single saros series. The change in gamma is larger when Earth is near its aphelion (June to July) than when it is near perihelion (December to January). When the Earth is near its average distance (March to April or September to October), the change in gamma is average.\nRepetition of lunar eclipses.\nFor the repetition of a lunar eclipse, the geometric alignment of the Moon, Earth and Sun, as well as some parameters of the lunar orbit should be repeated. The following parameters and criteria must be repeated for the repetition of a lunar eclipse:\nThese conditions are related with the three periods of the Moon's orbital motion, viz. the synodic month, anomalistic month and draconic month. In other words, a particular eclipse will be repeated only if the Moon will complete roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical to that eclipse. The Moon will be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. Gamma changes monotonically throughout any single Saros series. The change in gamma is larger when Earth is near its aphelion (June to July) than when it is near perihelion (December to January). When the Earth is near its average distance (March to April or September to October), the change in gamma is average.\nEffect of Eccentricity.\nAnother thing to consider is that the motion of the Moon is not a perfect circle. Its orbit is distinctly elliptic, so the lunar distance from Earth varies throughout the lunar cycle. This varying distance changes the apparent diameter of the Moon, and therefore influences the chances, duration, and type (partial, annular, total, mixed) of an eclipse. This orbital period is called the anomalistic month, and together with the synodic month causes the so-called \"full moon cycle\" of about 14 lunations in the timings and appearances of full (and new) Moons. The Moon moves faster when it is closer to the Earth (near perigee) and slower when it is near apogee (furthest distance), thus periodically changing the timing of syzygies by up to 14 hours either side (relative to their mean timing), and causing the apparent lunar angular diameter to increase or decrease by about 6%. An eclipse cycle must comprise close to an integer number of anomalistic months in order to perform well in predicting eclipses.\nIf the Earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the Earth, and both orbits were coplanar (on the same plane) with each other, then two eclipses would happen every lunar month (29.53 days). A lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon, a solar eclipse every new moon, and all solar eclipses would be the same type. In fact the distances between the Earth and Moon and that of the Earth and the Sun vary because both the Earth and the Moon have elliptic orbits. Also, both the orbits are not on the same plane. The Moon's orbit is inclined about 5.14\u00b0 to Earth's orbit around the Sun. So the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes. If a New Moon takes place within about 17\u00b0 of a node, then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on Earth.\nAt an average angular velocity of 0.99\u00b0 per day, the Sun takes 34.5 days to cross the 34\u00b0 wide eclipse zone centered on each node. Because the Moon's orbit with respect to the Sun has a mean duration of 29.53 days, there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each 34.5-day interval when the Sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones. These time periods are called eclipse seasons. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon's orbit is low, hence the Sun, Moon, and Earth become aligned straight enough (in syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.\nNumerical values.\nThese are the lengths of the various types of months as discussed above (according to the lunar ephemeris ELP2000-85, valid for the epoch J2000.0; taken from (\"e.g.\") Meeus (1991) ):\n SM = 29.530588853 days (Synodic month)\n DM = 27.212220817 days (Draconic month)\n AM = 27.55454988 days (Anomalistic month)\n EY = 346.620076 days (Eclipse year)\nNote that there are three main moving points: the Sun, the Moon, and the (ascending) node; and that there are three main periods, when each of the three possible pairs of moving points meet one another: the synodic month when the Moon returns to the Sun, the draconic month when the Moon returns to the node, and the eclipse year when the Sun returns to the node. These three 2-way relations are not independent (i.e. both the synodic month and eclipse year are dependent on the apparent motion of the Sun, both the draconic month and eclipse year are dependent on the motion of the nodes), and indeed the eclipse year can be described as the beat period of the synodic and draconic months (i.e. the period of the difference between the synodic and draconic months); in formula:\nformula_1\nas can be checked by filling in the numerical values listed above.\nEclipse cycles have a period in which a certain number of synodic months closely equals an integer or half-integer number of draconic months: one such period after an eclipse, a syzygy (new moon or full moon) takes place again near a node of the Moon's orbit on the ecliptic, and an eclipse can occur again. However, the synodic and draconic months are incommensurate: their ratio is not an integer number. We need to approximate this ratio by common fractions: the numerators and denominators then give the multiples of the two periods\u00a0\u2013 draconic and synodic months\u00a0\u2013 that (approximately) span the same amount of time, representing an eclipse cycle.\nThese fractions can be found by the method of continued fractions: this arithmetical technique provides a series of progressively better approximations of any real numeric value by proper fractions.\nSince there may be an eclipse every half draconic month, we need to find approximations for the number of half draconic months per synodic month: so the target ratio to approximate is: SM / (DM/2) = 29.530588853 / (27.212220817/2) = 2.170391682\nThe continued fractions expansion for this ratio is:\n 2.170391682 = [2;5,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,11,1...]:\n Quotients Convergents\n half DM/SM decimal named cycle (if any)\n 2; 2/1 = 2 synodic month\n 5 11/5 = 2.2 pentalunex\n 1 13/6 = 2.166666667 semester\n 6 89/41 = 2.170731707 hepton\n 1 102/47 = 2.170212766 octon\n 1 191/88 = 2.170454545 tzolkinex\n 1 293/135 = 2.170370370 tritos\n 1 484/223 = 2.170403587 saros\n 1 777/358 = 2.170391061 inex\n 11 9031/4161 = 2.170391732 selebit\n 1 9808/4519 = 2.170391679 square year\nThe ratio of synodic months per half eclipse year yields the same series:\n 5.868831091 = [5;1,6,1,1,1,1,1,11,1...]\n Quotients Convergents\n SM/half EY decimal SM/full EY named cycle\n 5; 5/1 = 5 pentalunex\n 1 6/1 = 6 12/1 semester\n 6 41/7 = 5.857142857 hepton\n 1 47/8 = 5.875 47/4 octon\n 1 88/15 = 5.866666667 tzolkinex\n 1 135/23 = 5.869565217 tritos\n 1 223/38 = 5.868421053 223/19 saros\n 1 358/61 = 5.868852459 716/61 inex\n 11 4161/709 = 5.868829337 selebit\n 1 4519/770 = 5.868831169 4519/385 square year\nEach of these is an eclipse cycle. Less accurate cycles may be constructed by combinations of these.\nEclipse cycles.\nThis table summarizes the characteristics of various eclipse cycles, and can be computed from the numerical results of the preceding paragraphs; \"cf.\" Meeus (1997) Ch.9. More details are given in the comments below, and several notable cycles have their own pages. Many other cycles have been noted, some of which have been named.\nThe numbers in the table are the average values. The actual length of time between two eclipses in an eclipse cycle varies because of the variation in the speed of the Moon and of the Sun in the sky. The variation is less if the number of anomalistic months is near a whole number, and if the number of anomalistic years is near a whole number. (See graphs lower down of semester and Hipparchic cycle.)\nAny eclipse cycle, and indeed the interval between any two eclipses, can be expressed as a combination of saros (\"s\") and inex (\"i\") intervals. These are listed in the column \"formula\".\nFor more information see eclipse season.\nNotes.\nThe next nine cycles, Cartouche through Accuratissima, are all similar, being equal to 52 inex periods plus up to two triads and various numbers of saros periods. This means they all have a near-whole number of anomalistic months. They range from 1505 to 1841 years, and each series lasts for many thousands of years.\nSaros series and inex series.\nAny eclipse can be assigned to a given saros series and inex series. The year of a solar eclipse (in the Gregorian calendar) is then given approximately by:\nyear = 28.945 \u00d7 number of the saros series + 18.030 \u00d7 number of the inex series \u2212 2882.55\nWhen this is greater than 1, the integer part gives the year AD, but when it is negative the year BC is obtained by taking the integer part and adding 2. For instance, the eclipse in saros series 0 and inex series 0 was in the middle of 2884 BC.\nA \"panorama\" of solar eclipses arranged by saros and inex has been produced by Luca Quaglia and John Tilley showing 61775 solar eclipses from 11001 BC to AD 15000 (see below).\nEach column of the graph is a complete Saros series which progresses smoothly from partial eclipses into total or annular eclipses and back into partials. Each graph row represents an inex series. Since a saros, of 223 synodic months, is slightly less than a whole number of draconic months, the early eclipses in a saros series (in the upper part of the diagram) occur after the Moon goes through its node (the beginning and end of a draconic month), while the later eclipses (in the lower part) occur before the Moon goes through its node. Every 18 years, the eclipse occurs on average about half a degree further west with respect to the node, but the progression is not uniform.\nSaros and inex number can be calculated for an eclipse near a given date. One can also find the approximate date of solar eclipses at distant dates by first determining one in an inex series such as series 50. This can be done by adding or subtracting some multiple of 28.9450 Gregorian years from the solar eclipse of 10 May, 2013, or 28.9444 Julian years from the Julian date of 27 April, 2013. Once such an eclipse has been found, others around the same time can be found using the short cycles. For lunar eclipses, the anchor dates May 4, 2004 or Julian April 21 may be used.\nSaros and inex numbers are also defined for lunar eclipses. A solar eclipse of given saros and inex series will be preceded a fortnight earlier by a lunar eclipse whose saros number is 26 lower and whose inex number is 18 higher, or it will be followed a fortnight later by a lunar eclipse whose saros number is 12 higher and whose inex number is 43 lower. As with solar eclipses, the Gregorian year of a lunar eclipse can be calculated as:\nyear = 28.945 \u00d7 number of the saros series + 18.030 \u00d7 number of the inex series \u2212 2454.564\nLunar eclipses can also be plotted in a similar diagram, this diagram covering 1000 AD to 2500 AD. The yellow diagonal band represents all the eclipses from 1900 to 2100. This graph immediately illuminates that this 1900\u20132100 period contains an above average number of total lunar eclipses compared to other adjacent centuries.\nThis is related to the fact that tetrads (see above) are more common at present than at other periods. Tetrads occur when four lunar eclipses occur at four lunar inex numbers, decreasing by 8 (that is, a semester apart), which are in the range giving fairly central eclipses (small gamma), and furthermore the eclipses take place around halfway between the Earth's perihelion and aphelion. For example, in the tetrad of 2014-2015 (the so-called Four Blood Moons), the inex numbers were 52, 44, 36, and 28, and the eclipses occurred in April and late September-early October. Normally the absolute value of gamma decreases and then increases, but because in April the Sun is further east than its mean longitude, and in September/October further west than its mean longitude, the absolute values of gamma in the first and fourth eclipse are decreased, while the absolute values in the second and third are increased. The result is that all four gamma values are small enough to lead to total lunar eclipses. The phenomenon of the Moon \"catching up\" with the Sun (or the point opposite the Sun), which is usually not at its mean longitude, has been called a \"stern chase\".\nInex series move slowly through the year, each eclipse occurring about 20 days earlier in the year, 29 years later. This means that over a period of 18.2 inex cycles (526 years) the date moves around the whole year. But because the perihelion of Earth's orbit is slowly moving as well, the inex series that are now producing tetrads will again be halfway between Earth's perihelion and aphelion in about 586 years.\nThe graph of inex versus saros for solar or lunar eclipses can be skewed so that the x axis shows the time of year. (An eclipse which is two saros series and one inex series later than another will be only 1.8 days later in the year in the Gregorian calendar.) This shows the 586-year oscillations as oscillations that go up around perihelion and down around aphelion (see graph).\nProperties of eclipses.\nThe properties of eclipses, such as the timing, the distance or size of the Moon and Sun, or the distance the Moon passes north or south of the line between the Sun and the Earth, depend on the details of the orbits of the Moon and the Earth. There exist formulae for calculating the longitude, latitude, and distance of the Moon and of the Sun using sine and cosine series. The arguments of the sine and cosine functions depend on only four values, the Delaunay arguments:\nThese four arguments are basically linear functions of time but with slowly varying higher-order terms. A diagram of inex and saros indices such as the \"Panorama\" shown above is like a map, and we can consider the values of the Delaunay arguments on it. The mean elongation, D, goes through 360\u00b0 223 times when the inex value goes up by 1, and 358 times when the saros value goes up by 1. It is thus equivalent to 0\u00b0, by definition, at each combination of solar saros index and inex index, because solar eclipses occur when the elongation is zero. From D one can find the actual elapsed time from some reference time such as J2000, which is like a linear function of inex and saros but with a deviation that grows quadratically with distance from the reference time, amounting to about 19 minutes at a distance of 1000 years. The mean argument of latitude, F, is equivalent to 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 (depending on whether the saros index is even or odd) along the smooth curve going through the centre of the band of eclipses, where gamma is near zero (around inex series 50 at present). F decreases as we go away from this curve towards higher inex series, and increases on the other side, by about 0.5\u00b0 per inex series. When the inex value is too far from the centre, the eclipses disappear because the Moon is too far north or south of the Sun. The mean anomaly of the Sun is a smooth function, increasing by about 10\u00b0 when increasing inex by 1 in a saros series and decreasing by about 20\u00b0 when increasing saros index by 1 in an inex series. This means it is almost constant when increasing inex by 1 and saros index by 2 (the \"Unidos\" interval of 65 years). The above graph showing the time of year of eclipses basically shows the solar anomaly, since the perihelion moves by only one day per century in the Julian calendar, or 1.7 days per century in the Gregorian calendar. The mean anomaly of the Moon is more complicated. If we look at the eclipses whose saros index is divisible by 3, then the mean anomaly is a smooth function of inex and saros values. Contours run at an angle, so that mean anomaly is fairly constant when inex and saros values increase together at a ratio of around 21:24. The function varies slowly, changing by only 7.4\u00b0 when changing the saros index by 3 at a constant inex value. A similar smooth function obtains for eclipses with saros modulo 3 equal to 1, but shifted by about 120\u00b0, and for saros modulo 3 equal to 2, shifted by 120\u00b0 the other way.\nThe upshot is that the properties vary slowly over the diagram in any of the three sets of saros series. The accompanying graph shows just the saros series that have saros index modulo 3 equal to zero. The blue areas are where the mean anomaly of the Moon is near 0\u00b0, meaning that the Moon is near perigee at the time of the eclipse, and therefore relatively large, favoring total eclipses. In the red area, the Moon is generally further from the Earth, and the eclipses are annular. We can also see the effect of the Sun's anomaly. Eclipses in July, when the Sun is further from the Earth, are more likely to be total, so the blue area extends over a greater range of inex index than for eclipses in January.\nThe waviness seen in the graph is also due to the Sun's anomaly. In April the Sun is further east than if its longitude progressed evenly, and in October it is further west, and this means that in April the Moon catches up with the Sun relatively late, and in October relatively early. This in turn means that the argument of latitude at the actual time of the eclipse will be raised higher in April and lowered in October. Eclipses (either partial or not) with low inex index (near the upper edge in the \"Panorama\" graph) fail to occur in April because syzygy occurs too far to the east of the node, but more eclipses occur at high inex values in April because syzygy is not so far west of the node. The opposite applies to October. It also means that in April ascending-node solar eclipses will cast their shadow further north (such as the solar eclipse of April 8, 2024), and descending-node eclipses further south. The opposite is the case in October.\nEclipses that occur when the earth is near perihelion (sun anomaly near zero) are in saros series in which the gamma value changes little every 18 years and 11 days. The reason for this is that from one eclipse to the next in the saros series, the day in the year advances by about 11 days, but the Sun's position moves eastward by more than what it does for that change of day in year at other times. This means the Sun's position relative to the node doesn't change as much as for saros series giving eclipses at other times of the year. In the first half of the 21st century, solar saros series showing this slow rate of change of gamma include 122 (giving an eclipse on January 6, 2019), 132 (January 5, 2038), 141 (January 15, 2010), and 151 (January 4, 2011). Sometimes this phenomenon leads to a saros series giving a large number of central eclipses, for example solar saros 128 gave 20 eclipses with |\u03b3|&lt;0.75 between 1615 and 1958, whereas series 135 gave only nine, between 1872 and 2016.\nAt present central eclipses move slowly backwards through the year. An approximately zero-gamma lunar eclipse took place on July 16, 2000, and an approximately zero-gamma solar eclipse a half saros (9 years) before that, and similar eclipses occur at intervals of 47 years less 9.5 days.\nThe time interval between two eclipses in an eclipse cycle is variable. The time of an eclipse can be advanced or delayed by up to ten hours due to the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit\u00a0\u2013 the eclipse will be early when the Moon is going from perigee to apogee, and late when it is going from apogee toward perigee. The time is also delayed because of the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. Eclipses occur about four hours later in April and four hours earlier in October. This means that the delay varies from eclipse to eclipse in a series. The delay is the sum of two sine-like functions, one based on the time in the anomalistic year and one on the time in the anomalistic month. The periods of these two waves depends on how close the nominal interval between two eclipses in the series is to a whole number of anomalistic years and anomalistic months. In series like the \"Immobilis\" or the \"Accuratissima\", which are near whole numbers of both, the delay varies very slowly, so the interval is quite constant. In series like the octon, the Moon's anomaly changes considerably at least twice every three intervals, so the intervals vary considerably.\nThe \"Panorama\" can also be related to where on the Earth the shadow of the Moon falls at the central time of the eclipse. If this \"maximum eclipse\" for a given eclipse is at a particular location, eclipses three saros later will be at a similar latitude (because the saros is close to a whole number of draconic months) and longitude (because a period of three saros is always within a couple hours of being 19755.96 days long, which would change the longitude by about 13\u00b0 eastward). If instead we increase the saros index at a constant inex index, the intervals are quite variable because the number of anomalistic months or years is not very close to a whole number. This means that although the latitude will be similar (but changing sign), the longitude change can vary by more than 180\u00b0. Moving by six inex (a de la Hire cycle) preserves the latitude fairly well but the longitude change is very variable because of the variation of the solar anomaly.\nEclipse periods.\nIn addition to the eclipse cycles, there are periods in eclipse behavior that do not correspond to an eclipse cycle. As mentioned previously, there is the period of around 565 years in which central eclipses move around the anomalistic year (near to the Tetradia cycles). This is the period of the alternation between times when central eclipses do not move much in date (for example in the 20th century they were in July and are now moving into June) and times when central exlipses move rapidly in date. There is also the period of around 1640 years between times when central eclipses are at perigee (or agogee). In the figure above showing inex versus time of year, this is the time between the successive blue patches when total eclipses are more common than annular ones. The central eclipe at perigee of 1781 (and similar ones around then) will recurr only after this much time, around AD 3420.\nThere are short periodicities in the sizes of the Sun and Moon at the times of eclipses.\nBoth the angular size of the Moon in the sky at eclipses at the ascending node and the size of the Sun at those eclipses vary in a sort of sine wave. The sizes at the descending node vary in the same way, but 180\u00b0 out of phase. The Moon is large at an ascending-node eclipse when its perigee is near the ascending node, so the period for the size of the Moon is the time it takes for the angle between the node and the perigee to go through 360\u00b0, or\nformula_2 years\n(Note that a plus sign is used because the perigee moves eastward whereas the node moves westward.) A maximum of this is in 2024 (September), explaining why the ascending-node solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, is near perigee and total and the descending-node solar eclipse of October 2, 2024, is near apogee and annular. Although this cycle is about a day less than six years, super-moon eclipses actually occur every three years on average, because there are also the ones at the descending node that occur in between the ones at the ascending node.\nAt lunar eclipses the size of the Moon is 180\u00b0 out of phase with its size at solar eclipses.\nThe Sun is large at an ascending-node eclipse when its perigee (the direction toward the Sun when it is closest to the Earth) is near the ascending node, so the period for the size of the Sun is\nformula_3 years\nIn terms of Delaunay arguments, the Sun is biggest at ascending-node solar eclipses and smallest at descending-node solar eclipses around when l'+D=F (modulo 360\u00b0), such as June, 2010. It is smallest at descending-node solar eclipses and biggest at ascending-node solar eclipses 9.3 years later, such as September, 2019.\nLong-term trends.\nThe lengths of the synodic, draconic, and anomalistic months, the length of the day, and the length of the anomalistic year are all slowly changing. The synodic and draconic months, the day, and the anomalistic year (at least at present) are getting longer, whereas the anomalistic month is getting shorter. The eccentricity of the Earth's orbit is presently decreasing at about one percent per 300 years, thus decreasing the effect of the Sun's anomaly. Formulae for the Delaunay arguments show that the lengthening of the synodic month means that eclipses tend to occur later than they would otherwise proportionally to the square of the time separation from now, by about 0.32 hours per millennium squared. The other Delaunay arguments (mean anomaly of the Moon and of the sun and the argument of latitude) will all be increased because of this, but on the other hand the Delaunay arguments are also affected by the fact that the lengths of the draconic month and anomalistic month and year are changing. The net results are:\nAs an example, from the solar eclipse of April, 1688 BC, to that of April, AD 1623, is 110 inex plus 7 saros (equivalent to a \"Palaea-Horologia\" plus a \"tritrix\", 3310.09 Julian years). According to the table above, the Delaunay arguments should change by:\nBut because of the changing lengths of these, they actually changed by:\nNote that in this example, in terms of anomaly (position with respect to perigee) the Moon returns to within 1% of an orbit (about 3.4\u00b0), rather than 3.2% as predicted using today's values of month lengths.\nThe fact that the day is getting longer means there are more revolutions of the Earth since some point in the past than what one might calculate from the time and date, and fewer from now to some future time. This effect means eclipses occur earlier in the day or calendar, going in the opposite direction relative to the effect of the lengthening synodic month already mentioned. This effect is known as \u0394T. It cannot be calculated exactly but amounts to around 50 minutes per millennium squared. In our example above, this means that although the eclipse in 1688 BC was centered on March 16 at 00:15:31 in Dynamic time, it actually occurred before midnight and therefore on March 15 (using time based on the location of present-day Greenwich, and using the proleptic Julian calendar).\nThe fact that the argument of latitude is decreased explains why one sees a curvature in the \"Panorama\" above. Central eclipses in the past and in the future are higher in the graph (lower inex number) than what one would expect from a linear extrapolation. This is because the ratio of the length of a synodic month to the length of a draconic month is getting smaller. Although both are getting longer, the draconic month is doing so more quickly because the rate at which the node moves west is decreasing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One saros period after an eclipse, the Sun, Earth, and Moon return to approximately the same relative geometry, a near straight line, and a nearly identical eclipse will occur, in what is referred to as an eclipse cycle. Every eclipse has an associated saros series and all succeeding or preceding eclipses have a different saros series associated with them - as the eclipse of the same series occurs or occurred with a gap of one saros only. Solar and lunar eclipses have different saros series.\nA series of eclipses that are separated by one saros is called a \"saros series\". It corresponds to:\nThe 19 eclipse years means that if there is a solar eclipse (or lunar eclipse), then after one saros a new moon will take place at the same node of the orbit of the Moon, and under these circumstances another solar eclipse can occur.\nHistory.\nThe earliest discovered historical record of what is known as the saros is by Chaldean (neo-Babylonian) astronomers in the last several centuries BCE. It was later known to Hipparchus, Pliny and Ptolemy.\nThe name \"saros\" () was applied to the eclipse cycle by Edmond Halley in 1686, who took it from the \"Suda\", a Byzantine lexicon of the 11th century. The Suda says, \"[The saros is] a measure and a number among Chaldeans. For 120 saroi make 2220 years (years of 12 lunar months) according to the Chaldeans' reckoning, if indeed the saros makes 222 lunar months, which are 18 years and 6 months (i.e. years of 12 lunar months).\" The information in the \"Suda\" in turn was derived directly or otherwise from the \"Chronicle\" of Eusebius of Caesarea, which quoted Berossus. (Guillaume Le Gentil claimed that Halley's usage was incorrect in 1756, but the name continues to be used.) The Greek word apparently either comes from the Babylonian word \"s\u0101ru\" meaning the number 3600 or the Greek verb \"saro\" (\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u1ff6) that means \"sweep (the sky with the series of eclipses)\".\nThe Saros period of 223 lunar months (in Greek numerals, \u03a3\u039a\u0393\u2032) is in the Antikythera Mechanism user manual on this instrument, made around 150 to 100 BCE in Greece, as seen in the picture. This number is one of a few inscriptions of the mechanism that are visible with the unaided eye. Above it, the period of the Metonic cycle and the Callippic cycle are also visible.\nDescription.\nThe saros, a period of 6585.3211 days (15 common years + 3 leap years + 12.321 days, 14 common years + 4 leap years + 11.321 days, or 13 common years + 5 leap years + 10.321 days), is useful for predicting the times at which nearly identical eclipses will occur. Three periodicities related to lunar orbit, the synodic month, the draconic month, and the anomalistic month coincide almost perfectly each saros cycle. For an eclipse to occur, either the Moon must be located between the Earth and Sun (for a solar eclipse) or the Earth must be located between the Sun and Moon (for a lunar eclipse). This can happen only when the Moon is new or full, respectively, and repeat occurrences of these lunar phases result from solar and lunar orbits producing the Moon's \"synodic period\" of 29.53059 days. During most full and new moons, however, the shadow of the Earth or Moon falls to the north or south of the other body. Eclipses occur when the three bodies form a nearly straight line. Because the plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to that of the Earth, this condition occurs only when a full or new Moon is near or in the ecliptic plane, that is when the Moon is at one of the two nodes (the ascending or descending node). The period of time for two successive lunar passes through the ecliptic plane (returning to the same node) is termed the \"draconic month\", a 27.21222 day period. The three-dimensional geometry of an eclipse, when the new or full moon is near one of the nodes, occurs every five or six months when the Sun is in conjunction or opposition to the Moon and coincidentally also near a node of the Moon's orbit at that time, or twice per eclipse year. Two eclipses separated by one saros have very similar appearance and duration due to the distance between the Earth and Moon being nearly the same for each event: this is because the saros is also an integer multiple of the \"anomalistic month\" of 27.5545 days, the period of the moon with respect to the lines of apsides in its orbit.\nAfter one saros, the Moon will have completed roughly an integer number of synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical: the Moon will have the same phase and be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. In addition, because the saros is close to 18 years in length (about 11 days longer), the Earth will be nearly the same distance from the Sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation (same season). Given the date of an eclipse, one saros later a nearly identical eclipse can be predicted. During this 18-year period, about 40 other solar and lunar eclipses take place, but with a somewhat different geometry. One saros equaling 18.03 years is not equal to a perfect integer number of lunar orbits (Earth revolutions with respect to the fixed stars of 27.32166 days sidereal month), therefore, even though the relative geometry of the Earth\u2013Sun\u2013Moon system will be nearly identical after a saros, the Moon will be in a slightly different position with respect to the stars for each eclipse in a saros series. The axis of rotation of the Earth\u2013Moon system exhibits a precession period of 18.59992 years.\nThe saros is not an integer number of days, but contains the fraction of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;+1\u20443 of a day. Thus each successive eclipse in a saros series occurs about eight hours later in the day. In the case of an eclipse of the Sun, this means that the region of visibility will shift westward about 120\u00b0, or about one third of the way around the globe, and the two eclipses will thus not be visible from the same place on Earth. In the case of an eclipse of the Moon, the next eclipse might still be visible from the same location as long as the Moon is above the horizon. Given three saros eclipse intervals, the local time of day of an eclipse will be nearly the same. This three saros interval (19,755.96 days) is known as a triple saros or \"exeligmos\" (\"Greek\": \"turn of the wheel\") cycle.\nSaros series.\nEach saros series starts with a partial eclipse (Sun first enters the end of the node), and in each successive saros the path of the Moon is shifted either northward (when near the descending node) or southward (when near the ascending node) due to the fact that the saros is not an exact integer of draconic months (about one hour short). At some point, eclipses are no longer possible and the series terminates (Sun leaves the beginning of the node). An arbitrary solar saros series was designated as solar saros series 1 by compilers of eclipse statistics. This series has finished, but the eclipse of November 16, 1990 BC (Julian calendar) for example is in solar saros series 1. There are different saros series for solar and lunar eclipses. For lunar saros series, the lunar eclipse occurring 58.5 synodic months earlier (February 23, 1994 BC) was assigned the number 1. If there is an eclipse one inex (29 years minus about 20 days) after an eclipse of a particular saros series then it is a member of the next series. For example, the eclipse of October 26, 1961 BC is in solar saros series 2. Saros series, of course, went on before these dates, and it is necessary to extend the saros series numbers backwards to negative numbers even just to accommodate eclipses occurring in the years following 2000 BC (up till the last eclipse with a negative saros number in 1367 BC). For solar eclipses the statistics for the complete saros series within the era between 2000 BC and AD 3000 are given in this article's references. It takes between 1226 and 1550 years for the members of a saros series to traverse the Earth's surface from north to south (or vice versa). These extremes allow from 69 to 87 eclipses in each series (most series have 71 or 72 eclipses). From 39 to 59 (mostly about 43) eclipses in a given series will be central (that is, total, annular, or hybrid annular-total). At any given time, approximately 40 different saros series will be in progress.\nSaros series, as mentioned, are numbered according to the type of eclipse (lunar or solar). In odd numbered series (for solar eclipses) the Sun is near the ascending node, whereas in even numbered series it is near the descending node (this is reversed for lunar eclipse saros series). Generally, the ordering of these series determines the time at which each series peaks, which corresponds to when an eclipse is closest to one of the lunar nodes. For solar eclipses, the 40 series numbered between 117 and 156 are active (series 117 will end in 2054), whereas for lunar eclipses, there are now 41 active saros series numbered between 110 and 150 (series 110 will end in 2027). These numbers can be derived by counting the number of eclipses listed over an 18-year (saros) period from the eclipse catalog sites.\nExample.\nAs an example of a single saros series, this table gives the dates of some of the 72 lunar eclipses for saros series 131. This eclipse series began in AD 1427 with a partial eclipse at the southern edge of the Earth's shadow when the Moon was close to its descending node. In each successive saros, the Moon's orbital path is shifted northward with respect to the Earth's shadow, with the first total eclipse occurring in 1950. For the following 252 years, total eclipses occur, with the central eclipse in 2078. The first partial eclipse after this will occur in the year 2220, and the final partial eclipse of the series will occur in 2707. The total lifetime of lunar saros series 131 is 1280 years. Solar saros 138 interleaves with this lunar saros with an event occurring every 9 years 5 days alternating between each saros series.\nBecause of the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;+1\u20443 fraction of days in a saros, the visibility of each eclipse will differ for an observer at a given locale. For the lunar saros series 131, the first total eclipse of 1950 had its best visibility for viewers in Eastern Europe and the Middle East because mid-eclipse was at 20:44 UT. The following eclipse in the series occurred about 8 hours later in the day with mid-eclipse at 4:47 UT, and was best seen from North America and South America. The third total eclipse occurred about 8 hours later in the day than the second eclipse with mid-eclipse at 12:43 UT, and had its best visibility for viewers in the Western Pacific, East Asia, Australia and New Zealand. This cycle of visibility repeats from the start to the end of the series, with minor variations. Solar saros 138 interleaves with this lunar saros with an event occurring every 9 years 5 days alternating between each saros series.\nFor a similar example for solar saros see solar saros 136.\nRelationship between lunar and solar saros (sar).\nAfter a given lunar or solar eclipse, after 9 years and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 days (a half saros, or sar) an eclipse will occur that is lunar instead of solar, or vice versa, with similar properties.\nFor example, if the Moon's penumbra partially covers the southern limb of the Earth during a solar eclipse, 9 years and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 days later a lunar eclipse will occur in which the Moon is partially covered by the southern limb of the Earth's penumbra. Likewise, 9 years and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 days after a total solar eclipse or an annular solar eclipse occurs, a total lunar eclipse will also occur. This 9-year period is referred to as a sar. It includes &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;111+1\u20442 synodic months, or 111 synodic months plus one fortnight. The fortnight accounts for the alternation between solar and lunar eclipse.

Four series of thirteen 50-minute episodes were broadcast on BBC1 between 1978 and 1981. It was created by Terry Nation, who also wrote the first series, produced by David Maloney (series one to three) and Vere Lorrimer (series four), and the script editor throughout its run was Chris Boucher, who wrote nine of its episodes. The main character for the first two series was Roj Blake, played by Gareth Thomas.\n\"Blake's 7\" was broadcast in 25 other countries. It had a low budget but featured many tropes of space opera, such as spaceships, robots, galactic empires and aliens. Critical responses have been mixed; some praised the programme for its dystopian themes, strong characterisation, ambiguous morality and pessimistic tone, as well as displaying an \"enormous sense of fun\", but others have criticised its production values and dialogue, and accused it of lacking originality. It retains a sizeable and enthusiastic fan base, and was described in \"The Guardian\"'s 40-year retrospective as \"a bold show that wasn't afraid to break formulas\".\nA limited range of \"Blake's 7\" merchandise was issued, and books, magazines and annuals were published. The BBC released music and sound effects from the series, and several companies made \"Blake's 7\" toys and models. Four video compilations were released between 1985 and 1990, and the entire programme was released in videocassette beginning in 1991 and re-released during 1997, and as four DVD boxed sets between 2003 and 2006. The BBC produced two audio dramas during 1998 and 1999, featuring original cast members, that were broadcast by BBC Radio 4. Although proposals for live-action and animated remakes have not been realised, \"Blake's 7\" has been revived with two series of audio dramas, a comedic short film, and a series of fan-made audio plays involving the original cast.\nOverview.\nFour series of thirteen 50-minute episodes were made, and first broadcast in the United Kingdom between January 1978 and December 1981 by BBC1.&lt;ref name=\"B7 Programme Guide/Prologue\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are set in the third century of the second calendar (this is mentioned in associated publicity material, not in the series) and at least 700 years in the future. \"Blake's 7\"'s narrative concerns the exploits of political dissident Roj Blake, who leads a small group of rebels against the forces of the totalitarian Terran Federation that rules the Earth and many colonised planets. The Federation uses mass surveillance, brainwashing, and drug pacification to control its citizens. Blake is arrested, tried on false charges, and deported to a remote penal colony. En route, he and fellow prisoners Jenna Stannis and Kerr Avon break free and escape on a technologically advanced alien spacecraft, which its central computer 'Zen' refers to as the \"Liberator\" (a word Jenna was thinking when the ship probed her mind). \"Liberator\"'s speed and weaponry are far superior to any Federation craft, and it also has a teleportation system that enables transport to the surface of planets. It also contains rooms filled with clothes and precious gemstones, and a medical bay facility. After freeing fellow prisoners Vila Restal and Olag Gan from the penal colony, and recruiting alien telepath freedom fighter Cally, Blake and his new crew use the \"Liberator\" to begin a campaign to damage the Federation, but are pursued by Space Commander Travis\u2014a vengeful Federation officer\u2014and Servalan, the Supreme Commander and later Federation President.&lt;ref name=\"B7 Programme Guide/Stories\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe composition of the titular \"seven\" changes throughout the series. The initial group\u2014Blake, Vila, Gan, Jenna, Avon, and Cally\u2014included Zen as the seventh member. At the end of the first series, they capture a supercomputer named Orac. Gan is killed during the second series, and the five remaining humans and two computers make up the defacto seven. After the end of the second series, Blake and Jenna disappear and are replaced by new characters Dayna and Tarrant. At the start of the fourth series, Cally dies and is replaced by Soolin. After the destruction of \"Liberator\", the computer Zen is replaced by a new computer, Slave, on board the group's new commandeered ship \"Scorpio\".\nWhile Blake is an idealistic freedom fighter, his associates are petty crooks, smugglers and killers. Avon is a technological genius who, while apparently motivated by self-preservation and wealth, consistently acts to help others. By the third series, after Blake has gone missing, Avon becomes the leader. At first, Avon believes the Federation has been destroyed; he becomes tired of killing, and seeks rest. However, by the middle of the third series, Avon realises that the Federation is expanding again, faster than originally realised, and he resumes the fight. \nThe BBC had originally planned to conclude \"Blake's 7\" at the end of its third series, but a further series was commissioned unexpectedly following the broadcast of its final episode.\nAs a result, some changes to the programme's format were inevitable, both in front of and behind the camera. These included the appointment of a new producer and the introduction of a new spacecraft, \"Scorpio\", and new characters, Soolin and Slave.\n\"Blake's 7\" was watched by an average of 9 million viewers in the UK, and was broadcast in 25 other countries.&lt;ref name=\"B7 Programme Guide/Back\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nSources and themes.\nTerry Nation pitched \"Blake's 7\" to the BBC as \"\"The Dirty Dozen\" in space\", a reference to the 1967 Robert Aldrich movie in which a disparate group of convicts are sent on a suicide mission during World War II.\nThis influence shows in that some of Blake's devotees are escaped convicts (Avon, Vila, Gan and Jenna). \"Blake's 7\" also draws much of its inspiration from the legend of Robin Hood.\nBlake's devotees are not a band of \"Merry Men\". His diverse crew includes a corrupt computer genius (Avon), a smuggler (Jenna), a thief (Vila), a murderer (Gan), a telepathic guerrilla soldier (Cally), the Liberator's computer (Zen) and another computer (Orac). Later additions were: a na\u00efve weapons expert (Dayna), a mercenary (Tarrant), a gunslinger (Soolin) and the Scorpio's computer (Slave). While Blake intends to use \"Liberator\" to strike against the Federation, the others are often reluctant soldiers\u2014especially Avon. Blake and Avon's clashes over the command represent a conflict between idealism and cynicism, emotion and rationality, and dreams and practicality.\nSimilar conflicts occur between other characters; the courage of Blake and Avon compared with Vila's cowardice, or Avon and Jenna's scepticism of Blake's ideals compared with Gan's unswerving loyalty, Blake's mass murdering methods compared with Avon's targeted and less destructive methods.\nScript editor Chris Boucher, whose influence on the series increased as it progressed, was inspired by Latin American revolutionaries, especially Emiliano Zapata, in exploring Blake and his devotees' motives and the consequences of their actions.\nThis is most evident in the episode \"Star One\", in which Blake must confront the reality that in achieving his goal of overthrowing the Federation, he will cause chaos and death for many innocent citizens. When Avon gains control of \"Liberator\", after Blake's disappearance after the events of \"Star One\", he uses it to pursue his own agenda, such as avenging his lost love Anna Grant. Later, Avon realises that he cannot escape the Federation's reach and that he must, like Blake, resist them. In this respect, by the end of the fourth series Avon has replaced Blake.\nClassic films, such as the Western \"The Magnificent Seven\", were an important influence upon \"Blake's 7\". Chris Boucher incorporated lines from Westerns into the scripts, much to the delight of Paul Darrow, an enthusiast of the genre. The final episode, \"Blake\", was inspired by \"The Wild Bunch\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\". \"Blake's 7\" also drew inspiration from the classic British dystopian novels \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" by George Orwell, \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley and \"When the Sleeper Wakes\" by H. G. Wells. This is most evident in the nature of the Federation, whose methods of dealing with Blake in the first episode, \"The Way Back\", include brainwashing and show trials. These are reminiscent of the way in which the USSR dealt with its dissidents.\nExplorations of totalitarianism in the series are not confined to the Federation\u2014totalitarian control through religion (\"Cygnus Alpha\"), genetics (\"The Web\") and technology (\"Redemption\") are also portrayed.\nSuch authoritarian dystopias are common in Terry Nation's work, including his \"Doctor Who\" story \"Genesis of the Daleks\" (1975).\nLoyalty and trust are important themes of the series.\nAvon is presented with several opportunities to abandon Blake. Many of Blake's schemes require co-operation and expertise from others. Characters are often betrayed by family and friends, especially Avon, whose former lover Anna Grant is eventually revealed to be a Federation agent. The theme of loyalty and trust reaches its maximum during Blake and Avon's final encounter in the last episode (\"Blake\"); Blake, by now very paranoid, has been masquerading as a bounty hunter collaborating with the Federation as a front for his activities in recruiting and testing potential allies in the struggle and this causes Avon and the others to suspect him when Tarrant accuses Blake of betraying them; an ironic miscommunication between Avon and Blake precipitates the disastrous events that conclude the episode.\nIf Blake and his crew represent Robin Hood and his Merry Men, then the Federation forces, personified by the obsessive, psychopathic Space Commander Travis and his superior, the beautiful but ruthless Supreme Commander Servalan, represent Guy of Gisbourne and the Sheriff of Nottingham.\nA common theme of Nation's science fiction is the depiction of post-apocalyptic societies, as in several of his \"Doctor Who\" serials, for example \"The Daleks\" (1963\u201364), \"Death to the Daleks\" (1974), \"Genesis of the Daleks\" (1975) and \"The Android Invasion\" (1975) and in his series \"Survivors\" (1975\u201377). Post-apocalyptic societies feature in several \"Blake's 7\" episodes including \"Duel\", \"Deliverance\", \"City at the Edge of the World\" and \"Terminal\". Although not explicitly stated, some publicity material for the series refers to the Federation as having developed after a nuclear holocaust on Earth. Noting the series's distinctive aesthetic, an academic concluded: \"At its best, Blake's 7 had a peculiar intensity all its own\".\nPlot summary.\nThe series is set in a future age of interstellar travel and concerns the exploits of a group of outlaws. Gareth Thomas played the eponymous character Roj Blake, a political dissident who is arrested, tried and convicted on false charges, and then deported from Earth to a prison planet. En route, he and two fellow prisoners, treated as expendable, are sent to board and investigate an abandoned alien spacecraft found drifting in space. They get the ship working, commandeer it, rescue two more prisoners, and are later joined by an alien guerrilla with telepathic abilities. In their attempts to stay ahead of their enemies and inspire others to rebel, they encounter a great variety of cultures on different planets, and are forced to confront human and alien threats. Blake's group suffer losses and casualties, and recruit newer members to join them. They perform a campaign against the totalitarian Terran Federation until an intergalactic war occurs with aliens from the Andromeda galaxy. Blake disappears and Kerr Avon then leads the group. When their spacecraft is destroyed and another group member is killed, the survivors commandeer another craft (which they enhance with superior technology), and a secret base on a distant planet from which they continue their campaign. In the final episode, Avon finds Blake and, suspecting him of betraying the group, kills him. The group is then shot by Federation guards, who surround Avon in the final scene as shots are heard over the end credits.\nSeries One (1978).\nRoj Blake, a worker of high social status classified as \"alpha-grade\", lives in a domed city. Similar domes house most of the Earth's population. Blake is approached by a group of political dissidents who take him outside the city to meet their leader, Bran Foster. According to Foster, Blake was once the leader of an influential group of political activists opposed to the Federation's Earth Administration. Blake was arrested, brainwashed and coerced into making a confession denouncing the rebellion. His memory of those years was then blocked. Foster wants Blake to rejoin the dissidents. Suddenly, the meeting is interrupted by the arrival of Federation security forces, who shoot and kill the crowd of rebels. Blake, the only survivor, returns to the city, where he begins to remember his past. He is arrested, tried on false charges of child molestation and sentenced to deportation to the prison planet Cygnus Alpha.\nWhilst awaiting deportation from Planet Earth, Blake meets thief Vila Restal and smuggler Jenna Stannis. On board the prison ship \"London\", Blake meets convicted murderer Olag Gan and computer engineer and embezzler Kerr Avon. The \"London\" encounters a battle between two alien space fleets and the \"London\"'s crew plot a course to avoid the combat zone and continue their voyage. They encounter a strange alien craft, board it and attempt to salvage it but are thwarted by the alien ship's defence mechanism. The commander of the \"London\" sends the expendable Blake, Avon, and Jenna across to the ship. Blake defeats the defence system when it tries to use memories he recently discovered were false. With Jenna as pilot, the three convicts escape in the alien craft.\nBlake and his crew follow the \"London\" to Cygnus Alpha in their captured ship, which they have named \"Liberator\". They retrieve Vila and Gan, while Blake leaves the other prisoners. Blake wants to use \"Liberator\" and its new crew to attack the Federation with the others, especially Avon, as reluctant followers. Blake's first target is a communications station on the planet Saurian Major. Blake infiltrates the station and is assisted by Cally, a telepathic guerrilla soldier from the planet Auron. Blake invites Cally to join the crew. With this new arrival, and including \"Liberator\"'s computer, Zen, \"Liberator\" has a crew of seven.\nAs Blake's attacks against the Federation become bolder, he has less success. Political pressure grows on the Administration with planetary commanders threatening to leave the Federation because of its inability to protect them from Blake's attacks. Rumours abound about Blake's heroism and other rebel groups use his name for their actions. Supreme Commander Servalan appoints Space Commander Travis, who has a vendetta against Blake, to eliminate Blake and capture \"Liberator\". Servalan often co-opts Travis for her personal projects and uses Blake as a cover for her own activities. When Travis repeatedly fails to eliminate Blake, Servalan does not assign the task to another officer and does not use more resources to eliminate him.\nBlake meets a man named Ensor and discovers a plot by Servalan and Travis to seize a powerful computer named Orac, which is capable of communicating with any computer that uses a component called a Tariel Cell. Blake's crew suffers from radiation sickness but capture the device before Servalan arrives. Blake offers to perform the operation to save Ensor's life aboard the \"Liberator\" but Ensor dies when the power cells for his artificial heart are depleted before they are able to reach \"Liberator\". Aboard the ship, Orac predicts the craft's destruction in the near future.\nSeries Two (1979).\nThe \"Liberator\" is recaptured by the people that built it and Orac's prophecy is fulfilled when it destroys an identical space vehicle. Blake wants to attack the heart of the Federation and he targets the main computer control facility on Earth. Avon agrees to help on the condition that Blake gives him \"Liberator\" when the Federation has been destroyed. Blake, Avon, Vila and Gan reach the control facility and find an empty room. Travis reveals that the computer facility was secretly relocated years before and the old location was left as a decoy. Blake and his crew escape but Travis throws a grenade in the confined area and Gan is killed by falling rubble.\nAfter Gan's death, Blake considers the future of the rebellion, and Travis is convicted of war crimes by a Federation court martial at Space Command Headquarters aboard a space station. Blake decides to restore his group's reputation and attacks the space station but Travis escapes and continues his vendetta against Blake. Blake seeks the new location of the computer control facility. He learns that it is named \"Star One\". When \"Star One\" begins to malfunction, Servalan also becomes desperate to find its location. The facility's failure causes many problems in the Federation. \"Star One\" controls a large defensive barrier that has prevented extra-galactic incursions. Blake discovers \"Star One\"'s location and finds that, with help from Travis, aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy have infiltrated it. Vila discovers a fleet of alien spacecraft beyond the barrier. Travis partially disables the barrier. Blake and his crew overcome the aliens at \"Star One\" and kill Travis but the gap in the barrier allows the aliens to invade. Jenna calls for help from the Federation, where Servalan has conducted a military coup, imposed martial law and declared herself President. Servalan dispatches the Federation's battle fleets to repel the invaders, who begin to breach the barrier. With Blake badly wounded, \"Liberator\" by Avon's direction, alone until Servalan's battle fleets arrive, fights against the aliens.\nSeries Three (1980).\n\"Liberator\" is severely damaged during the battle with the Andromedans, forcing the crew to abandon ship whilst Zen carries out repairs. The Federation defeats the alien invaders but the cost considerably reduces its influence in the galaxy. Blake and Jenna go missing and Avon becomes the new leader. Two new additions, weapons expert Dayna Mellanby and mercenary Del Tarrant, join the crew. Avon is less inclined than Blake to attack the Federation but Servalan realises that if she captures \"Liberator\", the Federation will quickly restore its former power.\nServalan attempts to create clones of herself, but is thwarted when the embryos are destroyed. Avon decides to find the Federation agent who killed Anna Grant, his former lover. The group interrupts an attempt to eliminate Servalan and Avon discovers that Anna is alive and was previously a Federation agent named Bartolemew. Anna tries to shoot Avon in the back but Avon kills her and frees Servalan. Servalan lures Avon into a trap using a faked message from Blake. Servalan finally captures \"Liberator\" and maroons the crew on an artificial planet named Terminal but does not know that \"Liberator\" has been irreparably damaged after flying through a cloud of corrosive fluid particles. As Servalan leaves Terminal, the ship explodes and Servalan is apparently killed as she attempts to escape by teleporting away.\nSeries Four (1981).\nBooby traps, set by Servalan in her underground complex on Terminal, explode and Cally is killed. Avon, Tarrant, Vila and Dayna escape with Orac and are rescued by Dorian, a salvage operator. Dorian takes the crew in his spacecraft, \"Scorpio\", to his base on the planet Xenon, where they meet his partner, Soolin. Dorian plans to drain the crew's life-force and take Orac but is foiled by Vila. Avon completes a new teleport system for \"Scorpio\" using the technology left behind by Dorian. Soolin joins the crew and they commandeer \"Scorpio\" and occupy the Xenon base. Avon gains control of Slave, \"Scorpio\"'s main computer.\nThe crew acquires an experimental new stardrive that vastly increases \"Scorpio\"'s speed, making it even faster than \"Liberator\". The \"Scorpio\" crew become concerned about the speed at which the Federation is reclaiming its former territory and discover that Servalan survived the destruction of \"Liberator\". Deposed as President of the Federation, she is using the pseudonym Commissioner Sleer and is enacting a pacification programme using a drug named Pylene-50. The \"Scorpio\" crew gain the formula for an antidote to Pylene-50 but this cannot reverse the drug's effects. Avon finds a way to synthesise the antidote and the crew attempt to create an alliance between independent worlds to resist the Federation and get the resources and manpower to mass-produce the Pylene-50 antidote. One of the alliance members, Zukan, betrays the alliance to Servalan and detonates explosives on Xenon base, which is damaged and the \"Scorpio\" crew are forced to abandon it.\nAvon tells the rest of the group that Orac has traced Blake to Gauda Prime, an agricultural planet. Blake is masquerading as a bounty hunter; his latest quarry is Arlen, whom he hopes to recruit for his rebellion. \"Scorpio\" approaches Gauda Prime and is attacked. The crew, except Tarrant, use the teleport to abandon the damaged craft. Slave is damaged, Tarrant remains aboard to pilot \"Scorpio\" and is injured during a crash landing. Blake arrives, rescues and takes Tarrant to his base and purportedly captures Tarrant as bounty. Tarrant thinks that Blake has betrayed the group, and Blake lets Tarrant escape. Tarrant is nearly killed by Blake's colleagues when Avon and his crew save him, giving credence to Tarrant's accusation that Blake has betrayed them to the Federation. Becoming very suspicious of Blake, Avon kills him. Arlen reveals that she is a Federation officer and Federation guards arrive. Tarrant, Soolin, Vila, and Dayna are shot by Federation troops, who slowly surround Avon with their weapons pointed at him. Avon steps over Blake's body, raises his gun and smiles. Shots are heard over the end credits.\nProduction history.\n\"Blake's 7\" was created by Terry Nation, an experienced television scriptwriter who had previously created the Daleks for \"Doctor Who\" and created the post-apocalyptic fiction drama series \"Survivors\". He had the idea for \"Blake's 7\" in a moment of inspiration during a pitch meeting with Ronnie Marsh, a BBC drama executive. Marsh was intrigued and immediately commissioned a pilot script. When he had seen the draft, Marsh approved \"Blake's 7\" for full development. David Maloney, an experienced BBC director, was assigned to produce the series and Chris Boucher was engaged as script editor. Nation was commissioned to write the thirteen episodes. Boucher's task was to expand and develop Nation's first drafts into workable scripts, but this became increasingly difficult as Nation started running out of ideas. Meanwhile, Maloney was struggling with the low budget available given the need for action and special effects. Despite these challenges, \"Blake's 7\" was very popular, with some episodes exceeding ten million viewers. A second series was quickly commissioned.\nThe BBC engaged new writers for the subsequent series. It was decided that one of the regular characters should die, to demonstrate that Blake and his crew were not invincible. Gan, played by David Jackson, was chosen because Gan had been under-used and was the least popular character. Although ratings declined compared to the first series, the BBC commissioned a third. When Gareth Thomas and Sally Knyvette decided not to return, new characters were required so that the story could continue without its titular character. Suggestions for a replacement actor for Blake were rejected and Avon became more prominent in the story. New characters Del Tarrant, portrayed by Steven Pacey, and Dayna Mellanby, portrayed by Josette Simon, were introduced.\n\"Blake's 7\" was not expected to be recommissioned after the third series and there was surprise when during 1980 a further series was announced as the third series ended. BBC One controller Bill Cotton had watched \"Terminal\" and enjoyed it greatly. He telephoned the presentation department and ordered them to make the announcement. Maloney was unavailable to work on a fourth series, so Vere Lorrimer became the producer. He introduced new characters, a new spacecraft \u2013 \"Scorpio\" \u2013 and its computer Slave. Jan Chappell (who played Cally) decided that she did not want to return, and was replaced by Glynis Barber as Soolin.\nThomas made a final appearance as Blake and insisted that his character be killed in a definitive manner. Although the fourth series performed satisfactorily in the ratings, \"Blake's 7\" was not renewed and the final episode had an ambiguous finale. Except for Blake, whose death was contractual, the characters were shown being attacked in such a way that their survival would have been possible had a fifth series been commissioned. The final episode, \"Blake\", was broadcast on 21 December 1981.\nAlthough \"Blake's 7\" never crossed over with \"Doctor Who\" during its initial run, Thomas was open to the idea as he was close friends with \"Doctor Who\" star Tom Baker, and the two wanted to be \"briefly crossing paths\" with one another before going their separate ways. Ultimately, the idea was scrapped.\nFilming locations.\nInterior spaceship sets and other indoor scenes were recorded on videotape in London at BBC Television Centre, Shepherd's Bush. Some interiors were filmed at Ealing Film Studios. For indoor complexes, such as bases or command centre bunkers, filming often took place in local power plants and water turbine stations. Location shooting was also extensive with shooting occurring mostly in southern England. Notable location shots include episode eleven of the first series, \"Bounty\", where the production was filmed at Quex Park in Kent. The Waterloo Tower in Quex Park was ex-president Sarkoff's residence in exile.\nThe series also used Betchworth Quarry as the surface of an alien planet and Wookey Hole Caves as the site of an alien mine. Additional location shooting took place at Black Park, the New Forest, the South Bank, Camden Town and Wembley Conference Centre.\nMusic and sound effects.\n\"Blake's 7\"'s theme music was written by Australian composer Dudley Simpson, who had composed music for \"Doctor Who\" for more than ten years. The same recording of Simpson's theme was used for the beginning titles of all four series of the programme. For the fourth series, a new recording was made for the closing credits that used an easy listening-style arrangement. Simpson also provided the incidental music for all of the episodes except for the Series One episode \"Duel\" and the Series Two episode \"Gambit\". \"Duel\" was directed by Douglas Camfield, who had a grudge against Simpson and refused to work with him, and so the episode contained library music. Elizabeth Parker provided the music and sound effects for \"Gambit\". \"Blake's 7\" made considerable use of audio effects that are described in the credits as \"special sound\". Many electronically generated sound effects were used, ranging from foley-style effects for props including handguns, teleport sounds, spacecraft engines, flight console buttons and background atmospheres. The special sounds for \"Blake's 7\" were provided by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop composers Richard Yeoman-Clark and Elizabeth Parker.\nCritical reception.\n\"Blake's 7\" received both positive and negative reviews. The review by Stanley Reynolds in \"The Times\" of the fourth episode, \"Time Squad\", stated: \"\u00a0... nice to hear the youngsters holding their breath in anticipation of a little terror\". Reynolds elaborated, \"Television science fiction has got too self-consciously jokey lately. It is also nice to have each episode complete within itself, while still carrying on the saga of Blake's struggle against the 1984-ish Federation. But is that dark-haired telepathic alien girl, the latest addition to Blake's outer-space merry men, going to spell love trouble for blonde Jenna? Maid Marian never had that trouble in Sherwood Forest.\"\nIn January 1998 Robert Hanks of \"The Independent\" compared the series' ethos to that of \"Star Trek\". He wrote: \"If you wanted to sum up the relative position of Britain and America in this century\u00a0\u2014 the ebbing away of the pink areas of the map, the fading of national self-confidence as Uncle Sam proceeded to colonise the globe with fizzy drinks and Hollywood\u00a0\u2014 you could do it like this: they had \"Star Trek\", we had \"Blake's 7\"\u00a0... No 'boldly going' here: instead, we got the boot stamping on a human face which George Orwell offered as a vision of humanity's future in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". Hanks concluded that \"Blake's 7\" has acquired a credibility and popularity Terry Nation can never have expected\u00a0... I think it's to do with the sheer crappiness of the series and the crappiness it attributes to the universe: it is science-fiction for the disillusioned and ironic\u00a0\u2014 and that is what makes it so very British\".\nGavin Collinson of the British Film Institute's website Screenonline wrote \"The premise of \"Blake's 7\" held nothing remotely original. The outlaw group resisting a powerful and corrupt regime is an idea familiar from Robin Hood and beyond.\" He added \"\"Blake's 7\"'s triumph lay in its vivid characters, its tight, pacey plots and its satisfying realism...For arguably the first time since the 1950s Quatermass serials, the BBC had created a popular sci-fi/fantasy show along adult lines\". His review concludes \"Ultimately, the one force the rebels could not overcome proved to be the BBC's long-standing apathy towards science fiction. However, the bloody finale, in which Avon murders Blake, exemplified the programme's strengths\u00a0\u2014 fearless narratives, credible but surprising character development and an enormous sense of fun.\" In 2015, Tim Stanley of \"The Daily Telegraph\" described the series as \"oft-derided\" and \"gloriously low budget\" but \"a genuine classic\". He added: \"this was superior drama performed by consummate professionals who made it believable by being 100 per cent committed to the material. \"Blake's 7\"'s sets and dresses were bright and gaudy but it was dark, dark melodrama.\" Stanley concluded: \"\"Blake's 7\" can be read as a document of the Callaghan/Carter years with their piles of rubbish in the streets. Then along came Thatcher/Reagan and sci-fi turned hopeful again. Cue \"Star Wars\" and its childish universe of\nWookiees and Ewoks. Moral clarity returned. The budgets ballooned. But, for my money, it was nowhere near as interesting.\"\nThe Australian broadcaster and critic Clive James gave a negative appraisal, calling it \"\u00a0... classically awful British television SF\u00a0... no apostrophe in the title, no sense in the plot\". He continued \"The depraved space queen Servalan\u00a0... could never quite bring herself to volatilize the dimly heroic Blake even when she had him square in the sights of her plasmatic spasm guns. The secret of Blake's appeal, or Blakes appeal, for the otherwise infallibly fatale Servalan remained a mystery, like the actual wattage of light bulb on which the design of Blake's spaceship, or Blakes spaceship, was plainly based\". Screenwriter Nigel Kneale, whose work included \"The Quatermass Experiment\" and other science fiction, was also critical. He described \"the very few bits I've seen\" as \"paralytically awful\", saying that \"the dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling\".\nLegacy.\n\"Blake's 7\" deviates from the good-versus-evil dualism in \"Star Wars\"; \"\"'s 'feel-good' future; and the episodic structure of \"Doctor Who\". \"Blake's 7\" also influenced \"Hyperdrive\" and \"Aeon Flux\". It has also been alleged to have influenced \"Farscape\" and \"Firefly\", albeit Joss Whedon denied that it had been a conscious influence on the latter. \nTelevision playwright Dennis Potter's final work \"Cold Lazarus\" was inspired by the show.\n\"Blake's 7\" remains fairly well regarded. A poll of United States science-fiction writers, fans and critics for John Javna's 1987 book \"The Best of Science Fiction\" placed the series 25th in popularity, despite then only having recently begun to be broadcast in the US.\nA similar poll in Britain conducted for \"SFX magazine\" during 1999 put \"Blake's 7\" at 16th place, with the magazine commenting that \"twenty years on, TV SF is still mapping the paths first explored by Terry Nation's baby\".\nDuring 2005 \"SFX\" surveyed readers' top 50 British telefantasy shows of all time, and \"Blake's 7\" was placed at number four behind \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", \"Red Dwarf\" and \"Doctor Who\".\nA similar poll conducted by \"TV Zone\" magazine during 2003 for the top 100 cult television programmes scored \"Blake's 7\" 11th.\nDutch musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen was inspired by \"Blake's 7\" in naming his side-project Star One.\nIn 2004 a 15-minute comedy short entitled \"Blake's Junction 7\" debuted at several film festivals around the world. It was directed by Ben Gregor, written by Tim Plester, and featured Mackenzie Crook, Martin Freeman, Johnny Vegas, Mark Heap and Peter Tuddenham. This parody depicted the characters taking a break at the Newport Pagnell motorway service area. During 2006 the BBC produced a 30-minute documentary \"The Cult of... Blake's 7\" that was first broadcast on 12 December on BBC Four, as part of a \"Science Fiction Britannia\" series.\nPlanned revival.\nThe revival of \"Blake's 7\" has been mooted for some years. Terry Nation raised the possibility on a number of occasions and proposed that a new series would be set some years after the existing one. Avon, living in exile like Napoleon on Elba, would be persuaded by a new group of rebels to resume the fight against the Federation.\nRadio and audio.\nDuring 1998 \"Blake's 7\" was broadcast again by the BBC on radio. \"The Sevenfold Crown\" was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 17 January 1998 as part of its \"Playhouse\" strand. The play was produced by Brian Lighthill and written by Barry Letts. Paul Darrow, Michael Keating, Steven Pacey, Peter Tuddenham and Jacqueline Pearce reprised their television roles, but Josette Simon and Glynis Barber were replaced by Angela Bruce as Dayna and Paula Wilcox as Soolin. The story was set during the fourth series between the episodes \"Stardrive\" and \"Animals\". This was followed by \"The Syndeton Experiment\", which featured the same cast, producer and writer and was broadcast as \"The Saturday Play\" on 10 April 1999 by BBC Radio 4. BBC Audiobooks released a CD of readings of Trevor Hoyle's novelisations of episodes \"The Way Back\" read by Gareth Thomas and \"Cygnus Alpha\" read by Paul Darrow.\nOn 11 December 2006, B7 Productions announced that it had recorded a series of 36 five-minute \"Blake's 7\" audio adventures, written by Ben Aaronovitch, Marc Platt and James Swallow. This featured Derek Riddell as Blake, Colin Salmon as Avon, Daniela Nardini as Servalan, Craig Kelly as Travis, Carrie Dobro as Jenna, Dean Harris as Vila, Owen Aaronovitch as Gan, Michael Praed, Doug Bradley and India Fisher. The new series was broadcast by BBC Radio 7 and repeated during mid-2010 as three one-hour episodes: \"Rebel\" (written by Ben Aaronovitch), \"Traitor\" (Marc Platt) and \"Liberator\" (James Swallow). B7 Productions also produced series of 30-minute prequel audio episodes named \"Blake's 7: The Early Years\", which explored the earlier histories of the central characters.\nDuring 2011 Big Finish Productions, under licence from B7 Productions, announced that it would be producing a series of audio dramas named \"Blake's 7: The Liberator Chronicles\", which would be \"\u00a0... a series of exciting, character-driven tales that remain true to the original TV series. We're aiming for authenticity\u2014recreating the wonder of 1978 all over again!\" The company also said it would publish a series of \"Blake's 7\" novels at a rate of two per year. During January 2013 Big Finish released an initial full-cast audio production, Warship. This was followed during January 2014 with a series of six full-cast single-disc original stories, with a second series starting in November 2014.\nSeveral individuals and companies have produced unofficial material based upon Blake's 7. Alan Stevens, later of Magic Bullet Productions, produced three unofficial audio cassettes between 1991 and 1998: \"Travis: The Final Act\", \"The Mark of Kane\" and \"The Logic of Empire\". Stevens also produced a series of audio dramas named \"Kaldor City\", created by Chris Boucher, which link the \"Blake's 7\" universe into Boucher's \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Robots of Death\" through the character Carnell (Scott Fredericks), whom Boucher created for the \"Blake's 7\" episode \"Weapon\".\nTelevision.\nDuring April 2000 producer Andrew Mark Sewell announced that he had bought the rights to \"Blake's 7\" from the estate of Terry Nation, and was planning to produce a TV movie set 20 years after the finale of the original series. During July 2003, Sewell announced that he, Paul Darrow and Simon Moorhead had formed a consortium called 'B7 Enterprises' that had acquired the rights and was planning a television miniseries budgeted at between five and six million U.S. dollars. Darrow would play Avon and the series was to be televised during early 2005, depending on \"\u00a0... many factors, not least financing\". Paul Darrow subsequently left the project during December 2003, citing \"artistic differences\".\nB7 Enterprises announced on 31 October 2005 that it had appointed Drew Kaza as non-executive chairman, and that it was working on two \"Blake's 7\" projects. \"Blake's 7: Legacy\" was to be a two-part, three-hour mini-series, which would be written by Ben Aaronovitch and D. Dominic Devine. \"Blake's 7: The Animated Adventures\" was to be a 26-part children's animated adventure series written by Aaronovitch, Andrew Cartmel, Marc Platt and James Swallow.\nIn an interview with \"Doctor Who Magazine\", writer and producer Matthew Graham said that he had been involved in discussions to revive \"Blake's 7\". Graham's concept was that a group of young rebels would rescue Avon, who had been kept cryogenically frozen by Servalan, and then roam the galaxy in a new ship named \"Liberator\".\nOn 24 April 2008, television station Sky1 announced that it had commissioned two 60-minute scripts for a potential series, working alongside B7 Productions. On 4 August 2010, the station said it had decided not to commission the series. B7 Productions said the decision was \"\u00a0... obviously disappointing\", but that the development process has resulted in the \"\u00a0... dynamic reinvention of this branded series\". It said it was confident it would find another partner to develop a new version of \"Blake's 7\" for television.\nDuring July 2012, \"Deadline\" reported that a remake for US television networks was being developed by the independent studio Georgeville Television. The Syfy network announced on 22 August that Joe Pokaski would develop the script and Martin Campbell would direct the new remake.\nOn 9 April 2013, the BBC reported that a new series of \"Blake's 7\" would be broadcast by SyFy. Other media reported that a full-series order of thirteen episodes had been placed. Again, however, no new series materialised.\nMerchandise.\nTerry Nation had done well financially from commercial exploitation of the \"Doctor Who\" Daleks, and recognised the potential for merchandise related to \"Blake's 7\". Nation and his agent Roger Hancock discussed this with Ray Williams of BBC Merchandising in December 1976. By May 1977, twenty-seven items of merchandise had been proposed for release by companies including Palitoy, Letraset and Airfix. However, only a small quantity of these was ever made available.\nA small number of toys and models were produced. During 1978, Corgi Toys produced a die-cast model of \"Liberator\" with a transparent rear globe. This was re-released the following year in silver with a model space shuttle, and in blue on its own. Also during 1979, Blue Box Toys produced three space vehicle toys that featured the series logo; however, these had never appeared in the television programme. Comet Miniatures produced a injection-moulded model kit of \"Liberator\" in 1989, which contained many parts. They also produced a two-inch, white metallic \"Liberator\" model, and a three-inch Federation trooper figure. A \"Scorpio\" clip gun, and \"Liberator\" and \"Scorpio\" teleport bracelets, were also produced.\nThe children's programme \"Blue Peter\" offered a cheaper home-made alternative to fans who wanted merchandise. In its 23 February 1978 show, presenter Lesley Judd demonstrated how to create a replica \"Liberator\" teleport bracelet from common household objects. This was followed on 6 June 1983, when presenter Janet Ellis demonstrated a similar method of making a replica \"Scorpio\" bracelet.\nMusic.\nThe sheet music of the \"Blake's 7\" theme was published by Chappell &amp; Co. Ltd during 1978 with a photograph of \"Liberator\" on the front cover. A stereo re-recording of Dudley Simpson's theme music, in a markedly different arrangement to the original, was also released as a single, with \"The Federation March\" (a piece of incidental music from the episode \"Redemption\") on the B-side. The \"Blake's 7\" theme was also released on an album \"BBC Space Themes\", and \"Liberator\" was featured on the album sleeve. Another version of the theme, \"Blake's 7 Disco\", was recorded by Federation and released during 1979 on Beeb Records with a B-side unconnected with the series. Many of the sound effects from the series were released during 1981 as an album, \"\", and re-released later on CD as \"Essential Science Fiction Sound Effects Vol. 1\".\nBooks and magazines.\n\"Blake's 7\" books were produced by various authors and publishers. The first was entitled \"Blake's 7\", written by Trevor Hoyle and Terry Nation, and published during 1978 (novelising the first-series episodes \"The Way Back\", \"Space Fall\", \"Cygnus Alpha\" and \"Time Squad\"). Its US title was \"Blake's 7\u00a0\u2013 Their First Adventure\". Hoyle wrote two more books of the series: \"Blake's 7: Project Avalon\" (1979, novelising the episodes \"Seek\u2013Locate\u2013Destroy\", \"Duel\", \"Project Avalon\", \"Deliverance\" and \"Orac\" from the first series) and \"Blake's 7: Scorpio Attack\" (1981, novelising the episodes \"Rescue\", \"Traitor\" and \"Stardrive\" from the fourth series). Publications continued to be issued after the series had ended. Tony Attwood's \"Blake's 7: The Programme Guide\", published by Target during 1982, is a factual overview of the series with a detailed episode guide, an encyclopedia, and interviews with the cast and writers. It was re-issued by Virgin Books during 1994. Attwood also wrote an original novel named \"Afterlife\", which is set after the final episode and was published by Target during 1984. Another original novel, \"\" by Paul Darrow, told the story of Avon's early years before he met Blake, and was published during 1989.\nWorld Distributors produced \"Blake's 7 Annuals\" for 1979, 1980 and 1981. These featured stories, games, artwork and articles about space. During October 1981 Marvel UK began publishing the monthly \"Blake's 7\" magazine, which included a comic strip by Ian Kennedy as well as text stories, features and photographs. Twenty-five issues including two 'specials' were published, until the magazine closed during August 1983. Marvel produced two 'special' magazines during 1994 and 1995, with much of the content written by television historian Andrew Pixley and about how the series was made. Seven issues of \"Blake's 7 Poster Magazine\" were published between December 1994 and May 1995.\nSeveral books offering insight and background information to \"Blake's 7\" were produced, including \"Blake's 7: The Complete Guide\" by Adrian Rigelsford (Boxtree, 1995), \"Blake's 7: The Inside Story\" by Joe Nazzaro and Sheelagh Wells (Virgin, 1997), \"A History and Critical Analysis of Blake's 7\" by John Kenneth Muir (McFarland and Company, 1999), and \"Liberation. The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Blake's 7\" by Alan Stevens and Fiona Moore (Telos, 2003).\nHome video releases.\nDuring 1985 BBC Video issued four compilation videocassettes containing highlights from the first three series edited into 2 hour features. The first released was \"The Beginning\", containing excerpts from \"The Way Back\", \"Spacefall\", \"Cygnus Alpha\" and \"Time Squad\". \"Duel\" was released in 1986 with highlights of \"Seek\u2013Locate\u2013Destroy\", \"Duel\" and \"Project Avalon\". During the same year \"Orac\" was released, containing excerpts from \"Deliverance\", \"Orac\" and \"Redemption\". The first three tapes were available in both VHS and Betamax format. The final tape, \"The Aftermath,\" was released in Australia during 1986, with extracts from \"Aftermath\", \"Powerplay\" and \"Sarcophagus\". During 1990 all four tapes were re-released in the UK on VHS.&lt;ref name=\"B7 Programme Guide/Merchandise\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nFrom 1991, BBC Video released \"Blake's 7\" in episodic order on 26 VHS cassettes with two episodes per tape. Canadian company BFS also released these in North America. During 1997, Fabulous Films company re-released these tapes in different packaging. The BBC and Fabulous Films planned to issue the series as four DVD box sets, but this was disrupted by conflicts with rights-holders B7 Enterprises. These issues were resolved and one series per year was released on region 2 DVD between 2003 and 2006. During 2007 Amazon sold a four-series box set, but a casualty of the difficulties with Blake's 7 Enterprises was \"The Making of Blake's 7\", a four-part documentary directed by Kevin Davies, intended originally as an extra feature with each DVD release. B7 Enterprises said it \"\u00a0... did not feel [the documentary] provided a proper tribute or fresh retrospective of the show\". The discs contained extra features including bloopers, out-takes, alternative scenes, voiceover commentaries, interviews and behind the scenes footage.\nOn 22 August 2024, the BBC announced it would be releasing \"Blake's 7: The Collection \u2013 Series 1\", a Blu-ray box set containing the entire first series newly remastered for the release. The set contains bonus features previously seen on the DVD release of the show alongside brand new bonus material, such as optional updated special effects on all 13 episodes, a feature-length documentary detailing the making of the first series, rare convention footage and the previous unreleased \"The Making of Blake's 7 documentary\" originally meant for the DVD release. The box set was released on 11 November 2024.\nGaming.\nA retro point-and-click adventure game was developed in 2017 for the Oric platform, paying homage to the \"Blake's 7\" TV series, and is available as a free download.\nStreaming.\nOn Thursday 10 September 2020, \"Blake's 7\" was released on the UK streaming service BritBox.

His brother was Bishop Otto of Belley. Humbert is the progenitor of the dynasty known as the House of Savoy. The origins of this dynasty are unknown, but Humbert's ancestors are variously said to have come from Saxony, Burgundy or Provence. Given Humbert's close connections with Rudolf III of Burgundy, it is likely that his family was Burgundian, and was descended either from the dukes of Vienne, or from a Burgundian aristocratic family (such as the Guigonids, ancestors of the counts of Albon). It is also likely that Humbert was related to Ermengarde of Burgundy, second wife of Rudolf III.\nHumbert initially held lands around Belley and in the county of Sermorens, before gaining lands in Aosta and Valais.\nHumbert and the empire.\nAfter Rudolf III's death (1032), Humbert I swore fealty to Emperor Conrad II. He supported Conrad II in his campaigns against Odo II, Count of Blois, and Aribert, Archbishop of Milan. In return, Conrad II appointed Humbert count of Savoy and granted him Maurienne, Chablais and perhaps Tarentaise. These imperial grants to a loyal supporter secured key passes through the Alps, controlling trade between Italy and Western Europe, which would be the core of Savoy power for centuries.\nMarriage and children.\nHumbert married Ancelie (Auxilia or Ancilia). She may have been Ancilla of Aoste, the daughter of \"vir illustris\" Anselme of Aoste or Ancilla of Lenzburg, the daughter of the master of ceremonies of Burgundy. Alternatively, Ancilla may have been a daughter of Anselm and Aldiud, and thus a member of a northern Italian dynasty known as the Anselmids.\nWith his wife, Humbert had at least four sons:\nSome authors believe that he had additional sons.\nDeath.\nHumbert is often said to have died c. 1047/8 at Hermillon, a town in the Maurienne region of present-day Savoie, France. In the 21st century, it has been suggested that he died by 1042.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The earliest rulers in traditional Chinese historiography are of mythological origin, and followed by the Xia dynasty of highly uncertain and contested historicity. During the subsequent Shang (c.\u20091600\u20131046 BCE) and Zhou (1046\u2013256 BCE) dynasties, rulers were referred to as \"Wang\" , meaning king. China was fully united for the first time by Qin Shi Huang (r.259\u2013210 BCE), who established the first Imperial dynasty, adopting the title \"Huangdi\" (), meaning Emperor, which remained in use until the Imperial system's fall in 1912.\nAt no point during Ancient or Imperial China was there a formalized means to confer legitimate succession between rulers. From the Zhou dynasty onwards, monarchs justified their reigns by claiming the Mandate of Heaven (; \"Ti\u0101nm\u00ecng\"). The mandate held that a ruler and their successors had permission from the heavens to rule as long as they did so effectively. It also declared a ruler the Son of Heaven (; \"Ti\u0101nz\u01d0\"), giving them the right to rule \"all under heaven\" (; \"Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0\"). Given the Mandate's subjective nature, rulers also utilized a variety of methods to retain support and justify their accession. This ranged from military enforcement, political patronage, establishing peace and solidity, institutional reform, and historical revisionism to legitimize the dissolution of previous dynasties and their own succession. For most of Imperial China, the \"wuxing\" (; \"Five Elements\") philosophical scheme was also central to justify dynastic succession.\nMost Chinese monarchs had many names. They were given a personal name (; \"M\u00edngzi\") at birth, but later referred to by a posthumous name (; \"Sh\u00ech\u00e0o\")\u2014which memorialized their accomplishments or character\u2014due to a cultural naming taboo. Most emperors of the Imperial period also received a temple name (; \"Mi\u00e0oh\u00e0o\"), used to venerate them in ancestor worship. From the rule of Emperor Wu of Han (r.141\u201387 BCE) onwards, emperors also adopted one or several era names (; \"Ni\u00e1nh\u00e0o\"), or \"reign mottos\", to divide their rule by important events or accomplishments. Ming (1368\u20131644) and Qing (1644\u20131912) rulers are referred to solely by their era names, of which they only had one.\nApart from ethnic Han rulers, China was also ruled by various non-Han monarchs, including Jurchen, Khitan, Manchu, Mongol and Tangut and many others. To justify their reign, non-Han rulers sometimes aligned themselves with the Confucian sages or the \"Chakravarti\" of Chinese Buddhism. There are numerous lengthy periods where many competing kingdoms claimed the throne, many of whose legitimacy are still debated by scholars.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncient China.\nMythological rulers.\nIn traditional Chinese historiography, various models of mythological founding rulers exist. The relevancy of these figures to the earliest Chinese people is unknown, since most accounts of them were written from the Warring States period (c.\u2009475\u2013221 BCE) onwards. The sinologist Kwang-chih Chang has generalized the typical stages: \"the first period was populated by gods, the second by demigods/culture hero, and the third by the legendary kings.\" The primordial god Pangu is given by many texts as the earliest figure and is credited with forming the world by separating heaven and earth. Other gods include N\u00fcwa, who repaired heaven; Hou Yi, a mythical archer; and Gonggong, a serpent-like water deity.\nDemigod and hero rulers from hero myths\u2014the largest group Chinese myths\u2014are attributed the invention of specific items, practices or traditions. Among the more important of them are Fuxi, the inventor of hunting; Suiren, who invented fire; and Shennong, who invented both agriculture and medicine. The subsequent legendary kings began with the Yellow Emperor (), known as \"Huangdi\", a major culture hero of Chinese civilization whose reign was considered exemplary. Succeeding rulers include some combination of Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun. Since the late Warring States onwards, early Chinese monarchs have traditionally been ground into the concept of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors; however, the chosen figures of this grouping varies considerably between sources. Generally, most accounts include at least Fuxi and Shennong among the Three Sovereigns as well as the Yellow Emperor, Yao and Shun among the Five Emperors.\nXia dynasty.\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period was followed by the Xia dynasty in traditional historiography. Founded by Yu the Great, both the dynasty and its rulers are of highly uncertain and controversial historicity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0(&amp;num;) \u2013 Uncertain legitimacy\nShang dynasty (c. 1600\u20131046 BCE).\nUnlike the Xia, the Shang dynasty's historicity is firmly established, due to written records on divination objects known as Oracle bones. The oldest such oracle bones date to the Late Shang (c.\u20091250\u20141046 BCE), during the reign of Wu Ding (1250\u20131192), putting the exact details of earlier rulers into doubt.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0(&amp;num;) \u2013 Uncertain legitimacy\nEarly imperial China.\nHan and Xin dynasties (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0(&amp;num;) \u2013 contested legitimacy\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncient Era\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly Imperial Era\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSix Dynasties &amp; Mid Imperial Era\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLate Imperial Era\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66143", "revid": "940655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66143", "title": "Richard Hadlee", "text": "New Zealand cricketer (born 1951)\nSir Richard John Hadlee (born 3 July 1951) is a New Zealand former cricketer. Hadlee is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders in cricket history, and amongst the very finest fast bowlers.\nHadlee was appointed an MBE in the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours List and later knighted in the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to cricket. He is a former chairman of the New Zealand board of selectors. In December 2002, he was chosen by Wisden as the second greatest Test bowler of all time. In March 2009, Hadlee was commemorated as one of the Twelve Local Heroes, and a bronze bust of him was unveiled outside the Christchurch Arts Centre.\nOn 3 April 2009, Hadlee was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He is the most prominent member of the Hadlee cricket playing family.\nPersonal life.\nHadlee was born on 3 July 1951 at St Albans, Christchurch. His father Walter Hadlee, and two of his four brothers, Dayle and Barry, played cricket for New Zealand. His former wife Karen also played international cricket for New Zealand.\nHaving discovered that he had Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome six months after retiring, he had heart surgery in July 1991. Hadlee had the syndrome since birth and felt some of the effects like irregular heartbeat during his career. Hadlee continues to lead an active life and works with the Heart Foundation.\nIn June 2018, Hadlee was diagnosed with bowel cancer and underwent tumour removal surgery.\nTest career.\nAn all-rounder who was primarily a bowler, in an 86-Test career he took 431 wickets (at the time the world record), and was the first bowler to pass 400 wickets, with an average of 22.29, and made 3124 Test runs at 27.16, including two centuries and 15 fifties.\nHadlee is rated by many experts as the greatest exponent of bowling with the new ball. He was the master of (conventional) swing and was the original \"Sultan of Swing\". Hadlee was seen as one of the finest fast bowlers of his time, despite the contemporaneous presence during his playing career of extremely high quality players such as Dennis Lillee, Imran Khan, Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Kapil Dev, Ian Botham, Wasim Akram and Malcolm Marshall among others.\nAs one of the four top all-rounders of his time, (the others being Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Ian Botham) Hadlee had the best bowling average of the four, but the lowest batting average.\nBorn in Christchurch, Hadlee made his first class debut for Canterbury in 1971/72 and his Test match debut in 1973 \u2013 on both occasions, his first delivery was dispatched to the boundary. Hadlee was an inconsistent performer at Test level for several years; however a breakthrough performance against India in 1976 in which he took 11 wickets in a game resulting in a win by New Zealand cemented his place in the side. In 1978, Hadlee helped New Zealand to a historic first win over England by taking 6 for 26 in England's second innings, bowling the visitors out for 64 chasing a target of 137.\nIn 1979/80, New Zealand faced the West Indies in a home Test series at a time when the West Indies were a formidable world cricket power. In the first Test in Dunedin New Zealand achieved a shock 1-wicket win, helped by Hadlee's 11 wickets in the game. In the second Test, Hadlee scored his maiden Test century, helping New Zealand draw the Test and win the series 1\u20130. The result was the start of a 12-year unbeaten home record for New Zealand in Test match series. Hadlee was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket, in the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours.\nA tour to England in 1983 saw New Zealand register their first ever Test win on English soil, at Headingley. The match was remarkable for Hadlee's match return of 0 for 89, a very unusual occurrence in a New Zealand victory during his career. England eventually won the 4 Test series 3\u20131; however, Hadlee topped both batting and bowling averages for New Zealand in the series, and took his 200th Test wicket in the final Test at Nottingham. In the return Test series in New Zealand in 1984, New Zealand completed a remarkable three-day innings victory (including one day lost to rain) over England at Christchurch, in which England were dismissed for less than 100 in both of their innings. The match was also notable for Hadlee's superb all-round performance \u2013 he took 8 wickets in the match, and scored a rapid-fire 99 in New Zealand's only innings. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowling Rankings for the year 1984 (he retained it for the next 4 years, till 1988).\n1985/86 was the beginning of a period in which Hadlee developed from a very good fast bowler to a truly great one. In New Zealand's tour to Australia, an outstanding all-round performance helped destroy the home team in the first Test at Brisbane, beginning with a personal Test best 9 for 52 in Australia's first innings. A batting effort of 54 (to complement a fine 188 by Martin Crowe) combined with 6 more wickets in Australia's second innings, helped New Zealand to a crushing innings victory. Hadlee followed this up with 7 wickets in a loss in the second Test, and 11 wickets in a New Zealand victory in the third Test, giving his country their first series win on Australian soil and a personal haul of 33 wickets in 3 Tests. In the first Test of the return series in New Zealand, Hadlee took his 300th Test wicket by trapping Australian captain Allan Border LBW. The series was eventually won 2-1 by New Zealand by way of a victory in the third Test at Eden Park.\nIn 1986 Hadlee helped New Zealand to a 1\u20130 series win in England, their first over that country in England. Hadlee's outstanding personal performance in the second Test at Nottingham (his county 'home') where he took 10 wickets and scored 68 in New Zealand's first innings powered his team to victory. In this Test Hadlee, often a controversial character, added to this side of his reputation when he felled (and hospitalised) England wicketkeeper and Nottinghampshire teammate Bruce French with a nasty bouncer. During the New Zealand v West Indies Test at Christchurch in March 1987, Hadlee and captain Jeremy Coney had a disagreement in the dressing room prior to the game. It progressed to not talking to each other on the field, communicating through John Wright at mid-on.\nIn April 1987, New Zealand travelled to Sri Lanka where Hadlee recorded his second Test century. His 151 not out in the first Test helped New Zealand to save the game; however, the tour was cut short due to a bomb exploding near the New Zealand team's hotel in Colombo. The terrorist bomb responsible for killing 113 civilians was planted by the Tamil Tigers separatist movement and was not thought to be directed at the touring New Zealand cricket team. Nonetheless, the team voted overwhelmingly to return home after that one Test of the scheduled three-Test tour.\nHadlee's appetite for competition against Australia surfaced again in 1987/88, when in the third Test of a 3 match series in Australia he captured 10 wickets and nearly inspired New Zealand to an unlikely series-equalling victory. The Test ended with Australia's number eleven batsman Michael Whitney surviving a torrid last over bowled by an exhausted Hadlee. A wicket in that over would have given New Zealand victory, and Hadlee a world record 374th Test wicket, breaking current holder Ian Botham's record. In the following home series against England, the New Zealand public eagerly anticipated the wicket which would give Hadlee sole possession of the world record. However, Hadlee broke down injured on the first day of the first Test, and was forced to sit out the rest of the series. At an awards dinner at the end of the season, Australian commentator Richie Benaud, upon seeing Hadlee hobble up to the stage on crutches, said later that he thought Hadlee \"would never play cricket again.\"\nHowever, after a successful rehabilitation, the next opportunity for Hadlee to claim the Test wicket world record was against India in India in 1988. After touring India in 1976 Hadlee, plagued by stomach troubles, had decided never to play cricket there again, however the opportunity to make history was too strong a lure to pass up. He duly captured the record, and his 374th Test wicket, in the first Test of the series. In the second Test a 10 wicket haul helped New Zealand to a rare Test win in India, although the series was eventually lost 2\u20131.\nIn a home series against India in 1989/90, Hadlee become the first bowler in history to take 400 Test wickets when he dismissed Sanjay Manjrekar in the second innings of the first Test on his home ground in Christchurch, while a group of Old Boys from his former school sang their school song. Shortly after helping New Zealand to another Test victory over Australia at Wellington by taking his 100th first class 5 wicket haul in an innings, Hadlee announced that he would be retiring after the upcoming tour to England.\nShortly before the second Test of the England series at Lord's, the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours were announced and included Hadlee's appointment as a Knight Bachelor, for services to cricket. Hadlee was not invested with his knighthood until 4 October 1990 after the end of his final Test match on 10 July 1990, although he became Sir Richard upon the publication date of the Honours List. Lt.-Col. Sir Maharajkumar Dr. Vijayananda Gajapathi Raju (better known as the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram or Vizzy) was the only other person to be knighted for services to cricket while an active Test cricketer, in 1936. Unlike Hadlee however, Vizzy's knighthood was recognised for his administrative efforts in cricket rather than his achievements as a player. (Alastair Cook was subsequently knighted in 2019 while still a full-time first-class player, but shortly after his final Test match.) Due to most knighted cricketers being batsmen, Hadlee liked to joke that he was the first bowler to receive a knighthood since Sir Francis Drake. Hadlee celebrated the achievement by scoring 86 in New Zealand's first innings and winning the man of the match award. In the final Test of the series, Hadlee ended his Test career by taking 5 wickets in his final bowling performance, and taking a wicket with the final ball of his Test career.\nWhen his father Walter was asked to vote, for the 2000 edition of Wisden, for his choice of the five cricketers of the 20th century, he included Richard, confessing it was \"embarrassing nominating my own son... But there's a job to be done. I will cite the bare facts.\" He had considered Dennis Lillee for his selection, but found Richard's Test match performance put him marginally ahead. In total, Richard Hadlee received thirteen votes from the 100 electors, coming the equal tenth as player of the century.\nNottinghamshire career.\nFor Nottinghamshire, on often overgrassed Trent Bridge pitches, he gained some analyses that are remarkable in an era of covered pitches, notably his eight for 22 against Surrey in 1984. He represented Nottinghamshire between 1978 and 1987, but played only three full seasons due to injuries and Test calls. However, his bowling figures for those three seasons were quite remarkable:\nIn those three seasons he was voted the \"PCA Player of the Year\" by his peers of the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA). He won The Cricket Society \"Wetherall Award for the Leading All-Rounder in English First-Class Cricket\" in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1987.\nIn the 1984 county season, Hadlee completed a feat rare in the modern age by doing the county 'double' \u2013 scoring 1000 runs and taking 100 wickets in the same season. Hadlee, and his immediate successor at Nottinghamshire Franklyn Stephenson, are the only two players to achieve this feat in English county cricket since the number of county games per season was reduced in 1969. The runs component of the double included Hadlee's highest first class score, 210* in a victory over Middlesex at Lord's. In 1987, his swan song, he narrowly missed the double as Nottinghamshire won the County Championship as they had in 1981. Hadlee's contribution with ball and bat to both and their other triumphs was immense. They next won the championship in 2005 with fellow Kiwi Stephen Fleming in charge.\nCanterbury career.\nBecause of seasonal differences, Hadlee also played provincial cricket in New Zealand, representing Canterbury.\nThe now-demolished north stand of the earthquake-damaged AMI Stadium was named the Hadlee stand after both Richard Hadlee and other members of the Hadlee family who have made contributions to Canterbury and New Zealand cricket. The Chappell\u2013Hadlee Trophy in which New Zealand and Australia regularly compete in one-day matches is named after the Chappell family of Australia and the Hadlee family of New Zealand.\nHadlee was also a competent association football player, playing for southern league team Rangers A.F.C. in Christchurch.\nBowling style.\nHadlee was a right-arm pace bowler. Initially extremely fast as a young man, as the years progressed he shortened his run-up, gaining improved accuracy and considerable movement off the wicket and in the air. Perhaps his most potent delivery was the outswinger, which became his main weapon in the latter stages of his career.\nThe most influential person as Hadlee developed and through his career was Dennis Lillee, who he saw as the exemplar of the fast bowler. \"He was big, strong, fit, confident, aggressive, had marvelous skills, great technique, he intimidated the batsmen with sheer presence and of course he got you out!\" In tough situations in a game Hadlee would ask himself what Lillee would do in equivalent circumstances, and would strive to copy his determination. In his book \"Menace\", Lillee believed that determination was the greatest contribution to his success. Of Hadlee he considers him super skillful, the first true professional he saw in tests with serial away swingers on off stump with the occasional inswinger or cutter, the odd bouncer and a very rare yorker.\nHis economical action was notable for his close approach to the wicket at the bowler's end (to the point where he occasionally knocked the bails off in his approach), a line which meant he was able to trap many batsmen leg before wicket. He broke the Test-wicket taking record with his 374th wicket on 12 November 1988 in Bangalore, India. His 400th Test wicket was claimed on 4 February 1990, and with his final Test delivery, on 9 July 1990, he dismissed Devon Malcolm for a duck.\nBatting style.\nHadlee was an aggressive left-handed middle-order batsman. Though his record was not as strong against top international bowlers, he was effective at punishing lesser attacks. He finished his career scoring 15 Test fifties and two Test centuries, while for Nottinghamshire in 1984, 1986 and 1987 he averaged over 50 (only W.G. Grace and George Herbert Hirst have come comparably close to heading both batting and bowling averages in a season).\nThe Sir Richard Hadlee Sports Trust.\nIn August 1990, Hadlee established The Sir Richard Hadlee Sports Trust. It was opened to help sportsmen and women who were in situations of hardship to strive for success in their chosen sporting or cultural discipline. The criteria for the Sir Richard Hadlee Sports Trust are: the applicant must be under the age of 25, the applicant must be from the region of Canterbury New Zealand, the request for assistance is specifically for sporting or cultural purposes and applicant is disadvantaged, facing hardship or has special circumstances which prevent him or her from pursuing his or her sporting or cultural endeavors. The Sir Richard Hadlee Sports Trust relies on the generosity of the community, as well as its corporate sponsors CTV, Lion Nathan, Newstalk ZB, Pernod Ricard, Pope Print, PR South and Vbase.\nInternational record and awards.\nSporting awards.\nHadlee has received many awards throughout his career, including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This identification was rejected early in the 21st century by the historian Clare Downham, who has argued that later Norse writers synthesized the two Erics, possibly using English sources. This argument, though respected by other historians in the area, has not produced consensus.\nContemporary or near-contemporary sources include different recensions of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", Eric's coinage, the \"Life \"of St Cathr\u00f3e, and possibly skaldic poetry. Such sources reproduce only a hazy image of Eric's activities in Anglo-Saxon England.\nStrikingly, Eric's historical obscurity stands in sharp contrast to the wealth of legendary depictions in the kings' sagas, in which he takes part in the sagas of his father Harald Fairhair and his younger half-brother Haakon the Good. These include the late 12th-century Norwegian synoptics\u00a0\u2013 \"Historia Norwegi\u00e6 \"(perhaps \"c\". 1170), Theodoricus monachus' \"Historia de antiquitate regum Norwagiensium\" (\"c\". 1180), and \"\u00c1grip af N\u00f3regskonungas\u00f6gum\" (\"c\". 1190) \u2013 and the later Icelandic kings' sagas \"Orkneyinga saga\" (\"c\". 1200), \"Fagrskinna\" (\"c\". 1225), the \"Heimskringla\" ascribed to Snorri Sturluson (\"c\". 1230), \"Egils saga\" (1220\u20131240), and \"\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta\" (\"c\". 1300). Exactly in what sense the Eric of the sagas may have been based on the historical Eric of Northumbria, and conversely, to what extent later evidence might be called upon to shed light on the historical figure, are matters which have inspired a variety of approaches and suggestions among generations of historians. Current opinion veers towards a more critical attitude towards the use of sagas as historical sources for the period before the 11th century, but conclusive answers cannot be offered.\nEpithet.\nEric's soubriquet \"bl\u00f3\u00f0\u00f8x\", \u2018Bloodaxe\u2019 or 'Bloody-axe', is of uncertain origin and context. It is arguable whether its preservation in two \"lausav\u00edsur\" by Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson and a contemporary skald genuinely dates to the 10th century or had been inserted at some stage when Eric was becoming the focus of legend. There is no guarantee that it significantly predates the 12th-century narrative tradition, where it is first attached to him in \"\u00c1grip\" and in Latin translation as \"sanguinea securis\" in the \"Historia Norwegi\u00e6.\" The sagas usually explain it as referring to Eric's slaying of his half-brothers in a ruthless struggle to monopolise his rule over Norway; Theodoricus gives the similar nickname \"fratrum interfector\" (\"killer of brothers\" or \"brother-bane\"). \"Fagrskinna\", on the other hand, ascribes it to Eric's violent reputation as a Viking raider.\nFamily background.\nFather.\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (MS E) describes Eric laconically as \u2018Harold\u2019s son\u2019 (\"Haroldes sunu\"). In the early part of the 12th century, John of Worcester had reason to believe that Eric (\"Yrcus\") was of royal Scandinavian stock (\"Danica stirpe progenitum\", a phrase used earlier for the Hiberno-Norse ruler of Northumbria, Sihtric C\u00e1ech).\nThis appears to match with independent tradition from Norwegian synoptic histories and Icelandic sagas, which are explicit in identifying Eric of Northumbria as a son of the Norwegian king Harald (I) Fairhair. The skaldic poems ascribed to Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson may offer further reassurance that the sagas are on the right track, although doubts have been expressed about the date and integrity of the verses in the form in which they have survived. One of Egill's \"lausav\u00edsur\" speaks of an encounter in England with a man of \"Harald's line\" (\"Haralds \u00e1ttar\"), while the \"Arinbjarnarkvi\u00f0a\" envisages a ruler at York (J\u00f3rvik) who is a descendant of Halfd\u00e1n (\"Halfdanar\") and of the Yngling dynasty (\"ynglings burar\"). If genuine, the latter identification would form the only direct clue in the contemporary record which might link Eric with the Norwegian dynasty.\nAnother Harald known from this period is Aralt mac Sitric (d. 940), king of Limerick, the probable father of Maccus and Gofraid. This may be relevant, since both these brothers and a certain Eric have been described as rulers of 'the Isles' (Hebrides) (see below). In a letter addressed to Pope Boniface VIII, King Edward I (r. 1272\u20131307) remembered a certain Eric (\"Yricius\") as having been a king of Scotland subject to the English king.\nIn the 19th century, a case had also been made for Harald Bluetooth King of Denmark (d. 985) as being Eric's true father. J.M. Lappenberg and Charles Plummer, for instance, identified Eric with Harald's son Hiring. The only authority for this son's existence is Adam of Bremen, who in his \"Gesta\" (\"c\". 1070) claims to cite the otherwise unknown \"Gesta Anglorum\" for a remarkable anecdote about Hiring's foreign adventures: \"Harald sent his son Hiring to England with an army. When the latter had subjugated the island, he was in the end betrayed and killed by the Northumbrians.\" Even if Eric's rise and fall had been the inspiration for the story, the names are not identical and Harald Bluetooth's \"floruit\" does not sit well with Eric's.\nA brother?\nIn the account cited in the Latin text of the North Sagas entitled, \"Morte Rex Eilricus\" (The death of King Eirikr) which had been copied long ago from the annals of the lost York Chronicles, the author provides the details of the events leading to Eric (Eirikr or Eirik) Bloodaxe's death \"fraudulently, treacherously betrayed by Earl Osulfus\" (Osulf, Earl of Bamburg) \"...\u00a0was killed by Earl Maccus\u00a0... at the Battle of Steinmor\u00a0... and there fell Eirikr, with his sons and brothers and all his army\u00a0... and his brother Reginaldus [Latin for Ragnald or Ragnvald] ... His son was also known as: Henricus or Haericus [Latin form] and brother as Ragnald or Reginaldus [Latin form] ... together with his son Henricus\" whom the commentator Michael Wood in 1981 documentary TV series \"In Search of the Dark Ages\" (in the episode \"In Search of Eric Bloodaxe\") identifies as 'Har\u00e9kr' (from the Latin \"Haeric\" or \"Henricus\" or \"Haericus\") \"and brother Ragnald\" (from the Latin \"Reginaldus\"). Historians have been struck by the correspondence with these names in \"Fagrskinna\", which says two of the kings who died with Eric in his final battle against Osulf (Olaf) were called Har\u00e9kr and Ragnvald, although they are not identified as relatives there they certainly are identified as his son (\"cum filio\" \u2013 meaning: 'with his son') and his brother ( \u2013 meaning: 'and [his] brother') in the North Sagas.\nMother and half-brothers (sagas).\nFurther details on his family background are provided solely by the Icelandic and Norwegian sources of the 12th and 13th centuries, which are of limited and uncertain historical value and should therefore be treated with due circumspection. Harald 'Fairhair' is usually portrayed as a polygamous and virile king, the number of his sons varying between 16 and 20. While Eric's mother remains anonymous in the synoptic histories (\"\u00c1grip\") and most of the Icelandic sagas, the \"Heimskringla\" (\"c\". 1230) claims that she was Ragnhildr, daughter of Eric, king of (South) Jutland. The possibility that Harald had married a Danish princess may find some support in a skaldic stanza which is usually assigned to \u00deorbj\u00f6rn Hornklofi's \"Hrafnsm\u00e1l\", a eulogy on Harald's deeds in the form of a conversation between a raven and valkyrie. It tells that Harald \"chose the lady from Denmark [\"konu danska\"] / broke with his Rogaland loves / and his lemans of Horthaland, / the maidens of H\u00e1logaland / and of Hathaland eke.\" In the \"Flateyjarb\u00f3k\", it is preceded by another stanza which refers to the \"handmaidens of Ragnhildr\" (\"amb\u00e1ttir Ragnhildar\") as witnesses of the event. However, it is uncertain whether her name was already in the original composition, as another manuscript reading has the metrically regular \"amb\u00e1ttir Danskar\". The account of \"Heimskringla\", which claims that Harald had enjoyed the company of eleven consorts before Ragnhildr, and that of \"Egils saga\" are at variance with the suggestion elsewhere that Eric was one of the oldest (\"Fagrskinna\"), if not the eldest son of Harald (\"Historia Norwegi\u00e6\", \"\u00c1grip\"). Whatever one makes of the discrepancy, the sagas \u2013 including \"Heimskringla\"\u00a0\u2013 are unanimous in making Haakon Eric's younger half-brother and successor.\nEarly career (sagas).\nAccording to \"Heimskringla\" and \"Egils saga\", Eric spent much of his childhood in fosterage with the \"hersir\" Th\u00f3rir son of Hr\u00f3ald. Of his adolescent years, a remarkable picture is painted in \"Heimskringla,\" which recounts that Eric, aged twelve and seemingly possessed of prodigious valour and strength, embarked on a career of international piracy: four years were spent harrying the Baltic coasts and those of Denmark, Frisia and Germany ('Saxland'); another four years those of Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France; and lastly, Lappland and Bjarmaland (in what is now northern Russia). Describing the last trip, \"Egils saga\" notes that Eric sailed up the Dvina River into the Russian hinterland of Permia, where he sacked the small trading port of Permina.\nMarriage.\nThe \"Life of St Cathr\u00f3e of Metz\", written \"c\". 1000 at the latest and therefore of near contemporary value, has information about Eric and his wife. It relates that \"after keeping him for some time\", the King of the Cumbrians conducted Cathr\u00f3e to \"Loidam Civitatem\", the boundary between the \"Normanni\" (\"Scandinavians\") and the \"Cumbri\" (\"Britons\"):\nAnd there he was received by a certain nobleman, Gunderic, by whom he was led to king \"Erichius\" in the town of York, because this king had as wife a relative of the godly Cathr\u00f3e\nGiven what is known of Cathr\u00f3e's own background, this probably means that she was of British (\"Cumbrian\") or Scottish descent. This contradicts to some extent later saga tradition. According to the early 13th century \"Egils saga\", Eric's consort at York was Gunnhild, the famous \"mother of kings\". This account was constructed by the author of \"Egils saga\" using an earlier poem called \"Arinbjarnarkvi\u00f0a\" \"Lay of Arinbj\u00f6rn\", and this poem does not mention Gunnhild by name, implying therefore that the name was introduced by the author of \"Egils saga\".\nSaga tradition is, however, unanimous that Eric did cohabit with a woman named Gunnhild. Her name occurs in a handful of Egill's \"lausav\u00edsur\". The earliest saga, \"Historia Norwegi\u00e6\", describes her as the daughter of Gorm inn Gamli (\u2018the Old\u2019), king of Denmark (and hence a sister of Harald Bluetooth). Most subsequent accounts name her father Ozur, nicknamed either Toti \"teat\" (\"Egils saga, Fagrskinna\", \"Heimskringla\") or lafskegg \"dangling beard\" (\"\u00c1grip\", \"Fagrskinna\"), a man who hailed from the northern province of H\u00e5logaland (\"Egils saga\", \"Heimskringla\"). Icelandic hostility towards Gunnhild has been cited as a possible source for her dissociation from the Danish royal house.\nThere is no consensus on how to solve this problem. An early suggestion is that the name for the king in York in the \"Life \"of Cathr\u00f3e has been erroneously supplanted for Eric's predecessor Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n (Olaf Sihtricsson), whose (second) wife D\u00fanflaith was an Irishwoman. Recently, Clare Downham has suggested that \"Erichius\", Eric of Northumbria, is not the same as Eric Bloodaxe. And there remains the possibility that he was not strictly monogamous, and the existence of two wives need not be mutually exclusive.\nKing of Norway (sagas).\nThe dominant theme of the sagas about Harald's numerous sons is the struggle for the Norwegian throne, in particular the way it manifests itself in the careers of Haakon and his foil Eric. According to \"Heimskringla\", Harald had appointed his sons as client kings over the various districts of the kingdom, and intended Eric, his favourite son, to inherit the throne after his death. At strife with his half-brothers, Eric brutally killed Ragnvald (R\u00f6gnvaldr), ruler of Hadeland on his father's orders, and Bj\u00f8rn Farmann, ruler of Vestfold. Some texts maintain that towards the end of his life, Harald allowed Eric to reign together with him (\"Heimskringla\", \"\u00c1grip\", \"Fagrskinna\")\".\" When Harald died, Eric succeeded to the realm, slaughtered the combined forces of his half-brothers Olaf and Sigr\u00f8d, and gained full control of Norway. At the time, however, Eric's younger and most famous half-brother Haakon, often nicknamed \"A\u00f0alsteinsf\u00f3stri\", had been staying at the West-Saxon court, having been sent there to be reared as fosterson to King \u00c6thelstan (r. 924\u2013939). Eric's rule was reputedly harsh and despotic and so he fell rapidly out of favour with the Norwegian nobility. At this propitious time, Haakon returned to Norway, found a nobility eager to accept him as king instead and ousted Eric, who fled to Britain. \"Heimskringla\" specifies that Haakon owed his success in large part to Sigurd, earl of Lade.\nDetermining the date and length of Eric's reign (before and after his father's death) is a challenging and perhaps impossible task based on the confused chronology of our late sources. It is also unfortunate that no contemporary or even near contemporary record survives for Eric's short-lived rule in Norway, if it is historical at all.\nJarls of Orkney (sagas).\nThe Norse sagas differ in the way they treat the manner and route by which Eric first came to Britain after he was forced out of Norway. The synoptic histories offer the most concise accounts. Theodoricus goes straight for Eric's arrival in England, his welcome there by King \u00c6thelstan, his brief rule and his death soon afterwards. Similarly, the \"Historia Norwegi\u00e6\" makes him flee directly to England, where he was received by his half-brother Haakon, baptised and given charge of Northumbria by \u00c6thelstan. When Eric's rule became intolerable, he was driven out and slain on an expedition in Spain. \"\u00c1grip\" tells that he came to Denmark first. According to \"Historia Norwegi\u00e6\", it would have been his wife's native country and hence a power base where he might have expected to muster some support, but the text makes no such claims.\nHowever, later sagas greatly expand upon Eric's activities in the interim between his reigns in Norway and Northumbria, claiming that he initially adopted a predatory lifestyle of raiding, whether or not he was aiming for a more political line of business in the longer run. The jarldom of Orkney, the former Viking base subjected and annexed by Eric's father, came to loom large in these stages of the literary development. \"Fagrskinna\" (\"c\". 1220) mentions his daughter Ragnhild and her marriage to an Orkney earl, here H\u00e1vard, but never describes Eric as actually stepping ashore. The \"Orkneyinga saga\", written \"c\". 1200, does speak of his presence in Orkney and his alliance with the joint jarls Arnkel and Erland, sons of Torf-Einarr, but not until his rule in Northumbria was challenged by Olaf (Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n). However, a number of later sagas such as the \"Separate Saga of St. Olaf\" (\"c\". 1225), \"Heimskringla\", \"Egils saga\" and \"\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta\" assert that he sailed directly to Orkney, where he took the joint jarls into vassalage, collected forces and so set up a base which enabled him to organise several expeditions in overseas territory. Named targets include Ireland, the Hebrides, Scotland and England. Eric sealed the alliance by giving his daughter Ragnhild in marriage to the future earl of Orkney, Arnfinn, son of Thorfinn Turf-Einarsson.\nKing of Northumbria.\nIt is when Eric gains the kingship in Northumbria that he finally steps more firmly into the historical limelight, even though the sources provide only scanty detail and present notorious problems of their own. The historical sources\u00a0\u2013 e.g., versions A-F of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", \"Historia regum\" and Roger of Wendover's \"Historia Anglorum\u00a0\u2013\" tend to be reticent and the chronology is confused. However, the best chronological guideline appears to be that offered by the Worcester Chronicle, i.e., the D-text of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\nThe Northumbria on which he set foot was one which had been bitterly fought over between the West-Saxon kings and the Hiberno-Norse line of descendants from \u00cdmair, kings of Dublin. The Northumbrians' own position in the middle of the struggle may have been complex and the outcome was variable, leading an unsympathetic historian like Henry of Huntingdon to judge harshly \"their usual faithlessness\" (\"solita infidelitas\").\nHistorical background.\n\u00c6thelstan.\nIn 927, having ejected Gofraid ua \u00cdmair from York, King \u00c6thelstan brought Northumbria under English control. His victory in the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, in which he and his half-brother Edmund defeated Gofraid's son King Olaf (III) Guthfrithson of Dublin, seems to have had the effect of consolidating his power. This impression is borne out by royal charters issued towards the end of his reign, between 937 and 939, which style \u00c6thelstan ruler over all Britain (e.g., or ).\nEdmund and the two Olafs.\nHowever, \u00c6thelstan died in 939 and his successor Edmund, only 18 years of age, was unable to retain control of Northumbria. In 939 or 940, almost as soon as Edmund had come to power, a new ruler of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasty had made York his seat. From Irish annals it is known that Edmund's old rival Olaf Guthfrithson left Dublin in 939 (\"Annals of the Four Masters\"), that in 940 his cousin, known in Ireland as Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n and in England as Olaf Sihtricsson, joined him in York (\"Annals of the Four Masters\", \"Annals of Clonmacnoise\") and that Olaf Guthfrithson died in 941 (\"Annals of Clonmacnoise\",\" Chronicon Scotorum\"), while the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (MS E) dates his death\u00a0\u2013 incorrectly it seems\u00a0\u2013 to 942. Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n succeeded him and did so with popular support, as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (MS D) reports that in 941, \"the Northumbrians belied their pledges, and chose Olaf [i.e., Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n] from Ireland as their king.\" Amla\u00edb shared the throne with his nephew Ragnald (R\u00f6gnvaldr), son of Gofraid. There are indications that Wulfstan, Archbishop of York and a leading statesman in Northumbrian politics, played a key role in Amla\u00edb's support, although he would later change his mind (see below). In 942 Edmund struck back with a recapture of Mercia and the Five Boroughs of Danelaw, which so impressed contemporaries that a poem was written in honour of the achievement and included in the \"Chronicle\". In response, Amla\u00edb launched a successful raid on Tamworth (Mercia), probably sometime later that year. However, in 943, when Amla\u00edb had marched on to Leicester, one of the Boroughs, he and Wulfstan were besieged by Edmund and managed to escape only by a hair's breadth. Peace negotiations followed later that year to the effect that Edmund accepted Amla\u00edb as an ally and as two northern sources add, ceded to him Northumbria as far south as Watling Street. Later, Edmund stood sponsor to him at baptism and to Ragnall at confirmation. In 944, however, Northumbria passed into West-Saxon hands again as Edmund drove out both Viking rulers. The chronicler \u00c6thelweard is clearer on the point of agency, writing that it was Wulfstan and the ealdorman () of the Mercians who deposed these 'deserters'\u00a0\u2013 perhaps born again pagans\u00a0\u2013 and forced them to submit to Edmund. The same year, Edmund raided Cumbria and entrusted it to Malcolm I of Scotland in exchange for support \"both on sea and on land\". The Irish annals report that in 945, Amla\u00edb was back in Dublin and an anonymous ruler at York, possibly Ragnald (R\u00f6gnvaldr), died. Edmund was described as in one of his charters, but did not live long enough to enjoy his renewed hold on the northern zone. He was killed in 946.\nEric's first reign (947/8\u2013948).\nWhen Eadred succeeded to the throne in 946, Northumbrian as well as Scottish loyalties had proved unstable, though nothing is known for certain of the ambitions of rival rulers at this stage. Eadred \"reduced all the land of Northumbria to his control; and the Scots granted him oaths that they would do all that he wanted.\" Moreover, in 947 he convened Archbishop Wulfstan and the Northumbrian witan at Tanshelf (now in Pontefract, West Yorkshire), on the boundary of the Humber (near an old Roman road), where they pledged their obedience to him. What perceived threat was being countered remains unclear, but English rule does not seem to have been very warmly received.\nIn any event, the \"Chronicle\" (MS D) notes that the Northumbrians soon violated their pledges and oaths (947) and records a definite outcome of their disloyalty in 948, by which time \"they had taken Eirik [\"Yryc\"] for their king\". That year, King Eadred harshly punished the northern defectors by launching a destructive raid on Northumbria, which notably included burning the Ripon minster founded by St Wilfrid. Although Eadred's forces had to sustain heavy losses in the Battle of Castleford (\"Ceaster forda\")\u00a0\u2013 near Tanshelf\u00a0\u2013 as they returned southwards, Eadred managed to check his rival by promising the latter's supporters even greater havoc if they did not desert Eric. The Northumbrians preferred to appease the English king, renounced Eric and paid compensation.\nThe Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records that shortly thereafter, in 948 or 949, Malcolm (I) of Scotland and Cumbria, at Constantine's instigation, raided Northumbria as far south as the River Tees and returned with many cattle and captives. Marios Costambeys suggests that it \"may have been directed against, or mounted in favour of, Eirik, though the protagonist could just as easily have been \u00d3l\u00e1f Sihtricson.\"\nEric's second reign (952\u2013954).\nEric's removal cleared the way for Amla\u00edb [Anlaf Cwiran], who having suffered defeat at Slane (Co. Meath, Ireland) in 947, returned to Northumbria and took the kingship, supposedly in 949, if the E-text is to be trusted. Eadred does not appear to have undertaken any significant action and may even have turned a blind eye on his brother's godson, or so at least the silence of the sources appears to suggest.\nThe E-text reports, however, that in 952, \"the Northumbrians drove out King Olaf and accepted Eric, son of Harold.\" The Annals of Ulster for the same year report a victory of the \"foreigners\", i.e., the Northmen or the Norse-Gaels, over \"the men of Scotland and the Welsh [\"Bretnu\", i.e., Britons of Strathclyde] and the Saxons.\" Exactly what this succinct account may tell us of his second rise to power, if anything, is frustratingly unclear. He may have led the Viking forces in a second bid for the throne, or only returned from the sideline to exploit the ravages of defeat. His reign proved once again of a short duration, since in 954 (a date on which MSS D and E agree), the Northumbrians expelled him, too.\nClare Downham notes the existence of an otherwise unrecorded \"Eltangerht\", whose coins were minted at York and date from about the same time, but nothing is known of him from other records.\nArchbishop Wulfstan and the charters.\nThe nature of Eric's relationship with Archbishop Wulfstan, the leading Northumbrian churchman who played such a decisive role in Amla\u00edb's career in the early 940s, remains tantalisingly unclear. One might assume that Wulfstan, given his political eminence, headed the Northumbrian party which elected Eric. It has likewise been suggested that Eadred's punitive attack on the ancient minster of Ripon, which carried little military weight, was targeted at Wulfstan in particular. In what sense his deposition in 948 may have affected the relationship in later years is more open to speculation.\nThe witness lists of Anglo-Saxon charters, which reveal when or not Wulfstan attended Eadred's court, in his own right or as a diplomat intermediating between two kings, have been used to provide a chronological framework for Wulfstan's swerving loyalties. Between 938 and 941, that is roughly between the Battle of Brunanburh (937) and the recovery of the Five Boroughs (942), the archbishop did not attest any royal charters, but he began to do so during or after the negotiations of 942. What the charters reveal for Eric's first reign is less clear-cut, but intermittent absence may explain gaps in the record for Wulfstan's attestations in the turbulent years 947\u2013948. Unfortunately, the critical period between 950 and 954 has produced comparatively few charters (owing perhaps to Eadred's deteriorating health), but what little there is may be instructive. Wulfstan is still seen at court in 950, but of the five charters which were issued in 951, not one was attested by him, which once again may imply his backing of Amla\u00edb. Eric's reign (952\u2013954) is more obscure. We do know, however, that in 952, the same year that Eric began his second term at York, Wulfstan was arrested and stood on trial in \"Iudanbyrig\" (unknown) on account of several unspecified allegations which had been repeatedly brought before Eadred. Of the few charters surviving for 953, Wulfstan attests one and by 955, after Eric's death, he was restored to office, but now with Dorchester rather than York as his episcopal seat. Clare Downham suggests that during this period, Wulfstan may have been pressured by King Eadred into relinquishing his support of Eric.\nCoinage.\nEric's Northumbrian rule is also corroborated by numismatic evidence. As of 3 February 2009, 31 coins minted at York had been found which bear the inscription of his name. These can be divided into two distinct types of issue: N549, in which the moneyer's name (reverse) is written horizontally and broken up in two, and N550, in which his name is inscribed around the edges and Eric's name (obverse) accompanied by a sword symbol (image above on the right). The two principal moneyers, Ingalger and Radulf, who had also minted coins for Amla\u00edb, occur on both types. The two types may correspond to his two reigns, but it is not out of the question that both were issued during a single reign.\n\"Life\" of St Cathr\u00f3e.\nEric's sudden appearance in the \"Chronicle\", first noted by the D-text, is a puzzling one, lacking any information as to how or why he emerged on the scene. As hinted above, the \"Life\" of the Scottish saint Cathr\u00f3e of Metz, written by a cleric (Reimann) who claimed to have been a former pupil of the saint, may possibly shed some light on his background. St Cathr\u00f3e, a Scottish saint with a Brythonic name, visited a certain King Eric (\"Erichus\") in York as he proceeded southwards from his native Strathclyde and Cumbria to \"Loida civitas\", sometimes identified as Leeds, on the boundary with Cumbria, ultimately intending to go to West France. This Eric was both settled and married, and may have been on good terms with his neighbours in the north-west, although the evidence is indirect and somewhat ambiguous: the saint claimed kinship not only with Eric's wife but also with Dyfnwal (III) (d. 975), king of Strathclyde and Cumbria (\"Donevaldus, rex Cumbrorum\"), which may point to an alliance of some kind between the two rulers. Based on internal evidence for the saint's itinerary, Cathr\u00f3e's stay is to be dated between 940 x 943, when Constantine (II) left the kingdom of Scotland to Malcolm (I), and 946, when Edmund was slain. The greatest obstacle to an identification of the Erics lies in the problem that the account would be difficult to square with the version of events presented by the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" and the assertion in royal charters that in 946, Edmund was still king of all Britain. It may be noted that the text's chronology has likewise presented some difficulties concerning the political status of Dyfnwal in the story (see main article there).\nKing of the Hebrides (\"Caithr\u00e9im Chellach\u00e1in Chaisil\").\nA further glimpse may be offered by the mid-12th-century Irish saga entitled \"Caithr\u00e9im Chellach\u00e1in Chaisil\", a text which was primarily designed to glorify the deeds of Cellach\u00e1n mac Buadach\u00e1in (d. 954), king of Munster, and hence his descendants, the Clann Fa\u00edlbe. In one of its poems, an \"Eric, King of the Islands\" (\"\u00c9iric Righ na n-Innse\"), meaning ruler of the Hebrides, is described as having allied himself to Sitriuc mac Tuirgeis, king of Dublin. Although the \"Caithr\u00e9im\" is hardly a work celebrated for its accuracy as a source of history, the distant memory of an Eric who ruled the Hebrides may not be fictitious. It may be a matter of coincidence that the next Vikings known to have ruled the Hebrides were also 'sons of Harold', Gofraid mac Arailt, \"ri Innsi Gall\" (d. 989), who was succeeded by his son Ragnall, \"r\u00ed na n-innsi\" (d. 1005), and probably Gofraid's brother Maccus mac Arailt, who is accorded the title \"king of very many islands\" ().\nDeath.\nThe \"Chronicle\" gives no explanation, but it seems as if the abdications of Amla\u00edb and Eric are described as essentially northern affairs, apparently without much (direct) West-Saxon intervention, let alone invasion. The historical accounts of Eric's death point to more complex circumstances, but Northumbrian politics are to the fore. Following a report on the invasion of Scotland by William I in 1072, the \"Historia regum\" attributed to Symeon of Durham recalls that Eric was driven out and slain by one Maccus son of Onlaf. The \"Flores historiarum\" (early 13th century) by Roger of Wendover is thought to have relied on a northern source now lost to us when it adds the following details:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nStainmore, traditionally in Westmorland and administratively in Cumbria, lies in the main pass through the northern Pennines, the Stainmore Pass or Gap, which marks the boundary between Cumbria in the west and modern Durham in the east. It is here that the mountains are traversed by an old Roman road\u00a0\u2013 more or less followed by the A66 today \u2013 leading from York to Catterick and north-westwards from Catterick (via Bowes, Stainmore, Brough, Appleby and Penrith) to Carlisle. Eric may therefore have followed by and large the same route that St Cathro\u00e9 had taken, except in the opposite direction, possibly with Strathclyde or the Hebrides as his intended destination.\nThe \"comes\" Osulf who betrayed Eric was high-reeve of the northern half of Northumbria, centred on Bamburgh, roughly corresponding to the former kingdom of Bernicia. He clearly benefited from his murderous plot against Eric. The \"Historia regum\" says that the province of Northumbria was henceforward administered by earls and records the formal appointment of Osulf as earl of Northumbria the following year. Likewise, the early 12th century \"De primo Saxonum adventu\" notes that \"[f]irst of the earls after Erik, the last king whom the Northumbrians had, Osulf administered under King Eadred all the provinces of the Northumbrians.\"\nBy contrast, the identity of Eric's slayer, the \"comes \"Maccus son of Anlaf, is unclear. His name may point to origins in a Norse-Gaelic family based in the Border country. While Anlaf (Middle Irish: \"Amla\u00edb\", Old Norse: \"\u00d3l\u00e1fr\") is a common Scandinavian and Norse-Gaelic name, Maccus, a Norse-Gaelic name of Middle Irish origin, is geographically more restricted and is particularly well attested in southern Scottish place-names. Based on Eric's confrontation with his predecessor \u00d3l\u00e1fr in \"Fagrskinna\", attempts have been made to connect Onlaf to Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n, but this must remain in the realm of speculation.\nEric's death receives a grander treatment in the synoptic histories and sagas. \"Fagrskinna\", apparently the \"Eir\u00edksm\u00e1l\" which it incorporates, and \"Heimskringla\" assert that Eric and five other kings died together in battle in an unnamed place in England. According to \"\u00c1grip\" and \"Historia Norwegi\u00e6\", Eric died on a foray in Spain after being forced out of Northumbria. Somewhat in line with the former version, earlier generations of scholars have envisaged the occasion of Eric's death on Stainmore to have been a last stand in battle. The view was espoused by W.G. Collingwood and later still by Frank Stenton, who speculates that Eric might have attempted to regain the kingdom or was fighting off pursuers. Finnur J\u00f3nsson re-interprets the alternative tradition in a historical light by proposing that \"Span-\" \"Spain\" in \"\u00c1grip\" goes back to a scribal confusion for \"Stan\"-, which in turn would have referred to Stainmore (OE *\"Stan\"). Having thus ascribed a historical core to the body of Scandinavian material, he in turn interprets the event as a battle.\nHowever, scholars today are usually less prepared to colour the sober records with details from the sagas, preferring to take the view that Eric was assassinated in exile. In sum then, it looks as if Eric, expelled and heading in a north-westerly direction (possibly in search of support), was about to cross over into Cumbria, when in a bid for power, his official Osulf had him killed through the agency of Maccus. Exactly what made this a betrayal (\"proditio\") in the eyes of the 10th century chronicler or those of Roger of Wendover, is unclear. It is unknown whether Osulf was also behind Eric's expulsion, despite being the main beneficiary, and whether he was expected to grant Eric safe passage and perhaps an escort to guide him safely through that part of Northumbria over which he (Osulf) had jurisdiction. It is equally obscure whether Maccus ambushed his victims, or was part of the escort, betraying them (\"fraudulenter\") as soon as he saw the opportunity.\n\"Eir\u00edksm\u00e1l\".\nTowards the end of its portrait of Eric, \"Fagrskinna\" cites the \"Eir\u00edksm\u00e1l\" (\"Lay of Eric\"), an anonymous panegyric written in commemoration of Eric's death and according to the saga's introduction, commissioned by his widow Gunnhild. Except for a single stanza in the Edda, the skaldic poem is preserved nowhere else and what has survived may represent only the opening stanzas.\nCast as a dialogue between Bragi, Odin, and fallen heroes, it tells of Eric's arrival in Valh\u00f6ll, accompanied by five other kings, and his splendid welcome there by Odin and his entourage. Odin had eagerly awaited his coming because \"many lands [...] / with his sword he has reddened\" and on being asked why he had deprived Eric of such earthly glory, answers that \"the future is uncertain\", since the grey wolf is always lying in wait. Eric is then greeted by the famous hero Sigmundr: \"Hail now, Eir\u00edkr [...] / here you shall be welcome; / brave hero, enter the hall.\"\nSome have argued that the language of the poem shows influence from Old English. However, on recently examining the poem, John McKinnell could find little trace of this. The (original) date of composition remains a matter of some debate: some argue that it was written shortly after Eric's death, while others who regard the poem as an imitation of the \"H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l\" in honour of Haakon the Good prefer a date sometime after Haakon's death, \"c\". 961.\nIn spite of the decidedly pagan contents of the poem, Eric may have died a Christian, as some of the sagas suggest. There is no evidence for his religious beliefs, but if ever Eric was to be accepted and consecrated as king, probably with Wulfstan as king-maker, acceptance of the Christian faith would have been set as a condition to royal office. The impression is borne out by Wulfstan's earlier removal of Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n and Ragnald on grounds that they had become, in \u00c6thelweard's words, \"deserti\" \"deserters\" (see above).\nIn support of this view, it has sometimes been suggested that the name of one \"Eiric rex Danorum\", \"Eric king of the Danes\", written into the Durham \"Liber Vitae\", f. 55v., may represent Eric of York. However, this can now be safely rejected in favour of an identification with Eric Ejegod (r. 1095\u20131103), whose queen Bodil (\"Botild\") occurs by name after him.\nRey Cross.\nOn the north side of the A66 in Stainmore today stands the so-called Rey cross, also known as Rere Cross, though what survives is little more than a stump consisting of the socket and a fragment of the shaft. Before it was temporarily housed at the Bowes Museum in 1990 and moved to its present location, it stood on a mound of rock a little further west on the south side of the road \u2013 coordinates: . The two sides of the shaft once seem to have borne carvings, if that much can be concluded from John Speed's supposed description in 1611. Based on stylistic observations made by W. G. Collingwood when certain features were apparently still visible, it has been described as an Anglo-Scandinavian cross, possibly of the 10th century. No burials have been found. All evidence seems to point to its use as a boundary marker (between Cumbria and Northumbria), much like the Legg's cross (County Durham) on Dere Street. The name has been explained as deriving from Old Norse \"hreyrr\", \"cairn\", or \"boundary cairn\". Towards the end of the 19th century, however, W. S. Calverley argued that whatever its function in later ages, crosses in those times were usually tombstones, whereas boundary crosses postdate the Conquest. In the absence of a churchyard, he tentatively links the erection of the Rey cross to the putative battle on Stainmore. Although he ultimately rejects the idea of a memorial stone for Eric as \"mere romance\", W. G. Collingwood was less prepared to dismiss it out of hand: \"a romancer might be justified in fancying that the Rey cross was carved and set up by Northumbrian admirers of the once mighty and long famous last King of York.\" No further evidence has been adduced to support the suggestion.\nReputation in the sagas.\nThe figure that Eric became in the Norse sagas is a heady mix of history, folklore, and political propaganda. He is usually portrayed as a larger-than-life Viking hero, whose powerful and violent performances bring him many short-term successes, but ultimately make him flawed and unpopular as a ruler and statesman. The \"Heimskringla\" describes Eric as \"a large and handsome man, strong and of great prowess, a great and victorious warrior\", but also \"violent of disposition, cruel, gruff, and taciturn\". The synoptic histories (Theodoricus, the \"Historia Norwegiae\", and \"\u00c1grip\") to some degree seek to excuse Eric's cruelty and fall from favour with the Norwegian nobility by pointing out another weakness, that of his naive faith in the evil counsels of his wife.\nConflict with Egill Skallagrimsson (\"Egils saga\").\nOne of the richest sagas to deal with Eric Bloodaxe and his affairs in England is \"Egils saga\", which is also a rich if problematic source for skaldic poems surviving from the 10th century. It tells how at the instigation of his wife Gunnhild, King Eric became involved in a prolonged conflict with Egill Skallagrimsson, the well-known Icelander Viking and skald. The account seems designed to enhance Egill's abilities as a warrior, wizard, and poet. The story can be summarised as follows.\nEgill had killed B\u00e1r\u00f0r of Atley, one of the king's retainers, thus making an enemy of Queen Gunnhild, who never forgave him and did everything within her power to take revenge. Gunnhild ordered her two brothers to kill Egil and Egill's older brother \u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfr, who had been on good terms with both her and the king before. However, this plan did not go well, as Egill easily killed the pair when they confronted him, greatly increasing the Queen's thirst for revenge. All that happened shortly before the death of Harald Fairhair and King Eric's killing of his brothers to secure his place on the throne. He then declared Egill an outlaw in Norway. Berg-\u00d6nundr gathered a company of men to capture Egill but was killed in his attempt to do so. Escaping from Norway, Egill killed Ragnald (R\u00f6gnvaldr Eirikssen), the king's son, and then cursed his parents, setting a horse's head on a pole (\"n\u00ed\u00f0st\u00f6ng\" or \"spite-post\") and saying,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Here I set up a pole of insult against King Eirik and Queen Gunnhild\" \u2013 then, turning the horse head towards the mainland \u2013 \"and I direct this insult against the guardian spirits of this land, so that every one of them shall go astray, neither to figure nor find their dwelling places until they have King Eirik and Queen Gunnhild from this country.\"\nHe set up the pole of spite in the cliff-face and left it standing; he faced the horse's eyes on the land, and he rist runes upon the pole, and said all the formal words of the curse. (\"n\u00ed\u00f0\" has been variously translated as \"scorn\", \"spite\" or \"curse\"). Gunnhild also put a spell on Egill, which made him feel restless and depressed until they met again. The last encounter happened when Erik and Gunnhild were living in England. Egill was shipwrecked on a nearby shore and came before Eric, who sentenced him to death. But Egill composed a dr\u00e1pa in Eric's praise in the dungeon during the night, and when he recited it in the morning, Eric gave him his freedom and forgave any vengeance or settlement for the killing of Ragnald.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was noted for his attempts to introduce Christianity into Norway.\nEarly life.\nHaakon is not mentioned in any narrative sources earlier than the late 12th century. According to this late saga tradition, Haakon was the youngest son of King Harald Fairhair and Thora Mosterstang. He was born on the H\u00e5konshella peninsula in Hordaland. King Harald determined to remove his youngest son out of harm's way and accordingly sent him to the court of King \u00c6thelstan. Haakon was fostered by King Athelstan, as part of an agreement made by his father, for which reason Haakon was nicknamed \"Adalsteinfostre\". According to the Sagas, Athelstan was tricked into fostering Haakon when Harald's envoy used the custom of kn\u00e9setja, whereby a child was formally adopted if it was set on the knees of the foster-parent. Becoming someone's foster-parent reportedly meant that they were subordinate to the child's parent.\nHaakon is not mentioned in any contemporary Anglo-Saxon sources, and later historians of Athelstan, such as William of Malmesbury, make no reference to Haakon. According to Norwegian royal biographies from the late 12th century, the English court introduced him to the Christian religion. On the news of his father's death, King Athelstan provided Haakon with ships and men for an expedition against his half-brother Eric Bloodaxe, who had been proclaimed king of Norway. \"Historia Norwegi\u00e6\" describes Haakon as an apostate who observed both pagan and Christian rites.\nReign.\nAt his arrival back in Norway, Haakon gained the support of the landowners by promising to give up the rights of taxation claimed by his father over inherited real property. Eric Bloodaxe soon found himself deserted on all sides, and saved his own and his family's lives by fleeing from the country. Eric fled to the Orkney Islands and later to the Kingdom of Jorvik, eventually meeting a violent death at Stainmore, Westmorland, in 954 along with his son, Haeric.\nIn 953, Haakon had to fight a fierce battle (\"Slaget p\u00e5 Blodeheia ved Avaldsnes\") at Avaldsnes against the sons of Eric Bloodaxe (\"Eirikss\u00f8nnene\"). Haakon won the battle, at which Eric's son Guttorm died. One of Haakon's most famous victories was the Battle of Rastarkalv (\"Slaget p\u00e5 Rastarkalv\") near Frei in 955 at which Eric's son, Gamle, died. By placing ten standards far apart along a low ridge, he gave the impression that his army was bigger than it actually was. He managed to fool Eric's sons into believing that they were outnumbered. The Danes fled and were slaughtered by Haakon's army. The sons of Eric returned in 957, with support from King Gorm the Old, King of Denmark, but were again defeated by Haakon's effective army system.\nSkaldic poems and the Icelandic sagas link the introduction of the lei\u00f0angr naval system in Norway to Haakon. Haakon may have emulated King \u00c6thelstan's naval system.\nSuccession.\nThree of the surviving sons of Eric Bloodaxe landed undetected on the coast of Hordaland in 961 and surprised the king at his residence in Fitjar. Haakon was mortally wounded at the Battle of Fitjar (\"Slaget ved Fitjar\") after a final victory over Eric's sons. The King's arm was pierced by an arrow and he died later from his wounds. He was buried in the burial mound (\"H\u00e5konshaugen\") in the village of Seim in Lind\u00e5s municipality in the county of Hordaland. Upon his death his court poet, Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir, composed a skaldic poem \"H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l\" about the fall of the King in battle and his reception into Valhalla.\nAfter Haakon's death, Harald Greycloak, the eldest surviving son of Eric Bloodaxe, ascended the throne as King Harald II, although he had little authority outside western Norway. Subsequently, the Norwegians were tormented by years of war. In 970, King Harald was tricked into coming to Denmark and killed in a plot planned by Haakon Sigurdsson, who had become an ally of King Harald Bluetooth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66152", "revid": "2666701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66152", "title": "Sea urchin", "text": "Class of marine invertebrates\nSea urchins or urchins () are echinoderms in the class Echinoidea. About 950 species live on the seabed, inhabiting all oceans and depth zones from the intertidal zone to deep seas of . They typically have a globular body covered by a spiny protective tests (hard shells), typically from across. Sea urchins move slowly, crawling with their tube feet, and sometimes pushing themselves with their spines. They feed primarily on algae but also eat slow-moving or sessile animals such as crinoids and sponges. Their predators include sharks, sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, and triggerfish. When unchecked by predators, urchins can create urchin barrens, damaged environments devoid of large algae and the animals associated with them.\nLike all echinoderms, adult sea urchins have pentagonal symmetry with their pluteus larvae featuring bilateral (mirror) symmetry; The latter indicates that they belong to the Bilateria, along with chordates, arthropods, annelids and molluscs. Sea urchins are found in every ocean and in every climate, from the tropics to the polar regions, and inhabit marine benthic (sea bed) habitats, from rocky shores to hadal zone depths. The fossil record of the echinoids dates from the Ordovician period, some 450 million years ago. The closest echinoderm relatives of the sea urchin are the sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea), which like them are deuterostomes, a clade that includes the chordates. (Sand dollars are a separate order in the sea urchin class Echinoidea.)\nThe animals have been studied since the 19th century as model organisms in developmental biology, as their embryos were easy to observe. That has continued with studies of their genomes because of their unusual fivefold symmetry and relationship to chordates. Species such as the slate pencil urchin are popular in aquaria, where they are useful for controlling algae. Fossil urchins have been used as protective amulets.\nDiversity.\nSea urchins are members of the phylum Echinodermata, which also includes starfish, sea cucumbers, sand dollars, brittle stars, and crinoids. Like other echinoderms, they have five-fold symmetry (called pentamerism) and move by means of hundreds of tiny, transparent, adhesive \"tube feet\". The symmetry is not obvious in the living animal, but is easily visible in the dried test.\nSpecifically, the term \"sea urchin\" refers to the \"regular echinoids\", which are symmetrical and globular, and includes several different taxonomic groups, with two subclasses: Euechinoidea (\"modern\" sea urchins, including irregular ones) and Cidaroidea, or \"slate-pencil urchins\", which have very thick, blunt spines, with algae and sponges growing on them. The \"irregular\" sea urchins are an infra-class inside the Euechinoidea, called Irregularia, and include Atelostomata and Neognathostomata. Irregular echinoids include flattened sand dollars, sea biscuits, and heart urchins.\nTogether with sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea), they make up the subphylum Echinozoa, which is characterized by a globoid shape without arms or projecting rays. Sea cucumbers and the irregular echinoids have secondarily evolved diverse shapes. Although many sea cucumbers have branched tentacles surrounding their oral openings, these have originated from modified tube feet and are not homologous to the arms of the crinoids, sea stars, and brittle stars.\nDescription.\nUrchins typically range in size from , but the largest species can reach up to . They have a rigid, usually spherical body bearing moveable spines, which give the class the name \"Echinoidea\" (from the Greek 'spine'). The name \"urchin\" is an old word for hedgehog, which sea urchins resemble; they have archaically been called sea hedgehogs. The name is derived from the Old French , from Latin ('hedgehog').\nLike other echinoderms, sea urchin early larvae have bilateral symmetry, but they develop five-fold symmetry as they mature. This is most apparent in the \"regular\" sea urchins, which have roughly spherical bodies with five equally sized parts radiating out from their central axes. The mouth is at the base of the animal and the anus at the top; the lower surface is described as \"oral\" and the upper surface as \"aboral\".\nSeveral sea urchins, however, including the sand dollars, are oval in shape, with distinct front and rear ends, giving them a degree of bilateral symmetry. In these urchins, the upper surface of the body is slightly domed, but the underside is flat, while the sides are devoid of tube feet. This \"irregular\" body form has evolved to allow the animals to burrow through sand or other soft materials.\nSystems.\nMusculoskeletal.\nThe internal organs are enclosed in a hard shell or test composed of fused plates of calcium carbonate covered by a thin dermis and epidermis. The test is referred to as an endoskeleton rather than exoskeleton even though it encloses almost all of the urchin. This is because it is covered with a thin layer of muscle and skin; sea urchins also do not need to molt the way invertebrates with true exoskeletons do, instead the plates forming the test grow as the animal does.\nThe test is rigid, and divides into five ambulacral grooves separated by five wider interambulacral areas. Each of these ten longitudinal columns consists of two sets of plates (thus comprising 20 columns in total). The ambulacral plates have pairs of tiny holes through which the tube feet extend.\nAll of the plates are covered in rounded tubercles to which the spines are attached. The spines are used for defence and for locomotion and come in a variety of forms. The inner surface of the test is lined by peritoneum. Sea urchins convert aqueous carbon dioxide using a catalytic process involving nickel into the calcium carbonate portion of the test.\nMost species have two series of spines, primary (long) and secondary (short), distributed over the surface of the body, with the shortest at the poles and the longest at the equator. The spines are usually hollow and cylindrical. Contraction of the muscular sheath that covers the test causes the spines to lean in one direction or another, while an inner sheath of collagen fibres can reversibly change from soft to rigid which can lock the spine in one position. Located among the spines are several types of pedicellaria, moveable stalked structures with jaws.\nSea urchins move by walking, using their many flexible tube feet in a way similar to that of starfish; regular sea urchins do not have any favourite walking direction. The tube feet protrude through pairs of pores in the test, and are operated by a water vascular system; this works through hydraulic pressure, allowing the sea urchin to pump water into and out of the tube feet. During locomotion, the tube feet are assisted by the spines which can be used for pushing the body along or to lift the test off the substrate. Movement is generally related to feeding, with the red sea urchin (\"Mesocentrotus franciscanus\") managing about a day when there is ample food, and up to a day where there is not. An inverted sea urchin can right itself by progressively attaching and detaching its tube feet and manipulating its spines to roll its body upright. Some species bury themselves in soft sediment using their spines, and \"Paracentrotus lividus\" uses its jaws to burrow into soft rocks.\nFeeding and digestion.\nThe mouth lies in the centre of the oral surface in regular urchins, or towards one end in irregular urchins. It is surrounded by lips of softer tissue, with numerous small, embedded bony pieces. This area, called the peristome, also includes five pairs of modified tube feet and, in many species, five pairs of gills. The jaw apparatus consists of five strong arrow-shaped plates known as pyramids, the ventral surface of each of which has a toothband with a hard tooth pointing towards the centre of the mouth. Specialised muscles control the protrusion of the apparatus and the action of the teeth, and the animal can grasp, scrape, pull and tear. The structure of the mouth and teeth have been found to be so efficient at grasping and grinding that similar structures have been tested for use in mechanical applications.\nOn the upper surface of the test at the aboral pole is a membrane, the periproct, which surrounds the anus. The periproct contains a variable number of hard plates, five of which, the genital plates, contain the gonopores, and one is modified to contain the madreporite, which is used to balance the water vascular system.\nThe mouth of most sea urchins is made up of five calcium carbonate teeth or plates, with a fleshy, tongue-like structure within. The entire chewing organ is known as Aristotle's lantern from Aristotle's description in his \"History of Animals\" (translated by D'Arcy Thompson):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0the urchin has what we mainly call its head and mouth down below, and a place for the issue of the residuum up above. The urchin has, also, five hollow teeth inside, and in the middle of these teeth a fleshy substance serving the office of a tongue. Next to this comes the esophagus, and then the stomach, divided into five parts, and filled with excretion, all the five parts uniting at the anal vent, where the shell is perforated for an outlet\u00a0... In reality the mouth-apparatus of the urchin is continuous from one end to the other, but to outward appearance it is not so, but looks like a horn lantern with the panes of horn left out.\nHowever, this has recently been proven to be a mistranslation. Aristotle's lantern is actually referring to the whole shape of sea urchins, which look like the ancient lamps of Aristotle's time.\nHeart urchins are unusual in not having a lantern. Instead, the mouth is surrounded by cilia that pull strings of mucus containing food particles towards a series of grooves around the mouth.\nThe lantern, where present, surrounds both the mouth cavity and the pharynx. At the top of the lantern, the pharynx opens into the esophagus, which runs back down the outside of the lantern, to join the small intestine and a single caecum. The small intestine runs in a full circle around the inside of the test, before joining the large intestine, which completes another circuit in the opposite direction. From the large intestine, a rectum ascends towards the anus. Despite the names, the small and large intestines of sea urchins are in no way homologous to the similarly named structures in vertebrates.\nDigestion occurs in the intestine, with the caecum producing further digestive enzymes. An additional tube, called the siphon, runs beside much of the intestine, opening into it at both ends. It may be involved in resorption of water from food.\nCirculation and respiration.\nThe water vascular system leads downwards from the madreporite through the slender stone canal to the ring canal, which encircles the oesophagus. Radial canals lead from here through each ambulacral area to terminate in a small tentacle that passes through the ambulacral plate near the aboral pole. Lateral canals lead from these radial canals, ending in ampullae. From here, two tubes pass through a pair of pores on the plate to terminate in the tube feet.\nSea urchins possess a hemal system with a complex network of vessels in the mesenteries around the gut, but little is known of the functioning of this system. However, the main circulatory fluid fills the general body cavity, or coelom. This coelomic fluid contains phagocytic coelomocytes, which move through the vascular and hemal systems and are involved in internal transport and gas exchange. The coelomocytes are an essential part of blood clotting, but also collect waste products and actively remove them from the body through the gills and tube feet.\nMost sea urchins possess five pairs of external gills attached to the peristomial membrane around their mouths. These thin-walled projections of the body cavity are the main organs of respiration in those urchins that possess them. Fluid can be pumped through the gills' interiors by muscles associated with the lantern, but this does not provide a continuous flow, and occurs only when the animal is low in oxygen. Tube feet can also act as respiratory organs, and are the primary sites of gas exchange in heart urchins and sand dollars, both of which lack gills. The inside of each tube foot is divided by a septum which reduces diffusion between the incoming and outgoing streams of fluid.\nNervous system and senses.\nThe nervous system of sea urchins has a relatively simple layout. With no true centralized brain, the neural center is a large nerve ring encircling the mouth just inside the lantern. From the nerve ring, five nerves radiate underneath the radial canals of the water vascular system, and branch into numerous finer nerves to innervate the tube feet, spines, and pedicellariae.\nSea urchins are sensitive to touch, light, and chemicals. There are numerous sensitive cells in the epithelium, especially in the spines, pedicellaria and tube feet, and around the mouth. Although they do not have eyes or eye spots (except for diadematids, which can follow a threat with their spines), the entire body of most regular sea urchins might function as a compound eye. In general, sea urchins are negatively attracted to light, and seek to hide themselves in crevices or under objects. Most species, apart from pencil urchins, have statocysts in globular organs called spheridia. These are stalked structures and are located within the ambulacral areas; their function is to help in gravitational orientation.\nLife history.\nReproduction.\nSea urchins are dioecious, having separate male and female sexes, although no distinguishing features are visible externally. In addition to their role in reproduction, the gonads are also nutrient storing organs, and are made up of two main type of cells: germ cells, and somatic cells called nutritive phagocytes. Regular sea urchins have five gonads, lying underneath the interambulacral regions of the test, while the irregular forms mostly have four, with the hindmost gonad being absent; heart urchins have three or two. Each gonad has a single duct rising from the upper pole to open at a gonopore lying in one of the genital plates surrounding the anus. Some burrowing sand dollars have an elongated papilla that enables the liberation of gametes above the surface of the sediment. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the peritoneum, and these allow the animal to squeeze its gametes through the duct and into the surrounding sea water, where fertilization takes place.\nDevelopment.\nDuring early development, the sea urchin embryo undergoes 10 cycles of cell division, resulting in a single epithelial layer enveloping the blastocoel. The embryo then begins gastrulation, a multipart process which dramatically rearranges its structure by invagination to produce the three germ layers, involving an epithelial-mesenchymal transition; primary mesenchyme cells move into the blastocoel and become mesoderm. It has been suggested that epithelial polarity together with planar cell polarity might be sufficient to drive gastrulation in sea urchins.\nAn unusual feature of sea urchin development is the replacement of the larva's bilateral symmetry by the adult's broadly fivefold symmetry. During cleavage, mesoderm and small micromeres are specified. At the end of gastrulation, cells of these two types form coelomic pouches. In the larval stages, the adult rudiment grows from the left coelomic pouch; after metamorphosis, that rudiment grows to become the adult. The animal-vegetal axis is established before the egg is fertilized. The oral-aboral axis is specified early in cleavage, and the left-right axis appears at the late gastrula stage.\nLife cycle and development.\nIn most cases, the female's eggs float freely in the sea, but some species hold onto them with their spines, affording them a greater degree of protection. The unfertilized egg meets with the free-floating sperm released by males, and develops into a free-swimming blastula embryo in as few as 12 hours. Initially a simple ball of cells, the blastula soon transforms into a cone-shaped echinopluteus larva. In most species, this larva has 12 elongated arms lined with bands of cilia that capture food particles and transport them to the mouth. In a few species, the blastula contains supplies of nutrient yolk and lacks arms, since it has no need to feed.\nSeveral months are needed for the larva to complete its development, the change into the adult form beginning with the formation of test plates in a juvenile rudiment which develops on the left side of the larva, its axis being perpendicular to that of the larva. Soon, the larva sinks to the bottom and metamorphoses into a juvenile urchin in as little as one hour. In some species, adults reach their maximum size in about five years. The purple urchin becomes sexually mature in two years and may live for twenty.\nLongevity.\nRed sea urchins were originally thought to live 7 to 10 years but recent studies have shown that they can live for more than 100 years. Canadian red urchins have been found to be around 200 years old.\nEcology.\nSea urchins are established in most benthic habitats from the intertidal downwards, at an extremely wide range of depths. Many genera are found in only the abyssal zone, including many cidaroids, most of the genera in the Echinothuriidae family, and the \"cactus urchins\" \"Dermechinus\". Some species, such as \"Cidaris abyssicola\", can live at depths of several kilometres, and one of the deepest-living families is the Pourtalesiidae, strange bottle-shaped irregular sea urchins that live in only the hadal zone and have been collected as deep as beneath the surface in the Sunda Trench. Compared to other classes of echinoderms, sea urchins inhabit more shallow depths compared to brittle stars, starfish, and crinoids that remain abundant below and sea cucumbers which have been recorded from .\nPopulation densities vary by habitat, with more dense populations in barren areas as compared to kelp stands. Even in these kelp barrens, greatest densities are found in shallow water. Populations are generally found in deeper water if wave action is present. Densities decrease in winter when storms cause them to seek protection in cracks and around larger underwater structures. The shingle urchin (\"Colobocentrotus atratus\"), which lives on exposed shorelines, is particularly resistant to wave action. It is one of the few sea urchin that can survive many hours out of water.\nSea urchins can be found in all climates, from warm seas to polar oceans. The larvae of the polar sea urchin \"Sterechinus neumayeri\" have been found to use energy in metabolic processes twenty-five times more efficiently than do most other organisms. Despite their presence in nearly all the marine ecosystems, most species are found on temperate and tropical coasts, between the surface and some tens of meters deep, close to photosynthetic food sources.\nTrophic ecology.\nSea urchins feed mainly on algae, so they are primarily herbivores, but can feed on sea cucumbers and a wide range of invertebrates, such as mussels, polychaetes, sponges, brittle stars, and crinoids, making them omnivores, consumers at a range of trophic levels.\nAdult sea urchins are usually well protected against most predators by their strong and sharp spines, which can be venomous in some species. The small urchin clingfish lives among the spines of urchins such as \"Diadema\"; juveniles feed on the pedicellariae and sphaeridia, adult males choose the tube feet and adult females move away to feed on shrimp eggs and molluscs.\nSea urchins are one of the favourite foods of lobsters, crabs, triggerfish, California sheephead, sea otter, and wolf eels (which specialise in sea urchins). All these animals carry particular adaptations (teeth, pincers, claws) and a strength that allow them to overcome the excellent protective features of sea urchins. \nAnti-predator defences.\nThe spines, long and sharp in some species, protect the urchin from predators. Some tropical sea urchins, like Diadematidae, Echinothuriidae and Toxopneustidae, have venomous spines. Other creatures also make use of these defences; crabs, shrimps and other organisms shelter among the spines, and often adopt the colouring of their host. Some crabs in the Dorippidae family carry sea urchins, starfish, sharp shells or other protective objects in their claws.\nPedicellariae are a good means of defense against ectoparasites, but not a panacea as some of them actually feed on it. The hemal system defends against endoparasites.\nUrchin barrens.\nLeft unchecked by predators, urchins devastate their environments, creating what biologists call an \"urchin barren\", devoid of macroalgae and associated fauna. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. The return of predators such as sea otters may reverse this process, promoting kelp regrowth and dramatically improving coastal ecosystem health.\nThe shift to urchin barrens may be better characterized as a \"compositional redistribution\", where change is observed in the species present in certain locales of a region, but the species extirpated in these locales remain present in other parts of the region. Compared to urchin barrens, kelp forests deliver more ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, species richness, abalone abundance, and sea urchin roe quality. \nUrchin barrens replace kelp forests, thus they occur in places where kelp are native, such as off the coast of the contiguous United States, Canada, the Aleutians, Chile, Europe's Atlantic coastline, Greece, Australia, Japan, and the Russian Far East. The following are species of macroalgae that form the ecosystems replaced by urchin barrens:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nContrary to what the name suggests, urchin barrens host invertebrates species other than sea urchins, such as sea stars, brittle stars, and mussels, along with coralline algae encrusting the substrate, which replace fleshy and filamentous algae. Regardless, these barrens are characterized by the dominance of sea urchins and coralline algae. The following are genera of sea urchins implicated with the establishment of urchin barrens:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSome authors consider these urchin barrens to be an alternative stable state of the ecosystem; kelp forests may return to locales which were formerly urchin barrens due to certain events, such as a change in urchin density due to disease, shifting the balance over the threshold. The inverse is also true, and urchin barrens may replace kelp forests in these locales yet again, if ecological conditions shift (such as during El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation events).\nSea urchin mass mortality events may cause the rapid return of a kelp forest, as was observed in the Southern California Bight, where the ecosystem returned to a \"kelp-dominated state\" within 6 months of a disease outbreak. Targeted culling of sea urchins, where divers kill purple sea urchins with small hammers, may aid this process.\nDisease.\nMass mortality of sea urchins was first reported in the 1970s, but diseases in sea urchins had been little studied before the advent of aquaculture. In 1981, bacterial \"spotting disease\" caused almost complete mortality in juvenile \"Pseudocentrotus depressus\" and \"Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus\", both cultivated in Japan; the disease recurred in succeeding years. It was divided into a cool-water \"spring\" disease and a hot-water \"summer\" form. Another condition, bald sea urchin disease, causes loss of spines and skin lesions and is believed to be bacterial in origin.\nEvolution.\nFossil history.\nThe earliest echinoid fossils date to the Middle Ordovician period (\"circa\" 465 Mya). There is a rich fossil record, their hard tests made of calcite plates surviving in rocks from every period since then.\nSpines are present in some well-preserved specimens, but usually only the test remains. Isolated spines are common as fossils. Some Jurassic and Cretaceous Cidaroida had very heavy, club-shaped spines.\nMost fossil echinoids from the Paleozoic era are incomplete, consisting of isolated spines and small clusters of scattered plates from crushed individuals, mostly in Devonian and Carboniferous rocks. The shallow-water limestones from the Ordovician and Silurian periods of Estonia are famous for echinoids. Paleozoic echinoids probably inhabited relatively quiet waters. Because of their thin tests, they would certainly not have survived in the wave-battered coastal waters inhabited by many modern echinoids. Echinoids declined to near extinction at the end of the Paleozoic era, with just six species known from the Permian period. Only two lineages survived this period's massive extinction and into the Triassic: the genus Miocidaris, which gave rise to modern cidaroida (pencil urchins), and the ancestor that gave rise to the euechinoids. By the upper Triassic, their numbers increased again. Cidaroids have changed very little since the Late Triassic, and are the only Paleozoic echinoid group to have survived.\nThe euechinoids diversified into new lineages in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and from them emerged the first irregular echinoids (the Atelostomata) during the early Jurassic.\nSome echinoids, such as \"Micraster\" in the chalk of the Cretaceous period, serve as zone or index fossils. Because they are abundant and evolved rapidly, they enable geologists to date the surrounding rocks.\nIn the Paleogene and Neogene periods (\"circa\" 66 to 2.6 Mya), sand dollars (Clypeasteroida) arose. Their distinctive, flattened tests and tiny spines were adapted to life on or under loose sand in shallow water, and they are abundant as fossils in southern European limestones and sandstones.\nPhylogeny.\nExternal.\nEchinoids are deuterostome animals, like the chordates. A 2014 analysis of 219 genes from all classes of echinoderms gives the following phylogenetic tree. Approximate dates of branching of major clades are shown in millions of years ago (mya).\nInternal.\nThe phylogeny of the sea urchins is as follows:\nThe phylogenetic study from 2022 presents a different topology of the Euechinoidea phylogenetic tree. Irregularia are sister group of Echinacea (including Salenioida) forming a common clade Carinacea, basal groups Aspidodiadematoida, Diadematoida, Echinothurioida, Micropygoida, and Pedinoida are comprised in a common basal clade Aulodonta.\nRelation to humans.\nInjuries.\nSea urchin injuries are puncture wounds inflicted by the animal's brittle, fragile spines.\nThese are a common source of injury to ocean swimmers, especially along coastal surfaces where coral with stationary sea urchins are present. Their stings vary in severity depending on the species. Their spines can be venomous or cause infection. Granuloma and staining of the skin from the natural dye inside the sea urchin can also occur. Breathing problems may indicate a serious reaction to toxins in the sea urchin. They inflict a painful wound when they penetrate human skin, but are not themselves dangerous if fully removed promptly; if left in the skin, further problems may occur.\nScience.\nSea urchins are traditional model organisms in developmental biology. This use originated in the 1800s, when their embryonic development became easily viewed by microscopy. The transparency of the urchin's eggs enabled them to be used to observe that sperm cells actually fertilize ova. They continue to be used for embryonic studies, as prenatal development continues to seek testing for fatal diseases. Sea urchins are being used in longevity studies for comparison between the young and old of the species, particularly for their ability to regenerate tissue as needed. Scientists at the University of St Andrews have discovered a genetic sequence, the '2A' region, in sea urchins previously thought to have belonged only to viruses like foot-and-mouth disease virus. More recently, Eric H. Davidson and Roy John Britten argued for the use of urchins as a model organism due to their easy availability, high fecundity, and long lifespan. Beyond embryology, urchins provide an opportunity to research cis-regulatory elements. Oceanography has taken an interest in monitoring the health of urchins and their populations as a way to assess overall ocean acidification, temperatures, and ecological impacts.\nThe organism's evolutionary placement and unique embryology with five-fold symmetry were the major arguments in the proposal to seek the sequencing of its genome. Importantly, urchins act as the closest living relative to chordates and thus are of interest for the light they can shed on the evolution of vertebrates. The genome of \"Strongylocentrotus purpuratus\" was completed in 2006 and established homology between sea urchin and vertebrate immune system-related genes. Sea urchins code for at least 222 Toll-like receptor genes and over 200 genes related to the Nod-like-receptor family found in vertebrates. This increases its usefulness as a valuable model organism for studying the evolution of innate immunity. The sequencing also revealed that while some genes were thought to be limited to vertebrates, there were also innovations that have previously never been seen outside the chordate classification, such as immune transcription factors PU.1 and SPIB.\nAs food.\nThe gonads of both male and female sea urchins, sometimes euphemized as sea urchin \"roe\" or \"corals\", are culinary delicacies in many parts of the world, especially Japan. In Japan, sea urchin is known as , and its gonads (the only meaty, edible parts of the animal) can retail for as much as \u00a540,000 ($360) per kilogram; they are served raw as sashimi or in sushi, with soy sauce and wasabi. Japan imports large quantities from the United States, South Korea, and other producers. Japan consumes 50,000 tons annually, amounting to over 80% of global production. Japanese demand for sea urchins has raised concerns about overfishing.\nSea urchins are commonly eaten stuffed with rice in the traditional \"oko-oko\" dish among the Sama-Bajau people of the Philippines. They were once foraged by coastal Malay communities of Singapore who call them . In New Zealand, \"Evechinus chloroticus\", known as in M\u0101ori, is a delicacy, traditionally eaten raw. Though New Zealand fishermen would like to export them to Japan, their quality is too variable.\nIn Mediterranean cuisines, \"Paracentrotus lividus\" is often eaten raw, or with lemon, and known as on Italian menus where it is sometimes used in pasta sauces. It can also flavour omelettes, scrambled eggs, fish soup, mayonnaise, b\u00e9chamel sauce for tartlets, the for a souffl\u00e9, or Hollandaise sauce to make a fish sauce. In the region of Marseille, sea urchin are commonly eaten in dedicated food festival called \"oursinade\".\nOn the Pacific Coast of North America, \"Strongylocentrotus franciscanus\" was praised by Euell Gibbons; \"Strongylocentrotus purpuratus\" is also eaten. Native Americans in California are also known to eat sea urchins. The coast of Southern California is known as a source of high quality , with divers picking sea urchin from kelp beds in depths as deep as 24 m/80\u00a0ft. As of 2013, the state was limiting the practice to 300 sea urchin diver licenses. Though the edible \"Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis\" is found in the North Atlantic, it is not widely eaten. However, sea urchins (called in Alutiiq) are commonly eaten by the Alaska Native population around Kodiak Island. It is commonly exported, mostly to Japan. In the West Indies, slate pencil urchins are eaten.\nIn Chilean cuisine, it is served raw with lemon, onions, and olive oil.\nAquaria.\nSome species of sea urchins, such as the slate pencil urchin (\"Eucidaris tribuloides\"), are commonly sold in aquarium stores. Some species are effective at controlling filamentous algae, and they make good additions to an invertebrate tank.\nFolklore.\nA folk tradition in Denmark and southern England imagined sea urchin fossils to be thunderbolts, able to ward off harm by lightning or by witchcraft, as an apotropaic symbol. Another version supposed they were petrified eggs of snakes, able to protect against heart and liver disease, poisons, and injury in battle, and accordingly they were carried as amulets. These were, according to the legend, created by magic from foam made by the snakes at midsummer.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, it was not to be another World Fair, for international themes were absent, as was the British Commonwealth. Instead, the 1951 festival focused entirely on Britain and its achievements; it was funded chiefly by the government, with a budget of \u00a312 million. The Labour government was losing support and so the implicit goal of the festival was to give the people a feeling of successful recovery from the war's devastation, as well as promoting British science, technology, industrial design, architecture and the arts.\nThe Festival's centrepiece was in London on the South Bank of the Thames. There were events in Poplar (Architecture \u2013\u00a0Lansbury Estate), Battersea (the Festival Pleasure Gardens), South Kensington (Science) and Glasgow (Industrial Power). Festival celebrations took place in Cardiff, Stratford-upon-Avon, Bath, Perth, Bournemouth, York, Aldeburgh, Inverness, Cheltenham, Oxford, Norwich, Canterbury and elsewhere, and there were touring exhibitions by land and sea.\nThe Festival became a \"beacon for change\" that proved immensely popular with thousands of elite visitors and millions of ordinary citizens. It helped reshape British arts, crafts, designs and sports for a generation. Journalist Harry Hopkins highlights the widespread impact of the \"Festival style\". They called it \"Contemporary\". It was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;clean, bright and new... It caught hold quickly and spread first across London and then across England...In an island hitherto largely given up to gravy browns and dull greens, \"Contemporary\" boldly espoused strong primary colors.\nHistorian Kenneth O. Morgan says the Festival was a \"triumphant success\" during which people:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;flocked to the South Bank site, to wander around the Dome of Discovery, gaze at the Skylon, and generally enjoy a festival of national celebration. Up and down the land, lesser festivals enlisted much civic and voluntary enthusiasm. A people curbed by years of total war and half-crushed by austerity and gloom, showed that it had not lost the capacity for enjoying itself...Above all, the Festival made a spectacular setting as a showpiece for the inventiveness and genius of British scientists and technologists.\nConception and organisation.\nThe first idea for an exhibition in 1951 came from the Royal Society of Arts in 1943, which considered that an international exhibition should be held to commemorate the centenary of the 1851 Great Exhibition. In 1945, the government appointed a committee under Lord Ramsden to consider how exhibitions and fairs could promote exports. When the committee reported a year later, it was decided not to continue with the idea of an international exhibition because of its cost at a time when reconstruction was a high priority. Herbert Morrison took charge for the Labour government and decided instead to hold a series of displays about the arts, architecture, science, technology and industrial design, under the title \"Festival of Britain 1951\". Morrison insisted there be no politics, explicit or implicit. As a result, Labour-sponsored programmes such as nationalisation, universal health care and working-class housing were excluded; instead, what was allowed was town planning, scientific progress, and all sorts of traditional and modern arts and crafts.\nMuch of London lay in ruins, and models of redevelopment were needed. The Festival was an attempt to give Britons a feeling of recovery and progress and to promote better-quality design in the rebuilding of British towns and cities. The Festival of Britain described itself as \"one united act of national reassessment, and one corporate reaffirmation of faith in the nation's future.\" Gerald Barry, the Festival Director, described it as \"a tonic to the nation\".\nA Festival Council to advise the government was set up under General Lord Ismay. Responsibility for organisation devolved upon the Lord President of the Council, Herbert Morrison, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, who had been London County Council leader. He appointed a Great Exhibition Centenary Committee, consisting of civil servants, who were to define the framework of the Festival and to liaise between government departments and the festival organisation. In March 1948, a Festival Headquarters was set up, which was to be the nucleus of the Festival of Britain Office, a government department with its own budget. Festival projects in Northern Ireland were undertaken by the government of Northern Ireland.\nAssociated with the Festival of Britain Office were the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Council of Industrial Design, the British Film Institute and the National Book League. In addition, a Council for Architecture and a Council for Science and Technology were specially created to advise the Festival Organisation and a Committee of Christian Churches was set up to advise on religion. Government grants were made to the Arts Council, the Council of Industrial Design, the British Film Institute and the National Museum of Wales for work undertaken as part of the Festival.\nGerald Barry had operational charge. A long-time editor with left-leaning, middle-brow views, he was energetic and optimistic, with an eye for what would be popular, and a knack on how to motivate others. Unlike Morrison, Barry was not seen as a Labour ideologue. Barry selected the next rank, giving preference to young architects and designers who had collaborated on exhibitions for the wartime Ministry of Information. They thought along the same lines socially and aesthetically, as middle-class intellectuals with progressive sympathies. Thanks to Barry, a collegial sentiment prevailed that minimised stress and delay.\nDisplays.\nThe arts were displayed in a series of country-wide musical and dramatic performances. Achievements in architecture were presented in a new neighbourhood, the Lansbury Estate, planned, built and occupied in the Poplar district of London.\nThe Festival's centrepiece was the South Bank Exhibition, in the Waterloo area of London, which demonstrated the contribution made by British advances in science, technology and industrial design, displayed, in their practical and applied form, against a background representing the living, working world of the day.\nThere were other displays elsewhere, each intended to be complete in itself, yet each part of the one single conception. Festival Pleasure Gardens were set up in Battersea, about three miles up river from the South Bank. Heavy engineering was the subject of an Exhibition of Industrial Power in Glasgow. Certain aspects of science, which did not fall within the terms of reference of the South Bank Exhibition, were displayed in South Kensington. Linen technology and science in agriculture were exhibited in \"Farm and Factory\" in Belfast. A smaller exhibition of the South Bank story was put on in the Festival ship \"Campania\", which toured the coast of Britain throughout the summer of 1951, and on land there was a travelling exhibition of industrial design.\nLondon Transport ordered its first batch of 25 post-war RF single deck buses fitted with roof lights to provide a fleet of sight-seeing coaches for the festival. In addition it sent four new RT buses on a promotional tour of Europe, covering and eight countries.\nThe University of Brighton Design Archives have digitised many of the http:// relating to the planning of the festival.\nPrincipal events.\nEngland.\nExhibitions\nFestival Pleasure Gardens, Battersea Park, London (3 May \u2013 3 November)\nLondon Season of the Arts (3 May \u2013 30 June)\nArts Festivals\nWales.\nPageant of Wales, Sophia Gardens, Cardiff\nSt Fagan's Folk Festival, Cardiff\nWelsh Hillside Farm Scheme, Dolhendre\nArts Festivals\nScotland.\nExhibitions\nArts Festivals\nGathering of the Clans, Edinburgh\nScots Poetry Competition\nMasque of St. Andrews, St. Andrews\nNorthern Ireland.\nUlster Farm and Factory, Belfast\nArts Festival\nTravelling exhibitions.\nFestival Ship \"Campania\",: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\nLand Travelling Exhibition : England\nThe South Bank Exhibition.\nConstruction of the South Bank site opened up a new public space, including a riverside walkway, where previously there had been warehouses and working-class housing. The layout of the South Bank site was intended to showcase the principles of urban design that would feature in the post-war rebuilding of London and the creation of the new towns. These included multiple levels of buildings, elevated walkways and avoidance of a street grid. Most of the South Bank buildings were International Modernist in style, little seen in Britain before the war.\nThe architecture and display of the South Bank Exhibition were planned by the Festival Office's Exhibition Presentation Panel, whose members were:\nThe theme of the Exhibition was devised by Ian Cox.\nThe Exhibition comprised the Upstream Circuit: \"The Land\", the Dome of Discovery, the Downstream Circuit: \"The People\", and other displays.\nUpstream Circuit: \"The Land\".\n\"Architect\": Misha Black\n\"Theme\": Ian Cox\n\"Display Design\": James Holland\nThe exhibits comprised:\nThe Dome of Discovery.\n\"Architect\": Ralph Tubbs\n\"Theme\": Ian Cox\n\"Display\": Design Research Unit\nThe exhibits focused on scientific discovery. They included:\nDownstream Circuit: \"The People\".\n\"Architect\": Hugh Casson\n\"Theme\": M.Hartland Thomas\n\"Display Design\": James Gardner\nThe exhibits comprised:\nOther features of the South Bank Exhibition.\nThe Skylon.\nAn unusual cigar-shaped aluminium-clad steel tower supported by cables, the Skylon was the \"Vertical Feature\" that was an abiding symbol of the Festival of Britain. The base was nearly 15 metres (50\u00a0feet) from the ground, with the top nearly 90 metres (300\u00a0feet) high. The frame was clad in aluminium louvres lit from within at night. It was designed by Hidalgo Moya, Philip Powell and Felix Samuely, and fabricated by Painter Brothers of Hereford, England, between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. It had a steel latticework frame, pointed at both ends and supported on cables slung between three steel beams. The partially constructed Skylon was rigged vertically, then grew taller \"in situ\". The architects' design was made possible by the engineer Felix Samuely who, at the time, was a lecturer at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in Bedford Square, Bloomsbury. The Skylon was scrapped in 1952 on the orders of Winston Churchill, who saw it as a symbol of the preceding Labour government. It was demolished and sold for scrap after being toppled into the Thames.\nRoyal Festival Hall.\nDesigned by Leslie Martin, Peter Moro and Robert Matthew from the LCC's Architects' Department and built by Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts for London County Council. The foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Clement Attlee in 1949, on the site of the former Lion Brewery, built in 1837. Martin was 39 when he was appointed to lead the design team in late 1948. He designed the structure as an 'egg in a box', a term he used to describe the separation of the curved auditorium space from the surrounding building and the noise and vibration of the adjacent railway viaduct. Sir Thomas Beecham used similar imagery, calling the building a \"giant chicken coop\". The building was officially opened on 3 May 1951. The inaugural concerts were conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and Sir Adrian Boult. In April 1988 it was designated a Grade I listed building, the first post-war building to become thus protected.\nFestival Pleasure Gardens.\nThe Festival Pleasure Gardens were created to present a lighter side of the Festival of Britain. They were erected in Battersea Park, a few miles from the South Bank Exhibition. Attractions included:\nThe majority of the buildings and pavilions on the site were designed by John Piper. There was also a whimsical Guinness Festival Clock resembling a three dimensional version of a cartoon drawing. The Pleasure Gardens received as many visitors as the South Bank Festival. They were managed by a specially-formed private company financed by loans from the Festival Office and the London County Council. As the attractions failed to cover their costs, it was decided to keep them open after the rest of the Festival had closed.\nAspects of the Festival.\nArchitecture.\nThe Festival architects tried to show by the design and layout of the South Bank Festival what could be achieved by applying modern town planning ideas. The Festival Style, (also called \"Contemporary\") combining modernism with whimsy and Englishness, influenced architecture, interior design, product design and typography in the 1950s. William Feaver describes the Festival Style as \"Braced legs, indoor plants, lily of the valley sprays of lightbulbs, aluminium lattices, Cotswold-type walling with picture windows, flying staircases, blond wood, the thorn, the spike, the molecule.\" The influence of the Festival Style was felt in the new towns, https:// and office blocks of the fifties. Harlow new town and the rebuilding of Coventry city centre are said to show the influence of the Festival Style \"in their light structures, picturesque layout and incorporation of works of art\", and Coventry Cathedral (1962), designed by Basil Spence, one of the Festival architects, was dubbed \"The Festival of Britain at Prayer\".\nThere was an exhibition about building research, town planning and architecture, the \"Live architecture\" exhibit of buildings, open spaces and streets in the Lansbury Estate, Poplar (named after the former Labour Party leader George Lansbury. Plans for social housing in the area had commenced in 1943. By the end of the war nearly a quarter of the buildings in this part of East London had been destroyed or badly damaged. In 1948, the Architecture Council decided that the Poplar site would make a good exhibition partly because it was near to the other Festival exhibitions. Despite funding problems, work began in December 1949 and by May 1950 was well advanced. The wet winter of 1950\u201351 delayed work, but the first houses were completed and occupied by February 1951. The exhibition opened on 3 May 1951 along with the other Festival exhibitions. Visitors first went to the Building Research Pavilion, which displayed housing problems and their solutions, then to the Town Planning Pavilion, a large, red-and-white striped tent. The Town Planning Pavilion demonstrated the principles of town planning and the urgent need for new towns, including a mock up of an imaginary town called \"Avoncaster\". Visitors then saw the buildings of the Lansbury Estate. Attendance was disappointing, only 86,426 people visiting, compared to 8 million who visited the South Bank exhibition. Reaction to the development by industry professionals was lukewarm, some criticising its small scale. Subsequent local authorities concentrated on high-rise, high-density social housing rather than the Lansbury Estate model. The estate remains popular with residents. Among the remaining 1951 buildings are Trinity Independent Chapel, and The Festival Inn and Festive Briton (now Callaghans) pubs.\nMisha Black, one of the Festival architects, said that the Festival created a wide audience for architectural modernism but that it was common currency among professional architects that the design of the Festival was not innovative. The design writer Reyner Banham has questioned the originality and the Englishness of the Festival Style and indeed the extent of its influence. Young architects in 1951 are said to have despised the Festival of Britain for its architecture. \"It was equated with the 'Contemporary Style', and an editorial on New Brutalism in \"Architectural Design\" in 1955 carried the epigraph, 'When I hear the word \"Contemporary\" I reach for my revolver.'\"\nDesign.\nThe South Bank Exhibition included a Design Review that presented \"an illustrated record of contemporary achievement in British industry\", showing \"the high standard of design and craftsmanship that has been reached in a wide range of British products.\" The exhibits were based on the stock list of the Council of Industrial Design (CoID) and were chosen for appearance, finish, workmanship, technical efficiency, fitness for purpose and economy of production. In selecting and promoting designs in this way, the Festival was an influential advocate of the concept of \"Good Design\", a rational approach to product design in accordance with the principles of the Modern Movement. Its advocacy of Good Design had grown partly out of the standards of utility furniture created during the war (Gordon Russell, the Director of the CoID, had been Chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel) and partly out of the CoID's Britain Can Make It exhibition of 1946. The CoiD's stock list was retained and inherited by its successor, the Design Council.\nDesign, science and industry came together in the Festival Pattern Group, which commissioned textiles, wallpaper, domestic objects and Festival exhibits based on x-ray crystallography. The idea of using the molecular patterns revealed in x-ray crystallography in surface patterns was first suggested by Dr Helen Megaw, a leading Cambridge University crystallographer. After hearing a presentation by Dorothy Hodgkin to the Society of Industrial Artists, Mark Hartland Thomas, chief industrial officer of the CoID, took up the idea and formed the Festival Pattern Group. Hartland Thomas was a member of the Festival of Britain Presentation Panel and was co-ordinating the CoID's stock list. He secured the Regatta Restaurant, one of the temporary restaurants on the South Bank, for an experiment in pattern design based on the crystal structure of haemoglobin, insulin, wareite, china clay, mica and other molecules, which were used for the surface patterns of the restaurant furnishings. The designs that were sponsored by the Festival Pattern Group chimed in with displays in the Dome of Discovery about the structure of matter and the Festival's emphasis on progress, science and technology. The Science Museum in London holds a collection of the Festival's fabrics donated by Dr Megaw; it also includes the official souvenir book by Mark Hartland Thomas.\nLettering and type design featured prominently in the graphic style of the Festival and was overseen by a typography panel including the lettering historian Nicolete Gray. A typeface for the Festival, Festival Titling, was specially commissioned and designed by Philip Boydell. It was based on condensed sans-serif capitals and had a three-dimensional form making it suitable for use in exhibition display typography. It has been said to bear \"a vague resemblance to bunting\". The lettering on the Royal Festival Hall and the temporary Festival building on the South Bank was a bold, sloping slab serif letter form, determined by Gray and her colleagues, including Charles Hasler and Gordon Cullen, illustrated in Gray's \"Lettering on Buildings\" (1960) and derived in part from typefaces used in the early 19th century. It has been described as a \"turn to a jauntier and more decorative visual language\" that was \"part of a wider move towards the appreciation of vernacular arts and the peculiarities of English culture\". The lettering in the Lion and Unicorn Pavilion was designed by John Brinkley.\nThe graphic designer for the Festival was Abram Games, who created its emblem, the Festival Star.\nThe arts.\nThe South Bank Exhibition showed the work of contemporary artists such as William Scott, including murals by Victor Pasmore, John Tunnard, Feliks Topolski, Barbara Jones, and John Piper and sculptures by Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Lynn Chadwick, Jacob Epstein and Reg Butler.\nArts festivals were held throughout the summer as part of the Festival of Britain:\nThe London Season of the Arts comprised exhibitions specially arranged for the Festival of Britain. They included:\nBarbara Jones and Tom Ingram organised \"Black Eyes and Lemonade\", an exhibition of British popular and traditional art, in association with the Society for Education in Art and the Arts Council. In the same year she surveyed the popular arts in her influential book, \"The Unsophisticated Arts\", which included taxidermy, fairgrounds, canal boats, seaside, riverside, tattooing, the decoration of food, waxworks, toys, rustic work, shops, festivals and funerals. She said of the popular arts,\" some of it is made for themselves by people without professional training in the arts or in the appreciation of them, and some of it has been made for those people by professionals who work to their taste.\"\nThe Festival was the occasion of the first performance of steelpan music in Britain by the Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra.\nFilm.\nThe British Film Institute was asked by Herbert Morrison in 1948 to consider the contribution that film could make to the Festival. It set up a panel including Michael Balcon, Antony Asquith, John Grierson, Harry Watt and Arthur Elston, which became a committee of sponsorship and distribution. Over a dozen sponsored documentary films were made for the Festival, including\nSeveral feature films were planned, but only one was completed in time, namely \"The Magic Box\", a biopic concerning pioneer William Friese-Greene, made by Festival Film Productions.\nThere was a purpose-built film theatre on the South Bank, the Telecinema (sometimes called the \"Telekinema\"), designed by Wells Coates, which showed documentary and experimental film exploiting stereophony and stereoscopy and the new invention of television. It was one of the most popular attractions of the Festival, with 458,693 visitors. When the Festival ended, the Telecinema was handed over to the BFI for use as a members-only repertory cinema club, re-opening in 1952 as the National Film Theatre.\nFilm was integral to the South Bank Exhibition, used to explain manufacturing, science and technology. The Dome of Discovery, the Exhibition of Science in South Kensington and the travelling Festival Exhibition made extensive use of educational and explanatory film.\nFilm festivals, including those at Edinburgh Film Festival, Bath and Glasgow participated in the Festival of Britain, and local authorities put on film festivals, helped by a BFI pamphlet, \"How to put on a Film Show\".\nCommercial cinema chains and independent cinemas also joined in, the Gaumont and Odeon chains programming seasons of British films. \"And finally, if the Festival visitor had not tired of the medium, they could purchase colour 16mm film of Britain\u2019s historic buildings and pageantry and filmstrips of the Festival of Britain and London as souvenirs.\"\nOne of the British Broadcasting Corporation's contributions to the Festival was a television musical entitled \"The Golden Year\", broadcast on 23 June and 2 July.\nScience.\nA new wing was built for the Science Museum to hold the \"Exhibition of Science\". The first part of the exhibition showed the physical and chemical nature of matter and the behaviour of elements and molecules. The second part, \"The Structure of Living Things\", dealt with plants and animals. The third part, \"Stop Press\", showed some of the latest topics of research in science and their emergence from the ideas illustrated in the earlier sections of the exhibition. They included \"the penetrating rays which reach us from outer space, what goes on in space and in the stars, and a range of subjects from the electronic brain to the processes and structures on which life is based.\"\nIt has been claimed that \"the Festival of Britain created a confusion at the heart of subsequent discussions amongst administrators and educationalists concerning the place science should have in British life and thought as a whole (particularly education), and its role in Britain\u2019s post-war greatness.\"\nOther festival events.\nThere were hundreds of events associated with the Festival, some of which were:\nAttendance figures.\nThe Festival was highly popular in every part of Britain. Richard Weight estimates that of the national population of 49 million, about half participated. The Festival largely ignored foreign tourists, with most of the visitors from the Continent being expatriate Britons.\nThere were over ten million paid admissions to the six main exhibitions over a period of five months: The most popular event was the centrepiece at South Bank Exhibition with almost 8.5 million visitors, over half of them from outside London. The Festival Pleasure Gardens had over 8 million visitors, three-quarters of them from London. The Festival Ship \"Campania\", which docked in ten cities, was visited by almost 900,000 people. The Travelling Land Exhibition, which went to four English cities, attracted under half a million. The most specialised events, in terms of attracting few visitors, were the architecture exhibition in Poplar, with 87,000 visitors and the exhibition of books in South Kensington, with 63,000.\nPolitical responses.\nThe idea of holding the Festival became a party political issue. Although Herbert Morrison said that he did not want the Festival to be seen as a political venture, it became associated with the Labour Party, which had won the 1950 general election, and it was opposed by the Conservative Party. Hugh Casson said that, \"Churchill, like the rest of the Tory Party, was against the Festival which they (quite rightly) believed was the advanced guard of socialism.\" Churchill referred to the forthcoming Festival of Britain as \"three-dimensional Socialist propaganda.\"\nIn an essay on the Festival, 17-year-old Michael Frayn characterised it as an enterprise of \"the radical middle-classes, the do-gooders; the readers of the \"News Chronicle\", \"The Guardian\", and \"The Observer\"; the signers of petitions; the backbone of the B.B.C.,\" whom he called \"Herbivores\". In Frayn's view, \"The Festival was the last, and virtually the posthumous, work of the Herbivore Britain of the BBC News, the Crown Film Unit, the sweet ration, the Ealing comedies, Uncle Mac, Sylvia Peters.\" In making the Festival the Herbivores \"earned the contempt of the Carnivores \u2013 the readers of the \"Daily Express\"; the Evelyn Waughs; the cast of the Directory of Directors\".\nSome prominent members of the Labour government considered the Festival to be a Labour undertaking which would contribute to their future electoral success, and Clement Attlee, the Labour leader, wrote to Morrison saying that an election in autumn 1951 would enable the Labour Party to benefit from its popularity. In the event, Labour lost the autumn election.\nLegacy.\nThe \"Guide Book\" to the Festival described its legacy in these words: \"It will leave behind not just a record of what we have thought of ourselves in the year 1951 but, in a fair community founded where once there was a slum, in an avenue of trees or in some work of art, a reminder of what we have done to write this single, adventurous year into our national and local history.\"\nWhile the idea of the Festival was being worked out, the government and the London County Council were at the same time planning the redevelopment of the South Bank site, including \"a number of great buildings, which will form part of a co-ordinated design.\" The first of these was the Royal Festival Hall. The Festival hastened the reclamation of four and a half acres of land from the river, which \"transformed the familiar patchwork of rubble and half-derelict buildings which had for so long monopolised the propect from the North Bank\". The Festival site was, over the following thirty years, developed into the South Bank Centre, an arts complex comprising the Royal Festival Hall, the National Film Theatre, the Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Purcell Room and the National Theatre.\nA 1951 office building at 219 Oxford Street, London, designed by Ronald Ward and Partners (now a Grade II* listed building), incorporates images of the Festival on its facade.\nThe Festival cost about \u00a310.5 million (apart from the loans for the Festival Gardens), with revenues of about \u00a32.5m. The net cost was \u00a38 million (equivalent to \u00a3\u00a0million today).\nIn 1953 the Festival of Britain Office was abolished and its records were taken over by the Ministry of Works.\nAs well as the material legacy, the Festival gave rise to new traditions, in particular the performances of medieval mystery plays in York and Chester. There was an explosion of interest in these plays, regular performance of which have continued in those cities ever since.\nIn 2018 Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the government was planning a Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to be held in 2022. The proposed festival, which was intended to unite the United Kingdom after Brexit, was widely criticised as it coincided with centenary of the Irish Civil War and risked inflaming tensions in Northern Ireland. The graphic designer Richard Littler, creator of Scarfolk, created a satirical poster for the Festival based on the cover of the original 1951 guide, reimagining the profile of the nation's symbolic figurehead Britannia shooting herself in the head.\nImages of the Festival of Britain.\nSeveral images of the South Bank Exhibition can be found on the internet, including many released by The National Archives on the 60th anniversary of the festival.\nA filmed retrospective of the South Bank Exhibition, \"Brief City\" (1952), with special reference to design and architecture, was made by Richard Massingham for \"The Observer\" newspaper. A film comedy, \"The Happy Family\", was made about working-class resistance to the demolition that the festival required. The Festival is featured in the early portion of the film \"Prick up your Ears\".\nThe archive of the Design Council held at the University of Brighton Design Archives includes several hundred images of the festival. They can be searched via the http:// (VADS).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
