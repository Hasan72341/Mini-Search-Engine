{"id": "70197", "revid": "246091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70197", "title": "Demographics of the United States", "text": "The United States is the most populous country in the Americas and the Western Hemisphere, with a projected population of 342,034,432 on July 1, 2025, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. With about 4% of the world's population, it is the third most populous country. The U.S. population grew 2.6% between the 2020 federal census of 331,449,281 residents and the 2024 official annual estimate of 340,110,998. These figures include the 50 states and the federal capital, Washington, D.C., but exclude the 3.6 million residents of five unincorporated U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands) as well as several minor uninhabited island possessions. The Census Bureau showed a population increase of 0.98% for the 12-month period ending in July 2024, slightly below the world estimated annual growth rate of 1.03%. By several metrics, including racial and ethnic background, religious affiliation, and percentage of rural and urban divide, the state of Illinois is the most representative of the larger demography of the United States.\nThe United States population almost quadrupled during the 20th century\u2014at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year\u2014from about 76\u00a0million in 1900 to 281\u00a0million in 2000. It is estimated to have reached the 200\u00a0million mark in 1967, and the 300\u00a0million mark on October 17, 2006. Foreign-born immigration caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase, with this population doubling from almost 20\u00a0million in 1990 to over 45\u00a0million in 2015, representing one-third of the population increase. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in late 2024 that recent immigration to the United States had more than offset the country's lower birth and fertility rates: \"Net international migration\u2019s influence on population trends has increased over the last few years. Since 2021, it accounted for the majority of the nation\u2019s growth\u2014a departure from the last two decades, when natural increase was the main factor.\" This in turn led to an increase in the U.S. population in each of the years 2022, 2023, and 2024 (+0.58%, +0.83%, and +0.98%, respectively).\nPopulation growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to a 2020 U.S. Census Bureau analysis, 50% of U.S. children under the age of 18 are members of ethnic minority groups. \nAs of 2020, white Americans numbered 235,411,507 or 71% of the population, including people who identified as white in combination with another race. People who identified as white alone (including Hispanic whites) numbered 204,277,273 or 61.6% of the population, while non-Latino whites made up 57.8% of the country's population.\nLatino Americans accounted for 51.1% of the country's total population growth between 2010 and 2020. The Hispanic or Latino population increased from 50.5 million in 2010 to 62.1 million in 2020, a 23% increase and a numerical increase of more than 11.6 million. Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.\nAsian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, with a growth rate of 35%. However, multiracial Asian Americans make up the fastest-growing subgroup, with a growth rate of 55%, reflecting the increase of mixed-race marriages in the United States.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], births to White American mothers remain around 50% of the U.S. total, a decline of 3% compared to 2021. In the same time period, births to Asian American and Hispanic women increased by 2% and 6%, respectively.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1900, when the U.S. population was 76 million, there were 66.8 million white Americans in the United States, representing 88% of the total population, 8.8\u00a0million Black Americans, with about 90% of them still living in Southern states, and slightly more than 500,000 Hispanics.\nUnder federal law, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States has increased, from 9.6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in 2007. Around a million people legally immigrated to the United States per year in the 1990s, up from 250,000 per year in the 1950s.\nIn 1900, non-Hispanic whites comprised almost 97% of the population of the 10 largest U.S. cities. The Census Bureau reported that minorities (including Hispanic whites) made up 50.4% of the children born in the U.S. between July 2010 and July 2011, compared to 37% in 1990.\nIn 2014, the state with the lowest fertility rate was Rhode Island, with a rate of 1.56, while Utah had the greatest rate with a rate of 2.33. This correlates with the ages of the states' populations: Rhode Island has the ninth-oldest median age in the US\u00a0\u2013 39.2\u00a0\u2013 while Utah has the youngest\u00a0\u2013 29.0.\nIn 2017, the U.S. birth rate remains well below the replacement level needed \u2013 at least 2.1 children per woman so as not to experience population decreases \u2013 as white American births fell in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Among non-Hispanic white women, no states had a fertility rate above the replacement level. Among non-Hispanic Black women, 12 states reached above the replacement level needed. Among Hispanic women, 29 states did. For non-Hispanic white women, the highest total fertility rate was in Utah, at 2.099, and the lowest in the District of Columbia, at 1.012. Among non-Hispanic Black women, the highest total fertility rate was in Maine, at 4.003, and the lowest in Wyoming, at 1.146. For Hispanic women, the highest total fertility rate was in Alabama, at 3.085, and the lowest in Vermont, at 1.200, and Maine, at 1.281. As of 2016, due to aging, low birth rates and rising mortality driven partly by drug overdoses, deaths outnumber births among non-Hispanic whites in more than half the states in the country.\nAge and sex distribution.\nSex distribution.\nThe 2020 U.S. Census reported there were more females than males with females making up 50.9% (or 168,763,470 people) of the population and males making up 49.1% (or 162,685,811 people). The previous census in 2010 also reported that there were more females than males; but females made up slightly less of the population at 50.8% and males made slightly more at 49.2%.\nThe first U.S. Census to report more females than males was the 1950 Census.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Age and sex distribution (2021)\n\"Note that this table shows some people in more than one group: for example someone aged 90 is included three times: in \"65+\", \"75+\" and \"85+\".\"\nPercent distribution of the total population by age: 1900 to 2015.\nSources: U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce, United Nations medium variant projections\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Percent distribution of the total population by age groups (1900 to 2015)\nDependency ratio.\nThe dependency ratio is the age-population ratio of people who are normally not in the labor force (the dependent population, which includes those aged 0 to 14 and 65 and older) to those who are (the productive part, ages 15 to 64). It is used to gauge the strain on the populace that is productive. The support ratio is the ratio of the working-age population to the elderly population, that is, the reciprocal of the aged dependency ratio.\nDensity.\nThe most densely populated state is New Jersey (1,263/mi2 or 488/km2).\nThe population is highly urbanized, with 83.3% of the population residing in cities and suburbs. Large urban clusters are spread throughout the eastern half of the United States (particularly the Great Lakes area, northeast, east, and southeast) and the western tier states; mountainous areas, principally the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian chain, deserts in the southwest, the dense boreal forests in the extreme north, and the central prairie states are less densely populated; Alaska's population is concentrated along its southern coast \u2013 with particular emphasis on the city of Anchorage \u2013 and Hawaii's is centered on the island of Oahu. California and Texas are the most populous states, as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward. New York City is the most populous city in the United States and has been since at least 1790.\nIn the U.S. territories, population centers include the San Juan metro area in Puerto Rico, Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, and the island of Tutuila in American Samoa.\nMedian age of the population.\nThe median age of the total population as of 2021 is 38.8 years; the male median age is 37.7 years; the female median age is 39.8 years.\nMedian age of the U.S. population through history. Source: U.S. Department of Commerce. Bureau of Census, United States Census Bureau and The World Factbook.\nPopulation centers.\nThe United States has dozens of major cities, including 31 \"global cities\" of all types, with 10 in the \"alpha\" group of global cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Boston, San Francisco, Miami, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Atlanta. As of 2021[ [update]], the United States had 56 metropolitan areas with 1 million or more inhabitants. (The U.S. Census Bureau ranked Urban Honolulu as the 56th most populous area, with just over 1 million residents. See Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas.)\nAs of 2011[ [update]], about 250\u00a0million Americans live in or around urban areas. That means more than three-quarters of the U.S. population shares just about three percent of the U.S. land area.\nThe following table shows the populations of the top twenty metropolitan areas. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPopulation by year (includes estimates).\nThis table includes the official United States population by year from the U.S. Census Bureau, and includes the Bureau's intercensal estimates. Such estimates are taken on July 1 of each year but are not included for the years of the decennial census (2000, 2010, 2020, etc.).

The U.S. population grew only 0.1% from the previous year before. The U.S. population has grown by less than one million people for the first time since 1937, with the lowest numeric growth since at least 1900, when the Census Bureau began yearly population estimates. Apart from the previous few years, when population growth plummeted to historically low levels, the slowest pace of increase in the twentieth century occurred between 1918 and 1919, when the influenza epidemic and World War I were both in full swing. Slower population growth has been the norm in the United States for some years, owing to lower fertility and net international migration, as well as rising mortality from an aging population.\nTo put it another way, since the mid-2010s, births and net international migration have been dropping while deaths have risen. These trends have a cumulative effect of reduced population increase.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend, resulting in a historically slow population increase in 2021.\nThe growth rate is 0.1% as estimated for 2021.\nThe birth rate is 11.0 births/1,000 population, as of 2020. This was the lowest birth rate since records began. There were 3,613,647 births in 2020, this was the lowest number of births since 1980. \nIn 2020, the CDC reported that there were 1,676,911 marriages in 2020, compared to 2019, there were 2,015,603 marriages. Marriage rates varied significantly by state, ranging from 3.2 marriages/1,000 population in California to 21.0 marriages/1,000 population in Nevada.*\nIn 2009, \"Time magazine\" reported that 40% of births in the United States were to unmarried women. The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 17% Asian, 29% White, 53% Hispanics (of any race), 66% Native Americans, and 72% Black American.\nAccording to the CDC, in 2020, there were at least 1,461,121 births to unmarried women, or 40.5% of all births in the United States. The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 28.4% Non-Hispanic White, 70.4% Non-Hispanic Black, and 52.8% Hispanic (of any race).\nThe drop in the U.S. birth rate from 2007 to 2009 is believed to be associated with the Great Recession.\nA study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that more than half (51 percent) of live hospital births in 2008 and 2011 were male.\nPer U.S. federal government data released in March 2011, births fell 4% from 2007 to 2009, the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s.\nBirths have declined for three consecutive years, and are now 7% below the peak in 2007. This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011. Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions. This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly stems from the fact that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at their lowest level in U.S. history. In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007. The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009. Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates still remain higher than in other developed nations. Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.\nTotal fertility rate (TFR).\nIn 1800 the average U.S. woman had 7.04 children; by the first decade of the 1900s, this number had already decreased to 3.56. Since 1971, the birth rate has generally been below the replacement rate of 2.1.3 Since the Great Recession of 2007, the rate has consistently been below replacement.3 The drop in the TFR from 2.08 per woman in 2007 to 1.76 in 2017 was mostly due to the declining birth rate of ethnic minorities, teenagers and women in their 30s. During that period, the birthrate for women ages 35 to 44 has risen. The 12 month ending general fertility rate increased from 56.6 to 57.0 in 2022 Q1 compared to 2021 Q4.\nTotal fertility rates from 1800 to 2020.\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. Sources: Ansley J. Coale, Zelnik and National Center for Health Statistics.\nThe U.S. total fertility rate as of 2020 is 1.641\nOther:\nSource: National Vital statistics report based on 2010 US Census data\nBirths and fertility by race.\nA total of 3,659,289 babies were born in 2021, a 1% increase from 2020. Additionally, researchers also looked at births by race and found that White and Hispanic women each saw the number of births increase by about 2% from 2020 to 2021. Meanwhile, Black and Asian women saw the number of births decline by 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, over the same period, while American Indian/Alaskan Native women saw their numbers fall by 3.2%. It also marks the first rise in births since 2014. Prior to this report, the total number of births had been decreasing by an average of 2% per year. However, the total fertility rate (the number of births that the average women have over their lifetimes) was 1.6635 births per every woman. This is still below the replacement level, the level a population needs to replace itself, which is, at least, 2.1 births per woman.\nU.S.-born residents.\n\"Note: Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\" Also note that growth arrows indicate an increase or decrease in the number of births, not in the fertility rate.\nKey:\nLife expectancy.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), average American life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023. This was a gain of 0.9 year from 77.5 years in 2022. It was 76.4 years in 2021.1\nStarting in 1998, life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since. Average U.S. life expectancy in the United States has actually declined in four of the years following 2014 (the year when average U.S. life expectancy reached 78.9 years, its historical peak). These declines were mostly reversed in both 2022 (+1.1 years) and 2023 (+0.9 year). As of 2024, death rates among the youngest remain well higher than in peer nations. In 2023, there lower death rates in each of the ten U.S. leading causes of death but gains in life expectancy were largely driven by \"decreases in mortality due to COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries, cancer and diabetes\".\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had contributed to approximately 61% of the decrease in life expectancy in the United States. While increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, heart disease, homicide, and diabetes contributed to 11.7%, 5.8%, 2.9%, and 2.8% of the decrease in life expectancy from 2019 to 2020, respectively. Life expectancy has also varied by racial and ethnic group, with Non-Hispanic Asians having the highest life expectancy and Non-Hispanic American Indians having the lowest. In 2021, life expectancy at birth in the United States fell for the second year in a row, the first two-year drop since 1961\u20131963.\nNOTE: Life expectancy at birth data for 2021 are provisional.*\nLife expectancy at birth from 1901 to 2015.\nLife expectancy in the United States from 1901 to 2015.

In the cohort-component method, the components of population change (fertility, mortality, and net migration) are projected separately for each birth cohort (persons born in a given year). The base population is advanced each year by using projected survival rates and net international migration. Each year, a new birth cohort is added to the population by applying the projected fertility rates to the female population.\nRace and ethnicity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe following table shows the race and ethnicity of the United States per the 1930, 1970, 2000, and 2020 censuses. Data only covers states and the federal district, thus only covering the first 48 states and Washington, D.C. in 1930 and including Alaska and Hawaii as well in 1970, 2000, and 2020. The figures thus do not include various other territories that have been under the United States during this time period. Over this time period, the U.S. has evolved from being 89% White, 10% Black and 1% Hispanic in 1930 to 58% White, 12% Black, and 19% Hispanic ninety years later, reflecting a significant demographic shift.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRace.\nThe United States Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. Many other countries count multiple races based on origin while America compiles multiple dozens of ethnicity groups into skin color grouping them together. The racial classifications and definitions used by the U.S. Census Bureau are:\nData about race and ethnicity are self-reported to the Census Bureau. Since the 2000 census, Congress has authorized people to identify themselves according to more than one racial classification by selecting more than one category. Only one ethnicity may be selected, however, because the Census Bureau recognizes only two ethnicities\u00a0\u2013 \"Hispanic or Latino\" and \"Not Hispanic or Latino\"\u00a0\u2013 which are mutually exclusive since you can be one or the other, but not both. The singular term Hispanic has been supplanted as a federally-recognized ethnicity by the combined \"Hispanic or Latino,\" defined by the Census Bureau as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.\nAccording to the Census Bureau website, the racial composition of the United States in 2021 was:\nAccording to the 2022 American Community Survey, the racial composition of the United States in 2022 was:\nHispanic are shown like part of the races. Source: U.S. Census Bureau.\nSource: United States Census Bureau.\nSource: United States Census Bureau.\nHispanic or Latino origin.\nThe U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines \"Hispanic or Latino\" as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. People who identify with the terms \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the decennial census questionnaire and various Census Bureau survey questionnaires \u2013 \"Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano\" or \"Puerto Rican\" or \"Cuban\" \u2013 as well as those who indicate that they are \"another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.\" People who identify their origin as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, decennial census of population, 1970 (5-percent\nsample), 1980 to 2020.\nSource: United States Census Bureau.\nSource: United States Census Bureau.\nNote: Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race.\nIndigenous peoples.\nAs of 2020, there are 9,666,058 people identifying as American Indian and Alaska Native people in the United States, including those identifying with more than one race, representing around 3% of the U.S. population. This number includes not only groups indigenous to the United States, but any Indigenous people of the Americas, including Mesoamerican peoples such as the Maya, as well as Canadian and South American natives. In 2022, 634,503 Indigenous people in the United States identified with Central American Indigenous groups, 875,183 identified with the Indigenous people of Mexico, and 47,518 identified with Canadian First Nations. Of the 3.2 million Americans who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native alone in 2022, around 45% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, with this number growing as increasing numbers of Indigenous people from Latin American countries immigrate to the U.S. and more Latinos self-identify with indigenous heritage. Of groups Indigenous to the contiguous United States, the largest self-reported tribes are Cherokee (1,449,888), Navajo (434,910), Choctaw (295,373), Blackfeet (288,255), and Sioux (220,739). Additionally, 205,954 identify with an Alaska Native tribe. There are 573 federally recognized tribal governments in the United States.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau classifies Native Hawaiians separately from American Indians and Alaska Natives, grouping them with Pacific Islanders instead. According to 2022 estimates, 714,847 Americans identified with Native Hawaiian ancestry.\nOther groups.\nVeterans.\nThere were 15.8 million veterans in 2023, with only 6.2% of Americans having served in the Armed Forces. In 2023 the war with the highest number of veterans was the Korean War. Most veterans were male at 14 million and 1.7 million veterans were female.\nIllegal immigrants.\nIn 2010, \"The Washington Post\" estimated that there were 11\u00a0million illegal immigrants in the country. In 2017, the Pew Research Center reported an estimated 10.5\u00a0million illegal immigrants in the U.S. In 2025, Pew announced that \"the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023 after two consecutive years of growth\".\nPrisoners.\nIn 2023, an estimated 1,850,595\u00a0adults were imprisoned in the United States. \nIn 2016 it was reported that 92.7% of all prisoners were male, 6.9% female, 0.3% transgender, and 0.1% nonbinary. In 2022, there were 180,684 women incarcerated in U.S. prisons and jails. Most women involved in the country's correctional system were actually under probation, with 717,811 being so classified. Female parolees numbered 76,870, while 87,874 women were held in prisons and 92,900 women were held in jails in 2022.\nSome 37% of all federal prisoners were Hispanic, 32% Black/African American, 21% white, and 2% Native American or Alaska Native. Asians, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific islanders made up 2% of the population, while \"nearly 7% of federal prisoners identified as two or more races\". In state prisons, 34% identified as Black/African American, 32% white, 21% Hispanic, 1% Native American or Alaskan Native, 1% as being either Asian/Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 11% \"identified with two or more races\".\nProjections.\nA report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of non-Hispanic Whites between 2023 and 2060, a decline from 58.9% of the population to 44.9%. Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2050, but will remain the largest single ethnic group. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.\nWhile non-Hispanic whites are projected to become a minority, the total White population (including Hispanics), will remain a majority from 2023 to 2060, falling from 75.5% to 72.3% of the population who are white alone according to the projections. However, these projections are not directly comparable to other Census Bureau data, as they are based on a modified race dataset, which does not include the \"some other race\" category used in census surveys. Individuals identifying as \u201csome other race\u201d alone or in combination made up 16.2% of the population in 2022, and they are reclassified into recognized race categories in the dataset used for the projections. As a result, there is a significant discrepancy between the share of the white alone population in 2023 according to the projections (75.5%), and the estimated share of white alone (60.9%), as reported by the American Community Survey in 2022.\nThe report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 19.1% today to 26.9% by 2060, the Black percentage barely rising from 13.6% to 14.8%, and Asian Americans upping their 6.3% share to 9.4%. The United States had a population of 333\u00a0million people in July 2023, and is projected to reach 355 \u00a0million by 2040 and 364\u00a0million in 2060. It is further projected that all of the increase in population from 2023 to 2060 will be due to immigrants.\nOf the nation's children in 2060, 64% are expected to be of a minority ethnicity, up from 51% today. Approximately 32% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 26% in 2023), and 36% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 49% in 2023). Racial and ethnic minorities surpassed non-Hispanic whites as the largest group of U.S. children under 5 years old in 2015.\nThe fastest growing racial group in America is Asian Americans with a growth rate of 35%, however the multiracial mixed Asian group is growing even faster, with a growth rate of 55%. Multiracial Asians are therefore the fastest growing demographic group in America.\nIn 2020, it was reported that 51.0% of births were to non-Hispanic white mothers. In 2021, the percentage increased to 51.5%. However, by 2022 the rate of births to white mothers had declined by 3%, dropping to 50% of all total births. In the same period, the rate of births to Asian and Hispanic women increased by 2% and 6%, respectively.\nThe United Nations projects a population of just over 400\u00a0million in 2060.\nThe country's racial profile will be vastly different, and although whites will remain the single largest ethnic group in the U.S., they will no longer be a majority excluding White Hispanics by 2055 according to Pew Research Center. Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.\nAs of 2015[ [update]], 14% of the United States' population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39\u00a0million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.\nThe average person in the U.S. of 2060 is likely to be older than the average person of 2018 today, and it is projected that almost one in four people will be 65 or older.\nU.S. Census Census Bureau projections.\nNote: \"Minority\" refers to people who reported their ethnicity and race as something other than non-Hispanic White alone in the decennial census.\nSelf-reported ancestry.\nThis table displays all self-reported ancestries with over 50,000 members, alone or in combination, according to estimates from the 2022 American Community Survey. The total population of the US according to the survey was 333,287,550, and 251,732,240 people reported an ancestry. Of these, 175,054,020 reported a single ancestry, and 76,678,224 reported two or more ancestries. Hispanic groups are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry:\nReligion.\nReligious affiliations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe table below is based mainly on selected data as reported to the United States Census Bureau. It only includes the voluntary self-reported membership of religious bodies with 750,000 or more. The definition of a member is determined by each religious body. In 2004[ [update]], the US census bureau reported that about 13% of the population did not identify themselves as a member of any religion.\nAccording to data from Pew Research, Americans are significantly more religious on average than populations in other developed Western nations, with 55% of Americans reporting praying daily, compared to only 25% of Canadians, 18% of Australians, 6% of British people, and 22% of Europeans as a whole. The country has a smaller share of unaffiliated or atheist population than most other Western nations. However, this population has been growing significantly in recent decades. Surveys conducted in 2014 and 2019 by Pew indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion increased from 16% in 2007 to 23% in 2014 and 26% of the population in 2019. A Pew Research Survey performed in 2012 found that the number of Americans without a religion was approaching the number of Evangelical Protestants, and estimated that if the current growth rate in irreligion continued, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion by 2050. \nAccording to statistical data made by the Pew Research Center in 2023 about 62% of the US population is Christian, 29% is Unaffiliated, 2% is Jewish, 1% follows Buddhism, 1% follows Hinduism, 1% follows Islam and 3% follow traditional religions and others. Currently, the United States has the largest Christian population in the world (approximately 210 million) and the largest Protestant Christian population (approximately 130 million). The country also has the second largest Jewish community in the world (after Israel) and the largest Buddhist and Hindu communities in the West, as well as the largest number of followers of Islam in North America. The country has about 99 million non-affiliates (only China and Japan have more).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Chart:\nAccording to Pew Research Center study released in 2018, by 2040, Islam will surpass Judaism to become the second largest religion in the US due to higher immigration and birth rates.\nReligions of U.S. adults.\nThe United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.\nAdult respondents were asked the open-ended question, \"What is your religion, if any?\". Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \"Protestant\" or \"Christian\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.\nReligious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of \"no religion\" than any other group.\nLGBTQ population.\nThe United States Census Bureau does not measure sexual orientation but plans are in place to start measuring it starting in 2027 with the American Community Survey. In 2024, Gallup reported that 9.3% of adults were LGBTQ. The percentage of people who have reported being LGBTQ has risen during the 2010s and 2020s. Of LGBTQ adults in the United States, the most common identification was bisexual, with 56.3% of LGBTQ adults identifying as bisexual; bisexual people made up 5.2% of the adult U.S. population. The survey also reported that 13.9% of LGBTQ adults were transgender and made up 1.3% of the U.S. adult population.\nIn June 2023, UCLA's Williams Institute reported that there were approximately 823,000 same-sex couples in the United States. Also according to the institute, most same-sex couples were female at 53% and males were 47% of same-sex couples.\nMigration.\nImmigration.\nForeign-born population.\nAs of 2017, an estimated 44,525,458 residents of the United States were foreign-born, 13.5% of the country's total population. This demographic includes recent as well as longstanding immigrants; statistically Europeans have resided in the US longer than those from other regions with approximately 66% having arrived prior to 2000.\nImmigration (2023).\nIn 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7\u00a0million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3\u00a0million) were lawful permanent residents (including many eligible to become citizens), 6% (2.2\u00a0million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5\u00a0million) were unauthorized immigrants. The Pew Research Center estimated that \"the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023 after two consecutive years of growth\".\nAmong current living immigrants to the U.S., the top five countries of birth are Mexico (25% of immigrants), China (6%), India (6%), the Philippines (5%) and El Salvador (3%). Some 13% of current living immigrants come from Europe and Canada, and 10% from the Caribbean. Among new arrivals, Asian immigrants have been more numerous than Hispanic immigrants since 2010; in 2017, 37.4% of immigrant arrivals were Asian, and 26.6% were Hispanic. Until 2017 and 2018, the United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined. From fiscal year 1980 until 2017, 55% of refugees came from Asia, 27% from Europe, 13% from Africa, and 4% from Latin America, fleeing war and persecution.\nAs of 2017, 13.6% (44.4\u00a0million) of the population was foreign-born \u2013 an increase from 4.7% in 1970 but less than the 1890 record of 14.8%. Some 45% of the foreign-born population were naturalized US citizens. Around 23% (10.3\u00a0million) of the foreign-born community is undocumented, accounting for 3.2% of the total population. According to the 2010 census, Latin America and the Caribbean is the largest region-of-birth group, accounting for 53% of the foreign-born population. As of 2018, this region is still the largest source of immigrants to the United States. In 2018, there were almost 90\u00a0million immigrants and U.S. born children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. In 2018, 1,096,611 immigrants were granted either permanent or temporary legal residence in the United States\nEmigration and Expatriation.\nAs of April 2015, the U.S. State Department estimated that 8.7\u00a0million American citizens live overseas. Americans living abroad are not counted in the U.S. Census unless they are federal government employees or dependents of a federal employee. A 2010 paper estimated the number of civilian Americans living abroad to be around 4\u00a0million. So-called \"accidental Americans\" are citizens of a country other than the United States who may also be considered U.S. citizens or be eligible for U.S. citizenship under specific laws but are not aware of having such status (or became aware of it only recently).\nAs of 2022, 1.6 million Americans live in Mexico, according to the State Department.\nEconomics.\nIncome.\nIn 2020, the median household income in the United States was around $67,521, 2.9 percent less than the 2019 median of $69,560. Household and personal income depends on variables such as race, number of income earners, educational attainment and marital status.\nEconomic class.\nSocial classes in the United States lack distinct boundaries and may overlap. Even their existence (when distinguished from economic strata) is controversial. The following table provides a summary of some prominent academic theories on the stratification of American society:\nUnemployment rate (seasonally adjusted).\nThe U6 unemployment rate as of \u00a02017[ [update]] was 8.6 percent. The U6 unemployment rate counts not only people without work seeking full-time employment (the more familiar U3 rate), but also counts \"marginally attached workers and those working part-time for economic reasons.\" Some of these part-time workers counted as employed by U6 could be working as little as an hour a week. And the \"marginally attached workers\" include those who have become discouraged and stopped looking, but still want to work. The age considered for this calculation is 16 years and over.\nUrban Americans have more job opportunities than those in more rural areas. From 2008 to 2018, 72% of the nation's employment growth occurred in cities with more than one million residents, which account for 56% of the overall population.\nGenerational cohorts.\nA definitive recent study of U.S. generational cohorts was done by Schuman and Scott (2012) in which a broad sample of adults of all ages was asked, \"What world events are especially important to you?\" They found that 33 events were mentioned with great frequency. When the ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance rankings, seven (some indicated eight or nine) distinct cohorts became evident.\nToday the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts:\nU.S. demographic birth cohorts.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n Birth rate, death rate and natural increase rate in the United States 1935\u20132021\nSubdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as \"pre-peak\" (including peak year) and \"post-peak\". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3\u00a0million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a \"bust\", there are still a \"relatively\" large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.\nFrom the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to levels prior to World War II, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's, Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn.\nMobility.\nIn 2021, 27.1 million Americans said they were living in a different place than a year before, compared to 29.8 million in 2020. This reflects an 8.4% mover rate, the lowest recorded in more than 70 years.\nEducation.\nIn 2022 the most common level of highest educational attainment among those 25 years old and up (who were civilian and not institutionalized) was completing high school.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader, such as a president, rather than by a monarch or any hereditary aristocracy.\nIn a federal republic, a division of powers exists between the federal government and the governments of the individual subdivisions. While each federal republic manages this division of powers differently, common matters relating to international affairs and treaties, security and defense, inter-state relations, and monetary policy are usually handled at the federal level, while matters such as infrastructure maintenance and education policy are usually handled at the regional or local level; however, views differ on what issues should be a federal competence, and subdivisions usually have sovereignty in some matters where the federal government does not have jurisdiction. A federal republic is thus best defined in contrast to a unitary republic, whereby the central government has complete sovereignty over all aspects of political life. This more decentralized structure helps to explain the tendency for more populous countries to operate as federal republics.\nMost federal republics codify the division of powers between orders of government in a written constitutional document. The political differences between a federal republic and other federal states, especially federal monarchies under a parliamentary system of government, are largely a matter of legal form rather than political substance, as most federal states are democratic in structure if not practice with checks and balances; however, some federal monarchies, such as the United Arab Emirates, are based upon principles other than democracy.\nFederal states primarily contrast with unitary states, where the central government retains many of the powers that are delegated to the subdivisions in federal republics. While there are exceptions, the overall tendency is for federal republics to be larger, more populous, and more internally heterogeneous than unitary states, with such larger size and internal heterogeneity being more manageable in a federal system than in a unitary one.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Set in Victoria, Australia in 1900, it is about a group of female boarding school students who vanish at Hanging Rock while on a Valentine's Day picnic, and the effects the disappearances have on the school and local community.\nThe novel was first published in Australia by Cheshire Publishing and was reprinted by Penguin in 1975. It is widely considered by critics to be one of the greatest Australian novels. In 2022, it was included on the \"Big Jubilee Read\" list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.\nIt was adapted into a 1975 film of the same name, directed by Peter Weir.\nOverview.\nAlthough the events depicted in the novel are apparently entirely fictional, it is framed as though it were a true story, corroborated by ambiguous pseudohistorical references. Its unresolved conclusion has sparked significant public, critical, and scholarly analysis, and the narrative has become a part of Australia's national folklore as a result. Lindsay claimed to have written the novel over two weeks at her home Mulberry Hill in Baxter, on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula, after having successive dreams of the narrated events.\nAn excised final chapter of the novel was published posthumously as part of a book titled \"The Secret of Hanging Rock\", which also included critical commentary and theories about the novel. Another book, titled \"The Murders at Hanging Rock\", was published in 1980, proposing varying other interpretations.\nPlot.\nThe novel begins with a brief foreword stating that whether the novel \"is fact or fiction, my readers must decide for themselves\" and implying that the events occurred.\nAt Appleyard College, a private boarding school for upper-class girls near Mount Macedon, Victoria, a picnic is being planned for the pupils under the supervision of Mrs. Appleyard, the school's headmistress. The picnic entails a day trip to Hanging Rock, on St Valentine's Day in 1900. One of the pupils, Sara, who is in trouble with Mrs. Appleyard, is not allowed to go. Sara's close friend Miranda goes without her. When they arrive, the pupils relax and eat lunch. Afterwards Miranda goes to climb the monolith with classmates Edith, Irma, and Marion, despite being forbidden to do so. The girls' mathematics teacher, Greta McCraw, follows behind them separately. Miranda, Marion, and Irma climb still higher in a trance-like state while Edith flees in terror; she returns to the picnic in hysterics, disoriented and with no memory of what occurred. Miss McCraw cannot be accounted for either except for being seen by Edith, who passed her ascending the rock in her underwear. The school scours the rock in search of the three girls and their teacher, but they are not found.\nThe disappearances provoke much local concern and international sensation with rape, abduction, and murder being assumed as probable explanations. Several organized searches of the picnic grounds and the area surrounding the rock itself turn up nothing. Meanwhile the pupils, teachers, and other staff of the school, as well as members of the community, grapple with the riddle-like events. Mike Fitzhubert, an Englishman who was picnicking at the grounds the same day, embarks on a private search of the rock and discovers Irma, unconscious and on the verge of death. When he fails to return from his search, he is found in an unexplained daze, sitting at the rock with Irma, by his friend and uncle's coachman, Albert Crundall.\nConcerned parents begin withdrawing their daughters from the prestigious school, prompting various staff to leave; the handyman and maid quit their jobs and the French instructor, Mlle. Dianne de Poitiers, announces that she will be getting married and leaving as well. A junior governess at the school, Dora Lumley, also leaves with her brother Reg, only for both to be killed in a hotel fire. Amidst the unrest both in and around the school Sara vanishes, only to be found days later, having apparently died by suicide (her body being found right beneath the school's tower, with her head \"crushed beyond recognition\"). Mrs. Appleyard, distraught over the events that have occurred, kills herself by jumping from a peak on Hanging Rock.\nIn a pseudo-historical afterword purportedly extracted from a 1913 Melbourne newspaper article, it is written that both the school and the Woodend Police Station, where records of the investigation were kept, were destroyed by a bush fire in the summer of 1901. In 1903 rabbit hunters came across a lone piece of frilled calico at the rock, believed to have been part of the dress of the governess, Miss Greta McCraw, but neither she nor the girls were ever found.\nExcised final chapter.\nAccording to her editor, Sandra Forbes, Lindsay's original draft of the novel included a final chapter in which the mystery was resolved. At her editor's suggestion Lindsay removed it prior to publication. Chapter Eighteen, as it is known, was published posthumously as a standalone book in 1987 as The Secret of Hanging Rock by Angus &amp; Robertson Publishing.\nThe chapter opens with Edith fleeing back to the picnic area while Miranda, Irma, and Marion push on. Each girl begins to experience dizziness and feel as if she is \"being pulled from the inside out.\" A woman suddenly appears climbing the rock in her underwear, shouting \"Through!\", and then faints. This woman is not referred to by name and is apparently a stranger to the girls, yet the narration suggests she is Miss McCraw. Miranda loosens the woman's corset to help revive her. Afterwards the girls remove their own corsets and throw them off the cliff. The recovered woman points out that the corsets appear to hover in mid-air as if stuck in time and that they cast no shadows. She and the girls continue together. The girls then encounter what is described as \"a hole in space\", by which they physically enter a crack in the rock following a lizard; the unnamed woman disappears into the rock. Marion follows her, then Miranda, but when Irma's turn comes a balanced boulder (the hanging rock) slowly tilts and blocks the way. The chapter ends with Irma \"tearing and beating at the gritty face on the boulder with her bare hands.\"\nThe missing material amounts to about 12 pages; the remainder of the publication \"The Secret at Hanging Rock\" contains discussion by other authors, including John Taylor and Yvonne Rousseau. The suspension of the corsets and description of the hole in space suggest that the girls have encountered some sort of time warp, which is compatible with Lindsay's fascination with and emphasis on clocks and time in the novel.\nConception.\nLindsay claimed to have based the novel on an idea she had in a dream. In a 2017 article in \"The Age\" it was noted: \"The dream had centred on a summer picnic at a place called Hanging Rock, which Joan knew well from her childhood holidays. Joan told Rae [her housekeeper] that the dream had felt so real that when she awoke at 7.30am, she could still feel the hot summer breeze blowing through the gum trees and she could still hear the peals of laughter and conversation of the people she'd imagined, and their gaiety and lightness of spirit as they set out on their joyful picnic expedition.\"\nAccording to her housekeeper at the time, the events of the novel were dreamt by Lindsay successively. Several years after the publication of the novel, Lindsay would recount the experience of writing it as such: \"\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" really was an experience to write, because I was just impossible when I was writing it. I just sort of thought about it all night and in the morning I would go straight up and sit on the floor, papers all around me, and just write like a demon!\"\nThe novel was written over a total of two weeks at Lindsay's home in Mulberry Hill. In thinking of a title, Lindsay recalled the painting \"At the Hanging Rock\" by William Ford, which had hung in her husband Daryl's office at the National Gallery of Victoria, and chose to incorporate it into the title as it was \"simple and pretty, and belied the horrors hidden within.\" In an interview after Lindsay's death, academic Terrence O'Neill, who had befriended Lindsay, remarked the supernatural elements of the novel: \"It was clear that [Joan] was interested in Spiritualism, and longed for some spiritual dimension in her life, but she didn't feel safe bringing that side of her out in front of her husband. So I think she channelled it into her writing. I know she was very interested in Arthur Conan Doyle and his belief in and theories about Spiritualism, nature and the existence of spirits.\"\nThe novel was imported for sale in the United States and would receive its first publication there in 2014 by Penguin Random House. In the United Kingdom the novel was printed in several editions by Vintage, in 1998 and 2013.\nBasis in reality.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDid I think the story was true? We did talk about this. But the truth for Joan was different to the rest of us. She was never straightforward about it. I think I decided in the end that it was a great work of the imagination. I see it as a book of place; a painterly book that captures the atmosphere of the Australian bush.\nSandra Forbes, editor, on the novel's truth claim\n\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" is written in the form of a true story, and even begins and ends with a pseudohistorical prologue and epilogue, reinforcing the mystery that has generated significant critical and public interest since its publication in 1967. However, while the geological feature, Hanging Rock, and the several towns mentioned are actual places near Mount Macedon, the story itself is entirely fictitious. Lindsay had done little to dispel the myth that the story is based on truth, in many interviews either refusing to confirm it was entirely fiction, or hinting that parts of the book were fictitious and that others were not. The dates named in the novel do not correspond to actual dates in the 1900 calendar. For instance, Valentine's Day, 14 February 1900, occurred on a Wednesday, not a Saturday; similarly, Easter Sunday fell on 15 April in 1900, not on 29 March.\nAppleyard College was to some extent based on Clyde Girls' Grammar School at St Kilda East, Victoria, which Joan Lindsay attended as a day-girl while in her teens. Incidentally, in 1919 this school was transferred to the town of Woodend, Victoria, about 8\u00a0km southwest of Hanging Rock. The fictional site of the college was described in the book as having an eastward view of Mount Macedon on the Bendigo Road. This would place it roughly 5.8\u00a0km south of Woodend. The total trip to Hanging Rock was about 12\u00a0km.\nWhen asked in a 1974 interview about whether the novel was based in truth, Lindsay responded: \"Well, it was written as a mystery and it remains a mystery. If you can draw your own conclusions, that's fine, but I don't think that it matters. I wrote that book as a sort of atmosphere of a place, and it was like dropping a stone into the water. I felt that story, if you call it a story\u2014that the thing that happened on St. Valentine's Day went on spreading, out and out and out, in circles.\" The unresolved mystery of the disappearances in the novel aroused so much lasting public interest that in 1980 a book of hypothetical solutions (by Yvonne Rousseau) was published, called \"The Murders at Hanging Rock\".\nPublication history.\nThe novel was first published on 1 November 1967 by F. W. Cheshire, Melbourne, under the aegis of Andrew Fabinyi, with an acclaimed \"dream-like\" cover design by Alison Forbes. It was reprinted in paperback by Penguin Books' Australian division in 1975, printed in conjunction with the release of the film adaptation. A hardback illustrated edition was also printed in Australia in 1987, also by Penguin. It would receive another reprinting by Penguin Books Australia in 2013 as part of the \"Penguin Australian Classics\" series.\nCritical analysis.\nMuch of the critical and scholarly interest in the novel has centred on its mysterious conclusion, as well as its depiction of Australia's natural environment in contrast with the Victorian population of the British colony established in 1851. In 1987, literary scholar Donald Bartlett drew comparisons between Lindsay's treatment of the rock and that of the fictitious Marabar Caves in E. M. Forster's \"A Passage to India\", which has been interpreted as a metaphor for Pan, the Greek god of the wild: \"There is more, of course, to \"A Passage to India\" than Pan motifs, for example symbols such as the snake, the wasp and the undying worm, not to mention the vast panorama of India's religions. But I believe it probable that Joan Lindsay consciously borrowed the elements [from \"A Passage to India\"].\"\nLiterary scholar Kathleen Steele argues in her essay \"Fear and Loathing in the Australian Bush: Gothic Landscapes in \"Bush Studies\" and \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\"\" that the novel's treatment of landscape and its missing characters is reflective of Australia's national history and the relationship between the rock and the Aboriginal population: \"The silence surrounding Aborigines, and the manner in which Europeans foregrounded 'geographical, historical and cultural difference and discontinuity,' yet denied Aborigines either presence or history, created a gothic consciousness of 'something deeply unknowable and terrifying in the Australian landscape.'\" ... \"Lindsay provokes a reflection on the understanding of Australia as an un-peopled land where nothing of consequence occurred until the British gave it a history.\"\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\nThe first film adaptation of the book was a short by Tony Ingram, a fourteen-year-old filmmaker, who got permission from Joan Lindsay to adapt her book as \"The Day of Saint Valentine.\" However, only about ten minutes of footage was filmed before the rights were optioned to Peter Weir for his more famous feature-length version, and the production was permanently shelved. The completed footage is included on some DVD releases of Weir's film.\nThe feature film version of \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" premiered at the Hindley Cinema Complex in Adelaide on 8 August 1975. It became an early film of the Australian New Wave and is arguably Australia's first international hit film.\nTheatre.\n\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" was adapted by playwright Laura Annawyn Shamas in 1987 and published by Dramatic Publishing Company. Subsequently, it has had many productions in the US, Canada, and Australia. There have also been musical adaptations of the novel.\nIn 2007 a youth musical adaptation by Robert Johns (adapter) and Brian Spence (composer) premiered at Chichester's Minerva Theatre in West Sussex, UK.\nA stage-musical adaptation, with book, music, and lyrics by Daniel Zaitchik, was scheduled to open in New York City in the fall of 2012. The musical received a 2007 staged reading at New York's Lincoln Center, and further workshop development at the 2009 O'Neill Theater Center National Music Theater Conference. The musical had its world premiere on 28 February 2014 at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah under the direction of Jim Christian.\nIn 2016, the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne showed a stage adaptation dramatized by Tom Wright and directed by Matthew Lutton. The production was later staged at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland in January 2017. The overseas production worked alongside the original Australian theatre makers Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne as well as Black Swan State Theatre Company. The Malthouse Theatre presented an encore season of \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" in early 2018.\nRadio.\nAn abridged form of the book was read by New Zealand actress Lisa Harrow on BBC Radio Four in 1996 in its Book at Bedtime slot. In 2010, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation. The cast included Simon Burke, Penny Downie, Anna Skellern and Andi Snelling.\nMiniseries.\nOn 6 September 2016, it was announced that Fremantle Media and pay-TV broadcaster Foxtel were producing a six-part miniseries, to be broadcast in 2017. The miniseries became available on Amazon Prime streaming on 25 May 2018.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nResearch\nTheoretical analyses\nAdaptations"}
{"id": "70208", "revid": "11630810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70208", "title": "Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley", "text": "King consort of Scotland from 1565 to 1567\nHenry Stuart, Lord Darnley (1546 \u2013 10 February 1567) was King of Scotland as the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, from 29 July 1565 until his murder. Darnley had one child with Mary, James VI of Scotland and I of England. Less than a year after the birth of his son, Darnley was murdered at Kirk o' Field in 1567. Many contemporary narratives describing his life and death refer to him as simply \"Lord Darnley\", his title as heir apparent to the Earldom of Lennox.\nOrigins.\nHe was the second but eldest surviving son of Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox and his wife Lady Margaret Douglas, which supported his claim to the English succession. Darnley's maternal grandparents were Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, and Queen Margaret Tudor, daughter of King Henry VII of England and widow of King James IV of Scotland.\nEarly life.\nHenry Stuart, Lord Darnley was born at Temple Newsam, Leeds, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, in 1546. Henry was initially believed to be born on 5 December 1545, but more recent research suggests he was born in 1546, as his mother had given birth in late February 1545. In a letter from March 1566, his age was given as nineteen.\nIn 1545, his father, Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, was found guilty of treason in Scotland for siding with the English in the War of the Rough Wooing, in opposing Mary of Guise and Regent Arran. The family's Scottish estates were forfeited and his father went into exile in England for 22 years, returning to Scotland in 1564. The Countess of Lennox Margaret Douglas, his mother, had left Scotland in 1528.\nThe Scottish scholar John Elder was among his tutors. Elder advocated Anglo-Scottish union through the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Prince Edward. His advice to Henry VIII in 1543, was termed the \"Advice of a Redshank\". Another schoolmaster to the young heir was Arthur Lallart, who would later be interrogated in London for having gone to Scotland in 1562.\nHenry was considered strong, athletic, skilled in horsemanship and weaponry, and passionate about hunting and hawking. His youthful character is captured somewhat in a letter of March 1554 to Mary I of England from Temple Newsam, where he writes about making a map, the \"Utopia Nova\", and his wish that \"every haire in my heade for to be a wourthy souldiour\". In Scotland, he was delighted with an English Water Spaniel, a gift from the courtier James Melville of Halhill.\nSuccession crisis.\nThere was a political dilemma in England arising from the dynastic ambition of the Lennoxes: Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, was third in line to the Scottish throne, and his wife Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox, was a niece of Henry VIII, making her a potential successor to the English throne if Elizabeth should die. As Roman Catholics, they posed a threat to English Protestants. Although Elizabeth was bright, witty, and well-educated for her position, as a woman she had to prove herself. As she was a Protestant, many Roman Catholics would have liked to see the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, take the throne. They regarded Elizabeth as illegitimate, her parents' marriage not having been recognised by the Catholic Church. As a male descended from Henry VII, Darnley was also a contender for the English throne\u2014these interrelationships made for complex intrigues, spying, strategising, and manoeuvering for power at the various courts.\nWhen Henry II of France died in July 1559, Lennox's brother John, 5th Sieur d'Aubigny, was elevated in the French court as a relative of the new French queen, Mary, already Queen of Scots. Aubigny arranged for Darnley to be dispatched to the French court to congratulate Mary and Francis II of France on Francis's accession and seek restoration for Lennox. Mary did not restore Lennox to his Scottish earldom. Still, she did give 1,000 crowns to Darnley and invited him to her coronation. Lennox planned to appeal directly to the Queen of Scots via her ambassador, over the heads of Elizabeth and the Guise. The mission of Lennox's agent, one Nesbit, appears to have been a desperate one; not only was Lennox willing to hand over Darnley and his brother Charles as hostages for his restoration, but he supplied pedigrees of Darnley, indicating his right to the inheritance of England and Scotland and the houses of Hamilton and Douglas. Aubigny was also later accused of supporting Mary's title to the throne of England and hinting that even his nephew had a stronger claim than Elizabeth.\nLennox set Nesbit to watch Mary, Darnley, and Darnley's tutor, John Elder. In 1559 Nicholas Throckmorton, the English ambassador in Paris, warned Elizabeth that Elder was \"as dangerous for the matters of England as any he knew.\" Lord Paget in March 1560, wrote of the 'well founded' fear that Catholics would raise Darnley to the throne on Elizabeth's death.\nFrancis Yaxley was a Catholic spy discovered in 1562 whose activities led to the arrest of the Lennox family. He had been a Clerk of the Signet and from 1549 was employed by William Cecil travelling in France. Yaxley was employed by the Countess of Lennox. He placed Mabel Fortescue and other ladies as servants in the Lennox household at Settrington in November 1560. His interrogation at the Tower of London in February 1562 revealed that he had obtained intelligence about the English Court from the Spanish ambassador, and the ambassador had entrusted him and Hugh Allen with messages and tokens for the Lennoxes and Darnley. Yaxley admitted that his missions were intended to arrange the marriage of the Queen of Scots with Darnley, that Darnley's religion guaranteed him greater success in his suit than the Earl of Arran, and that the countess had many friends in the north. Although the Lennox threat never died out, Elizabeth did not convict the family of treason in 1562 after their arrest, nor did she encourage efforts to annul the countess's claim to her throne. Perhaps Elizabeth feared that these investigations could also be directed at herself, or her inaction was intended to ensure the monarchy's survival by not reducing the number of potential heirs. The Lennox family was released in February 1563. Within a few months, Darnley and his mother were conspicuous by their presence at Court and the favour they received there, although Elizabeth would not accommodate the earl at Court.\nSarah Macauley notes three outcomes of the court's decision in the Lennox trial:\"Their elevation at Court was, as it turned out in 1563, a useful complication in the succession issue. First, it presented a public statement that the preferences of Parliament (the claim of Catherine Grey in the succession crisis) could not dictate her own policy. Secondly, favouring the Lennoxes could serve as some kind of appeasement of the English Roman Catholics, who, like the Spanish ambassador, might foresee Elizabeth naming Darnley as her successor ... Such speculation would also distract them from favouring the more alarming claim of the Queen of Scots ... Thirdly, and most significantly, the elevation of the Lennoxes presented an obstacle between the Queen of Scots and the English throne. Thus was Darnley's uniquely 'British' inheritance put to use at last ... The subsequent release of Darnley into Scotland and the restoration of his father at the Scottish Court were part of this policy: the political disaster of the Darnley marriage as yet unforeseen.\"\nIn September 1564, the Scottish Parliament restored Matthew Stewart's rights and titles as Earl of Lennox, and listened to a lengthy speech from the Queen's secretary William Maitland, who offered;\"[I]t may be affirmid Scotland in na manis age that presentlie levis wes in gritter tranquillitie.\"\nMarriage to Mary, Queen of Scots.\nOn 3 February 1565, Darnley left London; by 12 February, he was in Edinburgh. On 17 February, he presented himself to Mary at Wemyss Castle in Fife. Mary and Darnley had known each other since 1560, when his parents sent him to France to present themselves to Mary and offer their respects and condolences on the death of her first husband, Francis II. James Melville of Halhill reported that \"Her Majesty took well with him, and said that he was the lustiest and best proportioned long man that she had seen.\" Mary immediately fell in love with the \u201clong lad\u201d as she initially called Darnley. \u2014Elizabeth I mentioned in one of her writings that he was over six feet tall or about 1.80 m\u2014. After a brief visit to his father at Dunkeld, Darnley returned with Mary and the court to Holyrood on 24 February. The next day, he heard John Knox preach, and he danced a galliard with Mary at night. He was constantly in Mary's company from then on.\nDarnley was his wife's half-first cousin through two different marriages of their grandmother, Margaret Tudor, putting Mary and Darnley high in the line of succession for the English throne. Darnley was also a descendant of a daughter of James II of Scotland, and so also in line for the throne of Scotland.\nAs a preliminary to the marriage, Darnley was made a knight, Lord of Ardmanoch and Earl of Ross at Stirling Castle on 15 May 1565. An entourage of 15 men were made knights, including one of Mary's half brothers, Robert Stewart of Strathdon, Robert Drummond of Carnock, James Stewart of Doune Castle, and William Murray of Tullibardine. In England, a concerned Privy council debated the perils of the intended marriage on 4 June. One of their resolutions was to relax the displeasure shown to Lady Catherine Grey, another rival to Mary Stuart for the English throne and at that time with better rights to the throne than the Scottish monarch. Mary sent William Maitland of Lethington to London to inform Elizabeth of her marriage plan, and Nicholas Throckmorton was sent to Edinburgh to convey her \"miscontentment\". Elizabeth suggested that one of her favorite courtiers, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester should marry Mary, but Leicester, whose distinguished reputation at the Elizabethan court had been tarnished by the death, under suspicious circumstances, of his first wife, Amy Robsart, in September 1560, refused to marry Mary, and instead worked in the interest of Darnley. As it became clear that Mary intended to marry Darnley, Elizabeth regretted allowing him and his father to travel to Scotland, and on 18 June she requested their return.\nOn 22 July, Darnley was made Duke of Albany in Holyrood Abbey, and the banns of marriage were called in the parish of Canongate. A proclamation was made at the Cross of Edinburgh on 28 July 1565 that government would be in the joint names of the king and queen of Scots, thus making Darnley king and giving him equality with and precedence over Mary. This was confirmed in the circulation of a silver ryal in the names of Henry and Mary.\nOn 29 July 1565, the marriage took place by Roman Catholic rites in Mary's private chapel at Holyrood, but Darnley (whose religious beliefs were unfixed \u2013 he was raised as a Catholic, but was later influenced by Protestantism) refused to accompany Mary to the nuptial Mass after the wedding. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph reported that Darnley did not attend the Mass but continued to attend services at St. Giles afterwards. John Knox wrote that Darnley went to his pastime (hunting with a Hawk) after the wedding while Mary went to the Mass. He said the dancing and banqueting went on for three or four days. Because the couple were first cousins, a papal dispensation was needed for the marriage, which was initially celebrated without the dispensation because the Holy See delayed issuing it. Rome issued the dispensation on September 25, thus validating the marriage between Mary and Darnley.\nThe marriage enraged Elizabeth because she considered Darnley, who was born and raised in England, to be her subject and had married without her permission. The marriage also posed a serious threat to Elizabeth because both Darnley and Mary had claims to the English throne as descendants of Henry VII, the first monarch of the reigning House of Tudor, and the English Catholics considered Mary to be the rightful heir to the throne, rather than Elizabeth who was Protestant. Furthermore, any son they might have would be a clear claimant to the throne of England.\nIn response to Henry's marriage, Elizabeth sent a diplomat John Tamworth to present her grievances to Mary. When Mary did not provide a suitable response, Elizabeth raged against Darnley's family, ordering the imprisonment of her first cousin and Darnley's mother, Lady Margaret, in the Tower of London. Margaret remained imprisoned in the Tower until she was freed shortly after her son's murder.\nThe marriage between Mary and the son of Scotland's premier Catholic nobleman alarmed the Protestant nobility, precipitating the Queen's half-brother, James Stewart, Earl of Moray, along with the earls of Argyll, Glencairn, and Rothes to take up arms against Mary. Protestant noblemen were worried that the marriage would mean Scotland would take a turn towards Catholicism. The rebellion, known as the Chaseabout Raid, was soon defeated by the royal forces, and Moray was forced to escape to England, where he sought Elizabeth's asylum.\nEstrangement.\nSoon after Mary married Darnley, she became aware of his vain, arrogant, and unreliable qualities, which threatened the state's well-being. Darnley was unpopular with the other nobles and had a violent streak, aggravated by his drinking. Mary refused to grant Darnley the Crown Matrimonial, which would have made him the successor to the throne if she died childless. By August 1565, less than a month after the marriage, William Cecil heard that Darnley's insolence had driven Lennox from the Scottish court. On 28 August 1565, a pair of diplomatic letters were sent from the Scottish court to the King of Denmark, one signed by Mary, the other by Darnley. This seems to have been an effort to confirm his royal status. Mary soon became pregnant.\nAs a token of friendship, Charles IX of France sent an ambassador, Nicolas d'Angennes, seigneur de Rambouillet, to invest Darnley in the Order of Saint Michael in February 1566. Mary, Darnley, and her private secretary David Rizzio, took part in a costly masque with seven other dancers in rich attire to welcome Rambouillet and celebrate Darnley's investiture. His costume for the ceremony in the chapel of Holyroodhouse, of satin guarded with black velvet and satin, sewn with aglets of gold, was given to a French herald as a perquisite.\nDavid Rizzio was stabbed 57 times on 9 March 1566 by Darnley and his confederates, Protestant Scottish nobles, in the presence of the queen, who was six months pregnant. According to English diplomats Thomas Randolph and the Earl of Bedford, the murder of Rizzio (who was rumoured to be the father of Mary's unborn child) was part of Darnley's bid to force Mary to cede the Crown Matrimonial. Darnley also bargained with his allies to advance his claim to the Crown Matrimonial in the Parliament of Scotland in return for restoring their lands and titles.\nWhen the Spanish Ambassador in Paris heard this news, the headlines were that Darnley \"had murdered his wife, admitted the exiled heretics, and seized the kingdom.\" However, on 20 March, Darnley posted a declaration denying all knowledge of or complicity in the Rizzio murder. \nMary no longer trusted her husband, and he was disgraced by the kingdom. On 27 March, the Earl of Morton and Lord Ruthven, who were both present at Rizzio's murder and had fled to England, wrote to Cecil claiming that Darnley had initiated the murder plot and recruited them, because of his \"heich quarrel\" and \"deadly hatred\" of Rizzio.\nBirth of son.\nMary and Darnley's son James (the future King James VI of Scotland and I of England) was born on 19 June 1566 at Edinburgh Castle.\nFollowing the birth of James, the succession was more secure, but Darnley and Mary's marriage continued to struggle, despite a hunting trip together to Cramalt Tower in the Ettrick Forest in August 1566. Darnley alienated many who would otherwise have been his supporters through his erratic behaviour. His insistence that he be awarded the Crown Matrimonial was still a source of marital frustration.\nTheir son was baptised Charles James on 17 December 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at Stirling Castle. His godparents were Charles IX of France, Elizabeth I of England and Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy. Mary refused to let the Archbishop of St Andrews, whom she referred to as \"a pocky priest\", spit in the child's mouth, as was then the custom. In the entertainment, devised by Frenchman Bastian Pagez, men danced dressed as satyrs and sporting tails; the English guests took offence, thinking the satyrs \"done against them\". The French ambassador described how Darnley was lodged in the castle but stayed in his rooms, and sensing he was out of favour, the ambassador refused to meet with him.\nDeath.\nDarnley was murdered eight months after James's birth. On the night of 9/10 February 1567, his body and that of his valet were discovered in the orchard of Kirk o' Field, in Edinburgh, where they had been staying. During the weeks leading up to his death, Darnley was recovering from a bout of smallpox (or, it has been speculated, syphilis). He was described as having deformed pocks upon his face and body. He stayed with his family in Glasgow until Mary brought him to recuperate at Old Provost's lodging at Kirk o' Field, a two-storey house within the church quadrangle, a short walk from Holyrood, to incorporate him into the court again. Darnley stayed at Kirk o' Field while Mary attended the wedding of Bastian Pagez, one of her closest servants, at Holyrood.\nAround 2:00 a.m. on the night of 9/10 February 1567, while Mary was away, two explosions rocked the foundation of Kirk o' Field. These explosions were later attributed to two barrels of gunpowder that had been placed in the small room under Darnley's sleeping quarters. Darnley's body and the body of his valet, William Taylor, were found outside, surrounded by a cloak, a dagger, a chair, and a coat. Darnley was dressed only in his nightshirt, suggesting he had hurriedly fled from his bedchamber. Darnley was smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. A post-mortem revealed internal injuries thought to have been caused by the explosion. John Knox claimed that the surgeons who examined the body were lying and that Darnley had been strangled, but all the sources agreed there were no marks on the body and there was no reason for the surgeons to lie as Darnley was murdered either way.\nAftermath.\nSuspicion quickly fell on James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, and his supporters, notably Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas, whose shoes were found at the scene, and on Mary herself. Bothwell had long been suspected of having designs on the throne, and his close relationship with the queen gave rise to rumours they were sexually intimate. This was viewed as a motive for Bothwell to have Darnley murdered, with help from some of the nobility and seemingly with royal approval. Mary had been looking at options for removing Darnley and had discussed ideas at Craigmillar Castle in November 1566, though her ideas were for divorce. The problem was the risk of making her son illegitimate.\nSoon after Darnley's death, Bothwell and Mary left Edinburgh together. There are two points of view about the circumstances: in the first, Bothwell kidnapped the queen, took her to Dunbar Castle, and raped her. In the second, Mary was a willing participant in the kidnapping, and the story of rape was a fabrication, so her honour and reputation were not ruined by her marriage to a man widely suspected of murder. Mary later miscarried twins by Bothwell while a prisoner at Lochleven Castle.\nA soldier under the pay of Bothwell, Captain William Blackadder of the Clan Blackadder, was one of the first non-participants to happen upon the scene and, for that reason, was treated as a suspect. He was convicted and executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered before each of his limbs was nailed to the gates of a different Scottish town.\nBothwell was put on trial in Edinburgh and found not guilty. Suspicions that Mary colluded with conspirators in her husband's death or that she took no action to prevent his death led to the loss of her supporters and the loss of the Scottish crown. Bothwell escaped to Shetland and Norway. Her enemies captured Mary at the battle of Carberry Hill. In 1568, Mary's involvement in the murder was discussed in England in conferences at York and Westminster, which ended with no definitive findings. The Casket letters were produced as evidence against her, alleged to have been written by Mary; they seemed to indicate her support for the killing. The letters were purportedly found by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, in Edinburgh, in a silver box engraved with an \"F\" (for Francis II), along with other documents, including the Mary-Bothwell marriage certificate. Before Morton's execution in 1581, he admitted knowing the murder plot, and that Bothwell and Archibald Douglas were \"chief actors\" in Darnley's murder.\nMary fled to England but was kept in captivity there until she was implicated in the Babington Plot against Elizabeth, after which she was convicted of treason and executed.\nBurial and missing remains.\nDarnley was buried in the Royal Vault at Holyrood Abbey in 1567 alongside the bodies of several royals: King James II, Arthur, Duke of Rothesay, Madeleine of Valois, James, Duke of Rothesay, Arthur, Duke of Albany and King James V. In 1668, the vault was opened by mobs, and sometime later (between 1776 and 1778), the vault was raided, and the skull of Lord Darnley was stolen.\nIn 1928, a paper was published by Karl Pearson, detailing his vast research into the skull of Lord Darnley. In his paper, Pearson discussed the possibility of Darnley's skull residing in the Royal College of Surgeons\u2019 museum. In 2016, at the request of the University of Edinburgh, research was undertaken to identify whether a skull once held in the university's collection (until destroyed in the Blitz) could be Darnley's stolen remains. The Royal College of Surgeons' skull and detailed pictures and measurements from 1928 of the destroyed Edinburgh skull were examined and compared to portraits of Darnley by Emma Price at the University of Dundee. The conclusion was that the Edinburgh skull could not be Darnley's, but the Royal College of Surgeons' one was a good match. A historical facial reconstruction was then produced.\nSexuality.\nDarnley's sexuality has been subject to debate. While at the Court of Elizabeth I, he was described as \"a great cock chick\", and Thomas Randolph (Elizabeth I's ambassador to Scotland) in a later despatch wrote that Darnley and Rizzio \"would lie sometimes in one bed together\". A sexual relationship between Darnley and Rizzio was depicted in both the 1971 film \"Mary, Queen of Scots\" and the 2018 film \"Mary Queen of Scots\".\nPoetry and the Bannatyne Manuscript.\nDarnley was the author of 'Darnley's Ballet', 'Gife langour makis men licht', and potentially 'Quhair luve is kendlit confortless' [attribution uncertain] printed in the Bannatyne Manuscript (1570 ca.).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since then, Australian crews have produced many films, a number of which have received international recognition. Many actors and filmmakers with international reputations started their careers in Australian films, and many of these have established lucrative careers in larger film-producing centres such as the US and the UK.\nCommercially successful Australian films include \"Crocodile Dundee\", George Miller's \"Mad Max\" trilogy, Baz Luhrmann's \"Moulin Rouge!\", and Chris Noonan's \"Babe\". Award-winning productions include \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\", \"Gallipoli\", \"The Tracker\", \"Shine\" and \"Ten Canoes\".\nHistory.\nThe Australian film critic David Stratton characterized the history of the country's film as one of \"boom and bust\": there have been deep troughs, during which few films were made for decades, and high peaks, during which a glut of films reached the market.\nPioneer days \u2013 1890s to 1910.\nThe first public screenings of films in Australia took place in October 1896, within a year of the world's first screening in Paris by Lumi\u00e8re brothers. On 22 August 1896, the first films projected to a paying audience in Australia were at Harry Rickards' Melbourne Opera House (later known as the Tivoli Theatre). The film by magician Carl Hertz was screened as part of a variety show act. Australian tours with similar projection machines followed.\nAustralia's first cinema, the \"Salon Lumi\u00e8re\" at 237 Pitt Street, Sydney, was operating in October 1896, and showed the first Australian-produced short film on 27 October 1896.\nThe first locally produced and successfully screened cinema program was a series of eleven one-minute film reels taken from the Victoria Derby on 31 October 1896 and the Melbourne Cup on 3 November 1896, both of which races were won by the same horse, Newhaven. Directed by Henry Walter Barnett, the Lumiere Brothers film was photographed by celebrated cinematographer Marius Sestier. They were first shown at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, on 19 November 1896, then taken to Sydney where they were shown at the Criterion Theatre on 24 November 1896. Three of the reels are still in existence.\nThe Athenaeum Hall in Collins Street, Melbourne, operated as a dance hall from the 1880s, and from time to time would provide alternative entertainment to patrons. In October 1896 it exhibited the first movie film shown in Australia, within a year of the first public screening of a film in Paris on 28 December 1895 by the French Lumi\u00e8re brothers. The Athenaeum would continue screenings, such as \"Life in Our Navy\", a 60,000 foot film of life on HMS \"Jupiter\", shown on 26 January 1901 by G. H. Snazelle, who provided additional entertainment.\nA landmark of newsreel photography was in 1897, when films of both the Caulfield Cup and Melbourne Cup were screened at the Melbourne Opera House on the evenings of the race. The events had been captured on film for W. C. Baxter and developed the same day by photographer Robert William Harvie (died 5 October 1922) and inventor Ernest J. Thwaites (c. 1873 \u2013 12 July 1933).\nSome of the earliest movie film shot in Australia consisted of films of Aboriginal dancers in Central Australia, shot by anthropologists Baldwin Spencer and F. J. Gillen between 1900 and 1903. They pioneered sound recording on wax cylinders and shot their films under very difficult conditions.\nThe earliest feature-length narrative film in the world was the Australian-produced \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906), shown at the Athenaeum. The film, written and directed by Charles Tait, included several of his family members. The film was also exhibited in the United Kingdom in January 1908.\nMelbourne also hosted one of the world's first film studios, the Limelight Department, operated by the Salvation Army in Australia between 1897 and 1910. The Limelight Department produced evangelical material for use by the Salvation Army, as well as carrying out private and government contracts. In its 19 years of operation the Limelight Department produced about 300 films of various lengths, making it the largest film-producer of its time. The major innovation of the Limelight Department came in 1899 when Herbert Booth and Joseph Perry began work on \"Soldiers of the Cross\", described by some as the first feature-length film ever produced. \"Soldiers of the Cross\" fortified the Limelight Department as a major player in the early film-industry. The Limelight Department also produced a film recording of the Federation of Australia.\nBoom and bust \u2013 1910s to 1920s.\nThe 1910s were a \"boom\" period in Australian cinema. Activity had begun slowly in the 1900s, and 1910 saw four narrative films released, then 51 in 1911, 30 in 1912, and 17 in 1913, and back to four in 1914, when the beginning of World War I brought a temporary pause in film-making. While these numbers may seem small in the 21st century, Australia was one of the most prolific film-producing countries at the time. In all, between 1906 and 1928 Australia made 150 narrative feature films, almost 90 of them between 1910 and 1912.\nA general consolidation took place in the early 1910s in the production, distribution and exhibition of films in Australia. By 1912 numerous independent producers had merged into Australasian Films and Union Theatres, later Greater Union (now known as Event Cinemas), which established control over film distributors and cinemas and required smaller producers to deal with the cartel. Some view the arrangement as opening the way for American distributors in the 1920s to sign exclusive deals with Australian cinemas to exhibit only their own products, thereby shutting out the local product and crippling the local film-industry.\nVarious other explanations attempt to account for the decline of the industry in the 1920s. Some historians point to falling audience numbers, a lack of interest in Australian product and narratives, and Australia's participation in the war. Also, an official ban on bushranger films occurred in 1912. With the suspension of local film-production, Australian cinema-chains sought alternative products in the United States and realised that Australian-produced films were much more expensive than the imported product, which were priced cheaply as production expenses had already been recouped in the home market. To redress this imbalance, the federal government of Australia imposed a tax on imported film in 1914, but this was removed by 1918.\nWhatever the explanation, by 1923 American films dominated the Australian market, with 94% of all exhibited films coming from the United States.\n1930s\u20131960s.\nIn 1930, F. W. Thring (1883\u20131936) established the Efftee Studios based in Melbourne to make talking films using optical sound equipment imported from the United States. The first Australian sound films appeared in 1931: the company produced \"Diggers\" (1931), \"A Co-respondent's Course\" (1931), \"The Haunted Barn\" (1931) and \"The Sentimental Bloke\" (1932). During the five years of its existence, Efftee produced nine features, over 80 shorts and several stage-productions. Notable collaborators included C. J. Dennis, George Wallace and Frank Harvey. Film production continued only until 1934, when it ceased as a protest over the refusal of the Australian government to set Australian film-quotas, followed soon by Thring's death in 1936. It was estimated that Thring lost over \u00a375,000 of his own money on his filmmaking and theatrical ventures.\nKen G. Hall became a driving force in establishing Cinesound Productions in 1931. The company became one of Australia's first feature-film production companies and operated into the early 1940s, becoming Australia's leading domestic studio based on the Hollywood model. The company also used the Hollywood model for the promotion of its films and attempted to promote a star system. It was particularly successful with the \"On Our Selection\" (1932) series of comedies, based on the popular writings of author Steele Rudd, which featured the adventures of a fictional Australian farming family, the Rudds, and the perennial father-and-son duo, \"Dad and Dave\". Despite its ambitions, Cinesound produced only 17 feature-films, all but one of them directed by Ken Hall. Though financially successful, the company ceased making feature films following the 1939 outbreak of World War II.\n\"In the Wake of the Bounty\" (1933), directed by Charles Chauvel, starred Tasmanian-born Errol Flynn. The film was not a success. Flynn then travelled to Britain to pursue a career in acting and later went to America and became a celebrated Hollywood star. Chauvel directed a number of successful Australian films, including 1944's World War II classic \"The Rats of Tobruk\" (which starred Peter Finch and Chips Rafferty) and 1955's \"Jedda\", which was notable as the first Australian film shot in colour, and as the first to feature Aboriginal actors in lead roles and to enter the Cannes Film Festival.\nIn Britain, the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 established a quota of films that had to be shown in British cinemas. One could shoot compliant films in the British Empire as well as in Great Britain; this stimulated Australian film-production. However the Cinematograph Films Act 1938 mollified the British film industry by including only films made by and shot in Great Britain in the quota - this removed Australian films from the film quota in the UK, and saw the loss of a guaranteed market for Australian films.\n\"Kokoda Front Line!\" (1942), directed by Ken G. Hall, won Australia's first Oscar. Chips Rafferty and Peter Finch became prominent international stars of the period. Rafferty's onscreen image as a lanky, laconic bushman struck a chord with Australian filmgoers, and he appeared in iconic early Australian films such as \"Forty Thousand Horsemen\" (1940), \"The Rats of Tobruk\" (1944), \"The Overlanders\" (1946) and \"Eureka Stockade\" (1949) (\"Overlanders\" and \"Eureka\" were part of a series of Australian-themed films produced by Britain's iconic Ealing Studios). In Hollywood, Rafferty also appeared in Australian-themed films, including \"The Desert Rats\" (1953), \"The Sundowners\" (1960) and \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962). Similarly, Peter Finch starred in quintessentially Australian roles (such as \"digger\" and stockman) through a series of popular films and had a successful and diverse screen career in Britain and the United States.\nBoth Ron Randell and Rod Taylor began their acting careers in Australia - initially in radio and on stage before appearing in such Australian films as \"Smithy\" (1946) for the former and \"Long John Silver\" (1954) for the latter. They each transferred to the United States to become Hollywood leading men in a number of films of the late 1940s (Randell) and both from the 1950s onwards. Taylor had starring roles in \"The Time Machine\" (1960) and \"The Birds\" (1963) as well as in several American television-series such as \"Hong Kong\" (1960\u20131961).\nIn the 1950s British and American production-companies made several notable films in Australia based on stories from Australian literature (generally with strong rural themes). These included \"A Town Like Alice\" (1956, which starred Virginia McKenna and Peter Finch); \"The Shiralee\" (1957, also starring Peter Finch with Australian actors Charles Tingwell, Bill Kerr and Ed Devereaux in supporting roles); \"Robbery Under Arms\" (1957, again starring Finch); and \"Summer of the Seventeenth Doll\" (1959, starring Ernest Borgnine, John Mills and Angela Lansbury). In 1960, \"The Sundowners\" was shot partly in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales with foreign leads Deborah Kerr, Robert Mitchum, and Peter Ustinov but a supporting cast including Australians - Chips Rafferty, John Meillon and Leonard Teale.\nIn 1958, Australian Film Institute was formed and in the same year began awarding the Australian Film Institute Awards.\nAfter filming \"Whiplash\" in the country in 1960, Peter Graves said that the biggest problem was the shortage of Australian actors. Australian film-production reached a low ebb with few notable productions during the 1960s. The 1966 comedy \"They're a Weird Mob\", starring Walter Chiari, Chips Rafferty and Claire Dunne, was a rare hit of the period which also documented something of the changing face of Australian society: telling the story of a newly-arrived Italian immigrant who, working as a labourer in Sydney, becomes mates with his co-workers, despite some difficulties with Australian slang and culture. The film foreshadowed the successful approaching \"New Wave\" of Australian cinema of the 1970s that would often showcase colloquial Australian culture.\nOverseas cinema continued to attract Australian actors as \"action-men\" with the casting of Australian George Lazenby to replace Sean Connery in portraying the superspy James Bond in the 1969 U.K. film \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\".\nRenaissance \u2013 1970s and 1980s.\nJohn Gorton, Prime Minister of Australia from 1968 to 1971, initiated several forms of government support for film and the arts, including the Australian Film Development Corporation. The Gough Whitlam government (1972\u201375) continued the support via its successor the Australian Film Commission, and state governments also established assistance programs. These measures led to a resurgence of Australian film-making in both the low budget 16mm format and 35mm cinema - the Australian New Wave - which lasted until the mid-to-late 1980s. The era also marked the emergence of the \"Ozploitation\" style \u2013 characterised by the exploitation of colloquial Australian culture.\nAlso notable during this era was the effect of the growing feminist movement. The role of women's films was discussed at the Women's Liberation Conference in Melbourne in 1970, and groups such as the Feminist Film Workers collective (1970s and 1980s), Sydney Women\"s Film Group (SWFG, 1972\u2013), Melbourne Women's Film Group (1973\u2013), Reel Women (1979 to 1983 in Melbourne), and Women's Film Unit (Sydney and Melbourne, 1984/5) were established. A number of filmmakers, including Jeni Thornley, Sarah Gibson, Susan Lambert, Martha Ansara, Margot Nash and Megan McMurchy, were involved in these groups. The 1975 International Women's Film Festival, the first of its kind, was initiated by the SWFG, but groups around the country organised screening events in other state capitals. In Melbourne and Sydney the festivals ran for nine days (with an audience of around 56,000), and in the other states they spanned two to three days.\nFilms such as \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" (directed by Peter Weir, 1975) and \"Sunday Too Far Away\" (Ken Hannam, 1975) made an impact on the international scene. The 1970s and 1980s are regarded by many as a \"golden age\" of Australian cinema, with many successful films, from the dark dystopian fiction of \"Mad Max\" (George Miller, 1979) to the romantic comedy of \"Crocodile Dundee\" (Peter Faiman, 1986) and the emergence of such film-directing auteurs as Gillian Armstrong, Phillip Noyce and Bruce Beresford.\nA major theme of Australian cinema which matured in the 1970s was one of survival in the harsh Australian landscape. A\u00a0number of thrillers and horror-films - dubbed \"outback gothic\" - have appeared, including \"Wake in Fright\", \"Walkabout\", \"The Cars That Ate Paris\" and \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" in the 1970s, \"Razorback\", \"Long Weekend\" and \"Shame\" in the 1980s and \"Japanese Story\", \"The Proposition\" and \"Wolf Creek\" in the 2000s. These films depict the Australian bush and its creatures as deadly, and its people as outcasts and psychopaths. These elements combine with futuristic post-apocalyptic themes in the \"Mad Max\" series. 1971's \"Walkabout\" was a British film, set in Australia, which became a forerunner to many Australian films related to indigenous themes; it introduced David Gulpilil to cinematic audiences. 1976's \"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith\" directed by Fred Schepisi re-told an award-winning historical drama from the book by Thomas Keneally about the tragic story of an Aboriginal bushranger.\nClassic stories from Australian literature and Australian history continued to provide popular cinematic adaptations during the 1970s and 1980s. Gillian Armstrong's \"My Brilliant Career\" (1979) featured Judy Davis and Sam Neill in early lead-roles. 1982's \"We of the Never Never\" followed up on the theme of the female experience of life in the Australian bush. 1982's \"The Man from Snowy River\", starring Tom Burlinson and Sigrid Thornton, dramatised the classic Banjo Paterson poem of that name and became one of the all-time box-office successes of Australian cinema. In addition to the serious historical dramas popular in the 1970s, a number of films celebrating and satirizing Australian colloquial culture appeared over the decade, including: \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\" (1972), \"Alvin Purple\" (1973), and \"Barry McKenzie Holds His Own\" (1974). The Barry McKenzie films saw performing-artist and writer Barry Humphries collaborating with director Bruce Beresford. In 1976, Peter Finch won a posthumous Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the American satire \"Network\", thus becoming the first Australian to win an Oscar for best actor.\n1980's \"Breaker Morant\" (starring Jack Thompson and Edward Woodward) dramatised the controversial trial of an Australian soldier during the Boer War of 1899-1902; there followed 1981's World War\u00a0I drama \"Gallipoli\" (directed by Peter Weir and starring Mel Gibson). These films, now considered classics of Australian cinema, explored contemporary Australian identity through dramatic episodes in Australian history. Gibson went on to further success in 1982's \"The Year of Living Dangerously\" before transferring to pursue his Hollywood career as an actor and director. Many other Australian stars would follow his path to international stardom in the coming decades. The director of \"The Year of Living Dangerously\", Peter Weir, also made a successful transition to Hollywood. Weir contributed to the screenplay along with its original author, Christopher Koch, and playwright David Williamson. Williamson rose to prominence in the early 1970s, and has gone on to write several other original scripts and screenplays made into successful Australian films, including: \"Don's Party\" (1976); \"Gallipoli\" (1981), \"Emerald City\" (1988), and \"Balibo\" (2009).\nActor/comedian Paul Hogan wrote the screenplay and starred in the title role in his first film, \"Crocodile Dundee\" (1986), about a down-to-earth hunter who travels from the Australian outback to New York City. The movie became the most successful Australian film ever, and launched Hogan's international film career. Following the success of \"Crocodile Dundee\", Hogan starred in the sequel, \"Crocodile Dundee II\" in 1988. 1988 also saw the release of the drama \"Evil Angels\" (released outside of Australia and New Zealand as \"A Cry in the Dark\") about the Lindy Chamberlain saga, in which a dingo took a baby at Ayers Rock and her mother was accused of having murdered the child.\nNicole Kidman began appearing in Australian children's TV and film in the early 1980s \u2013 including starring roles in \"BMX Bandits\" and \"Bush Christmas\". During the 1980s she appeared in several Australian productions, including \"Emerald City\" (1988), and \"Bangkok Hilton\" (1989). In 1989 Kidman starred in \"Dead Calm\" alongside Sam Neill and Billy Zane. The thriller garnered strong reviews, and Hollywood roles followed.\n1990\u20132000.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Is everyone in Australia a few degrees off from true north? You can search in vain through the national cinema for characters who are ordinary or even boring; everyone is more colorful than life. If England is a nation of eccentrics, Australia leaves it at the starting line.\"\nRoger Ebert describing the eccentric national character in his review for the film \"Chopper\" (2000).\nThe 1990s proved a successful decade for Australian film and introduced several new stars to a global audience. Low budget films such as the comedy/drama \"Muriel's Wedding\", starring Toni Collette, the gently satirical suburban comedy \"The Castle\" directed by Rob Sitch (which cast Eric Bana in his first prominent film role), and Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant \"Strictly Ballroom\" each attained commercial and critical success, and explored quirky characters inhabiting contemporary Australian suburbia \u2013 marking something of a departure from the Outback and historical sagas which obtained success in the 1970s and 1980s. Stephan Elliott's 1994 film \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" mixed traditional outback cinematography and landscape with contemporary urban sub-culture: following three drag queens on a road trip to Central Australia.\nWhile a number of major international stars gained early prominence in Australia over the period, an important stable of established and emerging local stars with prodigious film credits remained prominent, including screen veterans Charles Tingwell, Bill Hunter, Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown and Chris Haywood.\nThe World War II drama \"Blood Oath\" (1990) debuted both Russell Crowe and Jason Donovan, in minor cinematic roles. Crowe demonstrated his versatility as an actor in this early period of his career by starring soon after as a street gang Melbourne skinhead in 1992's \"Romper Stomper\" and then as an inner-Sydney working-class gay man in 1994's \"The Sum of Us\" before transferring to the US to commence his Hollywood career.\nGeorge Miller's \"Babe\" (1995) employed new digital effects to make a barnyard come alive and went on to become one of Australia's highest-grossing films. The 1996 drama \"Shine\" achieved an Academy Award for Best Actor award for Geoffrey Rush and Gregor Jordan's 1999 film \"Two Hands\" gave Heath Ledger his first leading role.\nAusfilm was established in 1994 as the Export Film Services Association, after Austrade recognised potential opportunities for the country in the American market. It was converted to an incorporated association, Ausfilm International Inc., in 1998. It continues to promote the use of Australian filmmakers, and to get film production work done in Australia.\n2001\u20132019.\nAfter Ledger's successful transition to Hollywood, Jordan and Ledger collaborated again in 2003, with Ledger playing the iconic bushranger title role in the film \"Ned Kelly\", co-starring Australian actress Naomi Watts.\nThe canon of films related to Indigenous Australians also increased over the period of the 1990s and early 21st Century, with Nick Parsons' 1996 film \"Dead Heart\" featuring Ernie Dingo and Bryan Brown; Rolf de Heer's \"The Tracker\", starring Gary Sweet and David Gulpilil; and Phillip Noyce's \"Rabbit-Proof Fence\" in 2002. In 2006, Rolf de Heer's \"Ten Canoes\" became the first major feature film to be shot in an Indigenous language and the film was recognised at Cannes and elsewhere.\nThe shifting demographics of Australia following post-war multicultural immigration was reflected in Australian cinema through the period and in successful films like 1993's \"The Heartbreak Kid\"; 1999's \"Looking for Alibrandi\"; 2003's \"Fat Pizza\"; the \"Wog Boy\" comedies and 2007's \"Romulus, My Father\" which all dealt with aspects of the migrant experience or Australian subcultures.\nFox Studios Australia and Village Roadshow Studios had hosted large international productions like George Lucas's \"\" and , and the \"Wachowskis's The Matrix.\"\nRob Sitch and Working Dog Productions followed the success of \"The Castle\" with period comedy \"The Dish\", which was the highest grossing Australian film of the Year 2000 and entered the top ten list of highest grossing Australian films. Big budget Australian-international co-productions \"Moulin Rouge!\" (Baz Luhrmann, 2001) and \"Happy Feet\" (which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for filmmaker George Miller in 2006) also entered the top ten list during the first decade of the new century. Baz Luhrmann directed a series of international hits and returned to Australia for the production of 2008's \"Australia\", which showcased a host of Australian stars including Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman and David Wenham and went on to become the second highest-grossing film in Australian cinematic history.\n\"Lantana\", directed by Ray Lawrence attained critical and commercial success in 2001 for its examination of a complex series of relationships in suburban Sydney, and events surrounding a mysterious crime. It won seven AFI Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Anthony LaPaglia and Best Actress for Kerry Armstrong.\nEmerging star Sam Worthington had early lead roles in the 2002 mobster black comedy \"Dirty Deeds\" and 2003's crime caper \"Gettin' Square\". \"Gettin Square\" also featured rising star David Wenham who demonstrated versatility with a string of critically acclaimed roles including the title role in Paul Cox's 1999 biopic \"\" and the 2001 thriller \"The Bank\", directed by the politically conscious film director Robert Connolly.\nIn 2005, \"Little Fish\" marked a return to Australian film for actress Cate Blanchett and won five Australian Film Institute Awards including Best Actor for Hugo Weaving, Best Actress for Blanchett and Best Supporting Actress for screen veteran Noni Hazlehurst.\nIn 2008 following Ledger's death, the documentary film celebrating the romps of the Australian New Wave of 1970s and 1980s low-budget cinema: \"\" The film was directed by Mark Hartley and interviews filmmakers including Quentin Tarantino, Dennis Hopper, George Miller and Barry Humphries.\nThe early 2000s were generally not successful years for Australian cinema, with several confronting dramas proving unpopular at the box office. In 2008, no Australian movies made $3 million at the box office, but a conscious decision by filmmakers to broaden the types of films being made as well as the range of budgets produced a series of box-office hits at the close of the decade. Strong box office performances were recorded in 2009\u201310 by Bruce Beresford's \"Mao's Last Dancer\"; the Aboriginal musical \"Bran Nue Dae\" the dramatization of John Marsden's novel \"Tomorrow, When the War Began\"; and the crime drama \"Animal Kingdom\" which featured major Australian screen stars Ben Mendelsohn, Joel Edgerton, Guy Pearce and Jacki Weaver. \"Animal Kingdom\" achieved success at the 2010 Australian Film Institute Awards and was acclaimed at film festivals around the world. \"Tomorrow, When the War Began\" became the highest-grossing domestic film of 2010 and it was nominated for nine Australian Film Institute Awards.\nOther award-winning films of the period included \"Balibo\" (2009) starring Anthony LaPaglia; Middle Eastern crime flick \"Cedar Boys\" (2009) directed by Serhat Caradee; and animated comedy drama \"Mary and Max\".\nWorld War I drama \"Beneath Hill 60\" (2010), directed by Jeremy Sims and starring Brendan Cowell, was nominated for numerous awards and won three.\nSally Riley, as inaugural head of the Indigenous department at ABC Television, after her previous role at the Australian Film Commission (later Screen Australia), has done much to develop Indigenous talent in the film and television industry. Contemporary Indigenous film-makers include Warwick Thornton, Wayne Blair, Trisha Morton-Thomas and Rachel Perkins.\nThe Australian film industry continues to produce a reasonable number of films each year, but in common with other English-speaking countries, Australia has often found it difficult to compete with the American film industry, the latter helped by having a much larger home market. The most successful Australian actors and filmmakers are easily lured by Hollywood and rarely return to the domestic film industry. The South Australian Film Corporation continues to produce quality films, and Adelaide has been chosen as the location for films such as \"Hotel Mumbai\" (2019).\n2020\u2013present.\nThe Australian film and TV industry was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least 60 shoots being halted and around 20,000 people being put of work. On Monday 23 March, all productions funded by Screen Australia were postponed. As of 2020[ [update]], after some improvement in COVID-19 statistics in Australia, Screen Australia continues to fund work and process applications, intending to use all of its 2019/20 budget.\nSometime after the movie and TV industries reopened, several films restarted production. Two such films were \"Escape from Pretoria\" (2020) and \"Mortal Kombat\" (2021).\nGenres.\nAustralian Gothic films.\nGothic films incorporate Gothic elements and can be infused within different genres such as horror, romance, science fiction, and comedy. Australian Gothic films have been an accordant genera ever since the 1970s. Gothic Australian films means to make films that are diverse and use camera techniques in different ways to question what the audience may perceive. One of the Australian Gothic films created by female filmmakers Suzan Dermody and Elizabeth Jacka called \"The Screening of Australia\" (1987), shows different stylistic thematic terms and was the most successful at showing what is called the ocker, a term to describe a (white) Australian savage man. Other than this, there is a strong relationship between Australian Gothic films and Gothic literature. The characters and the actions that happen in a Gothic novel is created into a Gothic film. Most Gothic novels during the 1970s referred to female characters and their Australian cultural values.\nAlthough the film \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" (1975) was directed by a male filmmaker, it was written by storyteller Joan Lindsay. Lindsay decided to make this film culturally related to Australian societal issues of day-to-day lives. Her film included Gothic materials and gave a twist of horror that later the director will showcase through the mise-en-scene and cinematography. The use of Gothic materials were offered by the filmmakers Dermody and Jacka to other Australian Gothic films that have opened up to a more thematic analysis. Other Gothic films were made to broaden Australian characteristics and features. \"Smoke Em If You Got \u2018Em\" (1988), produced by Jennifer Hooks, showcased the protagonist in a supernatural horrific way, but also added a comedic twist to not lose its characterization of film style.\nFilm schools.\nThere are several film schools in Australia, most notably the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, known as AFTRS in Sydney. Others include Griffith Film School, https:// in Brisbane; the WA Screen and Media Academy at Edith Cowan University in Perth; and Media Arts and Production, University of Technology Sydney (MAP UTS). All are full members of CILECT, the international association of film schools.\nIn Melbourne, Victoria, Swinburne Film and Television School (1966\u20131991) produced many notable filmmakers, before merging into Victorian College of the Arts, becoming VCA Film and Television School (later merged into the University of Melbourne). However Swinburne University's Swinburne School of Film and Television (SSFT) remains, and both the VCA and SSFT are full members of CILECT. RMIT University runs various degree and diploma courses relating to filmmaking. In addition, in collaboration with AFTRS, it started delivering four short intensive courses relating to filmmaking and the film industry from December 2024.\nIn South Australia, Flinders University introduced their Bachelor of Creative Arts Screen (BCA) in 2002, which proved both popular and successful.\nGovernment support.\nJohn Gorton, Prime Minister of Australia from 1968\u20131971, initiated several forms of Government support for Australian film and the arts, establishing the Australian Council for the Arts, the Australian Film Development Corporation and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. Prime Minister Gough Whitlam continued to support Australian film. The South Australian Film Corporation was established in 1972 to promote and produce films, while the Australian Film Commission was created in 1975 to fund and produce internationally competitive films.\nThe federal Australian government had supported the Australian film industry through the funding and development agencies of Film Finance Corporation Australia, the Australian Film Commission and Film Australia. In 2008 the three agencies were consolidated into Screen Australia.\nHighest-grossing Australian films.\nOther financial hits.\nHigh-grossing Australian films from earlier decades include:\nDirectors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActors.\nThe Australian film industry has produced a number of successful actors, actresses, writers, directors and filmmakers many of whom have been known internationally.\nActors\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActresses\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mottos (or mottoes) are usually found predominantly in written form (unlike slogans, which may also be expressed orally), and may stem from long traditions of social foundations, or from significant events, such as a civil war or a revolution. One's motto may be in any language, but Latin has been widely used, especially in the Western world.\nLanguage.\nLatin has been very common for mottos in the Western World, but for nation states, their official national language is generally chosen. Examples of using other historical languages in motto language include:\nA canting motto is one that contains word play. For example, the motto of the Earl of Onslow is \"Festina lente\" (literally 'make haste slowly'), punningly interpreting 'on slow'. Similarly, the motto of the Burgh of Tayport, \"Te oportet alte ferri\" (It is incumbent on you to carry yourself high), is a cant on 'Tayport at auld Tay Ferry', also alluding to the local lighthouse. The motto of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, \"Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity\", is a backronym of the letters F.B.I.\nMottos in heraldry.\nIn heraldry, a motto is often found \"below\" the shield in a banderole in the compartment. This placement stems from the Middle Ages, in which the vast majority of nobles possessed a coat of arms complete with a motto. In the case of Scottish heraldry, it is mandated to appear \"above\" the crest and is called slogan (see: Slogan (heraldry)). The word 'slogan' is an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic \"sluagh-ghairm\" (\"sluagh\" \"army, host\" + \"gairm\" \"cry\"). There are several notable slogans which are thought to originate from a battle or war cries. In heraldic literature, the terms 'rallying cry' respectively 'battle banner' are also common. Spanish coats of arms may display a motto in the bordure of the shield.\nIn English heraldry, mottos are not granted with armorial bearings, and may be adopted and changed at will. In Scottish heraldry, mottos can only be changed by re-matriculation, with the Lord Lyon King of Arms. Although unusual in England, and perhaps outside English heraldic practice, there are some examples, such as in Belgium, of the particular appearance of the motto scroll and letters thereon being blazoned; a prominent example is the obverse of the Great Seal of the United States (which is a coat of arms and follows heraldic conventions), the blazon for which specifies that the motto scroll is held in the beak of the bald eagle serving as the escutcheon's supporter.\nShips and submarines in the Royal Navy (RN) each have a badge and motto, as do units of the Royal Air Force (RAF).[]\nMottos in literature.\nIn literature, a motto is a sentence, phrase, poem, or word; prefixed to an essay, chapter, novel, or the like, suggestive of its subject matter. It is a short, suggestive expression of a guiding principle for the written material that follows.\nFor example, Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Travels with a Donkey in the C\u00e9vennes\" uses mottos at the start of each section.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou and the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno. His father was the eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. Mary laid claim to Hungary after her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, died in 1290, but the Hungarian prelates and lords elected her cousin, Andrew III, king. Instead of abandoning her claim to Hungary, she transferred it to her son, Charles Martel, and after his death in 1295, to her grandson, Charles. On the other hand, her husband, Charles II of Naples, made their third son, Robert, heir to the Kingdom of Naples, thus disinheriting Charles.\nCharles came to the Kingdom of Hungary upon the invitation of an influential Croatian lord, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107, in August 1300. Andrew\u00a0III died on 14\u00a0January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus III K\u00e1n, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27\u00a0November 1308, but his rule remained nominal in most parts of his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27\u00a0August 1310.\nCharles won his first decisive victory in the Battle of Rozgony (at present-day Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15\u00a0June 1312. After that, his troops seized most fortresses of the powerful Aba family. During the next decade, Charles restored royal power primarily with the assistance of the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom. After the death of the most powerful oligarch, Matthew Cs\u00e1k, in 1321, Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom, with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able to preserve their autonomous status. He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330. Charles's contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from God for his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Z\u00e1h who had attempted to slaughter the royal family.\nCharles rarely made perpetual land grants, instead introducing a system of \"office fiefs\", whereby his officials enjoyed significant revenues, but only for the time they held a royal office, which ensured their loyalty. In the second half of his reign, Charles did not hold Diets and administered his kingdom with absolute power. He established the Order of Saint George, which was the first secular order of knights. He promoted the opening of new gold mines, which made Hungary the largest producer of gold in Europe. The first Hungarian gold coins were minted during his reign. At the congress of Visegr\u00e1d in 1335, he mediated a reconciliation between two neighboring monarchs, John of Bohemia and Casimir III of Poland. Treaties signed at the same congress also contributed to the development of new commercial routes linking Hungary with Western Europe. Charles's efforts to reunite Hungary, together with his administrative and economic reforms, established the basis for the achievements of his successor, Louis the Great.\nEarly years.\nChildhood (1288\u20131300).\nCharles was the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno, and his wife, Clemence of Austria. He was born as Caroberto in 1288; the place of his birth is unknown. Charles Martel was the firstborn son of Charles II of Naples and Charles II's wife, Mary, who was a daughter of Stephen V of Hungary. After the death of her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, in 1290, Queen Mary announced her claim to Hungary, stating that the House of \u00c1rp\u00e1d (the royal family of Hungary) had become extinct with Ladislaus's death. However, her father's cousin, Andrew also laid claim to the throne, although his father, Stephen the Posthumous, had been regarded a bastard by all other members of the royal family. For all that, the Hungarian lords and prelates preferred Andrew against Mary and he was crowned king of Hungary on 23\u00a0July 1290. She transferred her claim to Hungary to Charles Martel in January 1292. The Baboni\u0107i, Frankopans, \u0160ubi\u0107i and other Croatian and Slavonian noble families seemingly acknowledged Charles Martel's claim, but in fact their loyalty vacillated between Charles Martel and Andrew\u00a0III.\nCharles Martel died in autumn 1295, and his seven-year-old son, Charles, inherited his claim to Hungary. Charles would have also been the lawful heir to his grandfather, Charles\u00a0II of Naples, in accordance with the principles of primogeniture. However, Charles\u00a0II, who preferred his third son, Robert, to his grandson, bestowed the rights of a firstborn son upon Robert on 13\u00a0February 1296. Pope Boniface VIII confirmed Charles\u00a0II's decision on 27\u00a0February 1296, excluding the child Charles from succeeding his grandfather in the Kingdom of Naples. Dante Alighieri wrote of \"the schemes and frauds that would attack\" Charles Martel's family in reference to Robert's alleged manoeuvres to acquire the right to inherit Naples. The 14th-century historian Giovanni Villani also noted that his contemporaries were of the opinion that Robert's claim to Naples was weaker than his nephew's. The jurist Baldus de Ubaldis refrained from setting out his position on the legitimacy of Robert's rule.\nStruggle for Hungary (1300\u20131308).\nAndrew III of Hungary made his maternal uncle, Albertino Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II of Naples to send his grandson to Hungary to claim the throne in person. The king of Naples accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles's journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to Hungary. They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107 escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Cs\u00e1k swore loyalty to Charles. Charles's opponent, Andrew\u00a0III of Hungary, died on 14\u00a0January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a provisional crown before 13\u00a0May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required that it should have been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r.\nCharles counted his regnal years from this coronation, but Hungary had actually disintegrated into about a dozen independent provinces, each ruled by a powerful lord, or oligarch. Among them, Matthew Cs\u00e1k dominated the northwestern parts of Hungary (which now form the western territories of present-day Slovakia), Amadeus Aba controlled the northeastern lands, Ivan K\u0151szegi ruled Transdanubia, and Ladislaus K\u00e1n governed Transylvania. Most of those lords refused to accept Charles's rule and proposed the crown to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia's son and namesake, Wenceslaus, whose bride, Elisabeth, was Andrew\u00a0III's only daughter. Although Wenceslaus was crowned with the Holy Crown in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, the legitimacy of his coronation was also questionable because John Hont-P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny, Archbishop of Kalocsa, put the crown on Wenceslaus's head, although customary law authorized the Archbishop of Esztergom to perform the ceremony.\nAfter Wenceslaus's coronation, Charles withdrew to Ugrin Cs\u00e1k's domains in the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface sent his legate, Niccolo Boccasini, to Hungary. Boccasini convinced the majority of the Hungarian prelates to accept Charles's reign. However, most Hungarian lords continued to oppose Charles because, according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", they feared that \"the free men of the kingdom should lose their freedom by accepting a king appointed by the Church\". Charles laid siege to Buda, the capital of the kingdom, in September 1302, but Ivan K\u0151szegi relieved the siege. Charles's charters show that he primarily stayed in the southern parts of the kingdom during the next years although he also visited Amadeus Aba in the fortress of G\u00f6nc.\nPope Boniface who regarded Hungary as a fief of the Holy See declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31\u00a0May 1303. He also threatened Wenceslaus with excommunication if he continued to style himself king of Hungary. Wenceslaus, left Hungary in summer 1304, taking the Holy Crown with him. Charles met his cousin, Rudolph III of Austria, in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 24\u00a0August. After signing an alliance, they jointly invaded Bohemia in the autumn. Wenceslaus who had succeeded his father in Bohemia renounced his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria on 9\u00a0October 1305.\nOtto was crowned with the Holy Crown in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r on 6\u00a0December 1305 by Benedict R\u00e1d, Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m, and Anthony, Bishop of Csan\u00e1d. He was never able to strengthen his position in Hungary, because only the K\u0151szegis and the Transylvanian Saxons supported him. Charles seized Esztergom and many fortresses in the northern parts of Hungary (now in Slovakia) in 1306. His partisans also occupied Buda in June 1307. Ladislaus K\u00e1n, Voivode of Transylvania, seized and imprisoned Otto in Transylvania. An assembly of Charles's partisans confirmed Charles's claim to the throne on 10\u00a0October, but three powerful lords\u2014Matthew Cs\u00e1k, Ladislaus K\u00e1n, and Ivan K\u0151szegi\u2014were absent from the meeting. In 1308, Ladislaus K\u00e1n released Otto, who then left Hungary. Otto never ceased styling himself King of Hungary, but he never returned to the country.\nPope Clement V sent a new papal legate, Gentile Portino da Montefiore, to Hungary. Montefiore arrived in the summer of 1308. In the next few months, he persuaded the most powerful lords one by one to accept Charles's rule. At the Diet, which was held in the Dominican monastery in Pest, Charles was unanimously proclaimed king on 27\u00a0November 1308. The delegates sent by Matthew Cs\u00e1k and Ladislaus K\u00e1n were also present at the assembly.\nReign.\nWars against the oligarchs (1308\u20131323).\nThe papal legate convoked the synod of the Hungarian prelates, who declared the monarch inviolable in December 1308. They also urged Ladislaus K\u00e1n to hand over the Holy Crown to Charles. After K\u00e1n refused to do so, the legate consecrated a new crown for Charles. Thomas II, Archbishop of Esztergom crowned Charles king with the new crown in the Church of Our Lady in Buda on 15 or 16\u00a0June 1309. However, most Hungarians regarded his second coronation invalid. The papal legate excommunicated Ladislaus K\u00e1n, who finally agreed to give the Holy Crown to Charles. On 27\u00a0August 1310, Archbishop Thomas of Esztergom put the Holy Crown on Charles's head in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r; thus, Charles's third coronation was performed in full accordance with customary law. However, his rule remained nominal in most parts of his kingdom.\nMatthew Cs\u00e1k laid siege Buda in June 1311, and Ladislaus K\u00e1n declined to assist the king. Charles sent an army to invade Matthew Cs\u00e1k's domains in September, but it achieved nothing. In the same year, Ugrin Cs\u00e1k died, enabling Charles to take possession of the deceased lord's domains, which were situated between Po\u017eega in Slavonia and Temesv\u00e1r (present-day Timi\u0219oara in Romania). The burghers of Kassa (now Ko\u0161ice in Slovakia) assassinated Amadeus Aba in September 1311. Charles's envoys arbitrated an agreement between Aba's sons and the town, which also prescribed that the Abas withdraw from two counties and allow the noblemen inhabiting their domains to freely join Charles. However, the Abas soon entered into an alliance with Matthew Cs\u00e1k against the king. The united forces of the Abas and Matthew Cs\u00e1k besieged Kassa, but Charles routed them in the Battle of Rozgony (now Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15\u00a0June 1312. Almost half of the noblemen who had served Amadeus Aba fought on Charles's side in the battle. In July, Charles captured the Abas' many fortresses in Aba\u00faj, Torna and S\u00e1ros counties, including F\u00fcz\u00e9r, Reg\u00e9c, and Munk\u00e1cs (now Mukacheve in Ukraine). Thereafter he waged war against Matthew Cs\u00e1k, capturing Nagyszombat (now Trnava in Slovakia) in 1313 and Visegr\u00e1d in 1315, but was unable to win a decisive victory.\nCharles transferred his residence from Buda to Temesv\u00e1r in early 1315. Ladislaus K\u00e1n died in 1315, but his sons did not yield to Charles. Charles launched a campaign against the K\u0151szegis in Transdanubia and Slavonia in the first half of 1316. Local noblemen joined the royal troops, which contributed to the quick collapse of the K\u0151szegis' rule in southern parts of their domains. Meanwhile, James Borsa made an alliance against Charles with Ladislaus K\u00e1n's sons and other lords, including Mojs \u00c1kos and Peter, son of Petenye. They offered the crown to Andrew of Galicia. Charles's troops, which were under the command of a former supporter of the Borsas, D\u00f3zsa Debreceni, defeated the rebels' united troops at Debrecen at the end of June. In the next two months, many fortresses of Borsa and his allies fell to the royal troops in Bihar, Szolnok, Borsod and Kolozs counties. No primary source has made reference to Charles's bravery or heroic acts, suggesting that he rarely fought in person in the battles and sieges. However, he had excellent strategic skills: it was always Charles who appointed the fortresses to be besieged.\nStefan Dragutin, who controlled the Szer\u00e9ms\u00e9g, Macs\u00f3 and other regions along the southern borders of Hungary, died in 1316. Charles confirmed the right of Stefan Dragutin's son, Vladislav, to succeed his father and declared Vladislav the lawful ruler of Serbia against Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin. However, Stefan Uro\u0161 II captured Vladislav and invaded the Szer\u00e9ms\u00e9g. Charles launched a counter-campaign across the river Sz\u00e1va and seized the fortress of Macs\u00f3. In May 1317, Charles's army suppressed the Abas' revolt, seizing Ungv\u00e1r and Nevicke Castle (present-day Uzhhorod and Nevytsky Castle in Ukraine) from them. After that, Charles invaded Matthew Cs\u00e1k's domains and captured Kom\u00e1rom (now Kom\u00e1rno in Slovakia) on 3\u00a0November 1317. After his uncle, King Robert of Naples, granted the Principality of Salerno and the domain of Monte Sant'Angelo to his brother (Charles's younger uncle), John, Charles protested and laid claim to those domains, previously held by his father.\nAfter Charles neglected to reclaim Church property that Matthew Cs\u00e1k had seized by force, the prelates of the realm made an alliance in early 1318 against all who would jeopardize their interests. Upon their demand, Charles held a Diet in summer, but refused to confirm the Golden Bull of 1222. Before the end of the year, the prelates made a complaint against Charles because he had taken possession of Church property. In 1319, Charles fell so seriously ill that the pope authorized Charles's confessor to absolve him from his all sins before he died, but Charles recovered. In the same year, D\u00f3zsa Debreceni, whom Charles had made voivode of Transylvania, launched successful expeditions against Ladislaus K\u00e1n's sons and their allies, and Charles's future Judge royal, Alexander K\u00f6cski, seized the K\u0151szegis' six fortresses. In summer, Charles launched an expedition against Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin, during which he retook Belgrade and restored the Banate of Macs\u00f3. The last Diet during Charles's reign was held in 1320; following that, he failed to convoke the yearly public judicial sessions, contravening the provisions of the Golden Bull.\nMatthew Cs\u00e1k died on 18\u00a0March 1321. The royal army invaded the deceased lord's province, which soon disintegrated because most of his former castellans yielded without resistance. Charles personally led the siege of Cs\u00e1k's former seat, Trencs\u00e9n (now Tren\u010d\u00edn in Slovakia), which fell on 8\u00a0August. About three months later, Charles's new voivode of Transylvania, Thomas Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi, seized Csics\u00f3 (present-day Ciceu-Corabia in Romania), the last fortress of Ladislaus K\u00e1n's sons.\nIn January 1322, two Dalmatian towns, \u0160ibenik and Trogir, rebelled against Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107, who was a son of Charles's one-time leading partisan, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107. The two towns also accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice although Charles had urged Venice not to intervene in the conflict between his subjects. Many Croatian lords (including his own brother, Paul II \u0160ubi\u0107) also turned against Mladen, and their coalition defeated him at Klis. In September, Charles marched to Croatia where all the Croatian lords who were opposed to Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107 yielded to him in Knin. Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107 also visited Charles, but the king had the powerful lord imprisoned.\nConsolidation and reforms (1323\u20131330).\nAs one of his charters concluded, Charles had taken \"full possession\" of his kingdom by 1323. In the first half of the year, he moved his capital from Temesv\u00e1r to Visegr\u00e1d in the centre of his kingdom. In the same year, the Dukes of Austria renounced Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia), which they had controlled for decades, in exchange for the support they had received from Charles against Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1322.\nRoyal power was only nominally restored in the lands between the Carpathian Mountains and the Lower Danube, which had been united under a voivode, known as Basarab, by the early 1320s. Although Basarab was willing to accept Charles's suzerainty in a peace treaty signed in 1324, he refrained from renouncing control of the lands he had occupied in the Banate of Severin. Charles also attempted to reinstate royal authority in Croatia and Slavonia. He dismissed the Ban of Slavonia, John Baboni\u0107, replacing him with Mikcs \u00c1kos in 1325. Ban Mikcs invaded Croatia to subjugate the local lords who had seized the former castles of Mladen Subi\u0107 without the king's approval, but one of the Croatian lords, Ivan I Nelipac, routed the ban's troops in 1326. Consequently, royal power remained only nominal in Croatia during Charles's reign. The Baboni\u0107i and the K\u0151szegis rose up in open rebellion in 1327, but Ban Mikcs and Alexander K\u00f6cski defeated them. In retaliation, at least eight fortresses of the rebellious lords were confiscated in Slavonia and Transdanubia.\nThrough his victory over the oligarchs, Charles acquired about 60% of the Hungarian castles, along with the estates belonging to them. In 1323, he set about revising his previous land grants, which enabled him to reclaim former royal estates. During his reign, special commissions were set up to detect royal estates that had been unlawfully acquired by their owners. Charles refrained from making perpetual grants to his partisans. Instead, he applied a system of \"office fiefs\" (or \"honors\"), whereby his officials were entitled to enjoy all revenues accrued from their offices, but only for the time they held those offices. That system assured the preponderance of royal power, enabling Charles to rule \"with the plenitude of power\", as he emphasized in one of his charters of 1335. He even ignored customary law: for instance, \"promoting a daughter to a son\", which entitled her to inherit her father's estates instead of her male cousins. Charles also took control of the administration of the Church in Hungary. He appointed the Hungarian prelates at will, without allowing the cathedral chapters to elect them.\nHe promoted the spread of chivalrous culture in his realms. He regularly held tournaments and introduced the new ranks of \"page of the royal court\" and \"knight of the royal court\". Charles was the first monarch to create a secular order of knighthood by establishing the Order of Saint George in 1326. He was the first Hungarian king to grant helmet crests to his faithful followers to distinguish them from others \"by means of an \"insignium\" of their own\", as he emphasized in one of his charters.\nCharles reorganized and improved the administration of royal revenues. During his reign, five new \"chambers\" (administrative bodies headed by German, Italian or Hungarian merchants) were established for the control and collection of royal revenues from coinage, monopolies and custom duties. In 1327, he partially abolished the royal monopoly of gold mining, giving one third of the royal revenues from the gold extracted from a newly opened mine to the owner of the land where that mine was discovered. In the next few years, new gold mines were opened at K\u00f6rm\u00f6cb\u00e1nya (now Kremnica in Slovakia), Nagyb\u00e1nya (present-day Baia Mare in Romania) and Aranyosb\u00e1nya (now Baia de Arie\u0219 in Romania). Hungarian mines yielded about of gold around 1330, which made up more than 30% of the world's total production. The minting of gold coins began under Charles's auspices in the lands north of the Alps in Europe. His florins, which were modelled on the gold coins of Florence, were first issued in 1326.\nInternal peace and increasing royal revenues strengthened the international position of Hungary in the 1320s. On 13\u00a0February 1327, Charles and John of Bohemia signed an alliance in Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava in Slovakia) against the Habsburgs, who had occupied Pressburg. In the summer of 1328 Hungarian and Bohemian troops invaded Austria and routed the Austrian army on the banks of the Leitha River. On 21 September 1328, Charles signed a peace treaty with the three dukes of Austria (Frederick the Fair, Albert the Lame, and Otto the Merry), who renounced Pressburg and the Murak\u00f6z (now Me\u0111imurje in Croatia). The following year, Serbian troops laid siege to Belgrade, but Charles relieved the fortress.\nAlliance with his father-in-law, W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a permanent element of Charles's foreign policy in the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, W\u0142adys\u0142aw\u00a0I sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegr\u00e1d in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Clara Z\u00e1h, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17\u00a0April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Z\u00e1h, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegr\u00e1d with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. Z\u00e1h wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Clara, Felician Z\u00e1h's children were tortured to death; Clara's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.\nActive foreign policy (1330\u20131339).\nIn September 1330, Charles launched a military expedition against Basarab I of Wallachia who had attempted to get rid of his suzerainty. After seizing the fortress of Severin (present-day Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), he refused to make peace with Basarab and marched towards Curtea de Arge\u0219, which was Basarab's seat. The Wallachians applied scorched earth tactics, compelling Charles to make a truce with Basarab and withdraw his troops from Wallachia. While the royal troops were marching through a narrow pass across the Southern Carpathians on 9\u00a0November, the Wallachians ambushed them. During the next four days, the royal army was decimated; Charles could only escape from the battlefield after changing his clothes with one of his knights, Desiderius H\u00e9derv\u00e1ri, who sacrificed his life to enable the king's escape. Charles did not attempt a new invasion of Wallachia, which subsequently developed into an independent principality.\nIn September 1331, Charles made an alliance with Otto the Merry, Duke of Austria, against Bohemia. He also sent reinforcements to Poland to fight against the Teutonic Knights and the Bohemians. In 1332 he signed a peace treaty with John of Bohemia and mediated a truce between Bohemia and Poland. In 1332 Charles allowed the collection of the papal tithe (the tenth part of the Church revenues) in his realms only after the Holy See agreed to give one third of the money collected to him. After years of negotiations, Charles visited his uncle, Robert, in Naples in July 1333. Two months later, Charles's son, Andrew, was betrothed to Robert's granddaughter, Joanna, who had been made her grandfather's heir. Charles returned to Hungary in early 1334. In retaliation for a previous Serbian raid, he invaded Serbia and captured the fortress of Galamb\u00f3c (now Golubac in Serbia).\nIn summer 1335, the delegates of John of Bohemia and the new King of Poland, Casimir III, entered into negotiations in Trencs\u00e9n to put an end to the conflicts between the two countries. With Charles's mediation, a compromise was reached on 24\u00a0August: John of Bohemia renounced his claim to Poland and Casimir of Poland acknowledged John of Bohemia's suzerainty in Silesia. On 3\u00a0September, Charles signed an alliance with John of Bohemia in Visegr\u00e1d, which was primarily formed against the Dukes of Austria. Upon Charles's invitation, John of Bohemia and Casimir of Poland met in Visegr\u00e1d in November. During the Congress of Visegr\u00e1d, the two rulers confirmed the compromise that their delegates had worked out in Trencs\u00e9n. Casimir\u00a0III also promised to pay 400,000 groschen to John of Bohemia, but a part of this indemnification (120,000 groschen) was finally paid off by Charles instead of his brother-in-law. The three rulers agreed upon a mutual defence union against the Habsburgs, and a new commercial route was set up to enable merchants travelling between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire to bypass Vienna.\nThe Baboni\u0107i and the K\u0151szegis made an alliance with the Dukes of Austria in January 1336. John of Bohemia, who claimed Carinthia from the Habsburgs, invaded Austria in February. Casimir\u00a0III of Poland came to Austria to assist him in late June. Charles soon joined them at Marchegg. The dukes sought reconciliation and signed a peace treaty with John of Bohemia in July. Charles signed a truce with them on 13\u00a0December, and launched a new expedition against Austria early the next year. He forced the Baboni\u0107i and the K\u0151szegis to yield, and the latter were also compelled to hand over to him their fortresses along the frontier in exchange for faraway castles. Charles's peace treaty with Albert and Otto of Austria, which was signed on 11\u00a0September 1337, forbade both the dukes and Charles to give shelter to the other party's rebellious subjects.\nCharles continued the reform of coinage in the late 1330s. In 1336, he abolished the compulsory exchange of old coins for newly issued coins for villagers, but introduced a new tax, the chamber's profit, to compensate the loss of royal revenues. Two years later, Charles ordered the minting of a new silver penny and prohibited payments made in foreign coins or silver bars.\nJohn of Bohemia's heir, Charles, Margrave of Moravia, visited Charles in Visegr\u00e1d in early 1338. The margrave acknowledged the right of Charles's son, Louis, to inherit Poland if Casimir\u00a0III died without a son in exchange for Charles's promise to persuade Casimir\u00a0III not to invade Silesia. Two leading Polish lords, Zbigniew, chancellor of Cracow, and Spycimir Leliwita, also supported this plan and persuaded Casimir\u00a0III, who lost his first wife on 26\u00a0May 1339, to start negotiations with Charles. In July, Casimir came to Hungary and designated his sister (Charles's wife), Elizabeth, and her sons as his heirs. On his sons' behalf, Charles promised that they would make every effort to reconquer all lands that Poland had lost and that they would refrain from employing foreigners in Poland.\nLast years (1339\u20131342).\nCharles obliged the K\u0151szegis to renounce their last fortresses along the western borders of the kingdom in 1339 or 1340. He divided the large Z\u00f3lyom County (now in Slovakia), which had been dominated by a powerful local lord, Donch, into three smaller counties in 1340. The following year, Charles also forced Donch to renounce his two fortresses in Z\u00f3lyom in exchange for one castle in the distant Kraszna County (in present-day Romania). Around the same time, Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia, invaded Sirmium and captured Belgrade.\nCharles was ailing during the last years of his life. He died in Visegr\u00e1d on 16\u00a0July 1342. His corpse was first delivered to Buda where a Mass was said for his soul. From Buda, his corpse was taken to Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. He was buried in the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Basilica a month after his death. His brother-in-law, Casimir\u00a0III of Poland, and Charles, Margrave of Moravia, were present at his funeral, an indication of Charles's international prestige.\nFamily.\nThe \"Anonymi descriptio Europae orientalis\" (\"An Anonymous' Description of Eastern Europe\"), written in the first half of 1308, claims that \"the daughter of the strapping Duke of Ruthenia, Leo, has recently married Charles, King of Hungary\". Charles also stated in a charter of 1326 that he once travelled to \"Ruthenia\" (or Halych-Lodomeria) in order to bring his first wife back to Hungary. A charter issued on 23\u00a0June 1326 referred to Charles's wife, Queen Mary. Historian Gyula Krist\u00f3 says, the three documents show that Charles married a daughter of Leo II of Galicia in late 1305 or early 1306. Historian Enik\u0151 Csukovits accepts Krist\u00f3's interpretation, but she writes that Mary of Galicia most probably died before the marriage. The Polish scholar, Stanis\u0142aw Sroka, rejects Krist\u00f3's interpretation, stating that Leo I\u2014who was born in 1292, according to him\u2014could hardly have fathered Charles's first wife. In accordance with previous academic consensus, Sroka says that Charles's first wife was Mary of Bytom from the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty.\nThe \"Illuminated Chronicle\" stated that Charles's \"first consort, Maria\u00a0... was of the Polish nation\" and she was \"the daughter of Duke Casimir\". Sroka proposes that Mary of Bytom married Charles in 1306, but Krist\u00f3 writes that their marriage probably took place in the first half of 1311. The \"Illuminated Chronicle\" recorded that she died on 15\u00a0December 1317, but a royal charter issued on 12\u00a0July 1318 stated that her husband made a land grant with her consent. Charles's next\u2014second or third\u2014wife was Beatrice of Luxembourg, who was a daughter of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, and the sister of John, King of Bohemia. Their marriage took place before the end of February 1319. She died in childbirth in early November in the same year. Charles's last wife, Elisabeth, daughter of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I, King of Poland, was born around 1306. Their marriage took place on 6\u00a0July 1320.\nMost 14th-century Hungarian chroniclers write that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland had five sons. Their first son, Charles, was born in 1321 and died in the same year according to the \"Illuminated Chronicle\". However, a charter of June 1323 states that the child had died in this month. The second son of Charles and Elisabeth, Ladislaus, was born in 1324. The marriage of Ladislaus and Anne, a daughter of King John of Bohemia, was planned by their parents, but Ladislaus died in 1329. Charles's and Elisabeth's third son, Louis, who was born in 1326, survived his father and succeeded him as King of Hungary. His younger brothers, Andrew and Stephen, who were born in 1327 and 1332, respectively, also survived Charles.\nAlthough no contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous sources made mention of any further children, Charles may have fathered two daughters, according to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Krist\u00f3. Zsuzsa Teke writes that they were born to Mary of Bytom, but the nearly contemporaneous Peter of Zittau wrote that she had died childless. Gyula Krist\u00f3 proposes that a miniature in the \"Illuminated Chronicle\", which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children, implies that she gave birth to Charles's two daughters, because Krist\u00f3 identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters. The elder of Charles's two possible daughters, Catherine, who was born in the early 1320s, was the wife of Henry II, Duke of \u015awidnica. Their only daughter, Anne, grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents' death, implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents. Historian Kazimierz Jasi\u0144ski says that Elisabeth, the wife of Boleslaus\u00a0II of Troppau, was also Charles's daughter. If she was actually Charles's daughter, she must have been born in about 1330, according to Krist\u00f3.\nCharles also fathered an illegitimate son, Coloman, who was born in early 1317. His mother was a daughter of Gurke Cs\u00e1k. Coloman was elected Bishop of Gy\u0151r in 1336.\nLegacy.\nCharles often declared that his principal aim was the \"restoration of the ancient good conditions\" of the kingdom.\nOn his coat-of-arms, he united the \"\u00c1rp\u00e1d stripes\" with the motifs of the coat-of-arms of his paternal family, which emphasized his kinship with the first royal house of Hungary. During his reign, Charles reunited Hungary and introduced administrative and fiscal reforms. He bequeathed to his son, Louis the Great, a \"bulging exchequer and an effective system of taxation\", according to scholar Bryan Cartledge. Nevertheless, Louis the Great's achievements overshadowed Charles's reputation.\nThe only contemporaneous record of Charles's deeds were made by a Franciscan friar who was hostile towards the monarch. Instead of emphasizing Charles's achievements in the reunification of the country, the friar described in detail the negative episodes of Charles's reign. In particular, the unusual cruelty that the king showed after Felician Z\u00e1h's assassination attempt on the royal family contributed to the negative picture of Charles's personality. The Franciscan friar attributed Charles's defeat by Basarab of Wallachia as a punishment from God for the king's revenge.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70228", "revid": "6488475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70228", "title": "United States courts of appeals", "text": "Post-1891 U.S. appellate circuit courts\nThe United States courts of appeals are the intermediate appellate courts of the United States federal judiciary. They hear appeals of cases from the United States district courts and some U.S. administrative agencies, and their decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. The courts of appeals are divided into 13 \"Circuits\". Eleven of the circuits are numbered \"First\" through \"Eleventh\" and cover geographic areas of the United States and hear appeals from the U.S. district courts within their borders. The District of Columbia Circuit covers only Washington, DC. The Federal Circuit hears appeals from federal courts across the entire United States in cases involving certain specialized areas of law. \nThe United States courts of appeals are considered the most powerful and influential courts in the United States after the Supreme Court. Because of their ability to set legal precedent in regions that cover millions of Americans, the United States courts of appeals have strong policy influence on U.S. law. Moreover, because the Supreme Court chooses to review fewer than 3% of the 7,000 to 8,000 cases filed with it annually, the U.S. courts of appeals as a practical matter serve as the final arbiter on the vast majority of federal cases.\nThere are 179 judgeships on the U.S. courts of appeals authorized by Congress in \u00a0https:// pursuant to Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Like other federal judges, they are nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. They have lifetime tenure, earning (as of 2023) an annual salary of $246,600. The actual number of judges in service varies, both because of vacancies and because senior judges who continue to hear cases are not counted against the number of authorized judgeships.\nDecisions of the U.S. courts of appeals have been published by the private company West Publishing in the \"Federal Reporter\" series since the courts were established. Only decisions that the courts designate for publication are included. The \"unpublished\" opinions (of all but the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits) are published separately in West's \"Federal Appendix\", and they are also available in on-line databases like LexisNexis or Westlaw. More recently, court decisions have also been made available electronically on official court websites. However, there are also a few federal court decisions that are classified for national security reasons.\nThe circuit with the fewest appellate judges is the First Circuit, and the one with the most appellate judges is the geographically large and populous Ninth Circuit in the West. The number of judges that the U.S. Congress has authorized for each circuit is set forth by law in \u00a0https://, while the places where those judges must regularly sit to hear appeals are prescribed in \u00a0https://.\nAlthough the courts of appeals are frequently called \"circuit courts\", they should not be confused with the former United States circuit courts, which were active from 1789 through 1911, during the time when long-distance transportation was much less available, and which were primarily first-level federal trial courts that moved periodically from place to place in \"circuits\" in order to serve the dispersed population in towns and the smaller cities that existed then. The \"courts of appeals\" system was established in the Judiciary Act of 1891.\nProcedure.\nBecause the courts of appeals possess only appellate jurisdiction, they do not hold trials. Only courts with original jurisdiction hold trials and thus determine punishments (in criminal cases) and remedies (in civil cases). Instead, appeals courts review decisions of trial courts for errors of law. Accordingly, an appeals court considers only the record (that is, the papers the parties filed and the transcripts and any exhibits from any trial) from the trial court, and the legal arguments of the parties. These arguments, which are presented in written form and can range in length from dozens to hundreds of pages, are known as briefs. Sometimes lawyers are permitted to add to their written briefs with oral arguments before the appeals judges. At such hearings, only the parties' lawyers speak to the court.\nThe rules that govern the procedure in the courts of appeals are the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. In a court of appeals, an appeal is almost always heard by a \"panel\" of three judges who are randomly selected from the available judges (including senior judges and judges temporarily assigned to the circuit). Some cases, however, receive an \"en banc\" hearing. Except in the Ninth Circuit Court, the \"en banc\" court consists of all of the circuit judges who are on active status, but it does not include the senior or assigned judges (except that under some circumstances, a senior judge may participate in an \"en banc\" hearing who participated at an earlier stage of the same case). Because of the large number of Appellate Judges in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (29), only ten judges, chosen at random, and the Chief Judge hear \"en banc\" cases. The strong emphasis on collective judicial participation distinguishes the en banc procedure in the United States courts of appeals from the use of extended judicial formations in other legal systems, where such bodies often serve different institutional purposes.\nMany decades ago, certain classes of federal court cases held the right of an automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. That is, one of the parties in the case could appeal a decision of a court of appeals to the Supreme Court, and it had to accept the case. The right of automatic appeal for most types of decisions of a court of appeals was ended by an Act of Congress, the Judiciary Act of 1925, which also reorganized many other things in the federal court system. Passage of this law was urged by Chief Justice William Howard Taft.\nThe current procedure is that a party in a case may apply to the Supreme Court to review a ruling of the circuit court. This is called petitioning for a writ of certiorari, and the Supreme Court may choose, in its sole discretion, to review any lower court ruling. In extremely rare cases, the Supreme Court may grant the writ of certiorari before the judgment is rendered by the court of appeals, thereby reviewing the lower court's ruling directly. Certiorari before judgment was granted in the Watergate scandal-related case, \"United States v. Nixon\", and in the 2005 decision involving the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, \"United States v. Booker\".\nA court of appeals may also pose questions to the Supreme Court for a ruling in the midst of reviewing a case. This procedure was formerly used somewhat commonly, but now it is quite rare. For example, while between 1937 and 1946 twenty 'certificate' cases were accepted, since 1947 the Supreme Court has accepted only four. The Second Circuit, sitting \"en banc\", attempted to use this procedure in the case \"United States v. Penaranda\", 375 F.3d 238 (2d Cir. 2004), as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in \"Blakely v. Washington\", but the Supreme Court dismissed the question. The last instance of the Supreme Court accepting a set of questions and answering them was in 1982's \"City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc\".\nA court of appeals may convene a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel to hear appeals in bankruptcy cases directly from the bankruptcy court of its circuit. As of 2008[ [update]], only the First, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have established a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. Those circuits that do not have a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel have their bankruptcy appeals heard by the district court.\nCourts of appeals decisions, unlike those of the lower federal courts, establish binding precedents. Other federal courts in that circuit must, from that point forward, follow the appeals court's guidance in similar cases, regardless of whether the trial judge thinks that the case should be decided differently.\nFederal and state laws can and do change from time to time, depending on the actions of Congress and the state legislatures. Therefore, the law that exists at the time of the appeal might be different from the law that existed at the time of the events that are in controversy under civil or criminal law in the case at hand. A court of appeals applies the law as it exists at the time of the appeal; otherwise, it would be handing down decisions that would be instantly obsolete, and this would be a waste of time and resources, since such decisions could not be cited as precedent. \"[A] court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice, or there is statutory direction or some legislative history to the contrary.\"\nHowever, the above rule cannot apply in criminal cases if the effect of applying the newer law would be to create an \"ex post facto\" law to the detriment of the defendant.\nDecisions made by the circuit courts only apply to the districts within the court's oversight, though other courts may use the guidance issued by the circuit court in their own judgments. While a single case can only be heard by one circuit court, a core legal principle may be tried through multiple cases in separate circuit courts, creating an inconsistency between different parts of the United States. This creates a split decision among the circuit courts. Often, if there is a split decision between two or more circuits, and a related case is petitioned to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will take that case to resolve the split.\nAttorneys.\nIn order to serve as counsel in a case appealed to a circuit court, the attorney must first be admitted to the bar of that circuit. Admission to the bar of a circuit court is granted as a matter of course to any attorney who is admitted to practice law in any state of the United States. The attorney submits an application, pays a fee, and takes the oath of admission. Local practice varies as to whether the oath is given in writing or in open court before a judge of the circuit, and most courts of appeals allow the applicant to choose which method they prefer.\nNomenclature.\nWhen the courts of appeals were created in 1891, one was created for each of the nine circuits then existing, and each court was named the \"United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit\". When a court of appeals was created for the District of Columbia in 1893, it was named the \"Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\", and it was renamed to the \"United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\" in 1934. In 1948, Congress renamed all of the courts of appeals then existing to their current formal names: the court of appeals for each numbered circuit was named the \"United States Court of Appeals for the _____ Circuit\", and the \"United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\" became the \"United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\". The Tenth Circuit was created in 1929 by subdividing the existing Eighth Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit was created in 1981 by subdividing the existing Fifth Circuit. The Federal Circuit was created in 1982 by the merger of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims.\nJudicial councils.\nJudicial councils are panels in each circuit that are charged with making \"necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice\" within their circuits. Among their responsibilities is judicial discipline, the formulation of circuit policy, the implementation of policy directives received from the Judicial Conference of the United States, and the annual submission of a report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on the number and nature of orders entered during the year that relate to judicial misconduct. Judicial councils consist of the chief judge of the circuit and an equal number of circuit judges and district judges of the circuit.\nCircuit composition.\nThe courts of appeals, and the lower courts and specific other bodies over which they have appellate jurisdiction, are as follows:\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCircuit population.\nBased on 2020 United States census figures, the population residing in each circuit is as follows.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe Judiciary Act of 1789 established three circuits, which were groups of judicial districts in which United States circuit courts were established. The original three circuits were given distinct names, rather than numbers: the Eastern, the Middle, and the Southern. Each circuit court consisted of two Supreme Court justices and the local district judge; the three circuits existed solely for the purpose of assigning the justices to a group of circuit courts. Some districts (generally the ones most difficult for an itinerant justice to reach) did not have a circuit court; in these districts the district court exercised the original jurisdiction of a circuit court. As new states were admitted to the Union, Congress often did not create circuit courts for them for a number of years.\nThe number of circuits remained unchanged until the year after Rhode Island ratified the Constitution, when the Midnight Judges Act reorganized the districts into six numbered circuits, and created circuit judgeships so that Supreme Court justices would no longer have to ride circuit. This Act, however, was repealed in March 1802, and Congress provided that the former circuit courts would be revived as of July 1 of that year. But it then passed the new Judiciary Act of 1802 in April, so that the revival of the old courts never took effect. The 1802 Act restored circuit riding, but with only one justice to a circuit; it therefore created six new circuits, but with slightly different compositions than the 1801 Act. These six circuits later were augmented by others. Until 1866, each new circuit (except the short-lived California Circuit) was accompanied by a newly created Supreme Court seat.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Trained in her youth as a painter, she published her first literary work in 1936 at age forty under a pseudonym, a satirical novel titled \"Through Darkest Pondelayo\". Her second novel, \"Time Without Clocks\", was published nearly thirty years later, and was a semi-autobiographical account of the early years of her marriage to artist Sir Daryl Lindsay.\nIn 1967, Lindsay published her most celebrated work, \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\", a historical Gothic novel detailing the vanishing of three schoolgirls and their teacher at the site of a monolith during one summer. The novel sparked critical and public interest for its ambivalent presentation as a true story as well as its vague conclusion, and is widely considered to be one of the most important Australian novels. It was adapted into a 1975 film of the same name.\nShe was also the author of several unpublished plays, and contributed essays, short stories, and poetry to numerous journals and publications throughout her career. After the death of Lindsay's husband in 1976, she spent her time involved in the local art community in Melbourne, and was involved in several exhibitions. Her last published work, \"Syd Sixpence\" (1982), was her first and only work of children's literature. Lindsay died of stomach cancer in 1984, after which her home was donated to the Australian National Trust; the Lindsay estate now operates as a museum with her and her husband Daryl's artwork and personal effects.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nJoan \u00e0 Beckett Weigall was born in St Kilda East, Victoria, Australia, a suburb of Melbourne, the third daughter of Theyre \u00e0 Beckett Weigall, a prominent judge. His cousin, William Arthur Callendar \u00e0 Beckett, was father to Emma Minnie Boyd and thus Lindsay was related to the Boyd family including writer Martin Boyd. Her mother, Ann Sophie Weigall (n\u00e9e Hamilton), was the daughter of the Scottish born Sir Robert Hamilton, a Governor of Tasmania; she was a musician born and raised in Dublin. Lindsay had two sisters, Mim and Nancy, and a brother, Theyre Jr. Lindsay spent her early years in a mansion called \"St Margaret's\", at 151 Alma Road, East St Kilda. She described her childhood as \"outwardly happy and uneventful.\"\nIn 1909 at the age of thirteen, Lindsay was sent to a local boarding school, then called Carhue, to complete her education. During Lindsay's time there the school went through a change in ownership and was renamed the Clyde Girls' Grammar School; she was a model student. The school was relocated to near Mount Macedon, five years after Joan's final year. After graduating from Clyde, Lindsay considered becoming an architect, but decided to study art instead, enrolling at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne in 1916. There, while studying painting, she was educated by Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin.\nIn 1920 she began sharing a Melbourne studio with Maie Ryan (later Lady Casey). Joan exhibited her watercolours and oils at two Melbourne exhibitions in 1920, one of which was titled \"The Neo-Pantechnicists\" and exhibited with the Victorian Artists Society. She and Casey also collaborated on an unfinished book together, titled \"Portrait of Anna\".\nMarriage to Daryl Lindsay; early works.\nWhile studying at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, she met fellow art student Daryl Lindsay. The two married in Marylebone, London, England on St. Valentine's Day 1922. The day was always a special occasion for her, and she set her most famous work, \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\", on St. Valentine's Day.\nWhen the couple returned to live in Australia, they renovated a farmhouse in Baxter \u2014 Mulberry Hill \u2014 and lived there until the Great Depression forced them to take up more humble lodgings in Bacchus Marsh, renting out their home until the economic situation improved. During this time, Lindsay shifted her focus from painting to writing, and wrote two plays, both of which explored the uncanny and the macabre \u2014 \"Cataract\", and \"Wolf!\", the latter of which was a collaboration with Margot Goyder and Ann Joske (\"Margot Neville\"), Australia's best-known detective story writers at the time. Though neither of the plays was published, \"Wolf!\" was performed on stage in Swanage, England in May 1930.\nAfter returning from travel in England and Europe, Lindsay published her first novel, \"Through Darkest Pondelayo: An account of the adventures of two English ladies on a cannibal island\", in 1936, under the pseudonym Serena Livingstone-Stanley. Published by Chatto &amp; Windus in the United Kingdom, the novel is structured as a parody of popular travel books of the time but filled with intentional grammatical errors, also functioning as a satire on English tourists abroad. According to Lindsay's cousin Martin Boyd, the novel was \"one of the best collections of malapropisms in the English language.\" Lindsay helped Boyd write the outline for his novel, \"Nuns in Jeopardy\" (1940).\nLindsay also contributed articles, reviews and stories to various magazines and newspapers on art, literature and prominent people. In 1928, she interviewed actress Margaret Bannerman for Victoria's \"The Weekly Courier\", and, in 1941, co-authored the \"History of the Australian Red Cross\" with husband Daryl. In 1942, Lindsay published an essay of literary criticism on novelist George Moore in \"The Age\", titled \"A Modern of the Nineties. George Moore: literary craftsman.\"\nDuring this period, Daryl Lindsay abandoned painting to become Director of the National Gallery of Victoria, a position he held between 1942 and 1955. The position necessitated their relocation to Melbourne until his retirement. They retained their country home during their Victoria sojourn. When Daryl was knighted in 1956, Joan became known as Lady Lindsay.\nHer semi-autobiographical novel \"Time Without Clocks\" describes her wedding and idyllic early married life. The work takes its title from a strange ability which Joan described herself as having, of stopping clocks and machinery when she came close. The title also plays on the idea that this period in her life was unstructured and free. This was followed with \"Facts Soft and Hard\", a humorous, semi-autobiographical account of the Lindsays' travels in the United States while Daryl was on a Fulbright Award, which took the couple to New York City on a study tour of American art collections held by the Carnegie Corporation.\n\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\".\n\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\", published in 1967, is Lindsay's best known work. Lindsay wrote the novel over a four-week period at her home Mulberry Hill in Baxter, on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula, and constructed it around the real-life Hanging Rock, a monolith that had fascinated her since her childhood. She compared the story to the work of Henry James, citing the \"book about the children in a haunted house with a governess\" (\"The Turn of the Screw\").\nThe novel is historical fiction, though Lindsay dropped hints that it was based on an actual event, and is framed as such in the novel's introduction. An ending that explained the girls' fates, in draft form, was excised by her publisher prior to publication. The final chapter was published only in 1987 as a standalone book titled \"The Secret of Hanging Rock\", and also included critical commentary and interpretive theories on the novel. Lindsay based Appleyard College, the setting for the novel, on the school that she had attended, Clyde Girls Grammar School (Clyde School), at East St Kilda, Melbourne\u2014which in 1919 was transferred to Woodend, Victoria, in the immediate vicinity of Hanging Rock.\nIn a 1974 interview, Lindsay addressed readers' and critics' questioning about the novel's ambiguous conclusion, saying:Well, it was written as a mystery and it remains a mystery. If you can draw your own conclusions, that's fine, but I don't think that it matters. I wrote that book as a sort of atmosphere of a place, and it was like dropping a stone into the water. I felt that story, if you call it a story\u2014that the thing that happened on St. Valentine's Day went on spreading, out and out and out, in circles.\nThe novel's ambiguous conclusion led to significant interest from both public and critical readers, and the novel has drawn comparisons from literary critics to the work of E.M. Forster and Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was made into a 1975 feature film by producers Patricia Lovell, Hal and Jim McElroy, and director Peter Weir, which was hailed as initiating the revival of Australian cinema. A re-printing of the novel in 1975 by Penguin Books in Australia sold over 350,000 copies, making it Penguin Australia's best-selling novel to date (second, overall, only to Albert Facey's autobiography, \"A Fortunate Life\").\nLater life and death.\nIn 1969, Lindsay suffered severe injuries in a car accident and she required months of convalescence. Daryl Lindsay died on Christmas Day 1976. Lady Lindsay's later years were spent invested in visual arts, with frequent visits to the Lyceum Club in Melbourne, and to the McClelland Gallery in Langwarrin, where she was involved in the local art community. She painted several works in her later years, and she was lauded by the art critic, Alan McCulloch.\nIn 1972, she reunited with Lady Maie Casey and held an art exhibition at the McLelland in Langwarrin. Artist Rick Amor and his children, who had lived in a cottage of Lindsay's property, led her to resurrect an unpublished children's book she had written, titled \"Syd Sixpence\", which she published in 1982. Amor supplied illustrations for the book, which tells the story of Syd, an anthropomorphic sixpence coin's adventures on the ocean floor. Lindsay also worked on another novel, entitled \"Love at the Billabong\", which was left unfinished.\nLindsay died of stomach cancer at Peninsula Private Hospital in Frankston, Melbourne on 23 December 1984, aged 88. She was cremated, and her ashes are interred at Creswick Cemetery in Creswick, Shire of Hepburn in Victoria, Australia. As the Lindsays had no children, their Mulberry Hill home in Langwarrin South, Victoria was donated at her wishes to the National Trust upon her death. The Mulberry Hill estate is open to the public for self-guided tours, and contains both Joan and Daryl Lindsay's original artwork and personal possessions.\nLindsay's visual artwork has been exhibited posthumously as part of the National Women's Art Exhibition in Australia.\nIn 2025, foremost Australian biographer, Brenda Niall published Lindsay's biography, \"Joan Lindsay. The hidden life of the woman who wrote\" Picnic at Hanging Rock.\nBibliography.\nBibliography adapted from the State Library Victoria archive.\nUnpublished works.\nPlays\nNovels and memoirs\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

But unlike U.S. state courts, federal district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and can only hear cases that involve disputes between residents of different states, questions of federal law, or federal crimes.\nLegal basis.\nUnlike the U.S. Supreme Court, which was expressly established by Article III of the Constitution, the district courts were established by Congress pursuant to authority delegated by Article III through the enacting of a federal statute, the Judiciary Act of 1789. There is no constitutional requirement that district courts exist at all.\nDuring the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, some opponents of a strong federal judiciary argued that the federal courts ought to be limited to the Supreme Court, which would hear appeals only from state courts. In other words, the state courts would be treated as federal tribunals under Article I of the Constitution for the purpose of hearing disputes under federal law, but their judges would not become officers of the federal government. Edward Carrington advocated this position in a letter to James Madison, and it was also discussed by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 81. However, this view did not prevail, and the first Congress created the district court system that is still in place today. Pursuant to the Constitution, nonetheless, state courts retain the power of concurrent jurisdiction in most federal matters.\nWhen the Act was first passed, there were thirteen districts created among the eleven states which had ratified the Constitution by that point. When North Carolina and Rhode Island voted to ratify, a district was created for each of them, bringing the number of districts to fifteen.\nThe territories (insular areas) of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands each have one territorial court; these courts are called \"district courts\" and exercise the same jurisdiction as district courts, but differ from district courts in that territorial courts are Article IV courts, with judges who serve ten-year terms rather than the lifetime tenure of judges of Article III courts, such as the district court judges.\nAmerican Samoa having neither a district court nor a federal territorial court, its federal cases are sent either to the District of Columbia or Hawaii. The Philippines, previously part of the United States, were never part of the U.S. federal court system.\nGeography.\nThere are 89 districts in the 50 states, with a total of 94 districts including territories. There is at least one judicial district for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\nEach state has between one and four districts. For states with multiple districts, they are named geographically. States with two districts all give them either Northern\u2013Southern or Western\u2013Eastern designations. Most states with three districts add a Middle District, with two exceptions: Illinois has a Central District instead of a Middle District, and Oklahoma has Northern, Western, and Eastern Districts. Of the three states with four districts, New York and Texas use all four directional designations, while California has a Central District and no Western District.\nOther federal trial courts.\nThere are other federal trial courts that have nationwide jurisdiction over certain types of cases, but the district court also has concurrent jurisdiction over many of those cases, and the district court is the only one with jurisdiction over civilian criminal cases.\nThe United States Court of International Trade addresses cases involving international trade and customs issues. The United States Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over most claims for money damages against the United States, including disputes over federal contracts, unlawful takings of private property by the federal government, and suits for injury on federal property or by a federal employee. The United States Tax Court has jurisdiction over contested pre-assessment determinations of taxes.\nJudges.\nA judge of a United States district court is officially titled a \"United States District Judge\". Other federal judges, including circuit judges and Supreme Court justices, can also sit in a district court upon assignment by the chief judge of the circuit or by the Chief Justice of the United States. The number of judges in each district court (and the structure of the judicial system generally) is set by Congress in the United States Code. The president appoints the federal judges for terms of good behavior (subject to the advice and consent of the Senate), so the nominees often share at least some of his or her convictions. In states represented by a senator of the president's party, the senator (or the more senior of them if both senators are of the president's party) has substantial input into the nominating process, and through a tradition known as senatorial courtesy can exercise an unofficial veto over a nominee unacceptable to the senator.\nFederal magistrate judges are appointed by each district court pursuant to statute. They are appointed for an eight-year term and may be reappointed for additional eight-year terms. A magistrate judge may be removed \"for incompetency, misconduct, neglect of duty, or physical or mental disability\". A magistrate judgeship may be a stepping stone to a district judgeship nomination.\nDistrict judges usually concentrate on managing their court's overall caseload, supervising trials, and writing opinions in response to important motions like the motion for summary judgment. Since the 1960s, routine tasks like resolving discovery disputes can, in the district judge's discretion, be referred to magistrate judges. Magistrate judges can also be requested to prepare reports and recommendations on contested matters for the district judge's consideration or, with the consent of all parties, to assume complete jurisdiction over a case including conducting the trial.\nWith the exception of the territorial courts (Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands), federal district judges are Article III judges appointed for life, and can be removed involuntarily only when they violate the standard of \"good behavior\". The sole method of involuntary removal of a judge is through impeachment by the United States House of Representatives followed by a trial in the United States Senate and a conviction by a two-thirds vote. Otherwise, a judge, even if convicted of a felony criminal offense by a jury, is entitled to hold office until retirement or death. In the history of the United States, twelve judges have been impeached by the House, and seven have been removed following conviction in the Senate. (For a table that includes the twelve impeached judges, see Impeachment in the United States.)\nA judge who has reached the age of 65 (or has become disabled) may retire or elect to go on senior status and keep working. Such senior judges are not counted in the quota of active judges for the district and do only whatever work they are assigned by the chief judge of the district, but they keep their offices (called \"chambers\") and staff, and many of them work full-time.\nAs of 2010, there were 678 authorized district court judgeships.\nA federal judge is addressed in writing as \"The Honorable John/Jane Doe\" or \"Hon. John/Jane Doe\" and in speech as \"Judge\" or \"Judge Doe\" or, when presiding in court, \"Your Honor\".\nClerks.\nEach district court appoints a clerk, who is responsible for overseeing filings made with the court, maintaining the court's records, processing fees, fines, and restitution, and managing the non-judicial work of the court, including information technology, budget, procurement, human resources, and financial. Clerks may appoint deputies, clerical assistants, and employees to carry out the work of the court. The clerk of each district court must reside in the district for which the clerk is appointed, except that the clerk of the District of Columbia and the clerk of the Southern District of New York may reside within twenty miles of their respective districts.\nThe Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized the Supreme Court and the judge of each U.S. District Court to appoint a clerk to assist with the administration of federal judicial business in those courts. The clerk for each district court was to also serve as clerk of the corresponding circuit court. The Judiciary Act required each clerk to issue the writs summoning jurors and \"to record the decrees, judgments and determinations of the court of which he is clerk.\"\nThe Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 751) provides that the clerk is appointed, and may be removed, by the court. The clerk's duties are prescribed by the statute, by the court's customs and practices, and by policy established by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The clerk is appointed by order of the court en banc to serve the entire court. The role of the clerk and deputies or assistants should not be confused with the judges' law clerks, who assist the judges by conducting research and preparing drafts of opinions.\nTo be eligible to serve as a clerk, a person must have a minimum of 10 years of progressively responsible administrative experience in public service or business that provides a thorough understanding of organizational, procedural, and human aspects of managing an organization, and at least 3 of the 10 years must have been in a position of substantial management responsibility. An attorney may substitute the active practice of law on a year-for-year basis for the management or administrative experience requirement. Clerks do not have to be licensed attorneys, but some courts specify that a law degree is a preference for employment.\nJurisdiction.\nUnlike some state courts, the power of federal courts to hear cases and controversies is strictly limited. Federal courts may not decide every case that happens to come before them. In order for a district court to entertain a lawsuit, Congress must first grant the court subject matter jurisdiction over the type of dispute in question.\nThe district courts exercise original jurisdiction over\u2014that is, they are empowered to conduct trials in\u2014the following types of cases:\nFor most of these cases, the jurisdiction of the federal district courts is concurrent with that of the state courts. In other words, a plaintiff can choose to bring these cases in either a federal district court or a state court. Congress has established a procedure whereby a party, typically the defendant, can \"remove\" a case from state court to federal court, provided that the federal court also has original jurisdiction over the matter (meaning that the case could have been filed in federal court initially). If the party that initially filed the case in state court believes that removal was improper, that party can ask the district court to \"remand\" the case to the state court system. For certain matters, such as patent and copyright infringement disputes and prosecutions for federal crimes, the jurisdiction of the district courts is exclusive of that of the state courts, meaning that only federal courts can hear those cases.\nIn addition to their original jurisdiction, the district courts have appellate jurisdiction over a very limited class of judgments, orders, and decrees.\nAttorneys.\nIn order to represent a party in a case in a district court, a person must be an attorney at law and generally must be admitted to the bar of that particular court. The United States usually does not have a separate bar examination for federal practice (except with respect to patent practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office). Admission to the bar of a district court is generally available to any attorney who is admitted to practice law in the state where the district court sits.\n56 districts (around 60% of all district courts) require an attorney to be admitted to practice in the state where the district court sits. The other 39 districts (around 40% of all district courts) extend admission to certain lawyers admitted in other states, although conditions vary from court to court. For example, the district courts in New York City (Southern District of New York and Eastern District of New York) extend admission to attorneys admitted to the bar in Connecticut or Vermont and to the district court in that state, but otherwise require attorneys to be admitted to the New York bar. Only 13 districts extend admission to attorneys admitted to any U.S. state bar.\nThe attorney generally submits an application with a fee and takes the oath of admission. Local practice varies as to whether the oath is given in writing or in open court before a judge of the district. A \"sponsor\" admitted to the court's bar is often required. Several district courts require attorneys seeking admission to their bars to take an additional bar examination on federal law, including the following: the Southern District of Ohio, the Northern District of Florida, and the District of Puerto Rico.\n\"Pro hac vice\" admission is also available in most federal district courts on a case-by-case basis. Most district courts require \"pro hac vice\" attorneys to associate with an attorney admitted to practice before the court.\nAppeals.\nGenerally, a final ruling by a district court in either a civil or a criminal case can be appealed to the United States court of appeals in the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located, except that some district court rulings involving patents and certain other specialized matters must be appealed instead to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and in a very few cases the appeal may be taken directly to the United States Supreme Court.\nLargest and busiest district courts.\nThe Central District of California is the largest federal district by population; it includes all five counties that make up Greater Los Angeles. By contrast, New York City and the surrounding metropolitan area are divided between the Southern District of New York (which includes Manhattan, The Bronx and Westchester County) and the Eastern District of New York (which includes Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Nassau County and Suffolk County). New York suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey are covered by the District of Connecticut and District of New Jersey, respectively.\nThe Southern District of New York and the Central District of California are the largest federal districts by number of judges, with 28 judges each.\nIn 2007, the busiest district courts in terms of criminal federal felony filings were the District of New Mexico, Western District of Texas, Southern District of Texas, and the District of Arizona. These four districts all share the border with Mexico. A crackdown on illegal immigration resulted in 75 percent of the criminal cases filed in the 94 district courts in 2007 being filed in these four districts and the other district that borders Mexico, the Southern District of California. The busiest patent litigation court is the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, with the most patent lawsuits filed there nearly every year.\nExtinct district courts.\nSubdivided district courts.\nMost extinct district courts have disappeared by being divided into smaller districts. The following courts were subdivided out of existence: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin.\nOther abolished district courts.\nOn rare occasions, an extinct district court was extinguished by merging it with other district courts. In every case except one, this has restored a district court that had been subdivided:\nThere are a few additional extinct district courts that fall into neither of the above two patterns.\nNotes.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The current system of bankruptcy courts was created by the United States Congress in 1978, effective April 1, 1984. United States bankruptcy courts function as units of the district courts and have subject-matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases. The federal district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases arising under the bankruptcy code, (see \u00a0https://), and bankruptcy cases cannot be filed in state court. Each of the 94 federal judicial districts handles bankruptcy matters.\nTechnically, the United States district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters (see \u00a0https://). However, each such district court may, by order, \"refer\" bankruptcy matters to the bankruptcy court (see \u00a0https://). As a practical matter, most district courts have a standing \"reference\" order to that effect, so that all bankruptcy cases in that district are handled, at least initially, by the bankruptcy court. In unusual circumstances, a district court may in a particular case \"withdraw the reference\" (i.e., take the case or a particular proceeding within the case away from the bankruptcy court and decide the matter itself) under \u00a0https://.\nThe overwhelming majority of all proceedings in bankruptcy are held before a United States bankruptcy judge, whose decisions are subject to appeals to the district court. In some judicial circuits, appeals may be taken to a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP). The bankruptcy judges in each judicial district in regular active service constitute a \"unit\" of the applicable United States district court (see \u00a0https://). The bankruptcy judge is appointed for a renewable term of 14 years by the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicable district is located (see \u00a0https://).\nThe Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (FRBP) govern procedure in the U.S. bankruptcy courts.\nDecisions of the bankruptcy courts are not collected and published in an official reporter produced by the government. Instead, the \"de facto\" official source for opinions of the bankruptcy courts is \"West's Bankruptcy Reporter\", published privately by Thomson West.\nBankruptcy courts appoint a trustee to represent the interests of the creditors and administer the cases. The U.S. Trustee appoints Chapter 7 trustees for a renewable period of 1 year, Chapter 13 trustees are \"standing trustees\" who administer cases in a specific geographic region.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was formed in March 1888 when the Victorian Academy of Arts (previously Victorian Society of Fine Arts) and the Australian Artists' Association amalgamated.\nThe Victorian Artists\u2019 Society is a not-for-profit organisation and charity registered with the Victorian government. The Artists' Society routinely practices a range of art forms and styles through classes and gatherings in their permanent home, a heritage-listed bluestone building on Albert Street, Melbourne, opposite St. Patrick's Cathedral. As of 2021, the Victorian Artists' Society premises include four galleries, members\u2019 rooms, an administrative office, and the original bluestone studio which operates as an art school. The original studio was not finished until 1902.\nThe general public can view the seasonal collections of artworks in the gallery or buy artworks. The gallery is open seven days a week and the cost is free entry. New exhibitions are held fortnightly within the five galleries.\nHistory.\nThe origin of the Victorian Artists Society has strong connections to earlier art societies, academies and associations established in Melbourne, often with interlocking memberships, notably Mr. James Smith the art critic on Melbourne's \"Argus\" who was a member of the first society.\nThe Victorian Society of Fine Arts was established in 1856. Beyond a few exhibitions of that society, there was no art movement in Melbourne until the Victorian Academy of Arts was formed in 1870 with \"about twenty artists and amateurs\" amongst its first members, including Eliezer Levi Montefiore. The Victorian Academy of Arts held annual exhibitions from 1871 to 1887.\nIn 1886 a group of professional artists formed the Australian Artists' Association. The artists included: John Mather, Mr. Addison, Mr. G. R. Ashton, Mr. Percival Ball, Signor Catani, Mr. J.W. Curtis, Mr. McCubbin, Mr. Gibbs, Signor Habres, Mr. Kahler, Signor Tocein, Signor Neele, Mr. Patterson, Mr. Rolando, Mr. T. Roberts and Mr. Turner. The association held its first exhibition in 1886, with works by Tom Roberts, Louis Buvelot, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, John Ford Paterson, John Mather (artist) and many others. \nWhen opening the association's exhibition, Mr. James Smith, on behalf of the exhibiting artists stated that the \"association had not been formed in any spirit of opposition or rivalry with the older academy and that there was room for both.\" Ultimately this was not to be the case. \nJohn Mather was also a longstanding member of the Victorian Academy of Arts and worked towards bringing the two organisations together. In March 1888 the Academy and the Association amalgamated. On John Mather's motion, seconded by John Ford Paterson, the amalgamated organisation was named the Victorian Artist's Society.\nThe first president of the new Society was Joseph Anderson Panton. He was succeeded by John Mather who held the position for many years. Subsequent presidents included John Ford Paterson, Frederick McCubbin, Walter Withers, F.H. Bruford, W. Montgomery, Max Meldrum, C. Douglas Richardson, Sir John Longstaff, Paul Raphael Montford and Louis McCubbin.\nThe premises at 430 Albert Street in East Melbourne were erected for the society in 1888, enlarged in 1892 and modernised in 1953. Facilities include four galleries, teaching studio, members room, offices and other ancillary facilities.\nDuring its early establishment, the Artists\u2019 Society met in a private house in St. Kilda. Its founding members included landscape painter Louis Buvelot, painter Hubert de Castella and etcher J.A. Panton. The Artists\u2019 Society was known for throwing parties and picnics at Brighton. By the 1890s, there were 400 members.\nThis historical building was not limited to fine arts and was also established as a music conservatory that offered singing lessons by Nellie Melba. Melba taught music lessons at the historical building from 1915 until close to her death in 1931. She would perform to crowds outside from the balcony of the house. In 2014, the Society honoured Melba with a special plaque for the gallery to record her musical history at the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society.\nThe Artists\u2019 Society was a starting point for young artists of the Heidelberg school, a Victorian impressionist art movement of the 19th century, to exhibit their work and make their first major sales. Artists of the Heidelberg school who were active members of the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society included Charles Conder, Frederick McCubbin, Arthur Streeton, and Tom Roberts.\nMax Meldrum, the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society president in 1917, taught tonal realism at the gallery studio. In 1918 he left the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society to form \u2018The Society of Twenty Melbourne Painters\u2019. Meldrum ran this society in its early stages from his studio in Hardware Chambers, Elizabeth Street, Melbourne. They later changed their name to Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\nMost of the early exhibitors in the Society were women.\nAlbert Tucker, an Australian artist, and member of the Heide Circle, went to night art classes at the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society studio in the 1930s.\nIn 1938, at a VAS meeting, artists interested in contemporary styles decided to form Contemporary Artists\u2019 Society (CAS). CAS is still active.\nToday.\n\"As of 2021\"\nThe Victorian Artists Society is a gallery and public learning centre offering public exhibitions, art lessons, gallery space for hire, workshops, and paid opportunities for working Victorian artists.\nArt classes and workshops are offered to a minimum age of 16 and operate in four term sessions a year. Classes include painting, watercolour, pastel, oil, acrylic, drawing, and sculpture. 18 different art classes are offered each week in the studio. The gallery viewing hours operate from 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, and 1pm to 4pm on Saturday and Sunday. The gallery is closed on public holidays. Classes are held in the studio six days a week.\nMembership is restricted to 1000, a figure last reached in 1979, and is open for new members to join for approximately $90. Membership is open to all persons interested in the fine arts, with the emphasis on practising artists.\nAs of 2021, the current society president is Eileen Mackley, who joined the VAS board 29 December 2008, and was appointed president 5 December 2013. Ron Smith is head of media enquiries.\nExhibitions are held annually, including the seasonal spring, summer, autumn and winter exhibitions, with awards given at each. Every year, the society presents the \u2018Mavis Little VAS Artist of the Year Award\u2019 to the artist receiving the most votes from exhibitors through that year.\nIn 2020, The Victorian Artists\u2019 Society launched an online art gallery called \u2018Art for Sale,\u2019 creating the opportunity for local Victorian artists to sell their works to a domestic and international online audience. The mediums of art for sale included paintings, sculptures, prints and digital art. This free of charge online event ran from 26 August to 31 December 2020.\nIn 2020, the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society celebrated their 150th anniversary. The society released with historical information, drawings, and photographs, titled \u2018Victorian Artists Society 1870 \u2013 2020 Celebrating 150 Years\u2019, edited by Rosemary Noble. To celebrate 150 years of the Artists\u2019 Society on March 10, 2020, the Governor of Victoria, Linda Dessau AC, gave a speech saying \u201calmost every notable Australian painter from the late 19th to early 20th centuries was associated with the VAS. Fortunately for the people of Victoria, and thanks to the National Gallery of Victoria, many of their works grace the walls at Government House.\u201d\nBuilding restoration.\nThe Victorian Artists\u2019 Society building is Heritage and National Trust listed. In 1873, a grant of land on Albert street became available and allowed for a modest structure. The building is opposite St. Patrick's Cathedral and 600m from Parliament House. According to Professor Miles Lewis of the Australian Architectural Index, the building was originally one-story with measurements of 14.3m x 9.1 x 6m, built by Corben &amp; Stuart. The Romanesque-style building was originally designed by architect Leonard Terry, a designer of warehouses and banks, and Richard Speight.\nThe house underwent renovations in the late 1970s, installing fluorescent lighting, which they later changed again. Although the building has been renovated, the original 1873 studio and 1892 staircase, galleries, and balcony remain. The original Baltic pine floor, tables, and easels still remain the same. An elevator has been added.\nIn 2015, the historic building was threatened by severe water damage and needed urgent restoration repairs for a cost of approximately $1 million. The building needed cosmetic attention, roof restoration, replastering, replumbing, and new electricity installed. The society began the restoration funded entirely by donations and money raised. In May 2015, twenty of the society's artists participated in a mass portrait painting called \u201cPeople Painting People,\u201d with several well-known members of the public, including former Victorian Police commissioner Ken Lay, as the artist subjects. This fundraiser event and multiple others contributed to the money raised for the building restoration. Australian arts and heritage consultant, Tracey Avery advised and reported on paint finishes, new colour schemes and prepared for approval by Heritage Victoria. After approximately five years of renovations and $2.5 million raised by both members and donors, the building restoration was complete.\nFinances.\nThe Victorian Artist's Society is a non-for-profit and charitable organisation as of its registration in 2012. Many members of the society council work on a volunteer basis. The Society's president, Eileen Mackley, is the VAS Treasurer.\nAccording to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission AIS report published 30 July 2020, 9.46% of the total gross income of the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society was from donations and bequests. In the year 2020, over $650,000 of the society's gross income was from donations and bequests, which in large part paid for the completion of the building restoration. Approximately 91.64% of their total expenses is on employee salaries. In 2020, the year of COVID-19, there were no significant changes in the company's activity during the financial year.\nWorking artists in Victoria.\nAfter the amalgamation forming the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society in 1888, distinguished artists associated with the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society included Tom Roberts, Charles Conder, and Arthur Streeton. Arthur Ernest Streeton painted \u2018Settler\u2019s Camp\u2019 and \u2018Pastoral\u2019, both exhibited and sold at the Victorian Artists Society in 1888. He took inspiration for his portraits from the Yarra River and its bridges. After his time at the Victorian Artists Society, Streeton worked for the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1891. Tom Roberts, alongside Streeton a former member of the Artists\u2019 Society has been called the founder of Australian Impressionism. Both artists regularly exhibited oil paintings.\nCharles Conder studied at the Art Society School during the 1880s where he exhibited his impressionist painting \"\u2018Departure of the Orient \u2013 Circular Quay\u2019\" in 1888. Conder sold this painting to the Art Gallery of New South Wales that same year, before leaving to work with Streeton in Melbourne and joining the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society. After joining the Society, he exhibited paintings \u2018\"Coogee Bay\u2019\" 1888, and \u2018\"A Holiday at Mentone\u2019\" 1888. Conder, along with Roberts, McCubbin, and Streeton became contributors to \"The 9 by 5 Impressionism Exhibition\" in August 1889. This exhibition represented impressions of bushlands and city life during a formative period of national Australian history.\nEsther Paterson, born in 1893, was the longest-serving female office bearer of the Victorian Artist's Society. She was also an active member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Similar to the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society, the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, founded in 1902, is the oldest organisation for women artists in Australia. Many members of the Victorian Artists Society are also members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors.\nSimilar societies to the Victorian Artists\u2019 Society which provide opportunities and exhibitions for working artists in Victoria include Hawthorn Artist Society, Heidelberg Artists Society, and Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.\nExhibitions and awards.\nThe Victorian Artists\u2019 Society holds changing exhibitions throughout the year. In the five galleries, new exhibitions are held every two to three weeks. Exhibitions range from retrospective exhibitions of former VAS members to acrylic landscapes to contemporary works focusing on the raw beauty of nature. The Artists' Society holds eleven awarded exhibitions a year for members including, Mavis Little VAS Artist of the Year Award, The Norma Bull Portraiture Scholarship, The VAS George Hicks Foundation Contemporary Exhibition, VAS Autumn Select Exhibition, VAS Maritime Exhibition, VAS Portrait Exhibition, VAS Spring Select Exhibition, and the VAS Winter Select Exhibition. The Mavis Little Artist of the Year Award is a $10,000 prize and solo exhibition and is sponsored by the Hansen Little Foundation.\nThe Artist of the Year Award was introduced by Robert Miller in 1973.\nIn October 2019, the newly renovated Victorian Artists\u2019 Society hosted \u201cFIVE Exhibition\u201d by the FIVE Melbourne Art Group. This exhibition included landscapes, streetscapes, and portrait paintings from Ted Dansey, Mary Hyde, Julian Bruere, John Hunt, and Lucille Tam. This exhibition was free entry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was subsequently renamed the Department of Commerce on March 4, 1913, as the bureaus and agencies specializing in labor were transferred to the new Department of Labor.\nSince its creation, the Commerce Department has seen various agencies and administrative offices shift in and out of its organizational structure. The United States Patent and Trademark Office was transferred from the Interior Department into the Commerce Department in 1925. The Federal Employment Stabilization Office existed within the department from 1931 to 1939. In 1940, the Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) was transferred from the Agriculture Department, and the Civil Aeronautics Authority was also merged into the Commerce Department. In 1949, the Public Roads Administration was added to the department after the Federal Works Agency was dismantled.\nIn 1958, the independent Federal Aviation Agency was created and the Civil Aeronautics Authority was abolished. The United States Travel Service was established by the United States Secretary of Commerce on July 1, 1961, pursuant to the International Travel Act of 1961 (75 Stat. 129; 22 U.S.C. 2121 note) The Economic Development Administration was created in 1965. In 1966, the Bureau of Public Roads was transferred to the newly created Department of Transportation. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) was created on March 5, 1969, originally established by President Richard M. Nixon as the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was created on October 3, 1970.\nThe Cabinet Council on Commerce and Trade was one of multiple Cabinet Councils established in the United States on or about February 26, 1981 by the Reagan Administration.\n2020 data breach.\nIn 2020, the Department of Commerce suffered a data breach following a cyberattack likely conducted by a nation state adversary, possibly Russia.\nHerbert Hoover as secretary of commerce.\nHerbert Hoover was appointed Secretary of Commerce in 1921 by then-President Warren G. Harding. Hoover was, by far, the most active secretary in the history of the department until the end of his position in 1928.\nAfter his election as president in 1920, Warren G. Harding rewarded Hoover for his support, offering to appoint him as either Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Commerce. Secretary of Commerce was considered a minor Cabinet post, with limited and vaguely defined responsibilities, but Hoover, emphasizing his identity as a businessman, accepted the position. In sharp contrast to the Interior Department, there were no scandals at Commerce.\nHoover envisioned the Commerce Department as the hub of the nation's growth and stability. His experience mobilizing the war-time economy convinced him that the federal government could promote efficiency by eliminating waste, increasing production, encouraging the adoption of data-based practices, investing in infrastructure, and conserving natural resources. Contemporaries described Hoover's approach as a \"third alternative\" between \"unrestrained capitalism\" and socialism, which was becoming increasingly popular in Europe. Hoover sought to foster a balance among labor, capital, and the government, and for this he has been variously labeled a \"corporatist\" or an associationalist.\nHoover demanded, and received, authority to coordinate economic affairs throughout the government. He created many sub-departments and committees, overseeing and regulating everything from manufacturing statistics to air travel. In some instances he \"seized\" control of responsibilities from other Cabinet departments when he deemed that they were not carrying out their responsibilities well; some began referring to him as the \"Secretary of Commerce and Under-Secretary of all other departments\". In response to the Depression of 1920\u201321, he convinced Harding to assemble a presidential commission on unemployment, which encouraged local governments to engage in countercyclical infrastructure spending. He endorsed much of Mellon's tax reduction program, but favored a more progressive tax system and opposed the treasury secretary's efforts to eliminate the estate tax.\nRadio and travel.\nWhen Hoover joined the department, almost no families had radios; when he became president in 1929, 10 million owned one, and most of the rest listened in a nearby home, store or restaurant. Hoover's department set the policies that shaped the entire new industry. Hoover's radio conferences played a key role in the organization, development, and regulation of radio broadcasting. Hoover also helped pass the Radio Act of 1927, which allowed the government to intervene and abolish radio stations that were deemed \"non-useful\" to the public. Hoover's attempts at regulating radio were not supported by all congressmen, and he received much opposition from the Senate and from radio station owners.\nHoover was also influential in the early development of air travel, and he sought to create a thriving private industry boosted by indirect government subsidies. He encouraged the development of emergency landing fields, required all runways to be equipped with lights and radio beams, and encouraged farmers to make use of planes for crop dusting. He also established the federal government's power to inspect planes and license pilots, setting a precedent for the later Federal Aviation Administration.\nAs Commerce Secretary, Hoover hosted national conferences on street traffic collectively known as the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety. Hoover's chief objective was to address the growing casualty toll of traffic accidents, but the scope of the conferences grew and soon embraced motor vehicle standards, rules of the road, and urban traffic control. He left the invited interest groups to negotiate agreements among themselves, which were then presented for adoption by states and localities. Because automotive trade associations were the best organized, many of the positions taken by the conferences reflected their interests. The conferences issued a model Uniform Vehicle Code for adoption by the states, and a Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance for adoption by cities. Both were widely influential, promoting greater uniformity between jurisdictions and tending to promote the automobile's priority in city streets.\nOther Hoover initiatives.\nWith the goal of encouraging wise business investments, Hoover made the Commerce Department a clearinghouse of information. He recruited numerous academics from various fields and tasked them with publishing reports on different aspects of the economy, including steel production and films. To eliminate waste, he encouraged the standardization of products like automobile tires and baby bottle nipples. Other efforts at eliminating waste included reducing labor losses from trade disputes and seasonal fluctuations, reducing industrial losses from accident and injury, and reducing the amount of crude oil spilled during extraction and shipping. He promoted international trade by opening overseas offices to advise businessmen. Hoover was especially eager to promote Hollywood films overseas.\nHis \"Own Your Own Home\" campaign was a collaboration to promote ownership of single-family dwellings, with groups such as the Better Houses in America movement, the Architects' Small House Service Bureau, and the Home Modernizing Bureau. He worked with bankers and the savings and loan industry to promote the new long-term home mortgage, which dramatically stimulated home construction. Other accomplishments included winning the agreement of U.S. Steel to adopt an eight-hour workday, and the fostering of the Colorado River Compact, a water rights compact among Southwestern states.\nForeign economic policy.\nThe department has always been involved in promoting international non-financial business. It stations commercial attach\u00e9s at embassies around the world. Currently, the key sub-agencies are the International Trade Administration, and the Bureau of Industry and Security. The ITA provides technical expertise to numerous American companies, helping them adjust to foreign specifications. It provides guidance and marketing data as well. The Office of Export Enforcement administers export controls, especially regarding the spread of nuclear technology and highly advanced electronic technology. Under the administration of President Donald Trump, the policy has been to restrict high-technology flows to China. From 1949 to 1994, the department worked with the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, which restricted technological flows to the Soviet Union and other communist nations. Since 1980, the Commerce Department works to neutralize the dumping of exports or the subsidies of overseas production. Along with the export controls, this work continues to generate friction with other nations. On July 20, 2020, the commerce department announced adding eleven Chinese firms to an export blacklist for committing human rights abuse against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang by conducting genetic analysis on them. Two of the firms sanctioned were subsidiaries of BGI Group, a Chinese genetic sequencing, and biomedical firm. In the same year October, the BGI Group firm was again named in the alleged exploitation of medical samples of patients testing for Covid-19 in Nevada using the 200,000 rapid testing kits donated by the United Arab Emirates under its AI and cloud computing firm, Group 42. The Emirati firm, also known as G42, has previously been named in the mass surveillance of people via an instant messaging application called ToTok, which was actually a spy application snooping on user data.\nOrganization.\nFacilities.\nThe Department of Commerce was initially headquartered in the Willard Building at 513-515 14th Street (not to be confused with the Willard Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue). This site is now occupied by the Hotel Washington, completed in 1918. Between 1913 and 1932, the department was located in the Commerce Building at 19th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. In 1932, following completion of construction of the Herbert Hoover Building, the department relocated to the new facility, where it remains as of 2025.\nLeadership.\nThe department is headed by the Secretary of Commerce, a member of the president's cabinet and the tenth in line to succession to the U.S. presidency. In the event of the death, resignation, vacancy, or incapacity of the secretary, the following officials succeed to the office of secretary on an acting basis until the president appoints another person as acting secretary, or the vacancy is remedied through a permanent appointment by the president with the advice and consent of the United States Senate:\nReorganization proposals.\nProposals to reorganize the department go back many decades. The Department of Commerce was one of three departments that Texas governor Rick Perry advocated eliminating during his 2012 presidential campaign, along with the Department of Education and Department of Energy. Perry's campaign cited the frequency with which agencies had historically been moved into and out of the department and its lack of a coherent focus, and advocated moving its vital programs into other departments such as the Department of the Interior, Department of Labor, and Department of the Treasury. The Economic Development Administration would be completely eliminated.\nOn January 13, 2012, President Barack Obama announced his intentions to ask the United States Congress for the power to close the department and replace it with a new cabinet-level agency focused on trade and exports. The new agency would include the Office of the United States Trade Representative, currently part of the Executive Office of the President, as well as the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the United States Trade and Development Agency, and the Small Business Administration, which are all currently independent agencies. The Obama administration projected that the reorganization would save $3 billion and would help the administration's goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. The new agency would be organized around four \"pillars\": a technology and innovation office including the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the National Institute of Standards and Technology; a statistical division including the United States Census Bureau and other data-collection agencies currently in the Commerce Department, and also the Bureau of Labor Statistics which would be transferred from the Department of Labor; a trade and investment policy office; and a small business development office. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would be transferred from the Department of Commerce into the Department of the Interior. Later that year, shortly before the 2012 presidential election, Obama invoked the idea of a \"secretary of business\" in reference to the plan. The reorganization was part of a larger proposal which would grant the president the authority to propose mergers of federal agencies, which would then be subject to an up-or-down Congressional vote. This ability had existed from the Great Depression until the Reagan presidency, when Congress rescinded the authority.\nThe Obama administration plan faced criticism for some of its elements. Some Congress members expressed concern that the Office of the United States Trade Representative would lose focus if it were included in a larger bureaucracy, especially given its status as an \"honest broker\" between other agencies, which tend to advocate for specific points of view. The overall plan has also been criticized as an attempt to create an agency similar to Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which was abolished in 2001 after some of its initiatives failed and it became seen as a hindrance to growth. NOAA's climate and terrestrial operations and fisheries and endangered species programs would be expected to integrate well with agencies already in the Interior Department, such as the United States Geological Survey and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. However, environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council feared that the reorganization could distract the agency from its mission of protecting the nation's oceans and ecosystems. The plan was reiterated in the Obama administration's FY2016 budget proposal that was released in February 2015.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A principal goal for the bureau is helping stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, while furthering the growth of United States exports. The Bureau is led by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security.\nBIS' mission is to advance U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic interests. BIS activities include regulating the export of sensitive goods and dual-use technologies in an effective and efficient manner; enforcing export control, anti-boycott, and public safety laws; cooperating with and assisting other countries on export control and strategic trade issues; assisting U.S. industry to comply with international arms control agreements; monitoring the viability of the U.S. defense\u2013industrial base; and promoting federal initiatives and public-private partnerships to protect the nation's critical infrastructures.\nItems on the Commerce Control List (CCL) require a permit from the Department of Commerce before they can be exported. To determine whether an export permit is required, an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) is used.\nOrganization.\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security, a component of the United States Department of Commerce, is organized by the United States Secretary of Commerce as follows:\nGuiding principles of the Bureau of Industry and Security.\nThe main focus of the bureau is the security of the United States, which includes its national security, economic security, cyber security, and homeland security. For example, in the area of dual-use export controls, BIS administers and enforces such controls to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them, to halt the spread of weapons to terrorists or countries of concern, and to further U.S. foreign policy objectives. Where there is credible evidence suggesting that the export of a dual-use item threatens U.S. security, the Bureau is empowered to prevent export of the item.\nIn addition to national security, BIS's function is to ensure the health of the U.S. economy and the competitiveness of U.S. industry. BIS promotes a strong defense\u2013industrial base that can develop and provide technologies that will enable the United States to maintain its military superiority. BIS takes care to ensure that its regulations do not impose unreasonable restrictions on legitimate international commercial activity that are necessary for the health of U.S. industry.\nLists of Parties of Concern.\nThe Bureau maintains five major lists of parties with whom exportation is forbidden or requires licensing.

{"id": "70250", "revid": "8561672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70250", "title": "Nicolas Roeg", "text": "English film director and cinematographer (1928\u20132018)\nNicolas Jack Roeg ( ; 15 August 1928 \u2013 23 November 2018) was an English film director and cinematographer, best known for directing \"Performance\" (1970), \"Walkabout\" (1971), \"Don't Look Now\" (1973), \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" (1976), \"Bad Timing\" (1980) and \"The Witches\" (1990).\nMaking his directorial debut 23 years after his entry into the film business, Roeg quickly became known for an idiosyncratic visual and narrative style, characterised by the use of disjointed and disorienting editing. For this reason, he is considered a highly influential filmmaker, cited as an inspiration by such directors as Steven Soderbergh, Christopher Nolan and Danny Boyle.\nIn 1999, the British Film Institute acknowledged Roeg's importance in the British film industry by naming \"Don't Look Now\" and \"Performance\" the 8th- and 48th-greatest British films of all time in its Top 100 British films poll.\nEarly life.\nRoeg was born in St John's Wood in north London on 15 August 1928 to Jack Nicolas Roeg and Mabel Gertrude (n\u00e9e Silk). He had an older sister, Nicolette (1925\u20131987), who was an actress. His father, of Dutch origin, achieved considerable success in the diamond trade, until a failed South African investment saw him suffer heavy financial losses. Of his initial attraction to the film industry, Roeg suggested it was sparked by a recording studio located opposite his home. Roeg was educated at the Mercers' School in London.\nCareer.\nCinematography.\nIn 1947, after completing national service in the British Army as a unit projectionist, Roeg entered the film business as a tea boy, moving up to clapper-loader, the bottom rung of the camera department, at Marylebone Studios in London. For a time, he worked as a camera operator on a number of film productions, including \"The Sundowners\" and \"The Trials of Oscar Wilde\".\nRoeg was a second-unit cinematographer on David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) and this led to Lean's hiring Roeg as cinematographer on his next film, \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965); Roeg's creative vision clashed with that of Lean and eventually he was fired from the production and replaced by Freddie Young, who received sole credit for cinematography when the film was released in 1965. He was credited as cinematographer on Roger Corman's \"The Masque of the Red Death\" and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"Fahrenheit 451\", as well as John Schlesinger's \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" and Richard Lester's \"Petulia\"; the latter is the last film on which Roeg was solely credited for cinematography and also shares many characteristics and similarities with Roeg's work as a director.\nDirecting.\nIn the late 1960s, Roeg moved into directing with \"Performance\", alongside Donald Cammell. The film centres on an aspiring London gangster (James Fox) who moves in with a reclusive rock star (Mick Jagger) to evade his bosses. The film featured cinematography by Roeg and a screenplay by Cammell, the latter of whom had favoured Marlon Brando for the James Fox role. The film was completed in 1968 but withheld from release by its distributor Warner Bros. who, according to Sanford Lieberson, \"didn't think it was releasable.\" The film was eventually released with an X rating in 1970 and, despite its initial poor reception, has come to be held in high esteem by critics due to its cult following.\nRoeg followed up with \"Walkabout\", which tells the story of an English teenage girl and her younger brother who are abandoned in the Australian Outback by their father after his suicide and forced to fend for themselves, with the help of an Aboriginal boy on his walkabout. Roeg cast Jenny Agutter in the role of the girl, his son Luc as the boy, and David Gulpilil as the Aboriginal boy. It was widely praised by critics despite its lack of commercial success.\nRoeg's next film, \"Don't Look Now\", is based on Daphne du Maurier's short story of the same name and starred Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland as a married couple in Venice mourning the death of their daughter who had drowned. It attracted scrutiny early on due to a sex scene between Sutherland and Christie, which was unusually explicit for the time. Roeg's decision to inter-cut the sexual intercourse with shots of the couple dressing afterwards was reportedly due to the need to assuage the fears of the censors and there were rumours at the time of its release that the sex was unsimulated. The film was widely praised by critics and considered one of the most important and influential horror films ever made.\nSimilarly to \"Performance\", Roeg cast musicians in leading roles for his next two films, \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" and \"Bad Timing\". \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" (1976) stars David Bowie as a humanoid alien who comes to Earth to collect water for his planet, which is suffering from a drought. The film divided critics and was truncated upon its U.S. release. Despite this, it was entered into the Berlin International Film Festival where Roeg was nominated for the Golden Bear. It is today considered an important science fiction film and is one of Roeg's most celebrated films. \"Bad Timing\" was released in 1980 and stars Art Garfunkel as an American psychiatrist living in Vienna who develops a love affair with a fellow expatriate (played by Theresa Russell, to whom Roeg was later married), which culminates in the latter being rushed to hospital due to an incident the nature of which is revealed over the course of the film. At first, it was disliked by critics, as well as by the Rank Organisation, its distributor, who allegedly described it as \"a sick film made by sick people for sick people.\" Rank requested that their logo be taken off the finished film.\n\"Bad Timing\" marked the beginning of a three-film partnership with Jeremy Thomas. The second of these films \"Eureka\" (1983) is loosely based on the true story of Sir Harry Oakes; it received a largely limited release both theatrically and on home video. It was followed up with \"Insignificance\", which imagines a meeting between Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Monroe's second husband Joe DiMaggio and Senator Joseph McCarthy. \"Insignificance\" was screened in competition at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, with the film being selected to compete for the Palme d'Or.\nIn 1986, Roeg was approached by then Secretary of State for Health and Social Services Norman Fowler and the advertising agency TBWA to direct the British government's public health campaign \"\".\nRoeg's next two films, \"Castaway\" and \"Track 29\", are considered minor entries in his oeuvre. Roeg was selected to direct an adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's novel \"The Witches\" by Jim Henson, who had procured the film rights to the book in 1983. This would prove to be his last major studio film and proved a great success with critics, although it was a box-office failure. Roeg made only three theatrical films following \"The Witches\": \"Cold Heaven\" (1992), \"Two Deaths\" (1995) and \"Puffball\" (2007). Roeg also did a small amount of work for television, including \"Sweet Bird of Youth\", an adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play, and \"Heart of Darkness\" and an episode of George Lucas's \"Young Indiana Jones\".\nRoeg did not make any more films after 2007, but published a memoir, \"The World Is Ever Changing\", in 2013.\nStyle and influence.\nRoeg's films are known for having scenes and images from the plot presented in a disarranged fashion, out of chronological and causal order, requiring the viewer to do the work of mentally rearranging them to comprehend the story line. They seem to \"shatter reality into a thousand pieces\" and are \"unpredictable, fascinating, cryptic, and liable to leave you wondering what the hell just happened...\" This is also the strategy of Richard Lester's 1968 film \"Petulia\", which was Roeg's last film as a cinematographer only. A characteristic of Roeg's films is that they are edited in disjunctive and semi-coherent ways that make full sense only in the film's final moments, when a crucial piece of information surfaces; they are \"mosaic-like montages [filled with] elliptical details which become very important later.\"\nThese techniques, along with Roeg's foreboding sense of atmosphere, influenced later such filmmakers as Steven Soderbergh, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, Fran\u00e7ois Ozon and Danny Boyle. In addition to this, Christopher Nolan has said his film \"Memento\" would have been \"pretty unthinkable\" without Roeg and cites the finale of \"Insignificance\" as an influence on his own \"Inception\". In addition to this, Steven Soderbergh's \"Out of Sight\" features a love scene that is visibly influenced by that in \"Don't Look Now\".\nA further theme that can be seen to be running through Roeg's filmography is characters who are out of their natural setting. Examples of this include the schoolchildren in the Outback in \"Walkabout\", the men and women in Venice in \"Don't Look Now\", the alien on Earth in \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\", and the Americans in Vienna in \"Bad Timing\".\nRoeg's influence on cinema is not limited to deconstructing narrative. The \"Memo from Turner\" sequence in \"Performance\" predates many techniques later used in music videos. The \"quadrant\" sequence in \"Bad Timing\", in which the thoughts of Theresa Russell and Art Garfunkel are heard before words are spoken set to Keith Jarrett's piano music from \"The K\u00f6ln Concert\", stretched the boundaries of what could be done with film.\nLegacy and honours.\nRoeg's cinematic work was showcased at the Riverside Studios from 12\u201314 September 2008. He introduced the retrospective with Miranda Richardson, who starred in \"Puffball\". The programme included \"Bad Timing\", \"Far from the Madding Crowd\", \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\", \"The Witches\", \"Eureka\", \"Don't Look Now\" and \"Insignificance\". The London Film Academy organised this event for Roeg in honour of his patronage of the school.\nIn 1994, he was awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship. In the 1996 New Year Honours, Roeg was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\nPersonal life and death.\nFrom 1957 to 1977, Roeg was married to English actress Susan Stephen. They had four sons: Waldo, Nico, Sholto and (film producer) Luc Roeg. Luc appeared as an actor, as Lucien John, in \"Walkabout\", Roeg's first film as solo director. In 1982, Roeg married American actress Theresa Russell and they had two sons: Maximillian (an actor) and Statten Roeg. They later divorced. Roeg was then married to Harriet Harper from 2005 until his death, from dementia, on 23 November 2018, at a nursing home in Ladbroke Grove, London.\nActor Donald Sutherland (who named one of his sons after Roeg) described Roeg as a \"fearless visionary\". Filmmaker Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie, who starred in \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" (1976), also paid tribute to Roeg, calling him a \"great storyteller\" and \"inimitable\".\nFilmography.\nRoeg is credited on the following films:\nDirector.\nFilm.\nShort film\nCinematographer.\nFilm\nTelevision\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Growth accounting decomposes the growth rate of an economy's total output into that which is due to increases in the contributing amount of the factors used\u2014usually the increase in the amount of capital and labor\u2014and that which cannot be accounted for by observable changes in factor utilization. The unexplained part of growth in GDP is then taken to represent increases in productivity (getting more output with the same amounts of inputs) or a measure of broadly defined technological progress.\nThe technique has been applied to virtually every economy in the world and a common finding is that observed levels of economic growth cannot be explained simply by changes in the stock of capital in the economy or population and labor force growth rates. Hence, technological progress plays a key role in the economic growth of nations, or the lack of it.\nHistory.\nThis methodology was introduced by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan in 1957. Growth accounting was proposed for management accounting in the 1980s. but they did not gain on as management tools. The reason is clear. The production functions are understood and formulated differently in growth accounting and management accounting. In growth accounting the production function is formulated as a function OUTPUT=F (INPUT), which formulation leads to maximize the average productivity ratio OUTPUT/INPUT. Average productivity has never been accepted in management accounting (in business) as a performance criterion or an objective to be maximized because it would mean the end of the profitable business. Instead the production function is formulated as a function INCOME=F(OUTPUT-INPUT) which is to be maximized. The name of the game is to maximize income, not to maximize productivity or production.\nAbstract example.\nThe growth accounting model is normally expressed in the form of the exponential growth function. As an abstract example consider an economy whose total output (GDP) grows at 3% per year. Over the same period its capital stock grows at 6% per year and its labor force by 1%. The contribution of the growth rate of capital to output is equal to that growth rate weighted by the share of capital in total output and the contribution of labor is given by the growth rate of labor weighted by labor's share in income. If capital's share in output is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443, then labor's share is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 (assuming these are the only two factors of production). This means that the portion of growth in output which is due to changes in factors is .06\u00d7(&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443)+.01\u00d7(&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443)=.027 or 2.7%. This means that there is still 0.3% of the growth in output that cannot be accounted for. This remainder is the increase in the productivity of factors that happened over the period, or the measure of technological progress during this time.\nSpecific example.\nGrowth accounting can also be expressed in the form of the arithmetical model, which is used here because it is more descriptive and understandable. The principle of the accounting model is simple. The weighted growth rates of inputs (factors of production) are subtracted from the weighted growth rates of outputs. Because the accounting result is obtained by subtracting it is often called a \"residual\". The residual is often defined as the growth rate of output not explained by the share-weighted growth rates of the inputs.\nWe can use the real process data of the production model in order to show the logic of the growth accounting model and identify possible differences in relation to the productivity model. When the production data is the same in the model comparison the differences in the accounting results are only due to accounting models. We get the following growth accounting from the production data.\nThe growth accounting procedure proceeds as follows. First is calculated the growth rates for the output and the inputs by dividing the Period 2 numbers with the Period 1 numbers. Then the weights of inputs are computed as input shares of the total input (Period 1). Weighted growth rates (WG) are obtained by weighting growth rates with the weights. The accounting result is obtained by subtracting the weighted growth rates of the inputs from the growth rate of the output. In this case the accounting result is 0.015 which implies a productivity growth by 1.5%.\nWe note that the productivity model reports a 1.4% productivity growth from the same production data. The difference (1.4% versus 1.5%) is caused by the different production volume used in the models. In the productivity model the input volume is used as a production volume measure giving the growth rate 1.063. In this case productivity is defined as follows: output volume per one unit of input volume. In the growth accounting model the output volume is used as a production volume measure giving the growth rate 1.078. In this case productivity is defined as follows: input consumption per one unit of output volume. The case can be verified easily with the aid of productivity model using output as a production volume.\nThe accounting result of the growth accounting model is expressed as an index number, in this example 1.015, which depicts the average productivity change. As demonstrated above we cannot draw correct conclusions based on average productivity numbers. This is due to the fact that productivity is accounted as an independent variable separated from the entity it belongs to, i.e. real income formation. Hence, if we compare in a practical situation two growth accounting results of the same production process we do not know which one is better in terms of production performance. We have to know separately income effects of productivity change and production volume change or their combined income effect in order to understand which one result is better and how much better.\nThis kind of scientific mistake of wrong analysis level has been recognized and described long ago. Vygotsky cautions against the risk of separating the issue under review from the total environment, the entity of which the issue is an essential part. By studying only this isolated issue we are likely to end up with incorrect conclusions. A second practical example illustrates this warning. Let us assume we are studying the properties of water in putting out a fire. If we focus the review on small components of the whole, in this case the elements oxygen and hydrogen, we come to the conclusion that hydrogen is an explosive gas and oxygen is a catalyst in combustion. Therefore, their compound water could be explosive and unsuitable for putting out a fire. This incorrect conclusion arises from the fact that the components have been separated from the entity.\nTechnical derivation.\nThe total output of an economy is modeled as being produced by various factors of production, with capital and labor being the primary ones in modern economies (although land and natural resources can also be included). This is usually captured by an aggregate production function:\nformula_1\nwhere Y is total output, K is the stock of capital in the economy, L is the labor force (or population) and A is a \"catch all\" factor for technology, role of institutions and other relevant forces which measures how productively capital and labor are used in production.\nStandard assumptions on the form of the function F(.) is that it is increasing in K, L, A (if you increase productivity or you increase the number of factors used you get more output) and that it is homogeneous of degree one, or in other words that there are constant returns to scale (which means that if you double both K and L you get double the output). The assumption of constant returns to scale facilitates the assumption of perfect competition which in turn implies that factors get their marginal products:\nformula_2\nformula_3\nwhere MPK denotes the extra units of output produced with an additional unit of capital and similarly, for MPL. Wages paid to labor are denoted by w and the rate of profit or the real interest rate is denoted by r. Note that the assumption of perfect competition enables us to take prices as given. For simplicity we assume unit price (i.e. P =1), and thus quantities also represent values in all equations.\nIf we totally differentiate the above production function we get;\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 denotes the partial derivative with respect to factor i, or for the case of capital and labor, the marginal products. With perfect competition this equation becomes:\nformula_6\nIf we divide through by Y and convert each change into growth rates we get:\nformula_7\nor denoting a growth rate (percentage change over time) of a factor as formula_8 we get:\nformula_9\nThen formula_10 is the share of total income that goes to capital, which can be denoted as formula_11 and formula_12 is the share of total income that goes to labor, denoted by formula_13. This allows us to express the above equation as:\nformula_14\nIn principle the terms formula_11, formula_16, formula_17 and formula_18 are all observable and can be measured using standard national income accounting methods (with capital stock being measured using investment rates via the perpetual inventory method). The term formula_19 however is not directly observable as it captures technological growth and improvement in productivity that are unrelated to changes in use of factors. This term is usually referred to as Solow residual or Total factor productivity growth. Slightly rearranging the previous equation we can measure this as that portion of increase in total output which is not due to the (weighted) growth of factor inputs:\nformula_20\nAnother way to express the same idea is in per capita (or per worker) terms in which we subtract off the growth rate of labor force from both sides:\nformula_21\nwhich states that the rate of technological growth is that part of the growth rate of per capita income which is not due to the (weighted) growth rate of capital per person.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Losing his arm rendered Jack unfit for police work, so he put his experience to use by investigating insurance fraud. Williams has been murdered in a particularly cruel way, deliberately shot in the stomach to make the death slow and painful. Mike vows vengeance, declaring that Jack's murderer will die the same way Jack did.\nPrior to his death, Jack had fallen in love with Myrna Devlin when he stopped her from committing suicide by jumping from a bridge. Williams asked Dr. Charlotte Manning, a young, beautiful, blonde, and well-to-do psychiatrist, to admit Myrna to her clinic for psychotherapy. After Myrna became clean, she and Williams became engaged. The couple maintained a casual friendship with Manning. Over time, Williams comes to suspect that Hal Kines, one of Manning's college students who has spent some time at her clinic and who has become one of her casual acquaintances, is in fact a criminal.\nIn the course of his investigation, Hammer meets and begins to fall in love with Dr. Manning. In the course of the novel, they become engaged.\nTaking time out from his investigation on a Saturday morning, Hammer picks up Myrna Devlin and gives her a lift to an estate in the country, owned by the lovely Bellamy twins, for a gigantic all-day party. Charlotte Manning says she has some business to attend to and will be there in time for a tennis game due to take place that evening. After an unsuccessful attempt at playing tennis himself, Hammer gets rid of his sleep deficit by spending all day in his room, fast asleep, with \"old junior\" \u2014 his gun \u2014 close to him. He is woken up just in time for dinner, during which Harmon Wilder, the Bellamys' lawyer, and Charles Sherman, Wilder's assistant, are pointed out to him. This is a fine \u2014 and the final \u2014 distractor in the novel: Wilder and Sherman are suddenly missing from the party after Myrna Devlin has been found shot. In fact they had illicit drugs on them and did not want to be found out. During the tennis game, Mary Bellamy asks Charlotte if she can \"borrow\" Hammer. She then leads him into the woods, where they have sex. They return to the party just as a maid discovers Myrna's body in an upstairs room, in front of a large mirror. Both Hammer's friend Pat Chambers and other police are called in, and the alibi of each guest is checked.\nNow having another reason to seek vengeance, Hammer redoubles his efforts to discover the killer. Soon he has uncovered a wide-ranging narcotics rings, one that Jack had been on the verge of exposing.\nBack home, Hammer retreats into his apartment to think. Finally, he knows the identity of the killer: Dr. Manning. Confronting her, Hammer keeps his promise and kills her in the same excruciatingly painful way she had killed his friend Jack.\nWhen the dying murderer asks Hammer how he could act in such a cruel manner, Hammer replies \"It was easy!\".\nReception.\nBy the time the book was adapted into a film in 1953, it had sold 3,500,000 copies.\nFilms.\nThe first film version of \"I, the Jury\" was shot in 1953 and was released through United Artists. After a four-picture contract was signed with Spillane, the movie was filmed, in 3-D, featuring Biff Elliot (as Mike Hammer), Preston Foster and Peggie Castle. The plot from the novel was toned down for the film version. It grossed $1,299,000. The cinematographer was John Alton.\nIn 1982, the story was again made into a movie, this time with Richard T. Heffron directing, and with Armand Assante as Mike Hammer.\nIn popular culture.\nThe novel's reputation for raciness and violence has outlasted the popularity of the book itself.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Castile and Le\u00f3n is the largest autonomous community in Spain by area, covering 94,222\u00a0km2. It is, however, sparsely populated, with a population density below 30/km2. While a capital has not been explicitly declared, the seats of the executive and legislative powers are set in Valladolid by law, and for all purposes that city (also the most populated municipality) serves as the \"de facto\" regional capital.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n is a landlocked region, bordered by Portugal as well as by the Spanish autonomous communities of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, La Rioja, Aragon, Castilla\u2013La Mancha, the Community of Madrid and Extremadura. Chiefly comprising the northern half of the Inner Plateau, it is surrounded by mountain barriers (the Cantabrian Mountains to the North, the Sistema Central to the South and the Sistema Ib\u00e9rico to the East) and most of the territory is drained by the Douro River (Spanish: \"Duero\"), flowing west toward the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe autonomous community was created in 1983 by grouping the provinces of Le\u00f3n, Zamora, Salamanca (all three traditionally attached to the region of Le\u00f3n), \u00c1vila, Burgos, Palencia, Segovia, Soria and Valladolid (attached to Old Castile).\nThe region contains eleven World Heritage Sites, making it (along with Lombardia in Italy) the region with most UNESCO World Heritage Sites. UNESCO recognizes the Cortes of Le\u00f3n of 1188 as the cradle of worldwide parliamentarism. The region is strongly affected by population ageing. Castile and Le\u00f3n is the region with the worst quality of government index in Spain.\nSymbols.\nThe Statute of Autonomy of Castile and Le\u00f3n, reformed most recently in 2007, establishes in the sixth article of its preliminary title the symbols of the community's exclusive identity. These are: the coat of arms, the flag, the banner and the anthem. Its legal protection is the same as that corresponding to the symbols of the State -whose outrages are classified as crime in article 543 of the Penal Code-.\nIn the articulated statuary, the coat of arms is defined as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The coat of arms of Castile and Le\u00f3n is a stamped shield by open royal crown, barracked in cross. The first and fourth quartering: in the field of gules, a merloned golden castle of three merlons, drafted of sable and rinse of azure. The second and third quartering: in a silver field, a rampant lion of purple, lingued, dyed and armed with gules, crowned with gold.\nLikewise, the flag is described as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The flag of Castile and Le\u00f3n is quartered and contains the symbols of Castile and Le\u00f3n, as described in the previous section. The flag will fly in all the centres and official acts of the Community, to the right of the Spanish flag.\nFollowing the same wording, the banner is constituted by the shield quartered on a traditional crimson background. The Statute also expresses: \"The anthem and the other symbols [...] will be regulated by specific law\". After the promulgation of the fundamental norm, this law was not promulgated, so the anthem does not exist, but \"de iure\" is a symbol of autonomy.\nHistory.\nSeveral archaeological findings show that in prehistoric times these lands were already inhabited. In the Atapuerca Mountains have been found many bones of the ancestors of \"Homo sapiens\", making these findings one of the most important to determine the history of human evolution. The most important discovery that catapulted the site to international fame was the remains of \"Homo heidelbergensis\".\nBefore the arrival of the Romans, it is known that the territories that make up Castile and Le\u00f3n today were occupied by various Celtic peoples, such as Vaccaei, Autrigones, Turmodigi, the Vettones, Astures or Celtiberians. The Roman conquest resulted in warring with the local tribes. One particularly famous episode was the siege of Numantia, an old town located near the current city of Soria.\nThe romanization was unstoppable, and to this day great Roman works of art have remained, mainly the Aqueduct of Segovia as well as many archaeological remains such as those of the ancient Clunia, Salt mines of Poza de la Sal and the v\u00eda de la Plata pathway, which crosses the west of the community from Astorga (\"Asturica Augusta\") to the capital of modern Extremadura, M\u00e9rida (\"Emerita Augusta\").\nWith the fall of Rome, the lands were occupied militarily by the Visigoth peoples of Germanic origin. The subsequent arrival of the Arabs was followed by a process known as the \"Reconquista\" (Reconquest). In the mountainous area of Asturias, a small Christian kingdom was created that opposed the Islamic presence in the Peninsula. It proclaimed itself an heir of the last Visigoth kings, who in turn had been deeply romanized. This resistance of Visigoth-Roman heritage, supported by Christianity, was becoming increasingly strong and expanding to the south, eventually establishing its court in the city of Le\u00f3n, becoming the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. To encourage the repopulation of the newly reconquered lands, a number of fueros (\"letters of repopulation\") were granted by the monarchs.\nIn the Middle Ages, Christian pilgrimages to Santiago de Compostela were popularized. The Camino de Santiago, running along the northern part of the region, was a major part of the route of pilgrimage, so it contributed to the spread of European cultural innovations throughout the peninsula. Today the Camino is still an important touristic and cultural attraction.\nIn 1188, the basilica of San Isidoro of Le\u00f3n was the setting of the first parliamentary body in the history of Europe, with the participation of the Third Estate. The king who summoned it was Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n.\nThe legal basis for the kingdom was the Roman law, and because of this the kings increasingly wanted more power, like the Roman emperors. This is very clearly seen in the \"Siete Partidas\" of Alfonso X of Castile, which shows the imperial monism that the king sought. The King did not want to be a \"primus inter pares\", but the source of the law.\nSimultaneously, a county of this Christian kingdom of Le\u00f3n, began to acquire autonomy and to expand. This is the primitive County of Castile, which would grow into a powerful kingdom among the Christian kingdoms of the Peninsula. The first Castilian count was Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez.\nLe\u00f3n and Castile continued to expand to the South, even beyond the Douro river, seeking to conquer lands under Islamic rule. That was the time of the \"Cantares de gesta\", poems which recount the great deeds of the Christian nobles who fought against the Muslim enemy. Despite this, Christian and Muslim kings maintained diplomatic relations. One clear example is Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, \"El Cid\", paradigm of the medieval Christian knight, who fought both for Christian and Muslim kings.\nThe origin of the definitive dynastic unification of the kingdoms of Castile and Le\u00f3n, which had been separated for just seven decades, was in 1194. Alfonso VIII of Castile and Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n signed in Tordehumos the treaty that pacified the area of Tierra de Campos and laid the foundation for a future reunification of the kingdoms, consolidated in 1230 with Ferdinand III \"the Saint\". This agreement is called the Treaty of Tordehumos.\nDuring the Late Middle Ages there was an economic and political crisis produced by a series of bad harvests and by disputes between nobles and the Crown for power, as well as between different contenders for the throne. In the Cortes of Valladolid of 1295, Ferdinand IV is recognized as king. The painting Mar\u00eda de Molina presents her son Fernando IV in the Cortes of Valladolid of 1295 presides today the Spanish Congress of Deputies along with a painting of the Cortes of C\u00e1diz, emphasizing the parliamentarian importance that has all the development of Cortes in Castile and Le\u00f3n, despite its subsequent decline. The Crown was becoming more authoritarian and the nobility more dependent on it.\nThe \"Reconquista\" continued advancing from the thriving Crown of Castile to the south, and culminated with the Granada War against the last Muslim stronghold in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, which surrendered on 2 January 1492.\nAntecedents of the autonomy.\nIn June 1978, Castile and Le\u00f3n obtained the pre-autonomy, through the creation of General council of Castile and Le\u00f3n by Royal Decree-Law 20/1978, of 13 June.\nIn times of the First Spanish Republic (1873\u20131874), the federal republicans conceived the project to create a federated state of eleven provinces in the valley of the Spanish Douro, that would also have included the provinces of Santander and Logro\u00f1o. Very few years before, in 1869, as part of a manifesto, federal republicans representatives of the 17 provinces of Albacete, \u00c1vila, Burgos, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, Le\u00f3n, Logro\u00f1o, Madrid, Palencia, Salamanca, Santander, Segovia, Soria, Toledo, Valladolid and Zamora proposed in the so-called Castilian Federal Pact the conformation of an entity formed by two different \"states\": the state of Old Castile -that is presently built for the current Castilian-Leonese provinces and the provinces of Logro\u00f1o and Santander-, and the state of New Castile -which conforms to the current provinces of Castile-La Mancha plus the province of Madrid-. The end of the Republic, at the beginning of 1874, thwarted the initiative.\nIn 1921, on the occasion of the fourth centenary of the Battle of Villalar, the Santander City Council advocated the creation of a Castilian and Leonese Commonwealth of eleven provinces, an idea that would be maintained in later years. At the end of 1931 and beginning of 1932, from Le\u00f3n, Eugenio Merino elaborated a text in which the base of a Castilian-Leonese regionalism was put. The text was published in the \"Diario de Le\u00f3n\" newspaper.\nDuring the Second Spanish Republic, especially in 1936, there was a great regionalist activity favorable to a region of eleven provinces, and even bases for the Statute of Autonomy were elaborated. The \"Diario de Le\u00f3n\" advocated for the formalization of this initiative and the constitution of an autonomous region with these words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Join in a personality Le\u00f3n and Old Castile around the great basin of the Douro, without to fall now into provincial rivalries.\u2014\u200a\nThe end of the Spanish Civil War and the beginning of Franco regime ended the aspirations of the autonomy for the region. The philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset collected this scheme in his publications.\nAfter the death of Francisco Franco, regionalist, autonomist and nationalist organizations (Castilian-Leonese regionalism and Castilian nationalism) as Regional Alliance of Castile and Le\u00f3n (1975), Regional Institute of Castile and Le\u00f3n (1976) or the Autonomous Nationalist Party of Castile and Le\u00f3n (1977). Later after the extinction of these formations arose in 1993 Regionalist Unity of Castile and Le\u00f3n.\nAt the same time, others of Leonesist character arose, such as the Leonese Autonomous Group (1978) or Regionalist Party of the Leonese Country (1980), which advocated the creation of a Leonese autonomous community, composed of provinces of Le\u00f3n, Salamanca and Zamora. The popular and political support that maintained the uniprovincial autonomy in Le\u00f3n became very important in that city.\nAutonomy.\nThe autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n is the result of the union in 1983 of nine provinces: the three that, after the territorial division of 1833, by which the provinces were created, were ascribed to the Region of Le\u00f3n, and six ascribed to Old Castile; however 2 provinces of Old Castile were not included: Santander (current community of Cantabria) and Logro\u00f1o (current La Rioja).\nIn the case of Cantabria the creation of an autonomous community was advocated for historical, cultural and geographical reasons, while in La Rioja the process was more complex due to the existence of three alternatives, all based on historical and socio-economic reasons: union with Castile and Le\u00f3n (advocated by the Union of the Democratic Centre political party), union to a Basque-Navarrese community (supported by the Socialist Party and Communist Party) or creation of an uniprovincial autonomy; the latter option was chosen because it had more support among the population.\nAfter the creation of the Castilian-Leonese pre-autonomous body, which was supported by the Provincial Council of Le\u00f3n in its agreement of April 16, 1980, this institution revoked its original agreement on January 13, 1983, just as the draft of the Organic Law entered the Spanish parliament. The Constitutional Court determined which of those contradictory agreements was valid in the \"Sentence 89/1984 of September 28\"; it declares that the subject of the process is no longer, as in its preliminary phase, the councils and municipalities, but the new body.\nAfter the sentence, there were several demonstrations in Le\u00f3n in favor of the \"Le\u00f3n alone\" option (see Leonesism), one of them according to some sources brought together a number close to 90\u00a0000 people, This was the highest concentration held in the city in the Democratic period until the demonstrations rejecting the 2004 Madrid train bombings.\nIn an agreement adopted on 31 July 1981, the Provincial Council of Segovia decided to exercise the initiative so that Segovia could be constituted as a uniprovincial autonomous community, but in the municipalities of the province the situation was equal between the supporters of the uniprovincial autonomy and the supporters of the union.\nThe City Council of Cu\u00e9llar initially adhered to this autonomic initiative in agreement adopted by the corporation on October 5, 1981. However, another agreement adopted by the same corporation dated December 3 of the same year revoked the previous one and the process was paralyzed pending the processing of an appeal filed by the provincial council against this last agreement; this change of opinion of the city council of Cu\u00e9llar tipped the scales in the province towards the autonomy with the rest of Castile and Le\u00f3n, but it was an agreement that arrived out of time. Finally the province of Segovia was incorporated into Castile and Le\u00f3n along with the other eight provinces and legal coverage was given through the \"Organic Law 5/1983\" for \"reasons of national interest\", as provided for in article 144 c of the Spanish Constitution for those provinces that have not exercised their right on time.\nSince 2019, the \"ayuntamientos\" of several municipalities of the province of Le\u00f3n (including the capital's) have passed motions to propose the split of the provinces of the region of Le\u00f3n from Castile and Le\u00f3n and become a standalone autonomous community. As leonesism has traditionally been a fringe movement in the provinces of Zamora and Salamanca, some of these motions have limited to the prospect of a single-province autonomous community exclusively for Le\u00f3n (\").\nGeography.\nLocation.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n is a landlocked autonomous community, located in the north-western quadrant of the Iberian Peninsula. Its territory borders on the north with the uniprovincial communities of Asturias and Cantabria, as well as with the Basque Country (Biscay and \u00c1lava); to the east with the uniprovincial community of La Rioja and with Aragon (province of Zaragoza), to the south with the Community of Madrid, Castile-La Mancha (provinces of Toledo and Guadalajara) and Extremadura (province of C\u00e1ceres) and to the west with Galicia (provinces of Lugo and Ourense) and Portugal (Bragan\u00e7a District and Guarda District).\nOrography.\nThe morphology of Castile and Le\u00f3n consists, for the most part, of the northern half of the Meseta Central (\"Meseta Norte\") and a belt of mountainous reliefs. The Meseta Central is a high plateau with an average altitude close to above sea-level; it is covered by deposited clay materials that have given rise to a dry and arid landscape.\nGeology.\nThe Northern Plateau (Meseta Norte) is constituted by Paleozoic sockets. At the beginning of the Mesozoic Era, once the Hercynian folding that raised the current Central Europe and the Gallaeci zone of Spain, the deposited materials were dragged by the erosive action of the rivers.\nDuring the alpine orogeny, the materials that formed the plateau broke through multiple points. From this fracture rose the mountains of Le\u00f3n, with mountains of not much height and, constituting the spine of the Plateau (Meseta), the Cantabrian Mountains and the Sistema Central, formed by materials such as granite or metamorphic slates.\nThe karst complex of Ojo Guare\u00f1a, consisting of 110\u00a0km of galleries and its caves formed in carbonatic materials of Coniacian which are situated on a level of impermeable marls, is the second largest of the peninsula.\nThis geological configuration has allowed upwellings of mineral-medicinal or thermal water, used now or in the past, in Almeida de Sayago, Bo\u00f1ar, Calabor, Caldas de Luna, Castromonte, Cucho, Gejuelo del Barro, Morales de Campos, Tresacasas, Valdelateja and Villarijo, among other places.\nHydrography.\nRivers.\nThe main hydrographic network of Castile and Le\u00f3n is constituted by the Douro river and its tributaries. From its source in the Picos de Urbi\u00f3n, in Soria, to its mouth in the Portuguese city of Porto, the Douro covers 897\u00a0km. From the north descend the Pisuerga, the Valderaduey and the Esla rivers, its tributaries more plentiful and by the east, with less water in its flows, highlight the Adaja and the Durat\u00f3n. After passing the town of Zamora, the Douro is confined between the canyons of the Arribes del Duero Natural Park, bordering with Portugal. On the left bank are important tributaries such as Tormes, Huebra, \u00c1gueda, C\u00f4a and Paiva, all from Sistema Central. On the right they reach the Sabor, the Tua and the T\u00e2mega, born in the Galician Massif. After the Arribes area, the Douro turns west into Portugal until it empties into the Atlantic Ocean.\nSeveral rivers of the community pour their waters into the Ebro basin, in Palencia, Burgos and Soria (Jal\u00f3n river), that of Mi\u00f1o-Sil in Le\u00f3n and Zamora, that of the Tagus in \u00c1vila and Salamanca (rivers Ti\u00e9tar and Alberche and Alag\u00f3n respectively) and Cantabrian basin in the provinces through which the Cantabrian Mountains extends.\nLakes and reservoirs.\nIn addition to the rivers, the Douro basin also hosts a large number of lakes and lagoons such as the Negra de Urbi\u00f3n Lake, in the Picos de Urbi\u00f3n, the Grande de Gredos Lake, in Gredos, the Sanabria Lake, in Zamora or the La Nava de Fuentes Lake in Palencia. Also emphasize a great amount of reservoirs, fed by the water coming from the rains and the thaw of the snowy summits. Thus, Castile and Le\u00f3n, despite not having abundant rainfall, is one of the communities in Spain with the highest level of water dammed.\nMany of these natural lakes are being used as an economic resource, boosting rural tourism and helping to conserve ecosystems. The Sanabria Lake was a pioneer in this.\nClimate.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n has a continental Mediterranean climate, with long, cold winters, with average temperatures between 3 and 6\u00a0\u00b0C in January and short, hot summers (average 19 to 22\u00a0\u00b0C), but with the three or four months of summer aridity characteristic of the Mediterranean climate. Rainfall, with an average of 450\u2013500\u00a0mm per year, is scarce, accentuating in the lower lands.\nIn Castile and Le\u00f3n the cold extends almost continuously for much of the year, being a very characteristic element of its climate. The coldest periods of winter are associated with invasions of a continental polar front and strata of marine arctic air, rare is that they do not reach temperatures of the order of -5 \u00b0 to -10\u00a0\u00b0C. Likewise, in situations of anticyclone, in the interior of the region they cause persistent fogs, creating prolonged cold situations due to radiation processes. The intense \"cold waves\" of the winter central months are typical, showing a particular tendency to occur from the second fortnight of December to the first of February. During its course the most extreme minimum temperatures occur, whose values vary between -10 \u00b0 and -13\u00a0\u00b0C of its westernmost sector and -15 \u00b0 and -20\u00a0\u00b0C of the central plains and high moorlands. The lowest recorded records reach -22\u00a0\u00b0C of Burgos, -21.9\u00a0\u00b0C in Coca (Segovia), -20.4\u00a0\u00b0C in \u00c1vila, -20\u00a0\u00b0C in Salamanca and -19.2\u00a0\u00b0C in Soria. The high altitude of the Meseta and its mountains accentuates the contrast between winter and summer temperatures, as well as day and night temperatures.\nMaritime winds are stopped by the mountainous barriers that surround Castile and Le\u00f3n, stopping also the precipitations and causing the rains to fall very unequally in the Castilian and Leonese territory. While in the middle of the Douro basin there is an annual average of 450\u00a0mm, in the western regions of the mountains of Le\u00f3n, the Cantabrian Mountains and the southern area of the provinces of \u00c1vila and Salamanca, rainfall reaches 1500\u00a0mm per year, with a maximum of 3400\u00a0mm per year in the western part of the Sierra de Gredos, in the Candelario-Bejar Massif, which makes this area the rainiest not only from Spain, but from the Iberian Peninsula.\nAlthough Castile and Le\u00f3n is framed within the continental climate, in its lands different climate domains are distinguished:\nNature.\nFlora.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n has many protected natural sites. Actively collaborates with the European Union program \"Natura 2000\". There are also some special protection area for birds or SPA.\nThe solitary evergreen oaks and junipers (\"Juniperus sect. Sabina\") that now draw the Castilian-Leonese plain are remnants of the forests that covered these same lands long ago. The agricultural holdings, due to the need of land for the cultivation of cereal and pastures for the immense herds of the Castilian Plateau, supposed the deforestation of these lands during the Middle Ages. The last Castilian and Leonese forests of junipers are found in the provinces of Le\u00f3n, Soria and Burgos. They are not very leafy forests that can form mixed communities with evergreen oaks, Portuguese oaks or pines.\nThe Castilian-Leonese slope of the Cantabrian Mountains and the northern foothills of the Sistema Ib\u00e9rico have a rich vegetation. The most humid and fresh slopes are populated by large beeches, whose extension areas can reach 1,500 m altitude. In turn, the European beech forms mixed forests with the yew, the sorbus, the whitebeam, the European holly and the birch. On the sunny slopes the sessile oak, the European oak, the ash, the lime tree, the sweet chestnut, the birch and the scots pine (a typical species from the north of the province of Le\u00f3n).\nFauna.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n presents a great diversity of fauna. There are numerous species and some of them are of special interest because of their uniqueness, such as some endemic species, or because of their scarcity, such as the brown bear. There have been counted 418 species of vertebrates, which make up 63% of all vertebrates that live in Spain. Animals adapted to life in the high mountains, inhabitants of rocky places, inhabitants of fluvial courses, species of plains and forest residents form the mosaic of the Castilian-Leonese fauna.\nThe isolation to which the high summits are subject leads to the existence of abundant endemisms such as the Spanish ibex, which in Gredos constitutes a unique subspecies in the Peninsula. The European snow vole is a graceful small mammal of grayish brown color and long tail that lives in open spaces over the limit of the trees.\nSmall and large mammals such as squirrel, dormouse, talpids, European pine marten, Beech marten, fox, wildcat, wolf, quite abundant in some areas, boar, deer, roe deer and, only in the Cantabrian Mountains, some specimens of brown bear tend to frequent the deciduous forests, although some species also extend to coniferous forests and scrubland. The wildcat is slightly larger than a domestic cat, has a short and stout tail, with dark rings and striped fur. The Iberian lynx, however, lives almost exclusively in areas of Mediterranean scrubland.\nSmall reptiles such as the ladder snake, the coronella girondica and the aesculapian snake are also found in this environment. The smooth snake can be found from sea level to 1,800 m in height and in the community it tends to live on the heights. Further up, in the rocky areas of the subalpine floor at about 2,400 m altitude the Iberian rock lizard lives, one of the few reptiles adapted at this point.\nIn the mountain rivers live the otter and desman and in its waters the trout, anguillidae, the common minnows and some of the increasingly scarce autochthonous river crabs. The otter and the desman are two mammals with aquatic habits and very good swimmers. The otter feeds mainly on fish, while the desman seeks its food among the aquatic invertebrates that inhabit the riverbed. In lower sections of calmer waters swim barbel s and carps. Among the amphibians, the salamanders and as remarkable species: the Almanzor salamander (\"Salamandra salamandra almanzoris\") and the Gredos toad (\"Bufo bufo gredosicola\"), which are two endemic subspecies to the Sistema Central.\nWhere the rivers are encased forming sickles and canyons, rock-dwelling birds such as griffon vulture, cinereous vulture, Egyptian vulture, golden eagle or peregrine falcon. The Egyptian vulture, a small vulture, is black and white with a yellow head. Downstream and on its banks between the lush vegetation form their colonies the black-crowned night heron and the grey heron and the goldcrest, the eurasian penduline tit, the eurasian hoopoe and the common kingfisher.\nAmong the birds that populate the open Mediterranean forests live two endangered species: the black stork and the Spanish imperial eagle. The black stork, much rarer than its congener the white stork, is of solitary habits and lives far from man. The Spanish imperial eagle nests in the trees and feeds mainly on rabbits, but also birds, reptiles and carrion.\nIn the coniferous forests live among others the short-toed treecreeper, the coal tit and the eurasian nuthatch, a bird of gray back and flanks reddish-orange that it nests in holes to which it narrows the entrance with mud. The western capercaillie is a very dark and large rooster that lives in forest environments, so it is very difficult to observe. Among the forest raptors are the accipiter, the eurasian sparrowhawk or the tawny owl, which frequently attack other smaller birds such as eurasian jay, iberian green woodpecker, fringilla, great spotted woodpecker and typical warbler.\nThe bustard frequents the open plains with rain-fed crops; It is large and has a grayish head and neck and a brown back. In the Castilian-Leonese wetlands during the winter many specimens of greylag goose, which breeds in northern Europe and visits the area in winter, are concentrated.\nThe naturalist F\u00e9lix Rodr\u00edguez de la Fuente (1928 \u2013 1980), natural from Poza de la Sal, stands out in the scientific study and its dissemination. He had a great research and made the leap to fame with the television series \"El hombre y la Tierra\" (TVE).\nIn the Monta\u00f1a Palentina, in the municipality of San Cebri\u00e1n de Mud\u00e1, a program of reintroduction of the European bison, animal that had been a thousand years without presence in the Iberian Peninsula, in order to avoid the extinction of the species.\nDemography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWith 2\u00a0391\u00a0682\u00a0inhabitants (1 January 2024), the population of Castile and Le\u00f3n represents 4.92% of the population of Spain, although its vast territory covers almost a fifth of the total area of the country. In January 2024, the population of Castile and Le\u00f3n was divided, by province, as follows: Province of \u00c1vila, 160\u00a0463\u00a0inhabitants; Province of Burgos, 359\u00a0740; Province of Le\u00f3n, 447\u00a0802; Province of Palencia, 158\u00a0063; Province of Salamanca, 327\u00a0552; Province of Segovia, 156\u00a0620; Province of Soria, 90\u00a0073; Province of Valladolid, 525\u00a0398; and Province of Zamora, 166\u00a0253.\nThe autonomous community has a very low population density, around 25.38\u00a0inhabitants/km2, a record that is more than three times lower than the national average, which indicates that it is a sparsely populated and demographically decline, especially in rural areas and even in small traditional cities. The demographic characteristics of the territory show an aging population, with a low birth rate and mortality that approaches the state average.\nIn the year 2000, the population of Castile and Le\u00f3n totaled 2\u00a0479\u00a0118 people, that is, 6.12% of the Spanish total. Its natural growth was one of the lowest in Spain: -7223 (-2.92 gross rate), as a result of the difference between the 25\u00a0080 deaths (10.12 of the gross rate) and the 17\u00a0857 births ( 7.20 gross rate). The number of inhabitants in 1999 was slightly higher (2\u00a0488\u00a0062), so that, despite the negative growth, the relative numerical stability is partly due to the increase in immigration: of 22\u00a0910 immigrants in 1999 it went to 24\u00a0340 in 2000. In that year, 59 children under the age of one year died.\nThe life expectancy is higher than the Spanish average: 83.24 for women and 78.30 for men, a superiority that in 1999 was repeated in the register, since women added 1\u00a0260\u00a0906 and the males 1\u00a0227\u00a0156. A study by the University of Porto (Portugal) cites Castile and Le\u00f3n as one of the European regions where old people could expect to live longer.\nIn 1999, the age distribution gave the following results: 317\u00a0783 people from 0 to 14 years old; 913\u00a0618 between 15 and 39 years old; 576\u00a0183 from 40 to 59 years and 677\u00a0020 over 60 years.\nThe active population in 2001 was 1\u00a0005\u00a0200 and occupied 884\u00a0200 people, with which the unemployment was 12.1% of the active population. For sectors of the employed population, 10.9% worked in agriculture, 20.6% in the industry, 12.7% in construction, and 63,1% in the services sector.\nHistorical evolution.\nMany of the people of the territory, who devoted themselves mostly to agriculture and livestock, gradually abandoned the area, heading towards urban areas, much more prosperous. This situation was further aggravated at the end of the Spanish Civil War, with a progressive rural emigration. During the 1960s and 1980s, large urban centers and provincial capitals suffered a slight demographic increase due to a thorough urbanization process, although, despite this, the Castilian-Leonese area continues to suffer serious depopulation. Only the provinces of Burgos, Valladolid and Segovia are gaining population in recent years.\nThere is also an increase in the population of metropolitan areas around cities such as Valladolid, Burgos or Le\u00f3n. Due to this phenomenon, cities such as Laguna de Duero or San Andr\u00e9s del Rabanedo have seen their population increase rapidly in a few years. The metropolitan area of the city of Valladolid is, by far, the largest in the autonomous community, with more than 430\u00a0000\u00a0inhabitants.\nHowever, in absolute terms the autonomous community is losing population and aging. In 2011, it was one of only four autonomous communities that lost population along with Asturias, Galicia and Aragon.\nPresent-day population distribution.\nIn 1960 the urban population meant 20.6% of the total population of Castile and Le\u00f3n; in 1991 this percentage had risen to 42.3% and in 1998 it was approaching 43%, which indicates the progressive rural depopulation. The phenomenon is also reflected in the number of municipalities with less than 100 inhabitants, which was multiplied by seven between 1960 and 1986. Outside the provincial capitals, the largest towns are Miranda de Ebro and Aranda de Duero in the province of Burgos, Ponferrada and San Andr\u00e9s del Rabanedo in the province of Le\u00f3n, B\u00e9jar in the province of Salamanca, El Espinar and Cu\u00e9llar in the province of Segovia, Ar\u00e9valo in the province of \u00c1vila, Benavente in the province of Zamora, El Burgo de Osma in the province of Soria, Aguilar de Camp\u00f3o in the province of Palencia and Medina del Campo and Laguna de Duero in the province of Valladolid.\nOf the 2248 municipalities of this community, the 2014 registry registered 1986 with less than 1000 inhabitants; 204 from 1001 to 5000; 35 from 5001 to 10\u00a0000; 8 of 10\u00a0001 to 20\u00a0000; 6 of 20\u00a0001 to 50\u00a0000; 5 of 50\u00a0001 to 100\u00a0000 and 4 municipalities with more than 100\u00a0000 inhabitants. The latter are: Valladolid (306\u00a0830\u00a0hab.), Burgos (177\u00a0776\u00a0hab.), Salamanca (148\u00a0042\u00a0hab.) And Le\u00f3n (129\u00a0551\u00a0hab.) Among the least populated are, between others: Jaramillo Quemado (Burgos), with 4\u00a0inhabitants, Estepa de San Juan (Soria), with 7, Qui\u00f1oner\u00eda (Soria), with 8 and Villanueva de Gormaz (Soria), with 9.\nThere is a table below showing the largest municipalities in terms of population according to the municipal census of the INE of 2024:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReligion.\nCatholicism is the predominant religion in the community. According to the barometer of the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) conducted in October 2019, 76.8% of Castilian-Leonese are considered Catholics (43.2 Non-Practising and 33.6% Practising), and non-believers 20.3%.\nActual attendance at a church is on average less than these figures show. According to the same study, only half of self identifying Catholics go to mass regularly with those considered \"practicing\" Catholics attending more regularly than those considered \"non practicing\".\nForeign population.\nAs of 2022, the region had a foreign population of 146,655. The largest groups of foreigners were those of Moroccan, Romanian, Bulgarian and Colombian citizenship.\nLanguages.\nSpanish is the only official and preponderant language throughout the territory. The phenomena of \"le\u00edsmo\" and \"la\u00edsmo\" are considered to be deviations characteristic of the varieties of Spanish spoken in the region, later irradiating to other territories.\nIn addition to Spanish (also referred to in the Spanish-speaking world as ; transl.\u2009'Castilian'), other languages or linguistic varieties are spoken in small areas of Castile and Le\u00f3n: the Leonese language, that \"will be subject to specific protection [...] because of its particular value within the Community's linguistic heritage\" and Galician language, which, according to the Statute of Autonomy, \"will enjoy respect and protection in the places where it is usually used\" (fundamentally, in the border areas with Galicia of the comarcas of El Bierzo and Sanabria). In the Salamancan comarca of El Rebollar, a modality of Extremaduran language is spoken (of the Asturian-Leonese branch) known as Palra d'El Rebollal. In Merindad de Sotoscueva (province of Burgos) a Castilian is spoken with some dialectal features of the Asturian-Leonese. In the Trevi\u00f1o enclave, as of 2012 about a fifth of the population spoke Basque.\nLanguages spoken by some of the largest immigrant communities include Bulgarian, Romanian, and Arabic.\nAdministration and politics.\nTerritorial organization.\nThe community is the sum of nine provinces: Province of \u00c1vila, Province of Burgos, Province of Le\u00f3n, Province of Palencia, Province of Salamanca, Province of Segovia, Province of Soria, Province of Valladolid and Province of Zamora. The provincial capitals fall in the homonymous cities to their corresponding provinces.\nThe concurrence of some peculiar geographical, social, historical and economic characteristics is legally recognized for El Bierzo (an area that was a province on its own in the project of initial provincial division, though it disappeared in the 1833 territorial division of Spain), and the comarca of \"El Bierzo\" was created in 1991, with its center in Ponferrada. It is the only Castilian-Leonese territory recognized by law outside the normal provincial division, and it is administered by a Comarcal Council. Castile and Le\u00f3n also includes the exclave of Trevi\u00f1o, surrounded by the Basque province of Araba/\u00c1lava.\nProvision of services.\nThe new territorial arrangement approved by Law 7/2013, on Planning, Services and Government of the Territory of the Community of Castile and Le\u00f3n, establishes that the geographical spaces delimited for the provision of services are the basic unit of territorial planning and services (UBOST) -urban or rural- and functional areas -stable or strategic-. Also, the new ordination determines that the mancommunities of common interest are entities for the fulfillment of their specific purposes, which may be declared when their territorial scope substantially agrees with an UBOST or several contiguous ones.\nThis ordination is still in the implementation phase, and in September 2015 the draft map dividing the autonomous community was presented in 147 rural UBOST and 15 urban UBOST.\nAutonomous institutions.\nThe main autonomous institutions are:\nThe Statute of Autonomy does not explicitly establish one capital. Initially the Cortes were installed provisionally in Burgos; the possibility of fixing a capital in Tordesillas was also discussed, although the final decision was to install the Cortes provisionally in the castle of Fuensalda\u00f1a.\nThe region's 1983 statute of autonomy did not name a capital. The articles referred only to the \"seat of government\", that could only be fixed with a two-thirds approval in the Cortes of Castile and Le\u00f3n. In 1987, President of the Junta of Castile and Le\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar approved that the basic bodies of regional rule \u2013 the presidency, Junta and the Cortes \u2013 would be located in Valladolid.\nOne reason for the lack of the official capital is that the merger of Castile and Le\u00f3n as one autonomous community caused uproar in the latter, which wanted to be separate. Other autonomous bodies are in the capitals of other provinces of the region. The High Court of Justice of Castile and Le\u00f3n is in Burgos, the Court of Audits is in Palencia, the Advisory Council is in Zamora, the Ombudsman is in Le\u00f3n.\nIn March 2009, the Junta of Castile and Le\u00f3n apologised for school textbooks that named Valladolid as capital, saying that it was an honest confusion of its status as a seat. In February 2010, the People's Party in Valladolid City Hall rejected a Spanish Socialist Workers' Party proposal for the city to become the official capital, saying it could \"provoke eight motions against it\" from the other provincial capitals. In September 2019, Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Santiago Ju\u00e1rez of Valladolid's PP made a proposal of the same matter, which was opposed by the party leadership.\nCortes of Castile and Le\u00f3n.\nDuring the first legislature, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party was the party with the most representation in Cortes, being the first president of the community the Socialist Demetrio Madrid. Since the 1990s, regional policy has been framed by a series of absolute majorities of the People's Party, which continues to comfortably govern at present. Other national parties with presence in the community, either locally or regionally, are United Left (previously as Communist Party of Spain) and Union, Progress and Democracy, with a significant presence in the provinces of \u00c1vila and Burgos. Previously Democratic and Social Centre of Adolfo Su\u00e1rez also managed to be in the regional political life occupying the reformist center of the political spectrum.\nThe Leonesism through the Leonese People's Union, the Castilianism through Party of Castile and Le\u00f3n, previously Commoners' Land or localistas parties like Independent Solution, Group of Zamoran Independent Electoral Members or Initiative for the Development of Soria have also had their presence, although at a lower level.\nThe community is governed by Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco, of the People's Party. This party obtained 29 procurators in the 2019 Castilian-Leonese regional election. Ma\u00f1ueco's investiture was supported by the party Citizens, with 12 representatives. The party that obtained the most seats at the election, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party is in opposition, with 35 representatives. The leader of the opposition is Luis Tudanca. In addition, four more formations obtained parliamentary representation in the region: Podemos (2 seats), Vox (1), X\u00c1vila (1) and Leonese People's Union (1).\nA 2024 law passed by the regional Castile and Le\u00f3n coalition (including Vox and the People's Party) omitted any mention of General Franco as a dictator, which sparked criticism.\nHuman rights.\nThe roots of modern human rights theories has its origins in Castile and Le\u00f3n. The School of Salamanca was an intellectual movement of 16th-century where humanism raised, being its major contributor Francisco de Vitoria.\nThe Valladolid debate was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of Indigenous people by European colonizers.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n is the only autonomous region in Spain without a specific regional law protecting LGBTQ+ citizens. Several LGBTQ+ organizations exists in the region, such as Segovia Entiende, Espacio Seguro LGBTQ+ Burgos, Chiguitxs LGTB+ Palencia, Arco \u00c1vila, Awen Le\u00f3n or Fundaci\u00f3n Triangulo Castilla y Le\u00f3n.\nSince 2022 the Festival Zorrilla's Fest is celebrated annually in Valladolid during Pride Week to promote LGBTQ+ artists and local LGBTQ+ engagement. Since then artists such as Samantha Hudson, Putochinomaric\u00f3n, Javiera Mena or Tremenda Jaur\u00eda have performed in the Festival.\nThe first transgender person in Spain to reach Professor level at University is Marina S\u00e1enz, in the Law School of Valladolid University.\nAbortion law is applied as in the rest of the country, but women might suffer difficulties due to the high proportion of medical practitioners objecting to practise abortions.\nEconomy.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 57.9 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 4.8% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 25,800 euros or 85% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 97% of the EU average.\nUnemployment rate.\nIn July 2009, in full Great Recession, unemployment reached 14.14% of the population, when in 2007 it was half, 6,99%. According to the survey of the employment of the fourth quarter of 2014, the employment rate is 54.91% and the unemployment rate is 20.28%, while the national figure is 59,77% of employment and 23.70% of unemployed. Below the regional average of unemployment are Segovia (14.33%), Valladolid (16.65%), Soria (16.96%) and Burgos (18.76%), while above Salamanca (21,25%), Le\u00f3n (22.65%), Palencia (23.22%), \u00c1vila (25.33%) and Zamora (26.62%).\nThe unemployment rate stood at 14.1% in 2017 and was slightly lower than the national average.\nPrimary sector.\nThe fields of Castile and Leon are arid and dry although very fertile, predominating in them the dryland farming. Despite this, irrigation has been gaining importance in the areas of the valleys of Douro, Esla, \u00d3rbigo, Pisuerga and Tormes. The scarce orography and the improvement of communications has favored the entry of technical innovations throughout the process of agricultural production, especially in areas such as the province of Valladolid or the province of Burgos where the production per hectare is one of the highest in Spain. The most fertile Castilian-Leonese area coincides with the Esla valley, in Le\u00f3n, in the fields of Valladolid and Tierra de Campos, a district that extends between province of Zamora, province of Valladolid, province of Palencia and province of Le\u00f3n.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n has an agricultural area close to 5,783,831 hectares, which is more than half of the total area of its total territory. Most of the farmland is dryland, due to the climate and the low rainfall. Only 10% of the area is irrigated, with plots of intensive production, much more profitable than dryland crops.\nDespite the decline of the population in rural areas, the Castilian-Leonese agricultural production still represents 15% of the Spanish primary sector and its average occupation is lower than that of other autonomous communities.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n constitutes one of the main Spanish cereal areas. As the popular saying says: \"Castile, granary of Spain\". Although the most traditional crop was wheat, the production of barley has gained ground since the 1960s. These two cereals are followed, in number of hectares cultivated and volume of production, rye and oats. In addition to legumes, such as carob and chickpeas, sunflower cultivation has spread in the southern countryside.\nThe vineyard (56,337 ha) saw the number of hectares cultivated during the last three decades of the 20th century decrease considerably; However, the application of the most modern aging techniques has notably improved the Castilian-Leonese wines, which compete in quality with those of La Rioja and begin to be known outside the Spanish borders. The main viticultural areas of the region are Ribera del Duero (DO), Rueda (DO), Toro (DO), Bierzo (DO), Arribes (DO) and Tierra de Le\u00f3n (DO). Irrigated land is planted with sugar beet, a product that has been subsidized by the regional authorities, potatoes, alfalfa and vegetables. In the province of Le\u00f3n, corn, hops and legumes are also sown.\nLivestock represents an important part of the final agricultural production. Next to the small livestock units, which proliferate in the regions of pre-eminent agricultural dedication or in the mountain areas, now appears a modern livestock activity, with cattle, pig and sheep farms, of development. These farms are oriented both to the production of meat and to the supply of milk to the cooperatives that channel their subsequent commercialization, since the dairy production of Castile and Le\u00f3n -more than one and a half million liters per year- is the second largest in Spain, only surpassed by Galicia.\nThus, small livestock farms tend to disappear, largely due to the effect of rural depopulation and the consequent loss of labor. Transhumant grazing is conserved in some areas; large herds, mainly sheep, travel every year hundreds of kilometers from the flat lands to the land with mountain pastures as in the El Bierzo, the Cantabrian valleys of province of Le\u00f3n, the sierra de Gredos or Picos de Urbi\u00f3n. It is hard work that every time has less labor, having previously constituted a testimony of first importance on the history and cultural roots of the Castilian and Leonese people.\nThe sheep herd is the most numerous, with 5,425,000 heads, followed by domestic pig (2,800,000) and cattle (1,200,000). A long way away is the goats (166,200 heads) and horses (71,700 horses, mules and donkeys). The highest production of meat corresponds to that of pigs (241,700 t), followed by bovine (89,400 t) and poultry (66,000 t); in wool production Castile and Le\u00f3n leads the national balance with 7,500 t. Within the section of Protected Geographical indication (I.G.P), highlights Lechazo de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, based in Aranda de Duero.\nIn Castile and Le\u00f3n there are about 1,900,000 hectares of non-arboreal, representing 40% of the total forest area. This deforestation is mainly due to the hand of the man who, over the centuries, has made forests disappear, giving way to areas of non-arboreal vegetation. Little by little, with the abandonment of rural areas and the reforestation policy of the Castilian and Leonese governments, this situation has been reversed.\nSecondary sector.\nDuring 2000, the Castile and Le\u00f3n industry occupied 18% of the active population and contributed 25% of GDP. The most developed industrial axis is that of Valladolid-Palencia-Burgos-Miranda de Ebro-Aranda de Duero, where there is an important car industry, paper industry, aeronautics and chemistry, and is where most of the industrial activity of the Castilian-Leonese territory is concentrated. The food industry derived from the farm and livestock, with flour, sunflower oil and wines, among others is also important, especially in the Ribera del Duero comarca, especially in Aranda de Duero.\nThe main industrial poles of the community are: Valladolid (21,054 workers dedicated to the sector), Burgos (20,217), Aranda de Duero (4,872), Le\u00f3n (4,521), Ponferrada (4,270) and \u00d3lvega (4,075).\nOther industries are textiles in B\u00e9jar, roof tiles and bricks in Palencia, sugar in Le\u00f3n, Valladolid, Toro, Miranda de Ebro and Benavente, the pharmaceutical company in Le\u00f3n, Valladolid and mainly in Aranda de Duero with a factory of the GlaxoSmithKline group, the metallurgical and steel company in Ponferrada and the chemistry in Miranda de Ebro and Valladolid, the aeronautics in Miranda de Ebro and Valladolid. In the remaining capitals there is a food industry derived from the agricultural and livestock exploitation, with flour, sunflower oil and wines, among others. This regional agro-food industry is flagged by Calidad Pascual based in Aranda de Duero. In the agricultural industry, within the production of fertilizers, the Mirat, founded in 1812 in Salamanca, stands out.\nIn Soria the logging industry and furniture manufacturing is also relevant to the regional economy.\nThe president of the Castilian-Leonese employers' association is currently Gin\u00e9s Clemente, owner of the Aciturri Aeron\u00e1utica, based in Miranda de Ebro. It is a leading international aeronautical group, with contracts with groups such as Boeing and Airbus, which makes Castile and Le\u00f3n a benchmark in the sector.\nThe 16,34% of the companies in Castile and Le\u00f3n belong to the auxiliary sector of construction. Among the largest companies in the sector, the following stand out: Grupo Pantersa, Begar, Grupo MRS, Isolux Cors\u00e1n, Llorente Corporation, Volconsa and of auxiliary construction sector, Artepref of Gerardo de la Calle Group.\nIn Castile and Le\u00f3n, the mining activity acquired great importance in the Roman times, when a road was drawn, the V\u00eda de la Plata, to transfer the gold extracted in the deposits of Las M\u00e9dulas, in the Leonese comarca of El Bierzo, the route started from Asturica Augusta (Astorga) to Emerita Augusta (M\u00e9rida) and Hispalis (Seville).\nCenturies later, after the Spanish Civil War, mining was one of the factors that contributed to the economic development of the region. However, the production of iron, tin and tungsten decreased notably from the 1970s, while bituminous coal and anthracite mines were maintained thanks to the domestic demand for coal for thermal power plants. The economic reconversion that affected the Leonese mining basin and Palencian mining basin during the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the closure of numerous mines, social impoverishment, with a sharp increase of unemployment and the beginning of a new migratory movement towards other Spanish regions. Despite the investments of the Mining Action Plan of the Junta de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, traditional coal mining operations have entered into a severe crisis.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n is a net producer of electric energy, with a generation/demand ratio in 2021 of 197% (27,016 GWh vs. 13,670 GWh).\nIn addition to the northern basin, in those of the Douro and Ebro rivers there are numerous hydroelectric plants that allow Castile and Le\u00f3n to be one of the first autonomous communities producing electricity. Among others are those of Burguillo, Rioscuro, Las Ondinas, Cornatel, B\u00e1rcena, Aldead\u00e1vila I and II, Saucelle I and II, Castro I and II, Villalcampo I and II, Valpara\u00edso and Ricobayo I and II.\nThe total installed hydraulic power amounts to 3,979 MW and annual production in 2010 was 5,739 GWH. Only in the system Saltos del Duero there are more than 3000 MW installed. In this way, Castile and Le\u00f3n is the first Spanish autonomous community in installed capacity and the second in production.\nThe nuclear power is 466 MW, having produced 3,579.85 GWh in 2009. The only nuclear plant in Castile and Le\u00f3n on 1 August 2017, was definitively and irrevocably closed.\nThe coal thermal produces around 16,956 GWh per year at the following plants:\nThe region stands out for the importance of the production of renewable energy. Castile and Le\u00f3n is the community that covers the largest proportion of its electricity demand through renewable energies: 82,9% in 2009. Traditional hydroelectric power It has been added with force since the late 1990s and 2000 wind power, with more than 100 parks in operation and a production of 5,449 GWh in that same year. By provinces, it is at the top Burgos with 46, and a total of 3,128 MW of installed power.\nAmong the non-renewable energies is also the natural gas (194 MW of installed power) and fuel-diesel fuel (69 MW).\nThe provinces of Valladolid and Burgos are the most economically advanced regions, with a GDP per capita higher than the national average. Even so, the average GDP per capita of the community of Castile and Le\u00f3n is slightly below than average, at 21,244 euros per inhabitant.\nTertiary sector.\nTourism.\nSome of its tourism highlights include the walls of \u00c1vila, and the cathedrals of Burgos and Leon.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n has several cities whose Holy Week is considered to be of International Tourist Interest. Examples are Holy Week in Le\u00f3n, Holy Week in Salamanca, Holy Week in Valladolid or Holy Week in Zamora.\nThe region also has a wide network of Paradores, hotels of great quality that usually accommodate buildings of great historical value in privileged places to stimulate tourism in the area.\nSince 1988, the foundation \"Las Edades del Hombre\" has been organizing various exhibitions of religious art in various parts of the national and international geography, highlighting for its interest the exhibitions held in Castile and Le\u00f3n. The idea of carrying out these exhibitions was conceived in a chimney of Alcazar\u00e9n with the writer Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez Lozano and the priest of Valladolid Jos\u00e9 Velicia. The first \"Las Edades del Hombre\" were held in the Church of Santiago Ap\u00f3stol of Alcazar\u00e9n, with a small exhibition of sacred paintings. Later, and with the support of important personalities, the first known exhibition was held among the public, which was that of Valladolid. In 2012 the initiative was developed under the name of \"Monacatus\" in the town of O\u00f1a, being one of the most multitudinous editions with about 200\u00a0000 visitors. The last sample so far has taken place in the municipality of Ar\u00e9valo, in 2013. With the title of \"Credo\", the exhibition has revolved around the faith and has received more than 226\u00a0000 visitors.\nDomestic trade and exports abroad.\nThe internal trade of Castile and Le\u00f3n is concentrated in the sector of food, automotive, fabric and footwear. For foreign trade, according to the region, vehicles and car chassis are mainly exported in Province of \u00c1vila, Province of Palencia and Province of Valladolid, tires in Province of Burgos and Province of Valladolid, steel bars and slate manufactures in Le\u00f3n, beef in Province of Salamanca, pigs in Province of Segovia, rubber manufactures in Province of Soria and goat and sheep meat, together with wine, in Province of Zamora.\nCastile and Le\u00f3n also exports a lot of wine, being Province of Valladolid the one that more bottles sells abroad. As regards imports, vehicles and their accessories, such as engines or tires, are in the lead. The Region also imports mainly products from France, Italy, United Kingdom, [Germany, [Portugal and the United States and exports mostly to the countries of the European Union and to Turkey, Israel and United States.\nTransportation.\nRail.\nCastilla y Le\u00f3n has an extensive rail network, including the principal lines from Madrid to Cantabria and Galicia as well as the Le\u00f3n-Bilbao line across its north, making Europe's longest narrow-gauge line. The line from Paris to Lisbon crosses the region, reaching the Portuguese frontier at Fuentes de O\u00f1oro in Salamanca. Astorga, Burgos, Le\u00f3n, Miranda de Ebro, Palencia, Ponferrada, Medina del Campo and Valladolid are all important railway junctions.\nRailways operate in several different gauges: Iberian gauge (), UIC gauge () and narrow-gauge (). Except for the Ponferrada - Villablino line, Ferrocarril MSP under the Junta of Castile and Le\u00f3n, trains are operated by Renfe on lines maintained by the Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (ADIF); both of these are national, state-owned companies. \nRoads.\nThe region is also crossed by two major ancient routes:\nThe road network is regulated by the Ley de carreteras 10/2008 de Castilla y Le\u00f3n (Highway Law 10/2008 of Castile and Le\u00f3n).\nAir.\nThe region has 4 airports:\nHowever, others airports such as Asturias Airport, Bilbao Airport, Santiago\u2013Rosal\u00eda de Castro Airport, Vigo Airport, Zaragoza Airport and Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport are also used by air travellers from the region.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most common safeword system is the \"traffic light\" system, in which \"red\" means \"stop\", \"amber\" or \"yellow\" means \"proceed with caution\", and \"green\" means \"more, please!\"\nSome couples may feel that they do not need a safeword, depending on the practices involved, since the role of a safeword is filled by usual forms of communication. Less commonly, some couples may agree to abandon the use of safewords including the ability to withdraw consent altogether, especially those that practice forms of edgeplay or those in Master/slave relationships. In such cases, the choice to give up the use of safewords is a consensual act on the part of the bottom or submissive.

Pillow lavas in volcanic rock are characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses, commonly up to one meter in diameter. They form the upper part of Layer 2 of normal oceanic crust.\nComposition.\nPillow lavas are commonly of basaltic composition, although pillows formed of komatiite, picrite, boninite, basaltic andesite, andesite, dacite or even rhyolite are known. In general, the more felsic the composition (richer in silica - resulting in an Intermediate composition), the larger the pillows, due to the increase in viscosity of the erupting lava.\nOccurrence.\nThey occur wherever lava is extruded underwater, such as along marine hotspot volcano chains and the constructive plate boundaries of mid-ocean ridges. As new oceanic crust is formed, thick sequences of pillow lavas are erupted at the spreading center fed by dykes from the underlying magma chamber. Pillow lavas and the related sheeted dyke complexes form part of a classic ophiolite sequence (when a segment of oceanic crust is thrust over the continental crust, thus exposing the oceanic segment above sea level).\nThe presence of pillow lavas in the oldest preserved volcanic sequences on the planet, the Isua and Barberton greenstone belts, confirms the presence of large bodies of water on the Earth's surface early in the Archean Eon. Pillow lavas are used generally to confirm subaqueous volcanism in metamorphic belts.\nPillow lavas are also found associated with some subglacial volcanoes at an early stage of an eruption.\nFormation.\nThey are created when magma reaches the surface but, as there is a large difference in temperature between the lava and the water, the surface of the emergent tongue cools very quickly, forming a skin. The tongue continues to lengthen and inflate with more lava, forming a lobe, until the pressure of the magma becomes sufficient to rupture the skin and start the formation of a new eruption point nearer the vent. This process produces a series of interconnecting lobate shapes that are pillow-like in cross-section. The skin cools much faster than the inside of the pillow, so it is very fine-grained, with a glassy texture. The magma inside the pillow cools slowly, so it is slightly coarser-grained than the skin, but it is still classified as fine grained.\nUse as a way-up criterion.\nPillow lavas can be used as a way-up indicator in geology; that is, study of their shape reveals the attitude, or position, in which they were originally formed. Pillow lava shows it is still in its original orientation when:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70289", "revid": "50713147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70289", "title": "Trachea", "text": "Cartilaginous tube that exists\nThe trachea (pl.: tracheae or tracheas), also known as the windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all animals' lungs. The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. At the top of the trachea, the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the larynx. The trachea is formed by a number of horseshoe-shaped rings, joined together vertically by overlying ligaments, and by the trachealis muscle at their ends. The epiglottis closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.\nThe trachea begins to form in the second month of embryo development, becoming longer and more fixed in its position over time. Its epithelium is lined with column-shaped cells that have hair-like extensions called cilia, with scattered goblet cells that produce protective mucins. The trachea can be affected by inflammation or infection, usually as a result of a viral illness affecting other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, called croup, that can result in a cough. Infection with bacteria usually affects the trachea only and can cause narrowing or even obstruction. As a major part of the respiratory tract, the trachea, when obstructed, prevents air from entering the lungs; thus, a tracheostomy may be required. Additionally, during surgery, if mechanical ventilation is required during anaesthesia, a\u00a0tube is inserted into the trachea: this is called tracheal intubation.\nIn insects, the word \"trachea\" is used for a very different organ than in vertebrates. The respiratory system of insects consists of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles, which together transport metabolic gases to and from tissues.\nStructure.\nAn adult's trachea has an inner diameter of about and a length of about , wider in males than females. The trachea begins at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx at the level of sixth cervical vertebra (C6) and ends at the carina, the point where the trachea branches into left and right main bronchi., at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), although its position may change with breathing. The trachea is surrounded by 16\u201320 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are 4 millimetres high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped. Ligaments connect the rings. The trachealis muscle connects the ends of the incomplete rings and runs along the back wall of the trachea. Also adventitia, which is the outermost layer of connective tissue that surrounds the hyaline cartilage, contributes to the trachea's ability to bend and stretch with movement.\nAlthough trachea is a midline structure, it can be displaced normally to the right by the aortic arch.\nNearby structures.\nThe trachea passes by many structures of the neck and chest (thorax) along its course.\nIn front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin. Several other structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the jugular arch, which joins the two anterior jugular veins, sits in front of the upper part of the trachea. The sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles stretch along its length. The thyroid gland also stretches across the upper trachea, with the isthmus overlying the second to fourth rings, and the lobes stretching to the level of the fifth or sixth cartilage. The blood vessels of the thyroid rest on the trachea next to the isthmus; superior thyroid arteries join just above it, and the inferior thyroid veins below it. In front of the lower trachea lies the manubrium of the sternum, the remnants of the thymus in adults. To the front left lie the large blood vessels the aortic arch and its branches the left common carotid artery and the brachiocephalic trunk; and the left brachiocephalic vein. The deep cardiac plexus and lymph nodes are also positioned in front of the lower trachea.\nBehind the trachea, along its length, sits the oesophagus, followed by connective tissue and the vertebral column. To its sides run the carotid arteries and inferior thyroid arteries; and to its sides on its back surface run the recurrent laryngeal nerves in the upper trachea, and the vagus nerves in the lower trachea.\nThe trachealis muscle contracts during coughing, reducing the size of the lumen of the trachea.\nBlood and lymphatic supply.\nThe upper part of trachea receives and drains blood through the inferior thyroid arteries and veins; the lower trachea receives blood from bronchial arteries. Arteries that supply the trachea do so via small branches that supply the trachea from the sides. As the branches approach the wall of the trachea, they split into inferior and superior branches, which join with the branches of the arteries above and below; these then split into branches that supply the anterior and posterior parts of the trachea. The inferior thyroid arteries arise just below the isthmus of the thyroid, which sits atop the trachea. These arteries join () with ascending branches of the bronchial arteries, which are direct branches from the aorta, to supply blood to the trachea. The lymphatic vessels of the trachea drain into the pretracheal nodes that lie in front of the trachea, and paratracheal lymph nodes that lie beside it.\nDevelopment.\nIn the fourth week of development of the human embryo as the respiratory bud grows, the trachea separates from the foregut through the formation of ridges which eventually separate the trachea from the oesophagus, the tracheoesophageal septum. This separates the future trachea from the oesophagus and divides the foregut tube into the laryngotracheal tube. By the start of the fifth week, the left and right main bronchi have begun to form, initially as buds at the terminal end of the trachea.\nThe trachea is no more than 4\u00a0mm in diameter during the first year of life, expanding to its adult diameter of approximately 2\u00a0cm by late childhood. The trachea is more circular and more vertical in children compared to adults, varies more in size, and also varies more in its position in relation to its surrounding structures.\nMicroanatomy.\nThe trachea is lined with a layer of interspersed layers of column-shaped cells with cilia. The epithelium contains goblet cells, which are glandular, column-shaped cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. Mucus helps to moisten and protect the airways. Mucus lines the ciliated cells of the trachea to trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled as phlegm. This self-clearing mechanism is termed mucociliary clearance. Directly beneath this mucus layer lies the submucosa layer which is composed primarily of fibrous connective tissue and connects the mucosa to the rings of hyaline cartilage beneath.\nThe trachea is surrounded by 16 to 20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are incomplete and C-shaped. Two or more of the cartilages often unite, partially or completely, and they are sometimes bifurcated at their extremities. The rings are generally highly elastic but they may calcify with age.\nFunction.\nThe trachea's main function is to transport air to and from the lungs. It also helps to warm, humidify, and filter the air before it reaches the lungs.\nThe trachea is made up of rings of cartilage, which help to keep it open and prevent it from collapsing. The inside of the trachea is lined with a mucous membrane, which produces mucus to help trap dirt and dust particles. The cilia, which are tiny hairs that line the mucous membrane, help to move the mucus and trapped particles up and out of the trachea.\nClinical significance.\nInflammation and infection.\nInflammation of the trachea is known as tracheitis, usually due to an infection. It is usually caused by viral infections, with bacterial infections occurring almost entirely in children. Most commonly, infections occur with inflammation of other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, known as croup, however bacterial infections may also affect the trachea alone, although they are often associated with a recent viral infection. Viruses that cause croup are generally the parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, with influenza viruses A and B also causing croup, but usually causing more serious infections; bacteria may also cause croup and include \"Staphylococcus aureus\", \"Haemophilus influenzae\", \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\" and \"Moraxella catarrhalis\". Causes of bacterial infection of the trachea are most commonly \"Staphylococcus aureus\" and \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\". In patients who are in hospital, additional bacteria that may cause tracheitis include \"Escherichia coli\", \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\", and \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\".\nA person affected with tracheitis may start with symptoms that suggest an upper respiratory tract infection such as a cough, sore throat, or coryzal symptoms such as a runny nose. Fevers may develop and an affected child may develop difficulty breathing and sepsis. Swelling of the airway can cause narrowing of the airway, causing a hoarse breathing sound called stridor, or even cause complete blockage. Up to 80% of people affected by bacterial tracheitis require the use of mechanical ventilation, and treatment may include endoscopy for the purposes of acquiring microbiological specimens for culture and sensitivity, as well as removal of any dead tissue associated with the infection. Treatment in such situations usually includes antibiotics.\nNarrowing.\nA trachea may be narrowed or compressed, usually a result of enlarged nearby lymph nodes; cancers of the trachea or nearby structures; large thyroid goitres; or rarely as a result of other processes such as unusually swollen blood vessels. Scarring from tracheobronchial injury or intubation; or inflammation associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis may also cause a narrowing of the trachea (tracheal stenosis). Obstruction invariably causes a harsh breathing sound known as stridor. A camera inserted via the mouth down into the trachea, called bronchoscopy, may be performed to investigate the cause of an obstruction. Management of obstructions depends on the cause. Obstructions as a result of malignancy may be managed with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A stent may be inserted over the obstruction. Benign lesions, such as narrowing resulting from scarring, are likely to be surgically excised.\nOne cause of narrowing is tracheomalacia, which is the tendency for the trachea to collapse when there is increased external pressure, such as when airflow is increased during breathing in or out, due to decreased compliance. It can be due to congenital causes, or due to things that develop after birth, such as compression from nearby masses or swelling, or trauma. Congenital tracheomalacia can occur by itself or in association with other abnormalities such as bronchomalacia or laryngomalacia, and abnormal connections between the trachea and the oesophagus, amongst others. Congenital tracheomalacia often improves without specific intervention; when required, interventions may include beta agonists and muscarinic agonists, which enhance the tone of the smooth muscle surrounding the trachea; positive pressure ventilation, or surgery, which may include the placement of a stent, or the removal of the affected part of the trachea. In dogs, particularly miniature dogs and toy dogs, tracheomalacia, as well as bronchomalacia, can lead to tracheal collapse, which often presents with a honking goose-like cough.\nInjury.\nThe trachea may be injured by trauma such as in a vehicle accident, or intentionally by another wilfully inflicting damage for example as practiced in some martial arts.\nIntubation.\nTracheal intubation refers to the insertion of a tube down the trachea. This procedure is commonly performed during surgery, in order to ensure a person receives enough oxygen when sedated. The catheter is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics. This is often one of the responsibilities of an anaesthetist during surgery.\nIn an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a tracheotomy is often performed to insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the airway can be kept open. The provision of the opening via a tracheotomy is called a tracheostomy. Another method procedure can be carried, in an emergency situation, and this is a cricothyrotomy.\nCongenital disorders.\nTracheal agenesis is a rare birth defect in which the trachea fails to develop. The defect is usually fatal though sometimes surgical intervention has been successful.\nA tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital defect in which the trachea and esophagus are abnormally connected (a ). This is because of abnormalities in the separation between the trachea and oesophagus during development. This occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 births, and the most common abnormalities is a separation of the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus, with the upper end finishing in a closed pouch. Other abnormalities may be associated with this, including cardiac abnormalities, or VACTERL syndrome. Such fistulas may be detected before a baby is born because of excess amniotic fluid; after birth, they are often associated with pneumonitis and pneumonia because of of food contents. Congenital fistulas are often treated by surgical repair. In adults, fistulas may occur because of erosion into the trachea from nearby malignant tumours, which erode into both the trachea and the oesophagus. Initially, these often result in coughing from swallowed contents of the oesophagus that are aspirated through the trachea, often progressing to fatal pneumonia; there is rarely a curative treatment. A tracheo-oesophageal puncture is a surgically created hole between the trachea and the esophagus in a person who has had their larynx removed. Air travels upwards from the surgical connection to the upper oesophagus and the pharynx, creating vibrations that create sound that can be used for speech. The purpose of the puncture is to restore a person's ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed.\nSometimes as an anatomical variation one or more of the tracheal rings are formed as complete rings, rather than horseshoe shaped rings. These \"O\" rings are smaller than the normal C-shaped rings and can cause narrowing () of the trachea, resulting in breathing difficulties. An operation called a \"slide tracheoplasty\" can open up the rings and rejoin them as wider rings, shortening the length of the trachea. Slide tracheoplasty is said to be the best option in treating tracheal stenosis.\nMounier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of an abnormally enlarged trachea, characterised by absent elastic fibres, smooth muscle thinning, and a tendency to get recurrent respiratory tract infections.\nReplacement.\nFrom 2008, operations have experimentally replaced tracheas, with those grown from stem cells, or with synthetic substitutes, however this is regarded as experimental and there is no standardised method. Difficulties with ensuring adequate blood supply to the replaced trachea is considered a major challenge to any replacement. Additionally, no evidence has been found to support the placement of stem cells taken from bone marrow on the trachea as a way of stimulating tissue regeneration, and such a method remains hypothetical.\nIn January 2021, surgeons at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York performed the first complete trachea transplantation. The 18-hour procedure included harvesting a trachea from a donor and implanting it in the patient, connecting numerous veins and arteries to provide sufficient blood flow to the organ.\nOther animals.\nAllowing for variations in the length of the neck, the trachea in other mammals is, in general, similar to that in humans. Generally, it is also similar to the reptilian trachea.\nVertebrates.\nIn birds, the trachea runs from the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary bronchi diverge. Swans have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum; this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. In some birds, the tracheal rings are complete, and may even be ossified.\nIn amphibians, the trachea is normally extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear primary bronchi. A longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked salamanders, and in caecilians. While there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian trachea, these do not form the rings found in amniotes.\nThe only vertebrates to have lungs, but no trachea, are the lungfish and the \"Polypterus\", in which the lungs arise directly from the pharynx.\nInsects.\nIn insects, the word \"trachea\" describes a different organ than in vertebrates. Insects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, deep airways (tracheae) and tracheoles to conduct air directly to and from metabolic tissues. The distribution of spiracles can vary greatly among the many orders of insects, but in general each body segment can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects to an air cavity called \"atrium\" and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. The tracheae are invaginations of the cuticular exoskeleton that branch (anastomose) throughout the body with diameters from only a few micrometres up to 0.8\u00a0mm. Diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place across the walls of the smallest tubes, called tracheoles, which penetrate tissues and even indent individual cells. Gas may be conducted through the respiratory system by means of active ventilation or passive diffusion. Unlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry oxygen in their hemolymph.\nThis is one of the factors that may limit their size.\nA tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. Taenidia provide strength and flexibility to the trachea. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae may also be connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control the flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a gill, or function essentially as normal, via a plastron. Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are lined with cuticular tissue and are shed during moulting (ecdysis).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its administrative center is the town of Birobidzhan.\nThe JAO was designated by a Soviet official decree in 1928, and officially established in 1934. At its height, in the late 1940s, the Jewish population in the region peaked around 46,000\u201350,000, approximately 25% of its population. Since then, the share of Jews steadily declined, and according to the 2021 Russian census, there were only 837 ethnic Jews left in the JAO (0.6%).\nArticle 65 of the Constitution of Russia provides that the JAO is Russia's only autonomous oblast. It is one of two officially Jewish jurisdictions in the world, the other being Israel. It is one of the few places in the world where Yiddish is a recognized minority language.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAnnexation of the Amur Region by Russia.\nPrior to 1858, the area of what is today the Jewish Autonomous Oblast was ruled by a succession of Chinese imperial dynasties. In 1858, the northern bank of the Amur River, including the territory of today's Jewish Autonomous Oblast, was split away from the Qing Chinese territory of Manchuria and became incorporated into the Russian Empire pursuant to the Treaty of Aigun (1858) and the Convention of Peking (1860).\nMilitary colonization.\nIn December 1858, the Russian government authorized the formation of the Amur Cossack Host to protect the south-east boundary of Siberia and communications on the Amur and Ussuri rivers. This military colonization included settlers from Transbaikalia. Between 1858 and 1882, many settlements consisting of wooden houses were founded. It is estimated that as many as 40,000 men from the Russian military moved into the region.\nExpeditions of scientists, including geographers, ethnographers, naturalists, and botanists such as Mikhail Ivanovich Venyukov, Leopold von Schrenck, Karl Maximovich, Gustav Radde, and Vladimir Leontyevich Komarov promoted research in the area.\nConstruction of the Trans-Siberian Railway.\nIn 1899, construction began on the regional section of the Trans-Siberian Railway connecting Chita and Vladivostok. The project produced a large influx of new settlers and the foundation of new settlements. Between 1908 and 1912, stations opened at Volochayevka, Obluchye, Bira, Birakan, Londoko, In, and Tikhonkaya. The railway construction finished in October 1916 with the opening of the Khabarovsk Bridge across the Amur at Khabarovsk.\nDuring this time, before the 1917 revolution, most local inhabitants were farmers. The only industrial enterprise was the Tungussky timber mill, although gold was mined in the Sutara River, and there were some small railway workshops.\nRussian Civil War.\nIn 1922, during the Russian Civil War, the territory of the future Jewish Autonomous Oblast became the scene of the Battle of Volochayevka.\nSoviet policies regarding Jews.\nAlthough Judaism as a religion ran counter to the Bolshevik party's policy of atheism and their crackdown on organized Jewish communities by closing synagogues and harassing believers, Vladimir Lenin also wanted to appease minority groups to gain their support and provide examples of tolerance.\nIn 1924, the unemployment rate among Jews exceeded 30 percent, as a result of USSR policies against private property ownership, which prohibited them from being craftspeople and small businessmen as many had been prior to the revolution. With the goal of getting Jews back to work to be more productive members of society, the government established Komzet, the committee for the agricultural settlement of Jews. The Soviet government entertained the idea of resettling all Jews in the USSR in a designated territory where they would be able to pursue a lifestyle that was \"socialist in content and national in form\". The Russians also wanted to offer an alternative to Zionism, the establishment of the Mandate of Palestine as a Jewish homeland. Socialist Zionists such as Ber Borochov were gaining followers at that time, and Zionism was the favored ideology in the world's political economy to the Yiddish interpretations, which were essentially incompatible with the USSR because of the Yiddish movement's growing opposition (e.g. Emma Goldman) to the very ethno-nationalism which constituted and structured Soviet states.\nCrimea was initially considered in the early 1920s, when it already had a significant Jewish population. Two Jewish districts () were formed in Crimea and three in south Ukraine. However, an alternative scheme, perceived as more advantageous, was put into practice.\nEarly history.\nEstablishment.\nEventually, Birobidzhan, in what is now the JAO, was chosen by the Soviet leadership as the site for the Jewish region. The choice of this area was a surprise to Komzet; the area had been chosen for military and economic reasons. This area was often infiltrated by China, while Japan also wanted Russia to lose the provinces of the Soviet Far East. At the time, there were only about 30,000 inhabitants in the area, mostly descendants of Trans-Baikal Cossacks resettled there by tsarist authorities, Koreans, Kazakhs, and the Tungusic peoples. The Soviet government wanted to increase settlement in the remote Russian Far East, especially along the vulnerable border with China. General Pavel Sudoplatov writes about the government's rationale behind picking the area in the Far East: \"The establishment of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in Birobidzhan in 1928 was ordered by Stalin only as an effort to strengthen the Far Eastern border region with an outpost, not as a favour to the Jews. The area was constantly penetrated by Chinese and White Russian resistance groups, and the idea was to shield the territory by establishing a settlement whose inhabitants would be hostile to white Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, especially the Cossacks. The status of this region was defined shrewdly as an autonomous district, not an autonomous republic, which meant that no local legislature, high court, or government post of ministerial rank was permitted. It was an autonomous area, but a bare frontier, not a political center.\"\nOn 28 March 1928, the Presidium of the General Executive Committee of the USSR passed the decree \"On the attaching for Komzet of free territory near the Amur River in the Russian Far East for settlement of the working Jews.\" The decree meant \"a possibility of establishment of a Jewish administrative territorial unit on the territory of said region\".\nThe new territory was initially called the Birobidzhan Jewish National Raion.\nBirobidzhan had a harsh geography and climate: it was mountainous, covered with virgin forests of oak, pine and cedar, and also swamplands, and any new settlers would have to build their lives from scratch. To make colonization more enticing, the Soviet government allowed private land ownership. This led to many non-Jews settling in the oblast to get a free farm.\nIn the spring of 1928, 654 Jews arrived to settle in the area; however, by October 1928, 49.7% of them had left because of the severe conditions. In the summer of 1928, there were torrential rains that flooded the crops and an outbreak of anthrax that killed the cattle.\nOn 7 May 1934, the Presidium of the General Executive Committee accepted the decree on its transformation into the Jewish Autonomous Region within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1938, with the formation of the Khabarovsk Territory, the Jewish Autonomous Region (JAR) was included in its structure.\nGrowth of Jewish communities in the early 1930s.\nIn the 1930s, a Soviet promotional campaign was created to entice more Jewish settlers to move there. The campaign partly incorporated the standard Soviet promotional tools of the era, including posters and Yiddish-language novels describing a socialist utopia there. In one instance, leaflets promoting Birobidzhan were dropped from an airplane over a Jewish neighborhood in Belarus. In another instance, a government-produced Yiddish film called \"Seekers of Happiness\" told the story of a Jewish family from overseas making a new life for itself in Birobidzhan.\nEarly Jewish settlements included Valdgeym, dating from 1928, which included the first collective farm established in the oblast, Amurzet, which was the center of Jewish settlement south of Birobidzhan from 1929 to 1939, and Smidovich.\nThe Organization for Jewish Colonisation in the Soviet Union, a Jewish Communist organization in North America, successfully encouraged the immigration of some US residents, such as the family of the future spy George Koval, which arrived in 1932. Some 1,200 non-Soviet Jews chose to settle in Birobidzhan.\nAs the Jewish population grew, so did the impact of Yiddish culture on the region. The settlers established a Yiddish newspaper, the \"Birobidzhaner Shtern\"; a theatre troupe was created; and streets being built in the new city were named after prominent Yiddish authors such as Sholom Aleichem and I. L. Peretz.\nStalin era and World War II.\nThe Jewish population of JAO reached a pre-war peak of 20,000 in 1937. According to the 1939 population census, 17,695 Jews lived in the region (16% of the total population).\nAfter the war ended in 1945, there was renewed interest in the idea of Birobidzhan as a potential home for Jewish refugees. The Jewish population in the region peaked at around 46,000\u201350,000 Jews in 1948, around 25% of the entire population of the JAO.\nCold War.\nThe census of 1959 found that the Jewish population of the JAO had declined by approximately 50%, down to 14,269 people.\nA synagogue was opened at the end of World War II, but it closed in the mid-1960s after a fire left it severely damaged.\nIn 1980, a Yiddish school was opened in Valdgeym.\nIn 1987, the reformist Soviet government led by Mikhail Gorbachev pardoned many political prisoners and told the American Jewish community that it would allow the emigration of 11,000 Jewish refuseniks. According to the 1989 Soviet Census, there were 8,887 Jews living in the JAO, or 4% of the total JAO population of 214,085.\nPost-Soviet history.\nIn 1991, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast became the federal subject of Russia and thus was no longer subordinated to Khabarovsk Krai. However, by that time, most of the Jews had emigrated from the Soviet Union and the remaining Jews constituted fewer than 2% of the local population. In early 1996, 872 people, or 20% of the Jewish population at that time, emigrated to Tel Aviv via chartered flights. As of 2002, 2,357 Jews were living in the JAO. A 2004 article stated that the number of Jews in the region \"was now growing\". As of 2005, Amurzet had a small active Jewish community. An April 2007 article in \"The Jerusalem Post\" claimed that the Jewish population had grown to about 4,000. The article cited Mordechai Scheiner, the Chief Rabbi of the JAO from 2002 to 2011, who said that, at the time the article was published, Jewish culture was enjoying a religious and cultural resurgence. By 2010, according to data provided by the Russian Census Bureau, there were only approximately 1,600 people of Jewish descent remaining in the JAO (1% of the total population), while ethnic Russians made up 93% of the JAO population.\nAccording to an article published in 2000, Birobidzhan has several state-run schools that teach Yiddish, a Yiddish school for religious instruction and a kindergarten. The five- to seven-year-olds spend two lessons a week learning to speak Yiddish, as well as being taught Jewish songs, dance, and traditions. A 2006 article in \"The Washington Times\" stated that Yiddish is taught in the schools, a Yiddish radio station is in operation, and the \"Birobidzhaner Shtern\" newspaper includes a section in Yiddish.\nIn 2002, \"L'Chayim, Comrade Stalin!\", a documentary on Stalin's creation of the Jewish Autonomous Region and its settlement, was released by The Cinema Guild. In addition to being a history of the creation of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, the film features scenes of contemporary Birobidzhan and interviews with Jewish residents.\nAccording to an article published in 2010, Yiddish is the language of instruction in only one of Birobidzhan's 14 public schools. Two schools, representing a quarter of the city's students, offer compulsory Yiddish classes for children aged 6 to 10.\nAs of 2012, the \"Birobidzhaner Shtern\" continues to publish 2 or 3 pages per week in Yiddish and one local elementary school still teaches Yiddish.\nAccording to a 2012 article, \"only a very small minority, mostly seniors, speak Yiddish\", a new Chabad-sponsored synagogue opened at the 14a Sholom-Aleichem Street, and the Sholem Aleichem Amur State University offers a Yiddish course.\nAccording to a 2015 article, kosher meat arrives by train from Moscow every few weeks, a Sunday school functions, and there is also a minyan on Friday night and Shabbat.\nA November 2017 article in \"The Guardian\", titled, \"Revival of a Soviet Zion: Birobidzhan celebrates its Jewish heritage\", examined the current status of the city and suggested that, even though the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia's far east is now barely 1% Jewish, officials hope to woo back people who left after Soviet collapse.\n2013 proposals to merge the JAO with adjoining regions.\nIn 2013, there were proposals to merge the JAO with Khabarovsk Krai or with Amur Oblast. The proposals led to protests, and were rejected by residents, as well as the Jewish community of Russia. There were also questions as to whether a merger would be allowed pursuant to the Constitution of Russia and whether a merger would require a national referendum.\nCulture.\nJAO and its history have been portrayed in the documentary film \"L'Chayim, Comrade Stalin!\". Released in 2002, the film tells the story of Joseph Stalin's creation of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast and its partial settlement by thousands of Russian- and Yiddish-speaking Jews. As well as relating the history of the creation of the proposed Jewish homeland, the film features scenes of life in contemporary Birobidzhan and interviews with Jewish residents.\nGeography.\nThe northern and western section of the oblast is mountainous, with the Lesser Khingan and the Bureya Range, among others. At Mount Studencheskaya, located in the Bureya Range, is the highest point of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. The southern and eastern section is part of the Amur valley, with only a few small residual ridges.\nClimate.\nThe territory has a monsoonal/anticyclonic climate, with warm, wet, humid summers due to the influence of the East Asian monsoon, and cold, dry, windy conditions prevailing in the winter months courtesy of the Siberian high-pressure system.\nGovernment.\nArticle 65 of the Constitution of Russia provides that the JAO is Russia's only autonomous oblast.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe Jewish Autonomous Oblast is divided into five districts, including Birobidzhan, a town which has district status; the oblast has one other town (Obluchye) and a further 11 urban-type settlements.\nEconomy.\nThe Jewish Autonomous Oblast is part of the Far Eastern Economic Region; it has industry and agriculture and its transportation network involves roads, rail and water ways. Although landlocked, it is a free economic zone. The oblast's mineral and building and finishing material resources are in demand on the Russian market. Nonferrous metallurgy, engineering, metalworking, and the building material, forest, woodworking, light industrial, and food industries are the most highly developed industrial sectors.\nAgriculture is the Jewish Autonomous Oblast's main economic sector owing to fertile soils and a moist climate.\nThe largest companies in the region include Kimkano\u2013Sutarsky Mining and Processing Plant (with revenues of $ million in 2017), Teploozersky Cement Plant ($ million) and Brider Trading House ($ million).\nTransportation.\nThe region's well-developed transportation network consists of of railways, including the Tsarist-era Trans-Siberian Railway; of waterways along the Amur and Tunguska rivers; and of roads, including of paved roads. The most important road is the Khabarovsk-Birobidzhan-Obluchye-Amur Region highway with ferry service across the Amur. The Birobidzhan Yuzhniy Airfield, in the center of the region, connects Birobidzhan with Khabarovsk and outlying district centers.\nTongjiang-Nizhneleninskoye railway bridge.\nThe Tongjiang-Nizhneleninskoye railway bridge is a long, $355 million bridge that links Nizhneleninskoye in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast with Tongjiang in the Heilongjiang Province of China. The bridge opened in 2021 and transports more than of cargo and 1.5 million passengers per year.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;The population of JAO has declined by over 40% since 1989 due to massive exodus in 1989\u20131996, with the numbers recorded being \u2009(1989 Soviet census) and \u2009(2021 census); \nEthnic groups.\nIn the late 1940s, the Jewish population in the region peaked around 46,000\u201350,000, approximately 25% of its population.

However, the 2021 Russian census indicated (see the table above) a population of only 837 ethnic Jews, or 0.6% of the JAO population were Jewish.\nVital statistics for 2024:\nTotal fertility rate (2024):\n1.35 children per woman\nLife expectancy (2021): \nTotal \u2014 66.12 years (male\u00a0\u2014 61.73, female\u00a0\u2014 70.58)\nLanguages spoken.\nIn the Soviet Union there was an attempt to make Yiddish an official language within Birobidzhan.\nAccording to the statute of JAO (1997), Yiddish is one of the recognized minority languages.\nYiddish is taught in three of the region's schools, but the community is almost exclusively Russian-speaking.\nAccording to an article published in 2000, Birobidzhan has several state-run schools that teach Yiddish, a Yiddish school for religious instruction and a kindergarten.

Judaism, despite being the associated religion of the oblast's titular ethnoreligious group, is practiced by just 1% of the population, which is only slightly higher than the national average and is close to that of communities in other federal subjects. In addition, 35% of the population identify as \"spiritual but not religious\", and 22% profess atheism, making the Jewish Autonomous Oblast one of the least religious regions in Russia. A total of 5% of the population follows other religions or declined to answer the question.\nArchbishop Ephraim (Prosyanka) (2015) is the head of the Russian Orthodox Eparchy (Diocese) of Birobidzhan (established 2002).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Birobidzhan is named after the two largest rivers in the autonomous oblast: the Bira and the Bidzhan. The Bira, which lies to the east of the Bidzhan Valley, flows through the town. Both rivers are tributaries of the Amur.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nBuilt on the site of an earlier village called Tikhonka, Birobidzhan was planned by the Swiss architect Hannes Meyer, and established in 1931. It became the administrative centre of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in 1934, and town status was granted to it in 1937. The 36,000\u00a0km2 area of Birobidzhan was approved by the Politburo on March 28, 1928. After the Bolshevik revolution, the Soviet government set up two organisations that worked with the settlement of Jews into Birobidzhan, the KOMZET and OZET. These organisations were responsible for the distribution of land as well as domestic responsibilities, ranging from moving to medical assistance. Many Jewish Canadians then gave their support to the Soviet Union by becoming either members or sympathisers with the Communist Party of Canada.\nJewish communists believed that the Soviet Union's creation of Birobidzhan was the \"only true and sensible solution to the national question.\" The Soviet government used the slogan \"To the Jewish Homeland!\" to encourage Jewish workers to move to Birobidzhan. The slogan proved successful in convincing Soviet Jews as well as Jews from other countries to move to the city. In 1935, Ambijan received permission from the Soviet government to aid Jewish families travelling to Birobidzhan from Poland, Romania, Lithuania and Germany. Jewish workers and engineers travelled to Birobidzhan from Argentina and the United States as well. This campaign by the Soviet government was known as the Birobidzhan Experiment.\nFactors behind the Birobidzhan Experiment.\nAlthough Birobidzhan was meant to serve as a home for the Jewish population, the authorities struggled to turn the idea into a reality. There were no important cultural connections between the land and the Jewish settlers. The growing population was culturally diverse, with some settlers focused on being modern Russian citizens, some disillusioned by modern cultures with a desire to work the land and promote socialist ideals, with few interested in establishing a cultural homeland. Ulterior motives generated by the Soviet government were the primary reasons for Jewish people to relocate to Birobidzhan. The placement of the Jews in Birobidzhan was meant to serve as a buffer to dissuade any Chinese or Japanese expansion. The region was also a link between the Trans-Siberian Railroad and the Amur River Valley, and the Soviet government sought to exploit the natural resources of the area, such as fish, timber, iron, tin, and gold.\nComplications during the Experiment.\nBefore the Russian Revolution of 1917, residence for Jews was restricted to the Pale of Settlement. As Jews relocated to Birobidzhan, they had to compete with the approximately 27,000 Russians, Cossacks, Koreans, and Ukrainians already residing there for property and land to develop new homes. This complicated the transition for the Jewish population, as there was no significant area to claim as their own.\nLogistically and practically, settling Birobidzhan proved to be difficult. Due to inadequate infrastructure and the weather conditions of the area, more than half the Jewish settlers who relocated to Birobidzhan after the initial settlement did not remain.\nWhen the Stalinist purges began, shortly after the creation of Birobidzhan, Jews there were targeted. Following World War II, tens of thousands of displaced Eastern European Jews found their way to Birobidzhan from 1946 to 1948. Some were Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews who were not allowed to return to their original homes. However, Jews were once again targeted in the wake of World War II when Joseph Stalin embarked on a campaign against \"rootless cosmopolitans\". Nearly all the Yiddish institutions of Birobidzhan were liquidated.\nNotable supporters of Birobidzhan.\nAmong Birobidzhan's proponents was Dudley Aman, 1st Baron Marley. After Lord Marley met Peter Smidovich and Jacob Tsegelnitski in August 1932, Marley became a proponent of Birobidzhan as a new homeland for Jewish workers and refugees. His visit to Birobidzhan in October 1933 was organised by Smidovich himself. Marley's assessment of the area was positive, and he became a more avid supporter of the settlement of Birobidzhan.\nYiddish writer David Bergelson played a large part in promoting Birobidzhan, although he himself did not settle there permanently. Bergelson wrote articles in the Yiddish language newspapers in other countries extolling the region as an ideal escape from antisemitism elsewhere. At least 1,000 families from the United States and Latin America came to Birobidzhan because of Bergelson. On his 68th birthday in 1952, Bergelson was among those executed during Stalin's antisemitic campaign against \"rootless cosmopolitans\" following the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.\nIn the Russian language play \"Novaia rodina\" (\"New Homeland\") by the Soviet playwright Victor Fink celebrated Birobidzhan as the coming together of three communities \u2013 the Koreans, the Amur Cossacks and the Jews. Each community has its own good and bad characters, but ultimately the good characters from each community learnt to cooperate and work with each other. To symbolise the unity achieved, the play ends with mixed marriages with one Jewish character marrying a Korean, another Jewish character marrying a Cossack and a Cossack marrying a Korean. Likewise, the Soviet Yiddish writer Emmanuil Kazakevich portrayed in a poem the achievement of Birobidzhan being declared the Jewish Autonomous Region on 7 May 1934 as an inter-communal event with the members of the Amur Cossack Host coming out to join the celebrations. Kazkevich's poem had a basis in reality as many members of the Amur Cossack Host hoped that Birobidzhan signalled Soviet interest in the neglected region along the banks of the Amur river.\nCanadian Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson was vice president of Ambijan, or the \"American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan,\" which was a supplementary group that was combined with ICOR in 1946. His support of Birobidzhan as a new homeland for Jewish families consisted of appearing at meetings in support of the relocation of Jews to Birobidzhan as well as advocating for families who truly wished to travel rather than those who were the most suited for the journey.\nJewish and Yiddish culture.\nThe Russian Empire had the largest Jewish population in the world in the 19th and early 20th centuries and the majority of them were Ashkenazi Jews. Large numbers of them remained even after 2 million of them departed for other countries prior to the formation of the Soviet Union. While thousands of Jews migrated to Birobidzhan, the hardship and isolation caused most to leave. In 1939 the Jewish population made up less than twenty percent of the overall population. Shortly after World War II, the Jewish population in the region reached its peak of about 30,000. As of the mid-2010s, only about 2,000 Jews remain in the region, making up about one half of a percent of the population.\nYiddish, at that time widely regarded as the \"lingua franca\" of the Jewish community, was meant to help integrate the Jewish population into the Soviet population. The language would ensure 'national in form, socialist in content' was being followed by the Soviet Jewry. Many government officials in the Kremlin were under the impression that Birobidzhan was to become the new centre for Soviet Jewish life, which is why Jewish migration to Birobidzhan was strongly pushed during the 1920s.\nThe Jewish religious community in Birobidzhan was officially registered in 1946. The religious community suffered persecution in the early 1950s. Jewish culture was revived in Birobidzhan much earlier than elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Yiddish theaters opened in the 1970s. Since the early 1990s, Yiddish and Jewish traditions were required components in all public schools, taught not as Jewish exotica but as part of the region's national heritage. The orthodox synagogue, completed in 2004, is next to a complex housing Sunday School classrooms, a library, a museum, and administrative offices. The buildings were officially opened in 2004 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.\nAccording to Israeli Rabbi Mordechai Scheiner, the former Chief Rabbi of Birobidzhan and Chabad Lubavitch representative to the region, \"Today one can enjoy the benefits of the Yiddish culture and not be afraid to return to their Jewish traditions. It's safe without any anti-Semitism, and we plan to open the first Jewish day school here.\" Scheiner also hosted the Russian television show, \"Yiddishkeit\" in the region. His student, actually born in Birobidzhan, Rabbi Eliyahu Riss, has taken over the reins since 2010.\nThe orthodox synagogue opened in 2004. Rabbi Scheiner says there are 4,000 Jews in Birobidzhan, just over 5 percent of the town's population of 75,000. The Birobidzhan Jewish community was led by Lev Toitman, until his death in September, 2007.\nConcerning the Jewish community of the oblast, Governor Nikolay Mikhaylovich Volkov has stated that he intends to \"support every valuable initiative maintained by our local Jewish organizations\". In 2007, the Birobidzhan International Summer Program for Yiddish Language and Culture was launched by Yiddish studies professor Boris Kotlerman of Bar-Ilan University. The town's main street is named after the Yiddish language author and humorist Sholem Aleichem.\nFor the Chanukah celebration of 2007, officials of Birobidzhan in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast claimed to have built the world's largest menorah. A November 2017 article in \"The Guardian\", titled, \"Revival of a Soviet Zion: Birobidzhan celebrates its Jewish heritage\", examined the current status of the city and suggested that, even though the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia's far east is now barely 1% Jewish, officials hope to woo back people who left after Soviet collapse.\nRabbi Eli Riss has set out to return the Jewish culture to the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. The current slogan is \"make Birobidzhan Jewish again\". The people want this to include teaching Yiddish in the school systems again as well as celebrating the variety of Jewish holidays. Riss' parents were originally residents of Birobidzhan, but moved to Israel in the 1990s along with a large majority of the Jewish population from the Oblast. He came back as the Chief Rabbi with plans of reinvigorating the Jewish culture. There are already plans for a kosher restaurant, supermarket, and mikveh. Riss is trying to make Birobidzhan a 'safe place for Jews' and has already stated that it is one of the few places he has been where he has not experienced any antisemitism.\nAdministrative and municipal status.\nBirobidzhan is the administrative center of the autonomous oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Birobidzhansky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Birobidzhan\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Birobidzhan is incorporated as Birobidzhan Urban Okrug.\nEconomy, infrastructure and transportation.\nThe chief economic activity is light industry, including textile and footwear. The city also has a vehicle repair factory, a furniture factory, a quicklime production factory, and several foodstuff factories. Khabarovsk is the closest major city to Birobidzhan and provides the closest major airport access to it, which is Khabarovsk Novy Airport (KHV / UHHH), 198\u00a0km from the center of Birobidzhan.\nEducation.\nThe Sholem Aleichem Amur State University works in cooperation with the local religious community. The university is unique in the Russian Far East. The basis of the training course is study of the Hebrew language, history and classic Jewish texts. The town now boasts several state-run schools that teach Yiddish, as well as an Anglo-Yiddish faculty at its higher education college, a Yiddish school for religious instruction and a kindergarten. The five- to seven-year-olds spend two lessons a week learning to speak Yiddish, as well as being taught Jewish songs, dance and traditions. It is a public school that offers a half-day Yiddish and Jewish curriculum for those parents who choose it. About half the school's 120 pupils are enrolled in the Yiddish course. Many of them continue on to Public School No. 2, which offers the same half-day Yiddish/Jewish curriculum from first through 12th grade. Yiddish is also offered at Birobidzhan's Pedagogical Institute, one of the only university-level Yiddish courses in the country. Today, the town's fourteen public schools must teach Yiddish and Jewish tradition.\nClimate.\nBirobidzhan experiences a harsh, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dwb\") that is typified by very large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and severely cold (and dry) winters. January has never had an above-freezing temperature.\nSports.\nThe bandy club Nadezhda played in the 2nd highest division, the Russian Bandy Supreme League, until the 2016\u201317 season. However, in 2017\u201318 the team did not play in the league.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nBirobidzhan is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is classified as a Double-A league. Despite the league's name, only its five South Division teams are actually based in the state of Texas; the five North Division teams are located in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as Double-A Central before reassuming its original moniker in 2022. \nThe Texas League was founded in 1902, although it traces its lineage back to a predecessor founded in 1888.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nThe league was founded in 1888 and ran through 1892. It was refounded in 1895 and ran through 1899 (under the name Texas Association in 1895 and Texas-Southern League in 1896).\nThe Texas League was revived as a Class D league in 1902, moved to Class C in 1904 where it played through 1910 (except for 1906 as Class D again), played at Class B until 1920, and finally moved up to Class A in 1921. The Texas League, like many others, shut down during World War II. From 1959 to 1961, the Texas League and the Mexican League formed the Pan American Association. The two leagues played a limited interlocking schedule and post-season championship. By 1971, the Texas League and the Southern League had both decreased to seven teams. They played an interlocking schedule with the Southern League known as the Dixie Association. The two leagues played separate playoffs. The Texas League has operated its own schedule since 1972.\nThe term \"Texas Leaguer\" to describe a bloop hit, a soft fly ball that falls for a hit beyond the infielders' reach but too short for the outfielders to catch, has been extant since at least 1903 and was common throughout American baseball in the 20th century and to some degree into the 21st. The source of the idiom is not known but among other theories has been attributed to Ollie Pickering's feat in a Texas League game of May 21, 1892, in which he made seven such hits in succession. Talk of this singular feat is supposed to have spread widely, bringing the term with it.\n21st century.\nAround the advent of the 21st century, the Texas League witnessed a great deal of change. Teams once known as the Jackson Mets, El Paso Diablos, Shreveport Captains, and Wichita Wranglers all relocated to new cities and bigger stadiums.\nIn 2019, the San Antonio Missions relocated to Amarillo, Texas, becoming the Amarillo Sod Poodles. At the same time, the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) moved to San Antonio to continue on as the Missions at the Triple-A level.\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Texas League was temporarily renamed to \"Double-A Central\" for the 2021 season.

Having been classified at various levels throughout its existence, it operated at Class A-Advanced from 1990 until its demotion to Single-A following Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the Low-A West before re-assuming its original moniker in 2022.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, league attendance continued to increase each season, with over one million fans attending games per year, part of a general nationwide growth and expansion to smaller towns, cities, and regions below those in the National League or American League with Minor League Baseball at various levels of play in growing popularity in the last few decades.\nHistory.\nThere were various attempts in the late 1800s and early 1900s to form a \"California League\" on the West Coast, considering the distance of the two current major leagues which generally had teams only in the Northeast and were restricted at first until World War I by long-distance train travel. The first organized California League lasted from 1887 to 1889, then another followed in 1891, and 1893, and finally in 1899\u20131902. After the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, an organization of minor leagues was formed in 1902, (following the \"truce\" and agreements between the older National League of 1876 and the newly \"upstart\" American League of 1901), the California League operated outside the NAPBL system as an independent league in 1902 and again from 1907 to 1909. This led to huge differences in the quality of teams competing with each other. In 1907, the San Francisco team was 3\u201334, while later in 1908 San Francisco was 9\u201367 and Oakland was 4\u201371. Oakland and San Francisco competed in every year of these various state leagues, with San Francisco having two teams during 1887\u201388.\nThe latest version of the California League was founded in 1941, and included teams in Anaheim, Bakersfield, Fresno, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, and Stockton. The following year, as a result of World War II, the league dropped to four teams, then ceased and suspended operations altogether, although major league baseball and some minor leagues continued as much as possible with limited availability of players during the war years. It reorganized and came back in 1946, adding teams in Visalia, San Jose, and Ventura by 1947. Further east, Reno, Nevada joined the league in 1955 with the movement of the old Channel Cities Oilers in Santa Barbara and continued as a member for 37 years.\nThough nicknames and affiliations shifted, the California League's postwar configuration was largely stable by the late 1950s; four of the six cities in the league in 1960 would still be part of the league 50 years later. The league reached eight clubs in 1966 and would hold that for ten years, briefly dipped to six before wavering between eight and nine clubs in the early eighties, then reached ten in 1986 and held that configuration for thirty-one seasons. From 1996 to 2016, the league had a remarkably stable alignment for Class A baseball, with no teams moving or folding for twenty-one years. After the 2016 season, the Bakersfield Blaze, long dogged by inadequate facilities and unable to negotiate significant repairs, and the High Desert Mavericks, suffering from falling attendance and a lease dispute with the city of Adelanto, were folded; the High-A level replaced them by expanding the Carolina League to ten teams.\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the California League was demoted to Low-A and temporarily renamed the \"Low-A West\" for the 2021 season.

Having been classified at various levels throughout its existence, it operated at Class A-Advanced from 1990 until its demotion to Single-A following Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues. The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the Low-A East before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.\nThe organization that later became the Carolina League formed in 1945, just as World War II was ending, and consisted of eight teams, six from North Carolina and two from southern Virginia. This later grew to as many as 12 teams at times.\nHistory.\nThe Carolina League was announced on October 29, 1944, after an organizational meeting at Durham, North Carolina. It was a successor to the Class D Bi-State League that existed before World War II. The league began play in 1945 with eight teams based in Burlington, Durham, Greensboro, Leaksville, Raleigh, Winston-Salem (all from North Carolina), along with Danville and Martinsville from Virginia.\nA few of the many Carolina League players who have gone on to star in the Major Leagues include Baseball Hall of Famers like: Johnny Bench (Peninsula, 1966), Wade Boggs (Winston-Salem, 1977), Rod Carew (Wilson, 1966), Chipper Jones (Durham, 1992), Willie McCovey (Danville, 1956), Joe Morgan (Durham, 1963), Dave Parker (Salem, 1972), Tony P\u00e9rez (Rocky Mount, 1962), and Carl Yastrzemski (Raleigh, 1959). Other notable future Major League players who honed their skills in the Carolina League include Barry Bonds (Prince William, 1985), Dock Ellis (Kinston, 1965), Dwight Evans (Winston-Salem, 1971), Dwight Gooden (Lynchburg, 1983), Zack Greinke (Wilmington, 2003), Andruw Jones (Durham, 1996), Andy Pettitte (Prince William, 1993), Jorge Posada (Prince William, 1993), Darryl Strawberry (Lynchburg, 1981), and Bernie Williams (Prince William, 1988).\nDirector and screenwriter Ron Shelton's 1988 film \"Bull Durham\", starring Kevin Costner, Tim Robbins, and Susan Sarandon, depicted a fictionalized account of the Durham Bulls, at that time a Carolina League team (they have since become a Triple-A team in the International League). Before he began making films, Shelton had a five-year minor league career in the Baltimore Orioles' organization, which included a stint in the International League.\nThe Carolina League added two expansion teams for the 2017 season to fill two vacant spots at the Class A-Advanced level previously occupied by the California League's Bakersfield Blaze and High Desert Mavericks, which ceased operations at the end of the 2016 season. These additional teams were the Down East Wood Ducks in Kinston, North Carolina, and the Buies Creek Astros in Buies Creek, North Carolina. After the 2018 season, the Buies Creek Astros relocated to Fayetteville, North Carolina as the Fayetteville Woodpeckers. After the 2019 season, the Potomac Nationals relocated within Northern Virginia to Fredericksburg, rebranding themselves as the Fredericksburg Nationals.\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Carolina League was demoted to Single-A and temporarily renamed the \"Low-A East\" for the 2021 season. In the realignment process, the Frederick Keys were demoted out of professional baseball into the hybrid amateur/professional MLB Draft League, the Wilmington Blue Rocks and Winston-Salem Dash were shifted to the South Atlantic League (retaining their High-A status), and five teams were moved from the old SAL to bring the CL to twelve member teams. Following MLB's acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the Carolina League name was restored effective with the 2022 season.\nIn July 2024, MiLB announced that the Hickory Crawdads will join the Carolina League in 2025, replacing the Down East Wood Ducks.\nCurrent teams.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAll-time teams (1945\u2013present).\nAll teams that have competed in the Carolina League since its founding in 1945:\nLeague timeline (1945\u2013present).\nCurrent team Earlier team\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In April 2014, the team moved to El Paso, Texas, and changed their name to the El Paso Chihuahuas.\nFranchise history.\nFollowing the 2010 season, the Portland Beavers were put up for sale after PGE Park (now Providence Park) was remodeled into a soccer-only configuration for the MLS's 2011 expansion Portland Timbers. In 2010, the Beavers were sold to Jeff Moorad, principal owner of the San Diego Padres.\nThe Move to Tucson.\nOn October 19, 2010, it was announced a site in Escondido, California had been selected for the new home of the Portland Beavers. The new ballpark was scheduled to open in April 2013. Until the move to Escondido could be completed the Padres would play their home games at Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium in Tucson, Arizona. In May 2011, citing reasons of proposed redevelopment revenue confiscation by the State, the ballpark plans in Escondido were placed on indefinite hold.\nFranchise sale.\nFollowing the California Supreme Court's decision to uphold the 2011 decision by the State to abolish redevelopment agencies it was decided by the Mayor of Escondido, Sam Abed, the city would not be able to build the proposed stadium. In reaction Jeff Moorad announced he would sell the team if a location within the San Diego area could not be found. No sites materialized and in December 2011, Moorad decided to place the Tucson Padres up for sale. By December 2011, Moorad had received offers from buyers in three cities outside California. No offers surfaced to keep the team in Tucson. As a result, the Padres played in Tucson for the 2012 season and, in July 2012, announced they would remain in Tucson for the 2013 season as well.\nRelocation to El Paso.\nOn July 30, 2012, the Pacific Coast League gave preliminary approval to MountainStar Sports Group, an ownership group based out of El Paso, Texas, for the purchase of the Tucson Padres. The final sale of the Padres to MountainStar Sports was approved on September 26, 2012. On October 22, 2013 in front of a capacity crowd inside the historic Plaza Theater in Downtown El Paso, the MountainStar Sports Group announced that the team would officially be renamed as the El Paso Chihuahuas.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The league closed down in 1928 and resumed play in 1936. It has continued uninterrupted, except for a four-year (1942\u20131945) suspension during World War II.\nInitially, the FSL was classified as a Class D circuit, roughly equivalent to a Rookie-level league today. It was elevated to Class C from 1921 to 1924, roughly equivalent to an Advanced Rookie league in the pre-2021 classification system and a Rookie-level league today. It reverted to Class D from 1925 to 1928. The league went dormant from 1929 to 1935 but was revived as a Class D circuit from 1936 to 1941.

The circuit temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the High-A Central before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.\nThe Lansing Lugnuts and Wisconsin Timber Rattlers franchises jointly have won the most Midwest League championships, with nine each.\nHistory.\nThe Midwest League directly evolved from two earlier leagues in the region. In 1947, the Class D Illinois State League (ISL) began operation with six Illinois teams: the Belleville Stags, Centralia Cubs, Marion Indians, Mattoon Indians, Mount Vernon Braves, and West Frankfort Cardinals. In 1949, the ISL changed its name to the Mississippi\u2013Ohio Valley League after Marion moved their franchise to Kentucky and became the Paducah Chiefs. In 1954, the Mississippi-Ohio Valley League expanded, adding teams in Clinton and Dubuque, Iowa. The Mississippi-Ohio Valley League was then renamed Midwest League in 1956.\nThe original teams in 1956, the first year of Midwest League play, were: Clinton Pirates, Decatur Commodores, Dubuque Packers, Kokomo Dodgers, Lafayette Red Sox, Mattoon Phillies, Michigan City White Caps and the Paris Lakers. Mattoon is the oldest franchise in the MWL, evolving into today's Fort Wayne TinCaps, while Clinton is the oldest MWL locale.\nIn 1960, the Davenport Braves joined the league as an expansion team. In 1962, Appleton, Burlington, and Cedar Rapids joined the Midwest League from the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League which folded operations when those franchises switched leagues.

During the 1990s several teams changed cities as Major League Baseball placed higher standards on minor league baseball facilities; franchises in smaller cities were sold to new owners who moved those teams to new ballparks in larger cities. Kenosha, Madison, Rockford, Springfield, Waterloo, and Wausau lost teams during this decade while Battle Creek, Dayton, Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids (West Michigan), Kane County, and Lansing gained teams.\nThe 1978 Appleton Foxes are ranked #93 on the Top-100 All Time teams by MiLB.com.

The league temporarily operated for the 2021 season as the High-A East before reassuming its original moniker in 2022.\nA number of different leagues known as the South Atlantic League (SAL) have existed since 1904. The most recent SAL adopted the moniker in 1980, having previously been the Western Carolinas League, founded in 1963. All of these have been nicknamed \"Sally League\".\nHistory.\nThere have been several South Atlantic Leagues in the history of minor league baseball, spanning from 1904 to the present with a few breaks. The league ran from 1904 to 1917 as a class C league, then started up again in 1919, also class C. This time it ran from 1919 to 1930, moving up to class B beginning in 1921. William G. Bramham became league president in mid-1924 and served until 1930. The league was restarted again as a class B from 1936 to 1942, shut down as a result of World War II, and returned in 1946 as a class A league. The AA Southern Association (which never integrated) died after the 1961 season and so the SAL was promoted to AA in 1963 to take its place; a year later the name was changed to the Southern League. Out of the 51 seasons of operation, Augusta, Georgia competed in 46, Macon, Georgia was around for 46, and Columbia, South Carolina was in 45. Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; and Columbus, Georgia; each competed for at least 29 years also, making for a relatively stable lineup.\nThe South Atlantic League name went unused for 16 years, but in 1980 the Western Carolinas League brought back the name when it sought to change its identity. For nearly 60 years, 1948 through 2007, the dominant figure in the WCL/SAL was league founder and president John Henry Moss, who started the WCL as a young man in 1948, refounded it in 1960 and then led it into the new century. Moss retired at the close of the 2007 South Atlantic League season. He died at age 90 on July 1, 2009, at Kings Mountain, North Carolina\u2014a town where he had also been mayor for 23 years.\nIn 2005, the SAL had the highest attendance in 101 years with over 3,541,992 fans (while minor league baseball set a second straight record with 41,333,279 attendees).

In addition to New York and Pennsylvania, from which the league drew its name, the NYPL also had clubs in Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont, West Virginia, and Connecticut.\nThe Brooklyn Cyclones were the last NYPL champions, defeating the Lowell Spinners, two games to one, in 2019. The Oneonta Yankees/Tigers won 12 championships, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Auburn Mets/Twins/Phillies/Doubledays (8) and Jamestown Falcons/Expos (7).\nHistory.\nThe New York\u2013Penn League was founded in 1939 as the Pennsylvania\u2013Ontario\u2013New York League, generally shortened to PONY League, in a hotel in Batavia, New York. The original teams included the Batavia Clippers, Bradford Bees, Hamilton Red Wings, Jamestown Jaguars, Niagara Falls Rainbows, and Olean Oilers; all were based in or near Western New York. The Oilers, a Brooklyn Dodgers affiliate, won both the regular season and playoff championships. Batavia was the last remaining charter city in the league when it ceased operations after the 2020 season.\nThe Hamilton Red Wings folded early in the 1956 season, and with no more teams in Ontario, the circuit became the New York\u2013Penn League in 1957. The league crossed back into Canada with the formation of the St. Catharines Blue Jays in 1986. They were joined by the Hamilton Redbirds in 1987 and the Welland Pirates in 1989, but all three clubs had moved back to the United States by 2000.\nThe New York\u2013Penn circuit was originally a Class D league (the minors' lowest classification through 1962).

The current NWL is the descendant of the Western International League (WIL), a Class B league from 1937 to 1951 (with a stoppage during World War II) and Class A from 1952 to 1954. The\u00a0league reformed as the Northwest League and dropped to Class B for the 1955 season. The WIL had ten teams in its final season, with four in Canada. \nIn 1955, the Northwest League was formed, with seven charter teams: Salem Senators, Eugene Emeralds, Yakima Bears, Spokane Indians, Tri-City Braves, Wenatchee Chiefs, and Lewiston Broncs. The league switched to the short season schedule in 1966;\nbetween then and 1982, the NWL fluctuated between four, six, and eight clubs. In 1983, the league returned to an eight-team circuit, which it maintained through 2019.\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June\u00a030.

Designed for rising freshmen and sophomores using wooden bats, its season runs from June through August. The league is part of Major League Baseball and USA Baseball's Prospect Development Pipeline. \nBetween 1911 and 2020, the Appalachian League operated as part of Minor League Baseball and various of its teams were low-level affiliates of Major League Baseball franchises. It operated as a Class D league during four stints through 1962, then was classified as a Rookie Advanced league from 1963 to 2020.\nHistory.\nThe original Appalachian League existed for four seasons from 1911 to 1914 and was classified as a Class D circuit. All teams were independent with no Major League Baseball (MLB) affiliation in the era. The charter Appalachian League teams were the Asheville Moonshiners, Bristol Boosters, Cleveland Counts, Johnson City Soldiers, Knoxville Appalachians, and Morristown Jobbers, playing in the inaugural season. After a six-year absence, the league reorganized for five seasons from 1921 to 1925, and, as before, it consisted entirely of independent teams at the Class D level. Following an 11-year period of inactivity, the third iteration of the Class D Appalachian League played from 1937 to 1955. The league went dormant in 1956, but was revived in 1957.\nAlong with a reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 1963, the Appalachian League reformed and was classified as a Rookie-level league. In its final years as an MLB-affiliated league, the Appalachian League was one of two \"Rookie Advanced\" minor leagues along with the Pioneer League. As such, it occupied the second-lowest rung in the minor league ladder. \nAlthough classified as a Rookie league, the level of play was slightly higher than that of the two \"complex\" Rookie leagues, the Gulf Coast League and Arizona League. Unlike the complex leagues, Appalachian League teams charged admission and sold concessions. It was almost exclusively the first fully professional league in which many players competed; most of the players had just been signed out of high school and were further along in their development than players in the \"complex\" leagues. It was a short-season league that competed from late June (when major league teams signed players whom they selected in the amateur draft) to early September.\nIt continued to operate as a Rookie Advanced league through 2020, with the start of the 2020 season postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled. Thus, 2019 was the Appalachian League's last season of operation within Minor League Baseball, with the Johnson City Cardinals winning the league championship. Entering the 2021 Major League Baseball season, MLB stated that 29 of its 30 teams had players who had played in the Appalachian League when it was part of Minor League Baseball, with a total of 139 such players on Opening Day rosters.\nIn conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Appalachian League was converted to an amateur collegiate summer baseball league designed for rising freshmen and sophomores. The reconfigured league become a part of Major League Baseball's Prospect Development Pipeline, a collaboration between MLB and USA Baseball. It is scheduled to play a 48-game regular season and continue to host an annual All-Star Game.

It operates as one of four Major League Baseball (MLB) Partner Leagues in the American independent baseball league system without MLB team affiliations. The league is contested by twelve teams from California and the Rocky Mountains region, who play a regular season split into two halves. The top two teams at the end of each half qualify for a postseason tournament that determines the overall champion. \nThe Pioneer League was established in 1939 as a Class C minor league consisting of six teams from Idaho and Utah. It later expanded to Montana as part of a failed effort in the 1950s to become a third major league rivalling the American and National leagues, complicated by competition with the Pacific Coast League. By the time it was reclassified as a Rookie league in 1964, only four teams in Idaho remained. Gradually, it returned to Montana and Utah, and expanded into Colorado and the Canadian province of Alberta by 1974, and since then has consistently had eight or more teams competing. In 2021, the league became independent, and ceased all MLB team affiliations, reorganizing as an MLB Partner League representing the Western United States market. Though all the league's teams in Alberta and Colorado have since folded or relocated, an expansion into California in the 2020s balanced the number of teams.\nAs of the 2026 season, four teams from California and Montana each, two from Idaho, one from Utah, and one currently relocating, compete in the Pioneer League. Twenty franchises have competed in the league across its -year history, with the Missoula PaddleHeads, a current team that joined as the Pocatello Cardinals in the inaugural season, being the longest-tenured. The Oakland Ballers are the current champions, while the Billings Mustangs have won the most championships (15).\nHistory.\nThe Pioneer League began in 1939 with six teams in Idaho and Utah, operating at the Class C level. The original six teams were the Boise Pilots, Lewiston Indians, Ogden Reds, Pocatello Cardinals, Salt Lake City Bees, and Twin Falls Cowboys. With players in short supply due to World War II, the league suspended operations for the 1943 through 1945 seasons.\nIn 1948, the league expanded by adding two teams in Montana; the Billings Mustangs and Great Falls Electrics. In these early years, teams in the league either operated independently or were affiliated with Major League Baseball (MLB) or Pacific Coast League (PCL) parent clubs, as the PCL was attempting to grow into a third major league (a bid that ultimately failed). When MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers displaced the PCL's Hollywood Stars in 1958, the Stars relocated and became the \"new\" Salt Lake City Bees, remaining in the PCL and taking away the Pioneer League's largest market.\nBy 1959, the Pioneer League was down to six teams; Billings and Great Falls along with the Boise Braves, Idaho Falls Russets, Missoula Timberjacks, and Pocatello Athletics. The league operated at the Class A level for one year (1963), before changing to Rookie league in 1964, when there were only four teams in the league; the Idaho Falls Angels, Magic Valley Cowboys, Pocatello Chiefs, and Treasure Valley Cubs. By 1978, the league had again grown to eight teams \u2014 Billings and Idaho Falls along with the Butte Copper Kings, Calgary Cardinals, Great Falls Giants, Helena Phillies, Lethbridge Dodgers, and Medicine Hat Blue Jays. With the exception of 1986 (when there were six teams), there have been at least eight teams in the league since then.\nIn 2016, total league attendance was 616,686, down slightly from the 2015 total of 633,622.\nIn its final years as an MLB-affiliated league, the Pioneer League was one of two \"Rookie Advanced\" minor leagues along with the Appalachian League. As such, it occupied the second-lowest rung in the minor league ladder. \nAlthough classified as a Rookie league, the level of play was slightly higher than that of the two \"complex\" Rookie leagues, the Gulf Coast League and Arizona League. Unlike the complex leagues, Pioneer League teams charged admission and sold concessions. It was almost exclusively the first fully professional league in which many players competed; most of the players had just been signed out of high school. It was a short-season league that competed from late June (when Major League teams signed players whom they selected in the amateur draft) to early September.\nAfter the 2018 season, the Helena Brewers relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where they now play as the Rocky Mountain Vibes.\nAs the start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled on June 30, making the 2019 season the league's last as an MLB-affiliated league of Minor League Baseball.\nIn conjunction with the reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Pioneer League was converted to an independent baseball league and was granted status as an MLB Partner League. The reconfigured league continued with the same franchises using the same identities, with the exception of the Orem Owlz who relocated to Windsor, Colorado, as the Northern Colorado Owlz. The Boise Hawks also joined the Pioneer League in 2021 after moving from the Northwest League.\nThe Pioneer League announced a five-year naming rights deal between the league and ticket vendor TicketSmarter that would have the league go as The Pioneer Baseball League presented by TicketSmarter starting in time for the 2022 season.\nOn April 10, 2024, Kelsie Whitmore signed with the Oakland Ballers of the Pioneer League. She became the first woman to play for that league later that year. On June 6, 2024, she became the first female player to start a Pioneer League game. In that game she struck out one batter. The league further expanded into California for its 2026 season, adding teams in Long Beach and Modesto \u2013 the latter as a replacement for the Modesto Nuts of the California League, who moved to San Bernardino and became the Inland Empire 66ers. Simultaneously, the league's presence in Colorado came to an abrupt end, after both the Rocky Mountain Vibes and short-lived Colorado Springs Sky Sox folded, and the Grand Junction Jackalopes relocated.\nTeams.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTimeline of franchises (1939\u2013present)\nChampions.\nLeague champions have been determined by different means since the Pioneer League's formation in 1939.

The budget for the ship was increased several times and ultimately $4.5\u00a0billion was spent on her construction, including a redesigned ship island. \"Ronald Reagan\" was christened by Reagan's wife Nancy on 4 March 2001 at Newport News Shipbuilding; the crew moved aboard on 30 October 2002 and the ship was commissioned on 12 July 2003 at Naval Station Norfolk, with Captain J.\u00a0W. Goodwin in command.\nVice President Dick Cheney and Second Lady Lynne Cheney were both present at the ceremony, along with Nancy Reagan, who gave the ship's crew the traditional first order as an active unit of the Navy: \"Man the ship and bring her to life.\" \"Ronald Reagan\" made her maiden voyage on 21 July 2003. President Reagan, who did not attend either the launch or the commissioning due to his Alzheimer's disease, died 11 months later. At the end of the graveside services, the ship's commanding officer at that time, Captain James Symonds, at Mrs. Reagan's request presented her the flag that draped the former president's casket. This particular flag had flown over Capitol Hill on 20 January 1981 for Reagan's first inauguration. At a later date, Captain Symonds also presented Mrs.\u00a0Reagan the flag that had been flying over \"Ronald Reagan\" when the former president died.\nNaming.\n\"Ronald Reagan\" is the first aircraft carrier and first nuclear-powered warship of any type to be named in honor of a living former president. Unlike most of the men honored by inclusion in this group, Reagan was not associated with the United States Navy, apart from his term as Commander-in-Chief, although one of his key initiatives in office was the 600-ship Navy program.\nShip's seal.\nThe \"Ronald Reagan\"'s seal was designed entirely by her plankowner crew with historical assistance from staff members at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. The seal's red border is similar to the distinctive red rim on the White House china designed for the Reagans during their White House years. Four gold stars represent Reagan as 40th US President and his four pillars of freedom: individual liberty, economic opportunity, global democracy, and national pride. \"Peace through Strength\" was a recurring theme of Reagan's life in public service. The aircraft carrier is positioned on the West Coast, representing Reagan's two terms as governor of California and the ship's Pacific Fleet homeport. The three aircraft's patriotic contrails symbolize the three major military operations during Reagan's presidency: Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada/1983), Operation El Dorado Canyon (Libya/1986), and Operation Praying Mantis (Iran/1988). The view of the globe signifies Reagan's vision of global democracy, and the center is the United States, representing the country's national pride. Red, white, and blue dominate the seal, reflecting the American flag.\nService history.\nOn 8 May 2004, following a five-month post-shakedown availability, \"Ronald Reagan\" received her second flight deck certification covering all flight operations, including aircraft launch and recovery, safety, crash and salvage, fuel certifications, and training. \"Ronald Reagan\" then transited from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, through the Strait of Magellan to her new homeport, Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, with Captain James A. Symonds in command.\nCarrier Air Wing Eleven, normally assigned to , embarked 25% of its total strength for the transit. The squadrons making the transit were VFA-14 and VFA-41 flying the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, VAW-117 flying the E-2C Hawkeye 2000, HS-6 flying the SH-60F Seahawk, and VRC-30 flying the C-2A Greyhound. The ship visited Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 5 June 2004. During the first evening after arrival, the ship's namesake, former President Reagan, died. A ceremony in his honor was held onboard later that evening, after the US national anthem was publicly played. Upon leaving Rio, \"Ronald Reagan\" transited the Strait of Magellan on 20\u201321 June and subsequently visited Valpara\u00edso, Chile, and Callao, Peru, before arriving in San Diego on 23 July 2004. From 1 October 2004, \"Ronald Reagan\" was assigned to Carrier Strike Group Fifteen.\nDuring an anti-submarine warfare exercise in 2005, HSwMS \"Gotland\", on loan from the Swedish Navy, managed to score multiple simulated attacks on \"Ronald Reagan\" while undetected, showcasing that the submarine was in a position to sink the carrier. This prompted the U.S. Navy to extend their lease of the submarine following the exercise, for further study.\n2006 maiden deployment.\n\"Ronald Reagan\", with Terry B. Kraft in command, departed San Diego on 4 January 2006 on her maiden deployment conducting naval operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf. On 28 January 2006, an F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter attempting landing aboard \"Ronald Reagan\" crashed into the ship's flight deck while the ship was about southeast of Brisbane, Queensland. The aircraft struck the ramp, missed the third cable, and skidded overboard. The pilot ejected safely, but the aircraft was lost. While in Brisbane, the carrier's main condensers became clogged with of jellyfish, causing problems in the main machinery rooms and hindering cooling of the main reactors. The ship entered the Persian Gulf on 22 February 2006, and returned from deployment on 6 July 2006.\n2007 surge deployment.\n\"Ronald Reagan\" and her Carrier Strike Group (CSG) departed North Island, Coronado in San\u00a0Diego on 27 January 2007 on an unscheduled surge deployment to the Western Pacific, in place of the forward deployed carrier while she underwent maintenance in Japan. On 20 April 2007, \"Ronald\u00a0Reagan\" and her CSG returned to Coronado. The \"surge deployment\" was part of the Navy's Fleet Response Plan, which provides the US with the ability to respond to any global commitment with flexible and sustainable forces and the ability to rapidly respond to a range of situations on short notice.\nIn January 2007, \"Ronald Reagan\" earned the 2006 Commander, Naval Air Forces Pacific Carrier Battle Efficiency \"E\" award for the West Coast, the first Battle\u00a0\"E\" ever for the carrier.\n\"Ronald Reagan\" returned to Naval Air Station North Island on 20 April 2007, following a three-month deployment in support of operations in the Western Pacific.\nOn 15 December 2007, the carrier answered a distress call from a cruise ship off the coast of Baja California. An SH-60 helicopter airlifted an Illinois teenager whose appendix had ruptured while on a Mexican cruise to \"Ronald Reagan\", where the ship's surgeon performed an emergency appendectomy.\n2008 deployment.\n\"Ronald Reagan\", with CVW-14 embarked, departed San Diego on 19 May 2008, for a scheduled 7th Fleet and 5th Fleet deployment.\nThe \"Ronald Reagan\" CSG performed humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in the Philippines on 24 June 2008 after that country was devastated by Typhoon Fengshen, that killed hundreds from the central island regions and the main island of Luzon. The typhoon also capsized the passenger ferry MV \"Princess of the Stars\". Working in support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, \"Ronald Reagan\" and her escorts of CSG 7 focused their efforts on the island of Panay in the Central Visayas. For eight days, SH-60 Seahawk helicopters and C-2A Greyhound aircraft of the \"Ronald Reagan\" CSG helped deliver more than of rice, fresh water, and other supplies to areas of Panay, which were not reachable by truck due to flooded roads. The mission in Panay earned the entire strike group the Navy's Humanitarian Service Medal.\nThe CSG arrived in the U.S. Fifth Fleet area on 28 August 2008, where she launched more than 1,150\u00a0sorties into Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). \"Ronald Reagan\" returned to San Diego on 25 November 2008.\nOn 25 September 2008, \"Ronald Reagan\", while underway in the Gulf of Oman, played host to the rock band Creed. Over 1500 members of the ship's crew crowded the flight deck to watch the band perform.\n\"Ronald Reagan\" received word in February 2009 that the ship had won her second Battle Efficiency Award.\n2009 deployment.\nOn 28 May 2009, \"Ronald Reagan\" deployed with Carrier Air Wing 14 to the 7th and 5th Fleet Areas of Responsibility. \"Ronald Reagan\" relieved the CSG and launched her first sorties in support of OEF on 6 July. \"Ronald Reagan\" returned to homeport on 21 October after a five-month deployment.\n2010.\nIn early 2010, \"Ronald Reagan\" was awarded the 2009 Chief of Naval Operations Afloat Safety \"S\" Award, and the 2009 Pacific Fleet Battle \"E\" for combat efficiency. The Battle\u00a0\"E\" award was \"Ronald Reagan\"'s second consecutive and third Battle E in four years.\nOn 19 May 2010, Norfolk Naval Shipyard completed the six-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) maintenance cycle on \"Ronald Reagan\". This PIA project was under budget, and marked both Norfolk Naval Shipyard's largest off-site availability, as well as the largest public-sector work package ever performed on an aircraft carrier berthed at Naval Air Station North Island, Coronado, California. During the maintenance period, \"Ronald Reagan\" received technological upgrades for her next deployment and subsequent operations. Refurbishments included high-tech combat systems and firefighting equipment, improved ship's laundry services and living spaces. This PIA maintenance project was an example of the 'One Shipyard' concept wherein the US Navy mobilizes its work force across its various shipyards to better meet fleet readiness requirements and to stabilize a vital workforce base for the US defense industry. While Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) was the project lead, significant work was done by its partners: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &amp; Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS), Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SRMC), and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB). During peak manning, about 1,400 worked the project on a daily basis. This included rough 625 NNSY personnel, 165 PSNS employees, and 600 from SWRMC/NGSB.\nOn 18 May 2010, \"Ronald Reagan\" departed Naval Air Station North Island for sea trials. This was the final phase of the PIA, and was conducted to assess the carrier's material readiness to return to the operational fleet. \"Ronald Reagan\" pulled into Naval Air Station North Island on 19 May 2010 after completing her two-day sea trial, marking the official end to the ship's six-month PIA maintenance period.\nOn 2 June 2010, \"Ronald Reagan\", with Carrier Air Wing Fourteen (CVW-14) embarked, departed Naval Air Station North Island to conduct flight deck certifications. Embarked squadrons included: Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron 4 (HS-4), Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323 (VMFA-323), Strike Fighter Squadron 154 (VFA-154), Strike Fighter Squadron 147 (VFA-147), Strike Fighter Squadron 146 (VFA-146), Airborne Early Warning Squadron 113 (VAW-113) and Fleet Logistics Squadron 30 (VRC-30). The certification included a full evaluation of the arresting gear, steam catapults, and flight-deck personnel. \"Ronald Reagan\"'s air department was assessed on the ability to maintain a fully operational flight deck and respond to simulated mishaps.\nDuring the summer of 2010, \"Ronald Reagan\" participated in Exercise RIMPAC, departed from Naval Air Station North Island, California, for a Board of Inspection and Survey assessment on 25 August 2010, and departed her homeport to conduct routine operations off the coast of southern California in preparation for her 2011 Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment. In November 2010, the ship provided emergency supplies and assistance to passengers stranded in the Pacific Ocean aboard the cruise ship , which had lost power due to an engine fire.\n2011 deployment.\nThe ship departed for an Asian deployment on 2 February 2011. On 11 March 2011, \"Ronald Reagan\" was in the Korean peninsula region for a long-planned exercise off Korea, but was redirected towards Japan to provide support after the massive 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. The ship, stationed off Sendai, served as a refueling station for Japanese coast guard and military helicopters on relief missions in the area. US Navy helicopters also flew relief missions from the carrier. On 13 March 2011, the ship measured 0.6 millirem/hr direct gamma shine from clouds 130 miles (\u2248210\u00a0km) from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Members of the crew later blamed their cancers on the event. On 14 March 2011, the ship was forced to relocate to avoid a radioactive plume from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents which had contaminated 17\u00a0crew members of three helicopter crews. On 23 March, \"Ronald Reagan\"'s crew performed radiation decontamination by scrubbing down any surface that could have been contaminated, including the island superstructure and flight deck, to remove any potential radiation hazards. On 4 April 2011, Japan's minister of defense, Toshimi Kitazawa, accompanied by US ambassador to Japan John Roos, visited the ship to thank the crew for their assistance as part of Operation Tomodachi. Said Kitazawa, \"I have never been more encouraged by and proud of the fact that the United States is our ally.\" The ship returned to San Diego on 8 September 2011. In January 2011, the Navy announced that the aircraft carrier would be transferred to the Puget Sound Naval Ship Yard in Bremerton, Washington, for scheduled repair and maintenance beginning January 2012.\n2012 and 2013.\nOn 10 January 2012, \"Ronald Reagan\"'s official homeport was changed to Bremerton, Washington for a little over a year until returning to her homeport of San Diego on 21 March 2013. For the sailors being relocated, the Navy transported many privately owned vehicles on the deck of the ship as a cost-saving measure.\n2014.\nOn 14 January 2014, the Navy announced that \"Ronald Reagan\" would replace her sister ship as the Seventh Fleet forward deployed carrier at Yokosuka, Japan in 2015. Also in 2014, a USS Ronald Reagan commemorative challenge coin was created which is a symbolic 76 cents (CVN-76). The back has CPO 365 (Chief Petty Officer), a symbolic 50 stars wraps around the inside of the coin, and the text: \"If you want it, you gotta earn it\" is along the bottom of the coin. Centered is a US Navy rank which is half shiny silver and half shiny gold, along with the US Navy anchor logo.\n2015 homeport change and patrol.\nIn 2015 \"Ronald Reagan\" replaced \"George Washington\" as the US Navy's only forward deployed aircraft carrier. In August, after a short patrol in the Pacific, \"George Washington\" docked in Naval Base San Diego alongside \"Ronald Reagan\". A hull swap occurred over ten days, in which the crews assigned to each carrier switched ships. This was done to minimize the number of sailors who would need to move between San Diego to Japan due to the change in homeports of the two carriers. \"Ronald Reagan\" effectively took her new place as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 5 and Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5). On 1 October 2015, she arrived in her newest homeport, Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture. CVW-5 was based at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, which is also located in Kanagawa Prefecture. The ship was open for the public to tour on 12 October.\n\"Ronald Reagan\" departed for her annual patrol of the Western Pacific on 15 October. On 29 October two Russian Tupolev Tu-142 bombers flew within one mile of the ship at low altitude. Four F/A-18 Super Hornets were scrambled in response. The ship conducted fleet exercises with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and Republic of Korea Navy. During a fleet review with the JMSDF, the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe visited the ship. The ship returned to Yokosuka on 3 December.\n2016 patrol.\nOn 4 June 2016, \"Ronald Reagan\" departed Yokosuka and was deployed with CSG 5 to the South China Sea before an international tribunal released its decision regarding a China and Philippines conflict. The ship returned after a 53-day cruise for a mid-cruise break and conducted Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) inspections designed to ensure the ship would last her full 50-year lifespan. She temporarily left port due to Typhoon Lionrock. After completing INSURV, she returned to sea on 3 September. The ship then participated in Exercise Valiant Shield 2016 before making a port call at Guam and participating in Invincible Spirit, a joint exercise with South Korean forces in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. \"Ronald Reagan\" returned to Yokosuka on 21 November.\n2017.\nFrom 10 January, the ship began a period of Selected Restricted Availability with a focus on upgrading parts of the ship including the flight deck, hangar bays, and general living spaces. On 19 April the ship was visited by Vice President Mike Pence. On 7 May, the ship put to sea for sea trials before her annual patrol. After the short sea trials, \"Ronald Reagan\" returned to port, then left again on her annual cruise on 16 May to relieve her sister ship , which had been deployed near North Korea in light of political tensions.\nShe visited Singapore in June and then sailed to Australia where she participated in Exercise Talisman Saber with Australian and other forces in July. She then made a port visit to Brisbane before returning to Japan on 9 August. On 8 September she departed Yokosuka again to conduct patrols off Korea after the North Korean missile launch over Japan and nuclear test. On 2 October the ship visited Hong Kong. She then participated in drills with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force off Okinawa. After that, \"Ronald Reagan\" participated in drills off the Korean peninsula with the South Korean Navy. After the drills, she made a port visit at Busan in South Korea.\nOn 29 October, \"Ronald Reagan\" scrambled an undisclosed number of Super Hornets to intercept two Russian Tu-95MS bombers that were heading towards the carrier on a Tokyo Express flight near Japan. The Russian bombers were accompanied by their own Su-35S escort fighters. During their flights the bombers were also intercepted by F-2, F-4 and F-15 fighters of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. In November destroyers assigned to \"Ronald Reagan\" conducted exercises with the Indian Navy after which the Indian Navy ships joined by a Japan Self-Defense Forces destroyer conducted more exercises with \"Ronald Reagan\".\nLater in November the vessel conducted drills with two other US aircraft carriers, and . It was the first time in a decade that three US carrier strike groups had operated together in Asia. They were also joined by the Japanese helicopter destroyer \"Ise\" and the guided missile destroyers \"Inazuma\" and \"Makinami\". After working with the Japanese warships the carrier groups conducted drills with seven South Korean vessels, including two Aegis-equipped destroyers. The drills were timed to coincide with the Asian tour of US President Donald Trump amid tensions with North Korea.\nOn 22 November, a C-2A Greyhound cargo plane of VRC-30 with 11 crew and passengers aboard crashed into the Philippine Sea 145\u00a0km northwest of Okinotorishima while flying from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni to the carrier. It was the first C-2 loss since 2005, and the first fatal crash since 1973. Eight of the 11 were rescued. \"Ronald Reagan\" returned to Yokosuka on 4 December.\n2018.\nIn 17 May \"Ronald Reagan\" conducted sea trials and on 28 May 2018 she departed on her regular patrol of the Pacific. Her departure was several weeks late. The delay was caused by a \"material issue\" that required repairs to issues found during the sea trials. Field Carrier Landing Practice for aircrew on Iwo Jima were also delayed. After patrolling through the disputed South China Sea, the ship visited the Philippines for the first time, and stayed for four days.\nFrom 7 to 16 June the carrier participated in the Malabar 2018 exercise with Japan and India near Guam. \"Ronald Reagan\" returned to Yokosuka on 24 July. On 27 July along with other vessels she left port again to avoid Typhoon Jongdari, returning on 30 July. She left port again ahead of a typhoon on 7 August. On 31 August 2018, the carrier conducted training with the , of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.\nOn 21 November 2018, the ship visited Hong Kong. The ship backfitted the existing AN/SPS-48E three-dimensional (3D), air search radar with the AN/SPS-48G.\n2019.\nOn 24 August 2019, \"Ronald Reagan\" returned to Yokosuka Naval Base, after a very short patrol of the western Pacific. The vessel made two stops over the deployment. First at Brisbane to join the 2019 Exercise Talisman Saber off Australia's east coast, then at Manila for a brief port visit on the week of 11 August; between those two points the ship had transited the South China Sea in order to send a message to Beijing that the seas must be free and open. Admiral Karl O. Thomas used \"Freedom of Navigation Operations\" to stress that point when his weaker allies could not. The ship also participated in several exercises at sea with partner nations, most recently with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.\n2020.\nThe coronavirus pandemic was reported to have spread to \"Ronald Reagan\" when the first two cases were reported on 27 March 2020. The positive cases forced the closure of the naval base outside Tokyo where the carrier is based, with all personnel on base told to stay indoors for 48 hours.\nOn 5 July 2020, the \"Ronald Reagan\" Carrier Strike Group was deployed to the South China Sea along with .\n2021.\nOn 26 June 2021, \"Ronald Reagan\" was deployed to the Middle East to help with the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.\n2022.\nIn late May 2022, \"Ronald Reagan\" was relieved by at Sasebo, Japan. \"Ronald Reagan\" led Carrier Strike Group 5 into the Philippine Sea.\n\"Ronald Reagan\" departed Singapore's Changi Naval Base on 23 July to transit the South China Sea. President Joe Biden exchanged words with Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping over Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, which was only a possibility at that point. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian that his bosses were getting \"seriously prepared\".\nOn 4 August 2022, United States National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced that \"Ronald Reagan\" had been ordered to remain in the vicinity of Taiwan in response to missile launches conducted by China, which in turn were a response to Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. On 19 August 2022, \"Ronald Reagan\" returned to her home port of Yokosuka, Japan.\nOn 12 September 2022, \"Ronald Reagan\" departed Yokosuka for the second leg of her regional patrol. \"Ronald Reagan\" arrived at Busan, South Korea for a scheduled port visit on 23 September 2022. This was the first time in four years that a US Navy aircraft carrier had visited South Korea.\n2023.\nIn April 2023 the Commander, Naval Air Forces announced that would again be homeported at Fleet Activities Yokosuka in Japan and would relieve \"Ronald Reagan\" beginning in 2024. \"Ronald Reagan\" will depart Yokosuka and relocate to Bremerton, Washington, to conduct a scheduled Drydocking at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. On 25 June 2023, \"Ronald Reagan\" and two escort cruisers, and , made a port call in Tien Sa port in Da Nang, Vietnam and remained until 30 June. This is the third visit a US carrier has made to Vietnam since 2018, with another visit occurring in 2020.\n2024.\nIn May 2024, the ship left Yokosuka for her final patrol as the US Navy's only forward deployed carrier in advance of her homeport change to Naval Base Kitsap. This is concurrent with USS \"George Washington\"'s homeport shift to Yokosuka.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In their modern form, the cherries are first preserved in a brine solution usually containing sulfur dioxide and calcium chloride to bleach the fruit, then soaked in a suspension of food coloring (common red food dye is Allura Red AC), sugar syrup, and other components.\nUses.\nMaraschino cherries are used in many alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails, including the Old Fashioned, tequila sunrise, the Queen Mary and the Shirley Temple, giving them the nickname cocktail cherries. (This term is also used to refer to other varieties, including Amarena, Balaton, and Bing, when used for the same purpose, typically soaked in alcohol or sugar.) Sometimes the cherries, along with some of the maraschino syrup, are put into a glass of cola to make an old-fashioned or homemade cherry cola.\nAs a garnish, they can be used to decorate frozen yogurt, baked ham, cakes, pastry, parfaits, milkshakes and ice cream sodas. They are an integral part of an American ice cream sundae, giving rise to the term \"cherry on top\" in more general usage. They are frequently included in canned fruit cocktail.\nEurope.\nThe name \"maraschino\" originates from the marasca cherry of Dalmatian origin and the maraschino liqueur made from it, in which marasca cherries were crushed and preserved after being pickled. Whole cherries preserved in this liqueur were known as \"maraschino cherries\". This had been a local means of preserving the fruit in Dalmatia.\nIn the 19th century, these became popular in the rest of Europe, but the supply in Dalmatia was quite limited, so they became known as a delicacy for royalty and the wealthy. Because of the relative scarcity of the marasca, other cherries came to be preserved in various ways and sold as \"maraschino\".\nUnited States.\nThe cherries were first introduced in the United States in the late 19th century, where they were served in fine bars and restaurants. Because they were scarce and expensive, by the turn of the century American producers were experimenting with other processes for preserving cherries, with flavors such as almond extract and substitute fruit like Queen Anne cherries. Among these, alcohol was already becoming less common.\nIn response, the USDA in 1912 defined \"maraschino cherries\" as \"marasca cherries preserved in maraschino\" under the authority of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. The artificially colored and artificially sweetened Royal Anne variety were required to be called \"Imitation Maraschino Cherries\" instead. Food Inspection Decision 141 defined marasca cherries and maraschino themselves. It was signed on 17 Feb. 1912.\nDuring Prohibition in the United States as of 1920, the decreasingly popular alcoholic variety was illegal as well. Ernest H. Wiegand, a professor of horticulture at Oregon State University (OSU), developed the modern method of manufacturing maraschino cherries using a brine solution rather than alcohol. Accordingly, most modern maraschino cherries have only a historical connection with maraschino liqueur.\nAccording to Bob Cain, Cliff Samuels, and Hoya Yang, who worked with Wiegand at OSU, Prohibition had nothing to do with Wiegand's research: his intention was to develop a better brining process for cherries that would not soften them. When Wiegand began his research, there were several ways to preserve maraschino cherries without alcohol, long before Prohibition went into effect. Wiegand took a process that people had their own recipes for\u2014\"and who knows what they were putting in there\" (frequently not alcohol)\u2014and turned it into a science, something replicable.\nWhen Wiegand began his research, sodium metabisulfite was being used to preserve maraschino cherries. Some accounts indicate that this preservation method was being used long before Prohibition. Some manufacturers used maraschino or imitation liqueurs to flavor the cherries, but newspaper stories from the early part of the century suggest that many manufacturers stopped using alcohol and artificial dyes before Prohibition.\nAfter Prohibition was repealed, lobbying by the non-alcoholic preserved cherry industry encouraged the Food and Drug Administration to revise federal policy toward canned cherries. It held a hearing in April 1939 to establish a new standard of identity. Since 1940, \"maraschino cherries\" have been defined as \"cherries which have been dyed red, infused with sugar, and packed in a sugar syrup flavored with oil of bitter almonds or a similar flavor.\"\nFD&amp;C Red Number 1 and 4, and FD&amp;C Yellow Number 1 through 4 were removed from the approved list in 1960. The ban on Red Number 4 was lifted in 1965 to allow the coloring of maraschino cherries, which by then were considered mainly decorative and not a foodstuff. In 1975, William F. Randolph of the FDA ruled that if an \"artificial bitter almond flavor or any synthetic flavor is used, the product must be labeled artificial or artificially flavored.\" The following year, the ban on Red No. 4 was reinstated.\nAs of 2010[ [update]], modern American maraschino cherries typically use FD&amp;C Red 40 as a colorant.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She served as president of The Thalians, an organization dedicated to mental health causes. After receiving the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2015 and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2016, she made her final film performance in the biographical retrospective \"\". Reynolds died following a hemorrhagic stroke on December 28, 2016, one day after the death of her daughter, actress Carrie Fisher.\nEarly life.\nMary Frances Reynolds was born on April 1, 1932, in El Paso, Texas, to Maxene N. \"Minnie\" Harman and Raymond Francis \"Ray\" Reynolds, a carpenter who worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad. She was of Scottish-Irish and English ancestry and was raised in a strict Nazarene church of her domineering mother. She had an older brother, William, who was two years her senior. Reynolds was a Girl Scout, once saying that she wanted to die as the world's oldest living Girl Scout. Reynolds was also a member of The International Order of Job's Daughters.\nHer mother took in laundry for income, while they lived in a shack on Magnolia Street in El Paso. \"We may have been poor,\" she said in a 1963 interview, \"but we always had something to eat, even if Dad had to go out in the desert and shoot jackrabbits.\"{\nHer family moved to Burbank, California, in 1939. When Reynolds was a 16-year-old student at Burbank High School in 1948, she won the Miss Burbank beauty contest. Soon after, she was offered a contract with Warner Brothers and was given the stage name \"Debbie\" by studio head Jack L. Warner.\nOne of her closest high school friends said that she rarely dated during her teenaged years in Burbank. {\nReynolds agreed, saying, \"when I started, I didn't even know how to dress. I wore dungarees and a shirt. I had no money, no taste, and no training.\" Her friend adds:{\nCareer.\nFilm and television.\nReynolds was discovered by talent scouts from Warner Bros. and MGM, who were at the 1948 Miss Burbank contest. Both companies wanted her to sign up with their studio, and had to flip a coin to see which one got her. Warner Bros. won the coin toss, and she was with the studio for two years. When Warner Bros. stopped producing musicals, she moved to MGM.\nWith MGM, Reynolds regularly appeared in movie musicals during the 1950s, and had several hit records during the period. Her song \"Aba Daba Honeymoon\" (featured in the film \"Two Weeks with Love\" (1950) and sung as a duet with co-star Carleton Carpenter) was the first soundtrack recording to become a top-of-the-chart gold record, reaching number three on the \"Billboard\" charts.\nHer performance in the film greatly impressed the studio, which then gave her a co-starring role in what became her highest-profile film, \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952), a satire on movie-making in Hollywood during the transition from silent to sound pictures. It co-starred Gene Kelly, whom she called a \"great dancer and cinematic genius,\" adding, \"He made me a star. I was 18 and he taught me how to dance and how to work hard and be dedicated.\" In 1956, she appeared in the musical \"Bundle of Joy\" with her then-husband, Eddie Fisher.\nReynolds was one of 14 top-billed names in \"How the West Was Won\" (1962) but she was the only one who appeared throughout, the story largely following the life and times of her character Lilith Prescott. In the film, she sang three songs: \"What Was Your Name in the States?\", as her pioneering family begin their westward journey; \"Raise a Ruckus Tonight\", starting a party around a wagon train camp fire; and, three times, \"Home in the Meadow\" \u2013 to the tune of \"Greensleeves\" with lyrics by Sammy Cahn.\nHer starring role in \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" (1964) led to a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Reynolds noted that she initially had issues with its director, Charles Walters. \"He didn't want me,\" she said. \"He wanted Shirley MacLaine,\" who at the time was unable to take the role. \"He said, 'You are totally wrong for the part.'\" But six weeks into production, he reversed his opinion. \"He came to me and said, 'I have to admit that I was wrong. You are playing the role really well. I'm pleased.'\" Reynolds also played in \"Goodbye Charlie\", a 1964 comedy film about a callous womanizer who gets his just reward. It was adapted from George Axelrod's play \"Goodbye, Charlie\" and also starred Tony Curtis and Pat Boone.\nShe next portrayed Jeanine Deckers in \"The Singing Nun\" (1966). In what Reynolds once called the \"stupidest mistake of my entire career,\" she made headlines in 1970 after instigating a fight with the NBC television network over cigarette advertising on her weekly television show. Although she was television's highest-paid female performer at the time, she quit the show for breaking its contract:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was shocked to discover that the initial commercial aired during the premiere of my new series was devoted to a nationally advertised brand of cigarette (Pall Mall). I fully outlined my personal feelings concerning cigarette advertising\u00a0... that I will not be a party to such commercials, which I consider directly opposed to health and well-being.\nWhen NBC explained to Reynolds that banning cigarette commercials from her show would be impossible, she kept her resolve. The show drew mixed reviews, but according to NBC, it captured about 42% of the nation's viewing audience. She said later she was especially concerned about the commercials because of the number of children watching the show. She did quit doing the show after about a year, which she said had cost her about $2 million of lost income: \"Maybe I was a fool to quit the show, but at least I was an honest fool. I'm not a phony or pretender. With me, it wasn't a question of money, but integrity. I'm the one who has to live with myself.\" The dispute would have been rendered moot and in Reynolds' favor anyway had she not resigned; by 1971, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act (which had been passed into law before she left the show) would ban all radio and television advertising for tobacco products.\nReynolds voiced Charlotte in the Hanna-Barbera animated musical \"Charlotte's Web\" (1973), where she originated the song \"Mother Earth and Father Time.\" Reynolds continued to make other appearances in film and television. She played Helen Chappel Hackett's mother, Deedee Chappel, on the \"Wings\" episode \"If It's Not One Thing, It's Your Mother,\" which first aired November 22, 1994.\nFrom 1999 to 2006, she played Grace Adler's theatrical mother, Bobbi Adler, on the NBC sitcom \"Will &amp; Grace\", which earned Reynolds her only Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2000. She played a recurring role in the Disney Channel Original Movie \"Halloweentown\" film series as Aggie Cromwell. Reynolds made a guest appearance as a presenter at the 69th Academy Awards in 1997.\nIn 2000, Reynolds took up a recurring voice role on the children's television program \"Rugrats,\" playing the grandmother of two of the characters. In 2001, she co-starred with Elizabeth Taylor, Shirley MacLaine, and Joan Collins in the comedy \"These Old Broads,\" a television movie written for her by her daughter, Carrie Fisher. She had a cameo role as herself in the 2004 film \"Connie and Carla.\" In 2013, she appeared in \"Behind the Candelabra,\" as the mother of Liberace.\nReynolds appears with her daughter in \",\" a 2016 documentary about the very close relationship between the two. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The television premiere was January 7, 2017, on HBO. According to \"USA Today\", the film is \"an intimate portrait of Hollywood royalty ... [it] loosely chronicles their lives through interviews, photos, footage, and vintage home movies... It culminates in a moving scene, just as Reynolds is preparing to receive the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, which Fisher presented to her mom.\"\nMusic career and cabaret.\nHer recording of the song \"Tammy\" (1957; from \"Tammy and the Bachelor\") earned her a gold record. It was a number one single on the \"Billboard\" pop charts in 1957. In the movie (the first of the \"Tammy\" film series), she co-starred with Leslie Nielsen.\nReynolds also scored two other top-25 \"Billboard\" hits with \"A Very Special Love\" (number 20 in January 1958) and \"Am I That Easy to Forget\" (number 25 in March 1960)\u2014a pop-music version of a country-music hit made famous by Carl Belew (in 1959), Skeeter Davis (in 1960), and several years later by singer Engelbert Humperdinck.\nShe released \"The Best of Debbie Reynolds\" album in 1991.\nFor 10 years, she headlined for about three months a year in Las Vegas's Riviera Hotel. She enjoyed live shows, though that type of performing \"was extremely strenuous,\" she said in 1966:\nWith a performing schedule of two shows a night, seven nights a week, it's probably the toughest kind of show business, but in my opinion, the most rewarding. I like the feeling of being able to change stage bits and business when I want. You can't do that in motion pictures or TV.\nAs part of her nightclub act, Reynolds was noted for doing impressions of celebrities such as Eva and Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mae West, Barbra Streisand, Phyllis Diller, and Bette Davis. Her impersonation of Davis was inspired following their co-starring roles in the 1956 film, \"The Catered Affair\". Reynolds had started doing stage impersonations as a teenager; her impersonation of Betty Hutton was performed as a singing number during the Miss Burbank contest in 1948.\nHer 1992 holiday collaboration with Donald O'Connor, \"Christmas with Donald and Debbie\", arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo, would be her final album release.\nReynolds was also a French horn player. Gene Kelly, reflecting on Reynolds's sudden fame, recalled, \"There were times when Debbie was more interested in playing the French horn somewhere in the San Fernando Valley or attending a Girl Scout meeting...She didn't realize she was a movie star all of a sudden.\"\nStage work.\nWith limited film and television opportunities coming her way, Reynolds accepted an opportunity to make her Broadway debut. She starred in the 1973 revival of \"Irene\", a musical first produced 60 years before. When asked why she waited so long to appear in a Broadway play, she explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Primarily because I had two children growing up, I could make movies and recordings and plays in nearby Las Vegas and handle a television series without being away from them. Now, they are well on the way to being adults. Also, there was the matter of being offered a show that I felt might be right for me\u00a0... I felt that \"Irene\" was it and now was the time.\nReynolds and her daughter Carrie both made their Broadway debuts in the play. Per reports, the production broke records for the highest weekly gross of any musical. For that production, she received a Tony nomination. Reynolds also starred in the Broadway revue \"Debbie\" in 1976. She toured with Harve Presnell in \"Annie Get Your Gun\", then wrapped up the Broadway run of \"Woman of the Year\" in 1983, while Fisher was appearing in \"Agnes of God\". In the late 1980s, Reynolds repeated her role as Molly Brown in the stage version of \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\", first opposite Presnell (repeating his original Broadway and movie role) and later with Ron Raines.\nIn 2010, she appeared in her own West End show \"Debbie Reynolds: Alive and Fabulous\".\nFilm history preservation.\nReynolds amassed a large collection of movie memorabilia, beginning with items from the landmark 1970 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer auction, and she displayed them, first in a museum at her Las Vegas hotel and casino during the 1990s and later in a museum close to the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles.\nThe museum was to relocate to be the centerpiece of the Belle Island Village tourist attraction in the resort city of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, but the developer went bankrupt. The museum filed for Chapter\u00a011 bankruptcy in June 2009. The most valuable asset of the museum was Reynolds' collection. Todd Fisher, Reynolds' son, announced that his mother was \"heartbroken\" to have to auction off the collection. It was valued at $10.79\u00a0million in the bankruptcy filing. Los Angeles auction firm Profiles in History was given the responsibility of conducting a series of auctions. Among the \"more than 3500 costumes, 20,000 photographs, and thousands of movie posters, costume sketches, and props\" included in the sales were Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat and Marilyn Monroe's white \"subway dress,\" whose skirt is lifted up by the breeze from a passing subway train in the film \"The Seven Year Itch\" (1955). The dress sold for $4.6\u00a0million in 2011; the final auction was held in May 2014.\nBusiness ventures.\nIn 1979, Reynolds opened her own dance studio in North Hollywood. In 1983, she released an exercise video, \"Do It Debbie's Way!\" She purchased the Clarion Hotel and Casino, a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, in 1992. She renamed it the Debbie Reynolds Hollywood Hotel but it was not a success and Reynolds was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1997. In June 2010, she replaced Ivana Trump on the \"Globe\" weekly's advice column but many of the published letters were plagiarized from \"Slate\"'s \"Dear Prudence\" and possibly others.\nAdvocacy.\nReynolds was a longtime ally of the LGBT community and an early advocate for people with AIDS. In 1983, Reynolds performed at an AIDS fundraiser with her friend Shirley MacLaine. In a 2014 interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\", Reynolds revealed that she had helped several closeted actors conceal their homosexuality by dating them. When asked when she realized she was a gay icon, Reynolds replied, \"Over the years many of the boys that have worked for me as dancers have been gay. The creative people were all gay people, from producers to writers. To me, they were just family.\"\nMarriages and later life.\nReynolds was married three times. Her first marriage was to singer and actor Eddie Fisher in 1955. They became the parents of Carrie Fisher and Todd Fisher. The couple divorced in 1959 when it was revealed shortly after the death of Elizabeth Taylor's husband Mike Todd that Fisher had been having an affair with her; Taylor and Reynolds were good friends at the time. The Eddie Fisher\u00a0\u2013 Elizabeth Taylor affair was a great public scandal, which led to the cancellation of Eddie Fisher's television show.\nIn 2011, Reynolds was on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" just weeks before Elizabeth Taylor's death. She explained that Taylor and she happened to be traveling at the same time on the ocean liner (\"RMS Queen Elizabeth\") some time in the 1960s when they reconciled. Reynolds sent a note to Taylor's room, and Taylor sent a note in reply asking to have dinner with Reynolds and end their feud. As Reynolds described it, \"we had a wonderful evening with a lot of laughs.\" In 1972, she noted the bright side of the divorce and her remarriage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife is both faith and love. Without faith, love is only one dimensional and incomplete. Faith helps you to overlook other people's shortcomings, and love them as they are. If you ask too much of any relationship, you can't help but be disappointed. But if you ask nothing, you can't be hurt or disappointed.\nDebbie Reynolds (1964)\nReynolds' second marriage, to millionaire businessman Harry Karl, lasted from 1960 to 1973. For a period during the 1960s, she stopped working at the studio on Friday afternoons to attend Girl Scout meetings, since she was the leader of the Girl Scout Troop of which her 13-year-old daughter Carrie and her stepdaughter Tina Karl, also 13, were members. Reynolds later found herself in financial difficulty because of Karl's gambling and bad investments.\nReynolds' third marriage was to real estate developer Richard Hamlett from 1984 to 1996.&lt;ref name=\"nypost/third-time\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn 2011, Reynolds stepped down after 56 years of involvement in The Thalians, a charitable organization devoted to children and adults with mental-health issues.\nReynolds was hospitalized in October 2012 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles due to an adverse reaction to medication. She canceled appearances and concert engagements for the next three months.\nShe published the autobiographies \"Debbie: My Life\" in 1988 and \"Unsinkable: A Memoir\" in 2013.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn December 28, 2016, Reynolds was taken by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, after suffering a \"severe stroke,\" according to her son. Later that afternoon, Reynolds was pronounced dead in the hospital; she was 84 years old. On January 9, 2017, her cause of death was determined to be an intracerebral hemorrhage, with hypertension a contributing factor.\nOn December 23, 2016, Reynolds' daughter, actress and writer Carrie Fisher, suffered a medical emergency on a flight from London to Los Angeles, and died one day before her mother, December 27, at the age of 60 at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. \nTodd Fisher later said that Reynolds had been seriously affected by her daughter's death, and that her grief partially contributed to her stroke, noting that his mother had stated, \"I want to be with Carrie,\" shortly before she died. During an interview for the December 30, 2016, airing of the ABC-TV program \"20/20\", Todd Fisher elaborated on this, saying that his mother had joined his sister in death because Reynolds \"didn't want to leave Carrie and did not want her to be alone.\" He added, \"she didn't die of a broken heart\" as some news reports had implied, but rather \"just left to be with Carrie.\"\nReynolds was entombed with a portion of her daughter's ashes at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills during a memorial service held on January 6, while the remainder of Carrie Fisher's ashes are held in a giant, novelty Prozac pill.\nAwards and honors.\nReynolds was the 1955 Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year. Her footprints and handprints are preserved at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California. She also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6654 Hollywood Boulevard, for live performance and a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars dedicated to her. In keeping with the celebrity tradition of the Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival of Winchester, Virginia, Reynolds was honored as the Grand Marshal of the 2011 ABF that took place from April 26 to May 1, 2011.\nOn November 4, 2006, Reynolds received the Lifetime Achievement in the Arts Award from Chapman University (Orange, California). On May 17, 2007, she was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Nevada, Reno, where she had contributed for many years to the film studies program.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The story involves the production of a musical version of William Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" and the conflict on and off-stage between Fred Graham, the show's director, producer, and star, and his leading lady, his ex-wife Lilli Vanessi. A secondary romance concerns Lois Lane, the actress playing Bianca, and her gambler boyfriend, Bill, who runs afoul of some gangsters. The original production starred Alfred Drake, Patricia Morison, Lisa Kirk and Harold Lang.\n\"Kiss Me, Kate\" was Porter's response to Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\" and other integrated musicals; it was the first show he wrote in which the music and lyrics were firmly connected to the script. The musical premiered in 1948 and proved to be Porter's only show to run for more than 1,000 performances on Broadway. In 1949, it won the first Tony Award for Best Musical.\nConception.\nProducer Arnold Saint-Subber conceived the idea for \"Kiss Me, Kate\" after witnessing the on-stage/off-stage battling of husband-and-wife actors Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne during their 1935 production of \"The Taming of the Shrew\". In 1947, he asked the Spewacks (undergoing their own marital woes at the time) to write the script; Bella Spewack in turn enlisted Cole Porter to write the music and lyrics.\nPorter's score drew from musical styles of the Italian Renaissance, Verdi's operas, blues, the Viennese waltz, and, in \"Brush Up Your Shakespeare\", the 1897 hybrid \"Bowery waltz\". In writing the lyrics for \"Kiss Me, Kate\", Porter drew from Shakespearean themes and language, without creating something esoteric, and the song \"Always True to You in My Fashion\" was inspired by the Ernest Dowson poem \"\"Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae\"\u201d, with its refrain \"I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion\".\nProductions.\nOriginal Broadway production.\nAfter a 3\u00bd-week pre-Broadway tryout at the Shubert Theatre in Philadelphia starting December 2, 1948, the original Broadway production opened on December 30, 1948, at the New Century Theatre, where it ran for nineteen months before transferring to the Shubert, for a total run of 1,077 performances. Directed by John C. Wilson with choreography by Hanya Holm, the original cast included Alfred Drake, Patricia Morison, Lisa Kirk, Harold Lang, Charles Wood and Harry Clark. Brooks Atkinson of \"The New York Times\" praised the \"authentic book which is funny without the interpolation of gags. Cole Porter has written his best score in years, together with witty lyrics. Under Hanya Holm's direction, the dancing is joyous. And Lemuel Ayers has provided carnival costumes and some interesting scenery.\" The production won 5 Tony awards including Best Musical. The 1949 original cast recording has been inducted into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry for the album's \"cultural, artistic and/or historical significance to American society and the nation's audio legacy\".\nOriginal London and Australian productions.\nThe original West End production opened on March 8, 1951, at the Coliseum Theatre, and ran for 400 performances. Directed by Sam Spewack with choreography again by Holm, this production starred Patricia Morison, Bill Johnson, Adelaide Hall and Julie Wilson.\nThe original Australian production played from February 1952 at His Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne, before seasons in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide until 1954.

The cast featured Emile Belcourt (Petruchio), Judith Bruce, Eric Shilling, Ann Howard (Kate), Francis Egerton and Robert Lloyd, with direction by Peter Coe and choreography by Sheila O'Neill. Coe did a translation for British audiences, including having \"a tea wagon\", and included \"traditional English music hall jokes\". This revival had a \"brief run\", according to the \"Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre\".\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company staged a production which opened at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, on February 10, 1987, toured the UK from March to May, and then played at London's Old Vic Theatre from May 19, 1987.

Other cast members included Charlie Stemp as Bill / Lucentio, Georgina Onuorah as Lois / Bianca, and Nigel Lindsay and Hammed Animashaun as the gangsters. The production was filmed on stage for a November 17, 2024 release in UK cinemas and internationally.\nPlot.\nAct I\nThe cast of a musical version of William Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is rehearsing for the opening of the show that evening (\"Another Op'nin', Another Show\"). Egotistical Fred Graham is the director and producer and is starring as Petruchio; his movie-star ex-wife, Lilli Vanessi, is playing Katherine. The two seem to be constantly arguing, and Lilli is particularly angry that Fred is pursuing the alluring young actress Lois Lane, who is playing Bianca. After the rehearsal, Lois's boyfriend Bill appears; he is playing Lucentio, but he missed the rehearsal because he was gambling. He tells her that he signed a $10,000 IOU in Fred's name, and Lois reprimands him (\"Why Can't You Behave?\").\nBefore the opening, Fred and Lilli meet backstage, and Lilli shows off her engagement ring from Washington insider General Harrison Howell, reminding Fred that it is the anniversary of their divorce. They recall the operetta in which they met, which included \"Wunderbar\", a Viennese waltz; they end up fondly reminiscing, singing and dancing. Two gangsters show up to collect the $10,000 IOU, and Fred replies that he never signed it; the gangsters obligingly say they will give him time to remember it and will return later. In her dressing room, Lilli receives flowers from Fred, and she declares that she is still \"So In Love\" with him. Fred tries to keep Lilli from reading the card that came with the flowers, which reveals that he really intended them for Lois. However, Lilli takes the card with her onstage, saying she will read it later.\nThe show begins (\"We Open in Venice\"). Baptista, Katherine and Bianca's father, will not allow his younger daughter Bianca to marry until his older daughter Katherine is married. However, she is shrewish and ill-tempered, and no man desires to marry her. Three suitors \u2013 Lucentio, Hortensio, and Gremio \u2013 try to woo Bianca, and she says that she would marry any of them (\"Tom, Dick, or Harry\"). Petruchio, a friend of Lucentio, expresses a desire to marry into wealth (\"I've Come to Wive it Wealthily in Padua\"). The suitors hatch a plan for him to marry Kate, as Baptista is rich. Kate, however, has no intentions of getting married (\"I Hate Men\"); Petruchio attempts to woo her (\"Were Thine That Special Face\"). Offstage, Lilli has an opportunity to read the card. She walks on stage off-cue and begins beating Fred, who, along with the other actors, tries to remain in character as Baptista gives Petruchio permission to marry Kate. Lilli continues to strike Fred, and he ends up spanking her onstage.\nOffstage, Lilli furiously declares she is leaving the show. However, the gangsters reappear, and Fred tells them that if Lilli quits, he'll have to close the show and won't be able to pay them the $10,000; the gangsters force her to stay at gunpoint. Back onstage, Bianca and Lucentio dance while the chorus performs \"We Sing of Love\", covering a scene change. The curtain opens, revealing the exterior of a church; Petruchio and Kate have just been married, and they exit the church; the gangsters, dressed in Shakespearean costume, are onstage to make sure that Lilli stays. Petruchio implores for Kate to kiss him, and she refuses. He lifts her over his shoulder and carries her offstage while she pummels his shoulder with her fists (\"Kiss Me Kate\").\nAct II\nDuring the show's intermission, the cast and crew relax in the alley behind the theater, lamenting that it's \"Too Darn Hot\" to meet their lovers that night. The play continues, as Petruchio tries to \"tame\" Katherine and mourns for his now-lost bachelor life (\"Where Is the Life That Late I Led?\"). Offstage, Lilli's fianc\u00e9 Harrison Howell is looking for her. He runs into Lois, and she recognizes him as a former lover but promises not to tell Lilli. Bill is shocked to overhear this, but Lois tells him that even if she is involved with other men, she is faithful to him in her own way (\"Always True to You in My Fashion\"). Lilli tries to explain to Howell that she is being forced to stay at the theatre by the gangsters, but Howell doesn't believe her and wants to discuss wedding plans. Fred insidiously points out how boring Lilli's life with Howell will be compared with the theatre. Bill sings a love song he has written for Lois (\"Bianca\").\nThe gangsters discover that their boss has been killed, so the IOU is no longer valid. Lilli leaves\u2014without Howell\u2014as Fred unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay (\"So in Love\" (Reprise)). The gangsters get caught on stage and improvise a comedic tribute to Shakespeare in which they explain that knowing Shakespeare is the key to romance (\"Brush Up Your Shakespeare\"). The company prepares for the conclusion of the play, the wedding of Bianca and Lucentio, even though they are now missing one of the main characters. However, just in time for Katherine's final speech, Lilli arrives onstage (\"I Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple\"). Fred and Lilli wordlessly reconcile on stage, and the play ends (\"Kiss Me Kate\" (Finale)) with them, as well as Bill and Lois, kissing passionately.\nSong list.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes\nFilm and television.\nA film version of the same name was released in 1953.

{"id": "70318", "revid": "46866511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70318", "title": "Sound film", "text": "Motion picture with synchronized sound\nA sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, as opposed to a silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures became commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923. Before sound-on-film technology became viable, soundtracks for films were commonly played live with organs or pianos.\nThe primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid-to-late 1920s. At first, the sound films which included synchronized dialogue, known as \"talking pictures\", or \"talkies\", were exclusively shorts. The earliest feature-length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects. The first feature film originally presented as a talkie (although it had only limited sound sequences) was \"The Jazz Singer\", which premiered on October 6, 1927. A major hit, it was made with Vitaphone, which was at the time the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology. Sound-on-film, however, would soon become the standard for talking pictures.\nBy the early 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's position as one of the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of silent cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance (\"benshi\"), talking pictures were slow to take root. Conversely, in India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.\nEarly history.\nThe idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as the concept of cinema itself. On February 27, 1888, a couple of days after photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge gave a lecture not far from the laboratory of Thomas Edison, the two inventors met privately. Muybridge later claimed that on this occasion, six years before the first commercial motion picture exhibition, he proposed a scheme for sound cinema that would combine his image-casting zoopraxiscope with Edison's recorded-sound technology. No agreement was reached, but within a year Edison commissioned the development of the Kinetoscope, essentially a \"peep-show\" system, as a visual complement to his cylinder phonograph. The two devices were brought together as the Kinetophone in 1895, but individual, cabinet viewing of motion pictures was soon to be outmoded by successes in film projection.\nIn 1899, a projected sound-film system known as Cinemacrophonograph or Phonorama, based primarily on the work of Swiss-born inventor Fran\u00e7ois Dussaud, was exhibited in Paris; similar to the Kinetophone, the system required individual use of earphones. An improved cylinder-based system, Phono-Cin\u00e9ma-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, was developed by Cl\u00e9ment-Maurice Gratioulet and Henri Lioret of France, allowing short films of theater, opera, and ballet excerpts to be presented at the Paris Exposition in 1900. These appear to be the first publicly exhibited films with projection of both image and recorded sound. Phonorama and yet another sound-film system\u2014Th\u00e9\u00e2troscope\u2014were also presented at the Exposition.\nThree major problems persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which were difficult to start and maintain in tandem. Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project satisfactorily to fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed directly in front of the cumbersome recording devices (acoustical horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound.\nCinematic innovators attempted to cope with the fundamental synchronization problem in a variety of ways. An increasing number of motion picture systems relied on gramophone records\u2014known as sound-on-disc technology. The records themselves were often referred to as \"Berliner discs\", after one of the primary inventors in the field, German-American Emile Berliner. In 1902, L\u00e9on Gaumont demonstrated his sound-on-disc Chronophone, involving an electrical connection he had recently patented, to the French Photographic Society. Four years later, Gaumont introduced the Elg\u00e9phone, a compressed-air amplification system based on the Auxetophone, developed by British inventors Horace Short and Charles Parsons. Despite high expectations, Gaumont's sound innovations had only limited commercial success. Despite some improvements, they still did not satisfactorily address the three basic issues with sound film and were expensive as well. For some years, American inventor E. E. Norton's Cameraphone was the primary competitor to the Gaumont system (sources differ on whether the Cameraphone was disc- or cylinder-based); it ultimately failed for many of the same reasons that held back the Chronophone.\nIn 1913, Edison introduced a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone. Instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the film projector, allowing\u2014under ideal conditions\u2014for synchronization. However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after little more than a year. By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, \"The Photo-Drama of Creation\", promoting Jehovah's Witnesses' conception of humankind's genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action, synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.\nMeanwhile, innovations continued on another significant front. In 1900, as part of the research he was conducting on the photophone, the German physicist Ernst Ruhmer recorded the fluctuations of the transmitting arc-light as varying shades of light and dark bands onto a continuous roll of photographic film. He then determined that he could reverse the process and reproduce the recorded sound from this photographic strip by shining a bright light through the running filmstrip, with the resulting varying light illuminating a selenium cell. The changes in brightness caused a corresponding change to the selenium's resistance to electrical currents, which was used to modulate the sound produced in a telephone receiver. He called this invention the photographophone, which he summarized as: \"It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical actions, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound.\"\nRuhmer began a correspondence with the French-born, London-based Eugene Lauste, who had worked at Edison's lab between 1886 and 1892. In 1907, Lauste was awarded the first patent for sound-on-film technology, involving the transformation of sound into light waves that are photographically recorded direct onto celluloid. As described by historian Scott Eyman,\nIt was a double system, that is, the sound was on a different piece of film from the picture... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, where it would be photographed on the side of the film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.\nIn 1908, Lauste purchased a photographophone from Ruhmer, with the intention of perfecting the device into a commercial product. Though sound-on-film would eventually become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, which came to an effective dead end. In 1914, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process to an audience of scientists in Berlin. Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918; the patent award was published four years later. Whether sound was captured on cylinder, disc, or film, none of the available technology was adequate for big-league commercial purposes, and for many years the heads of the major Hollywood film studios saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures.\nCrucial innovations.\nA number of technological developments contributed to making sound cinema commercially viable by the late 1920s. Two involved contrasting approaches to synchronized sound reproduction, or playback:\nAdvanced sound-on-film.\nIn 1919, American inventor Lee De Forest was awarded several patents that would lead to the first optical sound-on-film technology with commercial application. In De Forest's system, the sound track was photographically recorded onto the side of the strip of motion picture film to create a composite, or \"married\", print. If proper synchronization of sound and picture was achieved in recording, it could be absolutely counted on in playback. Over the next four years, he improved his system with the help of equipment and patents licensed from another American inventor in the field, Theodore Case.\nAt the University of Illinois, Polish-born research engineer Joseph Tykoci\u0144ski-Tykociner was working independently on a similar process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture to members of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner's system would never be taken advantage of commercially; however, De Forest's soon would.\nOn April 15, 1923, at the New York City's Rivoli Theater, the first commercial screening of motion pictures with sound-on-film took place. This would become the future standard. It consisted of a set of short films varying in length and featuring some of the most popular stars of the 1920s (including Eddie Cantor, Harry Richman, Sophie Tucker, and George Jessel among others) doing stage performances such as vaudevilles, musical acts, and speeches which accompanied the screening of the silent feature film \"Bella Donna\". All of them were presented under the banner of De Forest Phonofilms. The set included the 11-minute short film \"From far Seville\" starring Concha Piquer. In 2010, a copy of the tape was found in the U.S. Library of Congress, where it is currently preserved. Critics attending the event praised the novelty but not the sound quality which received negative reviews in general. That June, De Forest entered into an extended legal battle with an employee, Freeman Harrison Owens, for title to one of the crucial Phonofilm patents. Although De Forest ultimately won the case in the courts, Owens is today recognized as a central innovator in the field. The following year, De Forest's studio released the first commercial dramatic film shot as a talking picture\u2014the two-reeler \"Love's Old Sweet Song\", directed by J. Searle Dawley and featuring Una Merkel. However, phonofilm's stock in trade was not original dramas but celebrity documentaries, popular music acts, and comedy performances. President Calvin Coolidge, opera singer Abbie Mitchell, and vaudeville stars such as Phil Baker, Ben Bernie, Eddie Cantor and Oscar Levant appeared in the firm's pictures. Hollywood remained suspicious, even fearful, of the new technology. As \"Photoplay\" editor James Quirk put it in March 1924, \"Talking pictures are perfected, says Dr. Lee De Forest. \"So\" is castor oil.\" De Forest's process continued to be used through 1927 in the United States for dozens of short Phonofilms; in the UK it was employed a few years longer for both shorts and features by British Sound Film Productions, a subsidiary of British Talking Pictures, which purchased the primary Phonofilm assets. By the end of 1930, the Phonofilm business would be liquidated.\nIn Europe, others were also working on the development of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893\u20131942), Hans Vogt (1890\u20131979), and Joseph Massolle (1889\u20131957), patented the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions\u2014including a dramatic talkie, \"Der Brandstifter\" (\"The Arsonist\") \u2014before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cin\u00e9phone.\nUS competition eclipsed Phonofilm. By September 1925, De Forest and Case's working arrangement had fallen through. The following July, Case joined Fox Film, Hollywood's third largest studio, to found the Fox-Case Corporation. The system developed by Case and his assistant, Earl Sponable, given the name Movietone, thus became the first viable sound-on-film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio. The following year, Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri-Ergon system, though the company found it inferior to Movietone and virtually impossible to integrate the two different systems to advantage. In 1927, as well, Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens, who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch-sound film.\nAdvanced sound-on-disc.\nParallel with improvements in sound-on-film technology, a number of companies were making progress with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified film projector, allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the Photokinema sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D. W. Griffith's failed silent film \"Dream Street\". A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, \"Dream Street\" was re-released, with love song added, at New York City's Town Hall theater, qualifying it\u2014however haphazardly\u2014as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence. However, the sound quality was very poor and no other theaters could show the sound version of the film as no one had the Photokinema sound system installed. On Sunday, May 29, \"Dream Street\" opened at the Shubert Crescent Theater in Brooklyn with a program of short films made in Phonokinema. However, business was poor, and the program soon closed.\nIn 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood studio with big ambitions, saw a demonstration of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York City's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president. Vitaphone, as this system was now called, was publicly introduced on August 6, 1926, with the premiere of \"Don Juan\"; the first feature-length movie to employ a synchronized sound system of any type throughout, its soundtrack contained a musical score and added sound effects, but no recorded dialogue\u2014in other words, it had been staged and shot as a silent film. Accompanying \"Don Juan\", however, were eight shorts of musical performances, mostly classical, as well as a four-minute filmed introduction by Will H. Hays, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, all with live-recorded sound. These were the first true sound films exhibited by a Hollywood studio. Warner Bros.' \"The Better 'Ole\", technically similar to \"Don Juan\", followed in October.\nSound-on-film would ultimately win out over sound-on-disc because of a number of fundamental technical advantages:\nNonetheless, in the early years, sound-on-disc had the edge over sound-on-film in two substantial ways:\nAs sound-on-film technology improved, both of these disadvantages were overcome.\nThe third crucial set of innovations marked a major step forward in both the live recording of sound and its effective playback:\nFidelity electronic recording and amplification.\nIn 1913, Western Electric, the manufacturing division of AT&amp;T, acquired the rights to the de Forest audion, the forerunner of the triode vacuum tube. Over the next few years they developed it into a predictable and reliable device that made electronic amplification possible for the first time. Western Electric then branched-out into developing uses for the vacuum tube including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry. Beginning in 1922, the research branch of Western Electric began working intensively on recording technology for both sound-on-disc and sound-on film synchronised sound systems for motion-pictures.\nThe engineers working on the sound-on-disc system were able to draw on expertise that Western Electric already had in electrical disc recording and were thus able to make faster initial progress. The main change required was to increase the playing time of the disc so that it could match that of a standard reel of 35\u00a0mm film. The chosen design used a disc nearly 16 inches (about 40\u00a0cm) in diameter rotating at 33\u00a01/3 rpm. This could play for 11 minutes, the running time of 1000\u00a0ft of film at 90\u00a0ft/min (24 frames/s). Because of the larger diameter the minimum groove velocity of 70\u00a0ft/min (14 inches or 356\u00a0mm/s) was only slightly less than that of a standard 10-inch 78 rpm commercial disc.\nIn 1925, the company publicly introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber-line recorders (named after the use of a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax master disc). That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest, just one month later. In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT&amp;T for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of \"Don Juan\" and its accompanying shorts over the following months. During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company's sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, Bell Labs\u2014the new name for the AT&amp;T research operation\u2014was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil speaker system was installed in New York's Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was filed on August 4, just two days before the premiere of \"Don Juan\".\nLate in the year, AT&amp;T/Western Electric created a licensing division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle rights to the company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense for the use of the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.\nTravel.\nIn 1929 a \"new RCA Photophone portable sound and picture reproducing system\" was described in the industry journal Projection Engineering. In Australia, Hoyts and Gilby Talkies Pty., Ltd were touring talking pictures to country towns. The same year the White Star Line installed talking picture equipment on the s.s. Majestic. The features shown on the first voyage were \"Show Boat\" and \"Broadway.\"\nTriumph of the \"talkies\".\nIn February 1927, an agreement was signed by five leading Hollywood movie companies: Famous Players\u2013Lasky (soon to be part of Paramount), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, First National, and Cecil B. DeMille's small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC). The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion, and then waited to see what sort of results the front-runners came up with. In May, Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI (along with the Fox-Case sublicense) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox's for use of Western Electric technology. Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema, moving in different directions both technologically and commercially: Fox moved into newsreels and then scored dramas, while Warners concentrated on talking features. Meanwhile, ERPI sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios.\nThe big sound film sensations of the year all took advantage of preexisting celebrity. On May 20, 1927, at New York City's Roxy Theater, Fox Movietone presented a sound film of the takeoff of Charles Lindbergh's celebrated flight to Paris, recorded earlier that day. In June, a Fox sound newsreel depicting his return welcomes in New York City and Washington, D.C., was shown. These were the two most acclaimed sound motion pictures to date. In May, as well, Fox had released the first Hollywood fiction film with synchronized dialogue: the short \"They're Coming to Get Me\", starring comedian Chic Sale. After rereleasing a few silent feature hits, such as \"Seventh Heaven\", with recorded music, Fox came out with its first original Movietone feature on September 23: \"\", by acclaimed German director F. W. Murnau. As with \"Don Juan\", the film's soundtrack consisted of a musical score and sound effects (including, in a couple of crowd scenes, \"wild\", nonspecific vocals).\nThen, on October 6, 1927, Warner Bros.' \"The Jazz Singer\" premiered. It was a smash box office success for the mid-level studio, earning a total of $2.625 million in the United States and abroad, almost a million dollars more than the previous record for a Warner Bros. film. Produced with the Vitaphone system, most of the film does not contain live-recorded audio, relying, like \"Sunrise\" and \"Don Juan\", on a score and effects. When the movie's star, Al Jolson, sings, however, the film shifts to sound recorded on the set, including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad-libbed speech\u2014one of Jolson's character, Jakie Rabinowitz (Jack Robin), addressing a cabaret audience; the other an exchange between him and his mother. The \"natural\" sounds of the settings were also audible. Though the success of \"The Jazz Singer\" was due largely to Jolson, already established as one of U.S. biggest music stars, and its limited use of synchronized sound hardly qualified it as an innovative sound film (let alone the \"first\"), the movie's profits were proof enough to the industry that the technology was worth investing in.\nThe development of commercial sound cinema had proceeded in fits and starts before \"The Jazz Singer\", and the film's success did not change things overnight. Influential gossip columnist Louella Parsons' reaction to \"The Jazz Singer\" was badly off the mark: \"I have no fear that the screeching sound film will ever disturb our theaters,\" while MGM head of production Irving Thalberg called the film \"a good gimmick, but that's all it was.\" Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios (PDC had dropped out of the alliance), along with United Artists and others, sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. It was a daunting commitment; revamping a single theater cost as much as $15,000 (the equivalent of $220,000 in 2019), and there were more than 20,000 movie theaters in the United States. By 1930, only half of the theaters had been wired for sound.\nInitially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. However, even with access to both technologies, most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own. No studio besides Warner Bros. released even a part-talking feature until the low-budget-oriented Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) premiered \"The Perfect Crime\" on June 17, 1928, eight months after \"The Jazz Singer\". FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor, General Electric's RCA division, which was looking to market its new sound-on-film system, Photophone. Unlike Fox-Case's Movietone and De Forest's Phonofilm, which were variable-density systems, Photophone was a variable-area system\u2014a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the standard. (In both sorts of systems, a specially designed lamp, whose exposure to the film is determined by the audio input, is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines. In a variable-density process, the lines are of varying darkness; in a variable-area process, the lines are of varying width.) By October, the FBO-RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood's newest major studio, RKO Pictures.\nMeanwhile, Warner Bros. had released three more talkies, all profitable, if not at the level of \"The Jazz Singer\": In March, \"Tenderloin\" appeared; it was billed by Warners as the first feature in which characters spoke their parts, though only 15 of its 88 minutes had dialogue. \"Glorious Betsy\" followed in April, and \"The Lion and the Mouse\" (31 minutes of dialogue) in May. On July 6, 1928, the first all-talking feature, \"Lights of New York\", premiered. The film cost Warner Bros. only $23,000 to produce, but grossed $1,252,000, a record rate of return surpassing 5,000%. In September, the studio released another Al Jolson part-talking picture, \"The Singing Fool\", which more than doubled \"The Jazz Singer\"'s earnings record for a Warner Bros. movie. This second Jolson screen smash demonstrated the movie musical's ability to turn a song into a national hit: inside of nine months, the Jolson number \"Sonny Boy\" had racked up 2 million record and 1.25 million sheet music sales. September 1928 also saw the release of Paul Terry's \"Dinner Time\", among the first animated cartoons produced with synchronized sound. Soon after he saw it, Walt Disney released his first sound picture, the Mickey Mouse short \"Steamboat Willie\".\nOver the course of 1928, as Warner Bros. began to rake in huge profits due to the popularity of its sound films, the other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology. Paramount, the industry leader, put out its first talkie in late September, \"Beggars of Life\"; though it had just a few lines of dialogue, it demonstrated the studio's recognition of the new medium's power. \"Interference\", Paramount's first all-talker, debuted in November. The process known as \"goat glanding\" briefly became widespread: soundtracks, sometimes including a smatter of post-dubbed dialogue or song, were added to movies that had been shot, and in some cases released, as silents. A few minutes of singing could qualify such a newly endowed film as a \"musical.\" (Griffith's \"Dream Street\" had essentially been a \"goat gland.\") Expectations swiftly changed, and the sound \"fad\" of 1927 became standard procedure by 1929. In February 1929, sixteen months after \"The Jazz Singer\"'s debut, Columbia Pictures became the last of the eight studios that would be known as \"majors\" during Hollywood's Golden Age to release its first part-talking feature, \"The Lone Wolf's Daughter\". In late May, the first all-color, all-talking feature, Warner Bros.' \"On with the Show!\", premiered.\nYet most American movie theaters, especially outside of urban areas, were still not equipped for sound: while the number of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929, they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters, which had actually grown in number as well, from 22,204 to 22,544. The studios, in parallel, were still not entirely convinced of the talkies' universal appeal\u2014until mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking. Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory. \"Points West\", a Hoot Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929, was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio.\nTransition: Europe.\n\"The Jazz Singer\" had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27, 1928. According to film historian Rachael Low, \"Many in the industry realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable.\" On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production \"Ich k\u00fcsse Ihre Hand, Madame\" (\"I Kiss Your Hand, Madame\"). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber. The movie was made with the sound-on-film system controlled by the German-Dutch firm Tobis, corporate heirs to the Tri-Ergon concern. With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a joint subsidiary of Germany's two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places. Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system's value, Tobis also established its own production operations.\nDuring 1929, most of the major European filmmaking countries began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe's first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: \"The Crimson Circle\" was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik's Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent \"Der Rote Kreis\" in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP's corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: \"The Clue of the New Pin\", a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, \"Black Waters\", which British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made much impact.\nThe first successful European dramatic talkie was the all-British \"Blackmail\". Directed by twenty-nine-year-old Alfred Hitchcock, the movie had its London debut June 21, 1929. Originally shot as a silent, \"Blackmail\" was restaged to include dialogue sequences, along with a score and sound effects, before its premiere. A British International Pictures (BIP) production, it was recorded on RCA Photophone, General Electric having bought a share of AEG so they could access the Tobis-Klangfilm markets. \"Blackmail\" was a substantial hit; critical response was also positive\u2014notorious curmudgeon Hugh Castle, for example, called it \"perhaps the most intelligent mixture of sound and silence we have yet seen.\"\nOn August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film industry came out with a talkie: \"G'schichten aus der Steiermark\" (\"Stories from Styria\"), an Eagle Film\u2013Ottoton Film production. On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, \"Das Land ohne Frauen\" (\"Land Without Women\"), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, about one-quarter of the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming. Sweden's first talkie, \"Konstgjorda Svensson\" (\"Artificial Svensson\"), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with \"Le Collier de la reine\" (\"The Queen's Necklace\"), shot at the \u00c9pinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence\u2014the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, \"Les Trois masques\" (\"The Three Masks\") debuted; a Path\u00e9-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like \"Blackmail\", at the Elstree studio, just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richeb\u00e9 talkie \"La Route est belle\" (\"The Road Is Fine\"), also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.\nBefore the Paris studios were fully sound-equipped\u2014a process that stretched well into 1930\u2014a number of other early French talkies were shot in Germany. The first all-talking German feature, \"Atlantik\", had premiered in Berlin on October 28. Yet another Elstree-made movie, it was rather less German at heart than \"Les Trois masques\" and \"La Route est belle\" were French; a BIP production with a British scenarist and German director, it was also shot in English as \"Atlantic\". The entirely German Aafa-Film production \"It's You I Have Loved\" (\"Dich hab ich geliebt\") opened three and a half weeks later. It was not \"Germany's First Talking Film\", as the marketing had it, but it was the first to be released in the United States.\nIn 1930, the first Polish talkies premiered, using sound-on-disc systems: \"Moralno\u015b\u0107 pani Dulskiej\" (\"The Morality of Mrs. Dulska\") in March and the all-talking \"Niebezpieczny romans\" (\"Dangerous Love Affair\") in October. In Italy, whose once vibrant film industry had become moribund by the late 1920s, the first talkie, \"La Canzone dell'amore\" (\"The Song of Love\"), also came out in October; within two years, Italian cinema would be enjoying a revival. The first movie spoken in Czech debuted in 1930 as well, \"Tonka \u0160ibenice\" (\"Tonka of the Gallows\"). Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures\u2014Belgium (in French), Denmark, Greece, and Romania. The Soviet Union's robust film industry came out with its first sound features in December 1930: Dziga Vertov's nonfiction \"Enthusiasm\" had an experimental, dialogueless soundtrack; Abram Room's documentary \"Plan velikikh rabot\" (\"The Plan of the Great Works\") had music and spoken voiceovers. Both were made with locally developed sound-on-film systems, two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world. In June 1931, the Nikolai Ekk drama \"Putevka v zhizn\" (\"The Road to Life\" or \"A Start in Life\"), premiered as the Soviet Union's first true talking picture.\nThroughout much of Europe, conversion of exhibition venues lagged well behind production capacity, requiring talkies to be produced in parallel silent versions or simply shown without sound in many places. While the pace of conversion was relatively swift in Britain\u2014with over 60 percent of theaters equipped for sound by the end of 1930, similar to the U.S. figure\u2014in France, by contrast, more than half of theaters nationwide were still projecting in silence by late 1932. According to scholar Colin G. Crisp, \"Anxiety about resuscitating the flow of silent films was frequently expressed in the [French] industrial press, and a large section of the industry still saw the silent as a viable artistic and commercial prospect till about 1935.\" The situation was particularly acute in the Soviet Union; as of May 1933, fewer than one out of every hundred film projectors in the country was as yet equipped for sound.\nTransition: Asia.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Japan was one of the world's two largest producers of motion pictures, along with the United States. Though the country's film industry was among the first to produce both sound and talking features, the full changeover to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West. It appears that the first Japanese sound film, \"Reimai\" (\"Dawn\"), was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system. Using the sound-on-disc Minatoki system, the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929: \"Taii no musume\" (\"The Captain's Daughter\") and \"Furusato\" (\"Hometown\"), the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound-on-film talkies in 1931 using a variable-density process called Tsuchibashi. Two years later, however, more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents. Two of the country's leading directors, Mikio Naruse and Yasujir\u014d Ozu, did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936, respectively. As late as 1938, over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue.\nThe enduring popularity of the silent medium in Japanese cinema owed in great part to the tradition of the \"benshi\", a live narrator who performed as accompaniment to a film screening. As director Akira Kurosawa later described, the benshi \"not only recounted the plot of the films, they enhanced the emotional content by performing the voices and sound effects and providing evocative descriptions of events and images on the screen... The most popular narrators were stars in their own right, solely responsible for the patronage of a particular theatre.\" Film historian Mariann Lewinsky argues,\nThe end of silent film in the West and in Japan was imposed by the industry and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn't lack anything, least in Japan, where there was always the human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn't have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.\nBy the same token, the viability of the benshi system facilitated a gradual transition to sound\u2014allowing the studios to spread out the capital costs of conversion and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology.\nThe Mandarin-language \"G\u0113n\u01da h\u00f3ng m\u01d4d\u0101n\" (\u6b4c\u5973\u7d05\u7261\u4e39, \"Singsong Girl Red Peony\"), starring Butterfly Wu, premiered as China's first feature talkie in 1930. By February of that year, production was apparently completed on a sound version of \"The Devil's Playground\", arguably qualifying it as the first Australian talking motion picture; however, the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner \"Fellers\" is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie. In September 1930, a song performed by Indian star Sulochana, excerpted from the silent feature \"Madhuri\" (1928), was released as a synchronized-sound short, the country's first. The following year, Ardeshir Irani directed the first Indian talking feature, the Hindi-Urdu \"Alam Ara\", and produced \"Kalidas\", primarily in Tamil with some Telugu. Nineteen-thirty-one also saw the first Bengali-language film, \"Jamai Sasthi\", and the first movie fully spoken in Telugu, \"Bhakta Prahlada\". In 1932, \"Ayodhyecha Raja\" became the first movie in which Marathi was spoken to be released (though \"Sant Tukaram\" was the first to go through the official censorship process); the first Gujarati-language film, \"Narsimha Mehta\", and all-Tamil talkie, \"Kalava\", debuted as well. The next year, Ardeshir Irani produced the first Persian-language talkie, \"Dukhtar-e-loor\". Also in 1933, the first Cantonese-language films were produced in Hong Kong\u2014\"Sha zai dongfang\" (\"The Idiot's Wedding Night\") and \"Liang xing\" (\"Conscience\"); within two years, the local film industry had fully converted to sound. Korea, where \"pyonsa\" (or \"byun-sa\") held a role and status similar to that of the Japanese benshi, in 1935 became the last country with a significant film industry to produce its first talking picture: \"Chunhyangjeon\" (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0) is based on the seventeenth-century pansori folktale \"Chunhyangga\", of which as many as fifteen film versions have been made through 2009.\nConsequences.\nTechnology.\nIn the short term, the introduction of live sound recording caused major difficulties in production. Cameras were noisy, so a soundproofed cabinet was used in many of the earliest talkies to isolate the loud equipment from the actors, at the expense of a drastic reduction in the ability to move the camera. For a time, multiple-camera shooting was used to compensate for the loss of mobility and innovative studio technicians could often find ways to liberate the camera for particular shots. The necessity of staying within range of still microphones meant that actors also often had to limit their movements unnaturally. \"Show Girl in Hollywood\" (1930), from First National Pictures (which Warner Bros. had taken control of thanks to its profitable adventure into sound), gives a behind-the-scenes look at some of the techniques involved in shooting early talkies. Several of the fundamental problems caused by the transition to sound were soon solved with new camera casings, known as \"blimps\", designed to suppress noise and boom microphones that could be held just out of frame and moved with the actors. In 1931, a major improvement in playback fidelity was introduced: three-way speaker systems in which sound was separated into low, medium, and high frequencies and sent respectively to a large bass \"woofer\", a midrange driver, and a treble \"tweeter.\"\nThere were consequences, as well, for other technological aspects of the cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.\nAs David Bordwell describes, technological improvements continued at a swift pace: \"Between 1932 and 1935, [Western Electric and RCA] created directional microphones, increased the frequency range of film recording, reduced ground noise\u00a0... and extended the volume range.\" These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: \"Increasing the fidelity of recording\u00a0... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness.\" Another basic problem\u2014famously spoofed in the 1952 film \"Singin' in the Rain\"\u2014was that some silent-era actors simply did not have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction, a process known as \"looping\", had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes.\nWith Hollywood's wholesale adoption of the talkies, the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound-film production was soon resolved. Over the course of 1930\u20131931, the only major players using sound-on-disc, Warner Bros. and First National, changed over to sound-on-film recording. Vitaphone's dominating presence in sound-equipped theaters, however, meant that for years to come all of the Hollywood studios pressed and distributed sound-on-disc versions of their films alongside the sound-on-film prints. Fox Movietone soon followed Vitaphone into disuse as a recording and reproduction method, leaving two major American systems: the variable-area RCA Photophone and Western Electric's own variable-density process, a substantial improvement on the cross-licensed Movietone. Under RCA's instigation, the two parent companies made their projection equipment compatible, meaning films shot with one system could be screened in theaters equipped for the other. This left one big issue\u2014the Tobis-Klangfilm challenge. In May 1930, Western Electric won an Austrian lawsuit that voided protection for certain Tri-Ergon patents, helping bring Tobis-Klangfilm to the negotiating table. The following month an accord was reached on patent cross-licensing, full playback compatibility, and the division of the world into three parts for the provision of equipment. As a contemporary report describes:\nTobis-Klangfilm has the exclusive rights to provide equipment for: Germany, Danzig, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, the Dutch Indies, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Finland. The Americans have the exclusive rights for the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Russia. All other countries, among them Italy, France, and England, are open to both parties.\nThe agreement did not resolve all the patent disputes, and further negotiations were undertaken and concords signed over the course of the 1930s. During these years, as well, the American studios began abandoning the Western Electric system for RCA Photophone's variable-area approach\u2014by the end of 1936, only Paramount, MGM, and United Artists still had contracts with ERPI.\nLabor.\nWhile the introduction of sound led to a boom in the motion picture industry, it had an adverse effect on the employability of a host of Hollywood actors of the time. Suddenly those without stage experience were regarded as suspect by the studios; as suggested above, those whose heavy accents or otherwise discordant voices had previously been concealed were particularly at risk. The career of major silent star Norma Talmadge effectively came to an end in this way. The celebrated German actor Emil Jannings returned to Europe. Moviegoers found John Gilbert's voice an awkward match with his swashbuckling persona, and his star also faded. Audiences now seemed to perceive certain silent-era stars as old-fashioned, even those who had the talent to succeed in the sound era. The career of Harold Lloyd, one of the top screen comedians of the 1920s, declined precipitously. Lillian Gish departed, back to the stage, and other leading figures soon left acting entirely: Colleen Moore, Gloria Swanson, and Hollywood's most famous performing couple, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. After his acting career collapsed due to his Danish accent, Karl Dane committed suicide. However, the impact of sound on the careers of film actors should not be exaggerated. One statistical analysis of silent actress career length showed that the five-year \u2018survival-rate\u2019 of actresses active in 1922 was only 10% greater than those active after 1927. As actress Louise Brooks suggested, there were other issues as well:\nStudio heads, now forced into unprecedented decisions, decided to begin with the actors, the least palatable, the most vulnerable part of movie production. It was such a splendid opportunity, anyhow, for breaking contracts, cutting salaries, and taming the stars... Me, they gave the salary treatment. I could stay on without the raise my contract called for, or quit, [Paramount studio chief B. P.] Schulberg said, using the questionable dodge of whether I'd be good for the talkies. Questionable, I say, because I spoke decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater. So without hesitation I quit.\nBuster Keaton was eager to explore the new medium, but when his studio, MGM, made the changeover to sound, he was quickly stripped of creative control. Though a number of Keaton's early talkies made impressive profits, they were artistically dismal.\nSeveral of the new medium's biggest attractions came from vaudeville and the musical theater, where performers such as Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Jeanette MacDonald, and the Marx Brothers were accustomed to the demands of both dialogue and song. James Cagney and Joan Blondell, who had teamed on Broadway, were brought west together by Warner Bros. in 1930. A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras: John Barrymore, Ronald Colman, Myrna Loy, William Powell, Norma Shearer, the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and Charlie Chaplin, whose \"City Lights\" (1931) and \"Modern Times\" (1936) employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects. Janet Gaynor became a top star with the synch-sound but dialogueless \"Seventh Heaven\" and \"Sunrise\", as did Joan Crawford with the technologically similar \"Our Dancing Daughters\" (1928). Greta Garbo was the one non\u2013native English speaker to retain Hollywood stardom on both sides of the great sound divide. Silent film extra Clark Gable, who had received extensive voice training during his earlier stage career, went on to dominate the new medium for decades; similarly, English actor Boris Karloff, having appeared in dozens of silent films since 1919, found his star ascend in the sound era (though, ironically, it was a non-speaking role in 1931's \"Frankenstein\" that made this happen, but despite having a lisp, he found himself much in demand after). The new emphasis on speech also caused producers to hire many novelists, journalists, and playwrights with experience writing good dialogue. Among those who became Hollywood scriptwriters during the 1930s were Nathanael West, William Faulkner, Robert Sherwood, Aldous Huxley, and Dorothy Parker.\nAs talking pictures emerged, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work. More than just their position as film accompanists was usurped; according to historian Preston J. Hubbard, \"During the 1920s live musical performances at first-run theaters became an exceedingly important aspect of the American cinema.\" With the coming of the talkies, those featured performances\u2014usually staged as preludes\u2014were largely eliminated as well. The American Federation of Musicians took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the \"Pittsburgh Press\" features an image of a can labeled \"Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever\" and reads in part:\nCanned Music on Trial\nThis is the case of Art vs. Mechanical Music in theatres. The defendant stands accused in front of the American people of attempted corruption of musical appreciation and discouragement of musical education. Theatres in many cities are offering synchronised mechanical music as a substitute for Real Music. If the theatre-going public accepts this vitiation of its entertainment program a deplorable decline in the Art of Music is inevitable. Musical authorities know that the soul of the Art is lost in mechanization. It cannot be otherwise because the quality of music is dependent on the mood of the artist, upon the human contact, without which the essence of intellectual stimulation and emotional rapture is lost.\nBy the following year, a reported 22,000 U.S. moviehouse musicians had lost their jobs.\nCommerce.\nIn September 1926, Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Bros., was quoted to the effect that talking pictures would never be viable: \"They fail to take into account the international language of the silent pictures, and the unconscious share of each onlooker in creating the play, the action, the plot, and the imagined dialogue for himself.\" Much to his company's benefit, he would be proven very wrong\u2014between the 1927\u20131928 and 1928\u20131929 fiscal years, Warners' profits surged from $2 million to $14 million. Sound film, in fact, was a clear boon to all the major players in the industry. During that same twelve-month span, Paramount's profits rose by $7 million, Fox's by $3.5 million, and Loew's/MGM's by $3 million. RKO, which did not even exist in September 1928 and whose parent production company, FBO, was in the Hollywood minor leagues, by the end of 1929 was established as one of America's leading entertainment businesses. Fueling the boom was the emergence of an important new cinematic genre made possible by sound: the musical. Over sixty Hollywood musicals were released in 1929, and more than eighty the following year.\nEven as the Wall Street crash of October 1929 helped plunge the United States and ultimately the global economy into depression, the popularity of the talkies at first seemed to keep Hollywood immune. The 1929\u20131930 exhibition season was even better for the motion picture industry than the previous, with ticket sales and overall profits hitting new highs. Reality finally struck later in 1930, but sound had clearly secured Hollywood's position as one of the most important industrial fields, both commercially and culturally, in the United States. In 1929, film box-office receipts comprised 16.6 percent of total spending by Americans on recreation; by 1931, the figure had reached 21.8 percent. The motion picture business would command similar figures for the next decade and a half. Hollywood ruled on the larger stage, as well. The American movie industry\u2014already the world's most powerful\u2014set an export record in 1929 that, by the applied measure of total feet of exposed film, was 27 percent higher than the year before. Concerns that language differences would hamper U.S. film exports turned out to be largely unfounded. In fact, the expense of sound conversion was a major obstacle to many overseas producers, relatively undercapitalized by Hollywood standards. The production of multiple versions of export-bound talkies in different languages (known as \"Foreign Language Version\"), as well as the production of the cheaper \"International Sound Version\", a common approach at first, largely ceased by mid-1931, replaced by post-dubbing and subtitling. Despite trade restrictions imposed in most foreign markets, by 1937, American films commanded about 70 percent of screen time around the globe.\nJust as the leading Hollywood studios gained from sound in relation to their foreign competitors, they did the same at home. As historian Richard B. Jewell describes, \"The sound revolution crushed many small film companies and producers who were unable to meet the financial demands of sound conversion.\" The combination of sound and the Great Depression led to a wholesale shakeout in the business, resulting in the hierarchy of the Big Five integrated companies (MGM, Paramount, Fox, Warner Bros., RKO) and the three smaller studios also called \"majors\" (Columbia, Universal, United Artists) that would predominate through the 1950s. Historian Thomas Schatz describes the ancillary effects:\nBecause the studios were forced to streamline operations and rely on their own resources, their individual house styles and corporate personalities came into much sharper focus. Thus the watershed period from the coming of sound into the early Depression saw the studio system finally coalesce, with the individual studios coming to terms with their own identities and their respective positions within the industry.\nThe other country in which sound cinema had an immediate major commercial impact was India. As one distributor of the period said, \"With the coming of the talkies, the Indian motion picture came into its own as a definite and distinctive piece of creation. This was achieved by music.\" From its earliest days, Indian sound cinema has been defined by the musical\u2014\"Alam Ara\" featured seven songs; a year later, \"Indrasabha\" would feature seventy. While the European film industries fought an endless battle against the popularity and economic muscle of Hollywood, ten years after the debut of \"Alam Ara\", over 90 percent of the films showing on Indian screens were made within the country.\nMost of India's early talkies were shot in Bombay, which remains the leading production center, but sound filmmaking soon spread across the multilingual nation. Within just a few weeks of \"Alam Ara\"'s March 1931 premiere, the Calcutta-based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi \"Shirin Farhad\" and the Bengali \"Jamai Sasthi\". The Hindustani \"Heer Ranjha\" was produced in Lahore, Punjab, the following year. In 1934, \"Sati Sulochana\", the first Kannada talking picture to be released, was shot in Kolhapur, Maharashtra; \"Srinivasa Kalyanam\" became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu. Once the first talkie features appeared, the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India as it did in the United States. Already by 1932, the majority of feature productions were in sound; two years later, 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures. Since 1934, with the sole exception of 1952, India has been among the top three movie-producing countries in the world every single year.\nAesthetic quality.\nIn the first, 1930 edition of his global survey \"The Film Till Now\", British cinema pundit Paul Rotha declared, \"A film in which the speech and sound effects are perfectly synchronised and coincide with their visual image on the screen is absolutely contrary to the aims of cinema. It is a degenerate and misguided attempt to destroy the real use of the film and cannot be accepted as coming within the true boundaries of the cinema.\" Such opinions were not rare among those who cared about cinema as an art form; Alfred Hitchcock, though he directed the first commercially successful talkie produced in Europe, held that \"the silent pictures were the purest form of cinema\" and scoffed at many early sound films as delivering little beside \"photographs of people talking\". In Germany, Max Reinhardt, stage producer and movie director, expressed the belief that the talkies, \"bringing to the screen stage plays\u00a0... tend to make this independent art a subsidiary of the theater and really make it only a substitute for the theater instead of an art in itself\u00a0... like reproductions of paintings.\"\nIn the opinion of many film historians and aficionados, both at the time and subsequently, silent film had reached an aesthetic peak by the late 1920s and the early years of sound cinema delivered little that was comparable to the best of the silents. For instance, despite fading into relative obscurity once its era had passed, silent cinema is represented by eleven films in \"Time Out\"'s Centenary of Cinema Top One Hundred poll, held in 1995. The first year in which sound film production predominated over silent film\u2014not only in the United States, but also in the West as a whole\u2014was 1929; yet the years 1929 through 1933 are represented by three dialogueless pictures (\"Pandora's Box\" (1929), \"Zemlya\" (1930), \"City Lights\" (1931)) and zero talkies in the \"Time Out\" poll. (\"City Lights\", like \"Sunrise\", was released with a recorded score and sound effects, but is now customarily referred to by historians and industry professionals as a \"silent\"\u2014spoken dialogue regarded as the crucial distinguishing factor between silent and sound dramatic cinema.) The earliest sound film to place is the French \"L'Atalante\" (1934), directed by Jean Vigo; the earliest Hollywood sound film to qualify is \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), directed by Howard Hawks.\nThe first sound feature film to receive near-universal critical approbation was \"Der Blaue Engel\" (\"The Blue Angel\"); premiering on April 1, 1930, it was directed by Josef von Sternberg in both German and English versions for Berlin's UFA studio. The first American talkie to be widely honored was \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", directed by Lewis Milestone, which premiered April 21. The other internationally acclaimed sound drama of the year was \"Westfront 1918\", directed by G. W. Pabst for Nero-Film of Berlin. Historian Anton Kaes points to it as an example of \"the new verisimilitude [that] rendered silent cinema's former emphasis on the hypnotic gaze and the symbolism of light and shadow, as well as its preference for allegorical characters, anachronistic.\" Cultural historians consider the French \"L'\u00c2ge d'Or\", directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel, which appeared late in 1930, to be of great aesthetic import; at the time, its erotic, blasphemous, anti-bourgeois content caused a scandal. Swiftly banned by Paris police chief Jean Chiappe, it was unavailable for fifty years. The earliest sound movie now acknowledged by most film historians as a masterpiece is Nero-Film's \"M\", directed by Fritz Lang, which premiered May 11, 1931. As described by Roger Ebert, \"Many early talkies felt they had to talk all the time, but Lang allows his camera to prowl through the streets and dives, providing a rat's-eye view.\"\nCinematic form.\n\"Talking film is as little needed as a singing book.\" Such was the blunt proclamation of critic Viktor Shklovsky, one of the leaders of the Russian formalist movement, in 1927. While some regarded sound as irreconcilable with film art, others saw it as opening a new field of creative opportunity. The following year, a group of Soviet filmmakers, including Sergei Eisenstein, proclaimed that the use of image and sound in juxtaposition, the so-called contrapuntal method, would raise the cinema to \"...unprecedented power and cultural height. Such a method for constructing the sound-film will not confine it to a national market, as must happen with the photographing of plays, but will give a greater possibility than ever before for the circulation throughout the world of a filmically expressed idea.\" So far as one segment of the audience was concerned, however, the introduction of sound brought a virtual end to such circulation: Elizabeth C. Hamilton writes, \"Silent films offered people who were deaf a rare opportunity to participate in a public discourse, cinema, on equal terms with hearing people. The emergence of sound film effectively separated deaf from hearing audience members once again.\"\nOn March 12, 1929, the first feature-length talking picture made in Germany had its premiere. The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production, it was not a drama, but a documentary sponsored by a shipping line: \"Melodie der Welt\" (\"Melody of the World\"), directed by Walter Ruttmann. This was also perhaps the first feature film anywhere to significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound. As described by scholar William Moritz, the movie is \"intricate, dynamic, fast-paced\u00a0... juxtapos[ing] similar cultural habits from countries around the world, with a superb orchestral score\u00a0... and many synchronized sound effects.\" Composer Lou Lichtveld was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film: \"\"Melodie der Welt\" became the first important sound documentary, the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse.\" \"Melodie der Welt\" was a direct influence on the industrial film \"Philips Radio\" (1931), directed by Dutch avant-garde filmmaker Joris Ivens and scored by Lichtveld, who described its audiovisual aims:\nTo render the half-musical impressions of factory sounds in a complex audio world that moved from absolute music to the purely documentary noises of nature. In this film every intermediate stage can be found: such as the movement of the machine interpreted by the music, the noises of the machine dominating the musical background, the music itself is the documentary, and those scenes where the pure sound of the machine goes solo.\nMany similar experiments were pursued by Dziga Vertov in his 1931 \"Entuziazm\" and by Chaplin in \"Modern Times\", a half-decade later.\nA few innovative commercial directors immediately saw the ways in which sound could be employed as an integral part of cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In \"Blackmail\", Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character's monologue so the word \"knife\" would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing. In his first film, the Paramount \"Applause\" (1929), Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, \"They said we couldn't record the two things\u2014the song and the prayer\u2014on one mike and one channel. So I said to the sound man, 'Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?'\" Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking.\nOne of the first commercial films to take full advantage of the new opportunities provided by recorded sound was \"Le Million\", directed by Ren\u00e9 Clair and produced by Tobis's French division. Premiering in Paris in April 1931 and New York a month later, the picture was both a critical and popular success. A musical comedy with a barebones plot, it is memorable for its formal accomplishments, in particular, its emphatically artificial treatment of sound. As described by scholar Donald Crafton,\n\"Le Million\" never lets us forget that the acoustic component is as much a construction as the whitewashed sets. [It] replaced dialogue with actors singing and talking in rhyming couplets. Clair created teasing confusions between on- and off-screen sound. He also experimented with asynchronous audio tricks, as in the famous scene in which a chase after a coat is synched to the cheers of an invisible football (or rugby) crowd.\nThese and similar techniques became part of the vocabulary of the sound comedy film, though as special effects and \"color\", not as the basis for the kind of comprehensive, non-naturalistic design achieved by Clair. Outside of the comedic field, the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by \"Melodie der Welt\" and \"Le Million\" would be pursued very rarely in commercial production. Hollywood, in particular, incorporated sound into a reliable system of genre-based moviemaking, in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling. As accurately predicted in 1928 by Frank Woods, secretary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, \"The talking pictures of the future will follow the general line of treatment heretofore developed by the silent drama... The talking scenes will require different handling, but the general construction of the story will be much the same.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In some languages, and occasionally in English, the right to vote is called active suffrage, as distinct from passive suffrage, which is the right to stand for election. The combination of active and passive suffrage is sometimes called \"full suffrage\".\nIn most democracies, eligible voters can vote in elections for representatives. Voting on issues by referendum (direct democracy) may also be available. For example, in Switzerland, this is permitted at all levels of government. In the United States, some states allow citizens the opportunity to write, propose, and vote on referendums (popular initiatives); other states and the federal government do not. Referendums in the United Kingdom are rare.\nSuffrage continues to be especially restricted on the basis of age, residency and citizenship status in many places. In some countries additional restrictions exist. In Great Britain and the United States a felon might lose the right to vote. In some countries being under guardianship may restrict the right to vote. Non-resident citizen voting allows emigrants and expats of some countries to vote in their home country. Resident non-citizens can vote in some countries, which may be restricted to citizens of closely linked countries (e.g., Commonwealth citizens and European Union citizens) or to certain offices or questions. Multiple citizenship typically allows to vote in multiple countries. Historically the right to vote was more restricted, for example by gender, race, or wealth.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"suffrage\" comes from Latin , which initially meant \"a voting-tablet\", \"a ballot\", \"a vote\", or \"the right to vote\". in the second century and later came to mean \"political patronage, influence, interest, or support\", and sometimes \"popular acclaim\" or \"applause\". By the fourth century the word was used for \"an intercession\", asking a patron for their influence with the Almighty. was used in the fifth and sixth centuries with connection to buying influence or profiteering from appointing to office, and eventually the word referred to the bribe itself. William Smith rejects the connection of to \"sub\" \"under\" + \"fragor\" \"crash, din, shouts (as of approval)\", related to \"frangere\" \"to break\"; Eduard Wunder writes that the word may be related to \"suffrago\", signifying an ankle bone or knuckle bone. In the 17th century the English \"suffrage\" regained the earlier meaning of the Latin \"\", \"a vote\" or \"the right to vote\".\nTypes.\nUniversal suffrage.\nUniversal suffrage would be achieved when all have the right to vote without restriction. It could, for example, look like a system where everyone was presumed to have the right to vote unless a government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the need to revoke voting rights. The trend towards universal suffrage has progressed in some democracies by eliminating some or all of the voting restrictions due to gender, race, religion, social status, education level, wealth, citizenship, ability and age. However, throughout history the term 'universal suffrage' has meant different things, with the different assumptions about the groups that were or were not deemed desirable voters.\nEarly history.\nThe short-lived Corsican Republic (1755\u20131769) was the first country to grant limited universal suffrage to all citizens over the age of 25.\nIn 1819, 60\u201380,000 women and men from 30 miles around Manchester assembled in the city's St. Peter's Square to protest their lack of any representation in the Houses of Parliament. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. (The eponymous \"Peterloo\" film featured a scene of women suffragists planning their contribution to the protest.) At that time Manchester had a population of around 140,000 and the population totals of Greater Manchester were around 490,000.\nThis was followed by other experiments in the Paris Commune of 1871 and the island republic of Franceville (1889). From 1840 to 1852, the Kingdom of Hawai'i granted universal suffrage without mention of sex. In 1893, when the Kingdom of Hawai'i was overthrown in a coup, New Zealand was the only independent country to practice universal (active) suffrage, and the Freedom in the World index lists New Zealand as the only free country in the world in 1893.\nWomen's suffrage.\nWomen's suffrage is the right of women to vote. This was the goal of the suffragists, who believed in using legal means, as well as the suffragettes, who used extremist measures. Short-lived suffrage equity was drafted into provisions of the State of New Jersey's first, 1776 Constitution, which extended the Right to Vote to unwed female landholders and black land owners.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;IV. That all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money, clear estate in the same, and have resided within the county in which they claim a vote for twelve months immediately preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote for Representatives in Council and Assembly; and also for all other public officers, that shall be elected by the people of the county at large. New Jersey \"1776\"\nHowever, the document did not specify an Amendment procedure, and the provision was subsequently replaced in 1844 by the adoption of the succeeding constitution, which reverted to \"all white male\" suffrage restrictions.\nAlthough the Kingdom of Hawai'i granted female suffrage in 1840, the right was rescinded in 1852. Limited voting rights were gained by some women in Sweden, Britain, and some western U.S. states in the 1860s. In 1893, the British colony of New Zealand became the first self-governing nation to extend the right to vote to all adult women. In 1894, the women of South Australia achieved the right to both vote and stand for Parliament. The autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire was the first nation to allow all women to both vote and run for parliament.\nAnti-women's suffrage propaganda.\nThose against the women's suffrage movement made public organizations to put down the political movement, with the main argument being that a woman's place was in the home, not polls. Political cartoons and public outrage over women's rights increased as the opposition to suffrage worked to organize legitimate groups campaigning against women's voting rights. The Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women was one organization that came out of the 1880s to put down the voting efforts.\nMuch anti-suffrage propaganda poked fun at the idea of women in politics. Political cartoons displayed the most sentiment by portraying the issue of women's suffrage to be swapped with men's lives. Some mocked the popular suffrage hairstyle of full-upward combed hair. Others depicted young girls turning into suffragettes after a failure in life, such as not being married.\nEqual suffrage.\nEqual suffrage is sometimes confused with \"Universal suffrage\", although the meaning of the former is the removal of graded votes, wherein a voter could possess a number of votes in accordance with income, wealth or social status.\nCensus suffrage.\nAlso known as \"censitary suffrage\", it is the opposite of \"equal suffrage,\" meaning that the votes cast by those eligible to vote are not equal, but weighed differently according to the person's income or rank in society (e.g., people who do not own property or whose income is lower than a given amount are barred from voting; or people with higher education have more votes than those with lower education; stockholders who have more shares in a given company have more votes than those with fewer shares). In many countries, census suffrage restricted who could vote and be elected: in the United States, until the Jacksonian reforms of the 1830s, only men who owned land of a specified acreage or monetary value could vote or participate in elections. Similarly, in Brazil, the Constitution of 1824 established that, in order to vote, citizens would need to have an annual income of 200,000 milr\u00e9is and, to be voted, their minimum annual income would need to be 400,000 milr\u00e9is.\nCompulsory suffrage.\nWhere compulsory suffrage exists, those who are eligible to vote are required by law to do so. Thirty-two countries currently practise this form of suffrage.\nBusiness vote.\nIn local government in England and some of its ex-colonies, businesses formerly had, and in some places still have, a vote in the urban area in which they paid rates. This is an extension of the historical property-based franchise from natural persons to other legal persons.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Corporation of the City of London has retained and even expanded business vote, following the passing of the City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002. This has given business interests within the City of London, which is a major financial centre with few residents, the opportunity to apply the accumulated wealth of the corporation to the development of an effective lobby for UK policies. This includes having the City Remembrancer, financed by the City's Cash, as a parliamentary agent, provided with a special seat in the House of Commons located in the under-gallery facing the Speaker's chair. In a leaked document from 2012, an official report concerning the City's Cash revealed that the aim of major occasions such as set-piece sumptuous banquets featuring national politicians was \"to increase the emphasis on complementing hospitality with business meetings consistent with the City corporation's role in supporting the City as a financial centre\".\nThe first issue taken up by the Northern Ireland civil rights movement was the business vote, abolished in 1968 (a year before it was abolished in Great Britain outside the City of London).\nIn the Republic of Ireland, commercial ratepayers can vote in local plebiscites, for changing the name of the locality or street, or delimiting a business improvement district. From 1930 to 1935, 5 of 35 members of Dublin City Council were \"commercial members\".\nIn cities in most Australian states, voting is optional for businesses but compulsory for individuals.\nSome municipalities in Delaware allow corporations to vote on local matters.\nBasis of exclusion.\nGender.\nIn ancient Athens, often cited as the birthplace of democracy, only adult, male citizens who owned land were permitted to vote. Through subsequent centuries, Europe was generally ruled by monarchs, though various forms of parliament arose at different times. The high rank ascribed to abbesses within the Catholic Church permitted some women the right to sit and vote at national assemblies \u2013 as with various high-ranking abbesses in Medieval Germany, who were ranked among the independent princes of the empire. Their Protestant successors enjoyed the same privilege almost into modern times.\nMarie Guyart, a French nun who worked with the First Nations peoples of Canada during the seventeenth century, wrote in 1654 regarding the suffrage practices of Iroquois women, \"These female chieftains are women of standing amongst the savages, and they have a deciding vote in the councils. They make decisions there like the men, and it is they who even delegated the first ambassadors to discuss peace.\" The Iroquois, like many First Nations peoples in North America, had a matrilineal kinship system. Property and descent were passed through the female line. Women elders voted on hereditary male chiefs and could depose them.\nThe emergence of many modern democracies began with male citizens obtaining the right to vote in advance of female citizens, except in the Kingdom of Hawai'i, where universal suffrage without mention of age or sex was introduced in 1840; however, a constitutional amendment in 1852 rescinded female voting and put property qualifications on male voting.\nVoting rights for women were introduced into international law by the United Nations' Human Rights Commission, whose elected chair was Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1948 the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Article\u00a021 states: \"(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. (3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.\"\nThe United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Political Rights of Women, which went into force in\u00a01954, enshrining the equal rights of women to vote, hold office, and access public services as set out by national laws. One of the most recent jurisdictions to acknowledge women's full right to vote was Bhutan in 2008 (its first national elections). Most recently, in 2011 King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia let women vote in the 2015 local elections (and from then on) and be appointed to the Consultative Assembly.\nReligion.\nIn the aftermath of the Reformation it was common in European countries for people of disfavored religious denominations to be denied civil and political rights, often including the right to vote, to stand for election or to sit in parliament. In Great Britain and Ireland, Roman Catholics were denied the right to vote from 1728 to 1793, and the right to sit in parliament until 1829. The anti-Catholic policy was justified on the grounds that the loyalty of Catholics supposedly lay with the Pope rather than the national monarch.\nIn England and Ireland, several Acts practically disenfranchised non-Anglicans or non-Protestants by imposing an oath before admission to vote or to stand for office. The 1672 and 1678 Test Acts forbade non-Anglicans to hold public offices, and the 1727 Disenfranchising Act took away Catholics' voting rights in Ireland, which were restored only in 1788. Jews could not even be naturalized. An attempt was made to change this situation, but the Jewish Naturalization Act 1753 provoked such reactions that it was repealed the following year. Nonconformists (Methodists and Presbyterians) were only allowed to run for election to the British House of Commons starting in 1828, Catholics in 1829 (following the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, which extended the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791), and Jews in 1858 (with the Emancipation of the Jews in England). Benjamin Disraeli could only begin his political career in 1837 because he had been converted to Anglicanism at the age of 12.\nIn several states in the U.S. after the Declaration of Independence, Jews, Quakers or Catholics were denied voting rights and/or forbidden to run for office. The Delaware Constitution of 1776 stated that:Every person who shall be chosen a member of either house, or appointed to any office or place of trust, before taking his seat, or entering upon the execution of his office, shall (...) also make and subscribe the following declaration, to wit: \"I, A B. do profess faith in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ His only Son, and in the Holy Ghost, one God, blessed for evermore; and I do acknowledge the holy scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by divine inspiration.\"This was repealed by article I, section\u00a02 of the 1792 Constitution: \"No religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office, or public trust, under this State\". The 1778 Constitution of the State of South Carolina stated that \"No person shall be eligible to sit in the house of representatives unless he be of the Protestant religion\", the 1777 Constitution of the State of Georgia (art. VI) that \"The representatives shall be chosen out of the residents in each county (...) and they shall be of the Protestent \"(sic)\" religion\". In Maryland, voting rights and eligibility were extended to Jews in 1828.\nIn Canada, several religious groups (Mennonites, Hutterites, Doukhobors) were disenfranchised by the wartime Elections Act of 1917, mainly because they opposed military service. This disenfranchisement ended with the closure of the First World War, but was renewed for Doukhobors from 1934 (via the \"Dominion Elections Act\") to 1955.\nThe first Constitution of modern Romania in 1866 provided in article 7 that only Christians could become Romanian citizens. Jews native to Romania were declared stateless persons. In 1879, under pressure from the Berlin Peace Conference, this article was amended, granting non-Christians the right to become Romanian citizens, but naturalization was granted on a case-by-case basis and was subject to Parliamentary approval. An application took over ten years to process. Only in 1923 was a new constitution adopted, whose article 133 extended Romanian citizenship to all Jewish residents and equality of rights to all Romanian citizens.\nWealth, tax class, social class.\nUntil the nineteenth century, many Western proto-democracies had property qualifications in their electoral laws; e.g. only landowners could vote (because the only tax for such countries was the property tax), or the voting rights were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid (as in the Prussian three-class franchise). Most countries abolished the property qualification for national elections in the late nineteenth century, but retained it for local government elections for several decades. Today these laws have largely been abolished, although the homeless may not be able to register because they lack regular addresses.\nIn the United Kingdom, until the House of Lords Act 1999, peers who were members of the House of Lords were excluded from voting for the House of Commons as they were not commoners. Although there is nothing to prevent the monarch from voting, it is considered improper for the monarch to do so.\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, many nations made voters pay to elect officials, keeping impoverished people from being fully enfranchised. These laws were in effect in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\nKnowledge.\nSometimes the right to vote has been limited to people who had achieved a certain level of education or passed a certain test. In some US states, \"literacy tests\" were previously implemented to exclude those who were illiterate. Black voters in the South were often deemed by election officials to have failed the test even when they did not. Under the 1961 constitution of Rhodesia, voting on the \"A\" roll, which elected up to 50 of the 65 members of parliament, was restricted based on education requirements, which in practice led to an overwhelming white vote. Voting on the \"B\" roll had universal suffrage, but only appointed 15 members of parliament.\nIn the 20th century, many countries other than the US placed voting restrictions on illiterate people, including: Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.\nRace.\nVarious countries, usually countries with a dominant race within a wider population, have historically denied the vote to people of particular races, or to all but the dominant race. This has been achieved in a number of ways:\nAge.\nAll modern democracies require voters to meet age qualifications to vote. Worldwide voting ages are not consistent, differing between countries and even within countries, though the range usually varies between 16 and 21 years. The United Kingdom was the first major democratic nation to extend suffrage to those 18 and older in 1969. The movement to lower the voting age is one aspect of the Youth rights movement. Demeny voting has been proposed as a form of proxy voting by parents on behalf of their children who are below the age of suffrage.\nNomination rules generally include age of candidacy rules.\nCriminality.\nSome countries restrict the voting rights of convicted criminals. Some countries, and some U.S. states, also deny the right to vote to those convicted of serious crimes even after they are released from prison. In some cases (e.g. in many U.S. states) the denial of the right to vote is automatic upon a felony conviction; in other cases (e.g. France and Germany) deprivation of the vote is meted out separately, and often limited to perpetrators of specific crimes such as those against the electoral system or corruption of public officials. In the Republic of Ireland, prisoners are allowed the right to vote, following the \"Hirst v UK (No2)\" ruling, which was granted in 2006. Canada allowed only prisoners serving a term of less than 2 years the right to vote, but this was found to be unconstitutional in 2002 by the Supreme Court of Canada in \"Sauv\u00e9 v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)\", and all prisoners have been allowed to vote as of the 2004 Canadian federal election.\nResidency.\nUnder certain electoral systems elections are held within subnational jurisdictions, thus preventing persons from voting who would otherwise be eligible on the basis that they do not reside within such a jurisdiction, or because they live in an area that cannot participate. In the United States, license plates in Washington, D.C. read \"TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION,\" in reference to the district not holding a seat in either the House of Representatives or Senate, however residents can vote in presidential elections based on the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution adopted in 1961. Residents of Puerto Rico enjoy neither.\nSometimes citizens become ineligible to vote because they are no longer resident in their country of citizenship. For example, Australian citizens who have been outside Australia for more than one and fewer than six years may excuse themselves from the requirement to vote in Australian elections while they remain outside Australia (voting in Australia is compulsory for resident citizens).\nDanish citizens that reside permanently outside Denmark lose their right to vote.\nIn some cases, a certain period of residence in a locality may required for the right to vote in that location. For example, in the United Kingdom up to 2001, each 15 February a new electoral register came into effect, based on registration as of the previous 10 October, with the effect of limiting voting to those resident five to seventeen months earlier depending on the timing of the election.\nNationality.\nIn most countries, suffrage is limited to citizens and, in many cases, permanent residents of that country. However, some members of supra-national organisations such as the Commonwealth of Nations and the European Union have granted voting rights to citizens of all countries within that organisation. Until the mid-twentieth century, many Commonwealth countries gave the vote to all British citizens within the country, regardless of whether they were normally resident there. In most cases this was because there was no distinction between British and local citizenship. Several countries qualified this with restrictions preventing non-white British citizens such as Indians and British Africans from voting. Under European Union law, citizens of European Union countries can vote in each other's local and European Parliament elections on the same basis as citizens of the country in question, but usually not in national elections.\nNaturalization.\nIn some countries, naturalized citizens do not have the right to vote or to be a candidate, either permanently or for a determined period.\nArticle 5 of the 1831 Belgian Constitution made a difference between ordinary naturalization, and \"grande naturalisation\". Only (former) foreigners who had been granted \"grande naturalisation\" were entitled to vote, be a candidate for parliamentary elections, or be appointed minister. However, ordinary naturalized citizens could vote for municipal elections. Ordinary naturalized citizens and citizens who had acquired Belgian nationality through marriage could vote, but not run as candidates for parliamentary elections in 1976. The concepts of ordinary and grande naturalization were suppressed from the Constitution in 1991.\nIn France, the 1889 Nationality Law barred those who had acquired the French nationality by naturalization or marriage from voting, and from eligibility and access to several public jobs. In 1938 the delay was reduced to five years. These instances of discrimination, as well as others against naturalized citizens, were gradually abolished in 1973 (9 January 1973 law) and 1983.\nIn Morocco, a former French protectorate, and in Guinea, a former French colony, naturalized citizens are prohibited from voting for five years following their naturalization.\nIn the Federated States of Micronesia, one must be a Micronesian citizen for at least 15 years to run for parliament.\nIn Nicaragua, Peru and the Philippines, only citizens by birth are eligible for being elected to the national legislature; naturalized citizens enjoy only voting rights.\nIn Uruguay, naturalized citizens have the right of eligibility to the parliament after five years.\nIn the United States, the President and Vice President must be natural-born citizens. All other governmental offices may be held by any citizen, although citizens may only run for Congress after an extended period of citizenship (seven years for the House of Representatives and nine for the Senate).\nFunction.\nIn France, an 1872 law, rescinded by a 1945 decree, prohibited all army personnel from voting.\nIn Ireland, police (the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and, before 1925, the Dublin Metropolitan Police) were barred from voting in national elections, though not local elections, from 1923 to 1960.\nThe 1876 Constitution of Texas (article VI, section 1) stated that \"The following classes of persons shall not be allowed to vote in this State, to wit: (...) Fifth\u2014All soldiers, marines and seamen, employed in the service of the army or navy of the United States.\"\nIn many countries with a presidential system of government a person is forbidden to be a legislator and an official of the executive branch at the same time. Such provisions are found, for example, in Article I of the U.S. Constitution.\nHistory around the world.\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union has given the right to vote in municipal elections to the citizen of another EU country by the Council Directive 94/80/EG from 19 December 1994.\nIndia.\nSince the very first Indian general election held in 1951\u201352, universal suffrage for all adult citizens aged 21 or older was established under Article 326 of the Constitution of India. The minimum voting age was reduced to 18 years by the 61st Amendment, effective 28 March 1989.\nItaly.\nThe Supreme Court states that \"the rules derogating from the passive electoral law must be strictly interpreted\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nFrom 1265, a few percent of the adult male population in the Kingdom of England (of which Wales was a full and equal member from 1542) were able to vote in parliamentary elections that occurred at irregular intervals to the Parliament of England. The franchise for the Parliament of Scotland developed separately. King Henry VI of England established in 1432 that only owners of property worth at least forty shillings, a significant sum, were entitled to vote in an English county constituency. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute. Changes were made to the details of the system, but there was no major reform until the Reform Act 1832. A series of Reform Acts and Representation of the People Acts followed. In 1918, all men over 21 and some women over 30 won the right to vote, and in 1928 all women over 21 won the right to vote resulting in universal suffrage.\nUnited States.\nThe Constitution of the United States did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to decide this status. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only white male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population). By 1856 property ownership requirements were eliminated in all states, giving suffrage to most white men. However, tax-paying requirements remained in five states until 1860 and in two states until the 20th century.\nSince the Civil War, five amendments to the Constitution have limited the ways in which the right to vote may be restricted in American elections, though none have added a general right to vote.\nThe use of grandfather clauses to allow European-Americans to vote while excluding African-Americans from voting was ruled unconstitutional in the 1915 decision \"Guinn v. United States\". States continued to use literacy tests and poll taxes, which also disenfranchised poor white citizens. Racial equality in voting was substantially secured after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a major victory in the Civil Rights Movement. State elections, it was not until the 1966 decision \"Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections\" that the U.S. Supreme Court declared state poll taxes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The language \"The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation\" is used, with slight variations, in Amendments XIII, XIV, XV, XIX, XXIII, XXIV, and XXVI. \nThe variations in the pertinent language are as follows: \nInitial creation and use.\nThese provisions made their first appearance in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which were adopted during the Reconstruction period primarily to abolish slavery and protect the rights of the newly emancipated African-Americans. The enforcement provisions contained in these amendments extend the powers of Congress originally enumerated in Article One, Section 8 of the Constitution, and have the effect of increasing the power of Congress and diminishing that of the individual states. They led to the \"Enforcement Acts\" of 1870 and 1871. Congress had only that power delegated (granted, given) to it by the Constitution.\nUse in the courts.\nInterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment's enforcement provision has been the subject of several important Supreme Court cases, which reflect the tension between the Courts' role of interpreting the Constitution and Congress's power of adopting legislation to enforce specific Constitutional amendments.\nEarly on, in the \"Civil Rights Cases\" decided in 1883, the Supreme Court concluded that the Congressional enforcement power in Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment did not authorize Congress to use the Privileges or Immunities Clause of that amendment to ban racial discrimination in public accommodations operated by private persons, such as inns and theaters. The Court stated that since the Fourteenth Amendment only restricted state action, Congress lacked power under this amendment to forbid discrimination that was not sponsored by the state. This ruling has not been overturned, although in modern times, similar civil rights legislation has been upheld under Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce under Article One, Section 8 of the Constitution. See Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nIn the \"Katzenbach v. Morgan\" case, decided in 1966, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress can forbid practices that are not themselves unconstitutional, if the law is aimed at preventing or remedying constitutional violations. On that basis, the Court upheld a provision of the Voting Rights Act that prevented states from using English language literacy tests as qualifications for voting. The Court decided that the law was a valid exercise of Congress's enforcement power under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it was aimed at remedying state-sponsored discrimination, despite an earlier court finding that a literacy test was not in and of itself a violation of the 14th Amendment.\nIn 1970, however, in \"Oregon v. Mitchell\", the Court held that Congress had exceeded its power by attempting to require the states to reduce the voting age to 18. This led to adoption of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the Constitution in 1971, which provided that the states could not set a minimum voting age higher than 18.\nIn the 1997 case of \"City of Boerne v. Flores\", the Court again took a narrow view of the Congressional power of enforcement, striking down a provision of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) that sought to forbid the states from placing burdens on religious practice in the absence of a compelling state interest in doing so. In enacting RFRA, Congress had sought to overturn the 1988 Supreme Court decision in \"Employment Division v. Smith\", which had held that the Constitution does not require states to recognize religious exemptions to laws of general applicability. In the \"Boerne\" case, the Supreme Court decided that RFRA overstepped Congress's authority, because the statute was not sufficiently connected to the goal of remedying a constitutional violation, but instead created new rights that are not guaranteed by the Constitution. Some observers have suggested that the Supreme Court saw RFRA as a threat to the Court's institutional power and an incursion on its role as final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution, because that statute was aimed specifically at overturning the \"Employment Division v. Smith\" decision. However, the effect of \"Boerne\" lasted beyond \"Boerne\" itself. The standard announced in that case\u2014that all legislation enacted under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment must be \"congruent and proportional\" to the unconstitutional harm it seeks to remedy\u2014has been followed by every post-\"Boerne\" decision on legislation that sought to abrogate the states' sovereign immunity. \n\"United States v. Morrison\", decided in 2000, is one controversial successor case. In that case, the Supreme Court, applying the congruent-and-proportional \"Boerne\" test, overturned provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which created federal civil jurisdiction over gender-based violence. The Court held that Congress did not have the power to enact a remedy targeting private action rather than state action, and that it could not enact a Section 5 remedy without findings of national, or near-national, harm.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Direct Connect clients connect to a central hub and can download files directly from one another. Advanced Direct Connect can be considered a successor protocol.\nHubs feature a list of clients or users connected to them. Users can search for files and download them from other clients, as well as chat with other users.\nHistory.\nNeoModus was started as a company funded by the adware \"Direct Connect\" by Jon Hess in November, 1999 while he was in high school.\nThe first third-party client was called \"DClite\", which never fully supported the file sharing aspects of the protocol. Hess released a new version of Direct Connect, requiring a simple encryption key to initiate a connection, locking out third-party clients. The encryption key was cracked, and the author of DClite released a new version of DClite compatible with the new software from NeoModus. Some time after, DClite was rewritten as Open Direct Connect with the purpose of having an MDI user interface and using plug-ins for file sharing protocols (similar to MLDonkey). Open Direct Connect also did not have complete support for the full file sharing aspects of the protocol, but a port to Java, however, did. Later on, other clients such as DCTC (Direct Connect Text Client) and DC++ became popular.\nThe DCDev archive contains discussions of protocol changes for development of DC in the years 2003\u20132005.\nProtocol.\nThe Direct Connect protocol is a text-based computer protocol, in which commands and their information are sent in clear text, without encryption in original NeoModus software (encryption is available as a protocol extension). Clients connect to a central server acting as a \"hub\". This hub provides content discovery and allows clients to negotiate direct connections with each other for transferring content. Since this central hub only deals with metadata, it does not have anywhere near the same bandwidth requirements as if it also had been serving the content itself; an estimate shows that handling 1000 users would require about 2.5 mbit/s of bandwidth.\nThere is no official specification of the protocol, meaning that every client and hub (besides the original NeoModus client and hub) has been forced to reverse engineer the information. As such, any protocol specification this article may reference is likely inaccurate and/or incomplete.\nThe client-server (as well as client-client, where one client acts as \"server\") aspect of the protocol stipulates that the server respond first when a connection is being made. For example, when a client connects to a hub's socket, the hub is first to respond to the client.\nThe protocol lacks a specified default character encoding for clients or hubs. The original client and hub use ASCII encoding instead of that of the Operating system. This allows migration to UTF-8 encoding in newer software.\nPort 411 is the default port for hubs, and 412 for client-to-client connections. If either of these ports is already in use, the port number is incremented until the number of a free port is found for use. For example, if 411, 412 and 413 are in use, then port 414 will be used.\nHub addresses are in the following form: dchub://example.com[:411], where 411 is an optional port.\nThere is no global identification scheme; instead, users are identified with their nickname on a hub-to-hub basis.\nAn incoming request for a client-client connection cannot be linked with an actual connection.\nA search result cannot be linked with a particular search.\nThe ability to kick or move (redirect) a user to another hub is supported by the protocol. If a user is kicked, the hub is not required to give that user a specific reason, and there is no restriction on where a user can be redirected to. However, if another client in power instructs the hub to kick, that client may send out a notification message before doing so. Redirecting a user must be accompanied by a reason. There is no HTTP referer equivalent.\nHubs may send out user commands to clients. These commands are only raw protocol commands and are used mostly for making a particular task simpler. For example, the hub cannot send a user command that will trigger the default browser to visit a website. It can, however, add the command \"+rules\" (where '+' indicates to the hub that it's a command - this may vary) to display the hub's rules.\nThe peer-to-peer part of the protocol is based on a concept of \"slots\" (similar to number of open positions for a job). These slots denote the number of people that are allowed to download from a user at any given time and are controlled by the client.\nIn client-to-client connections, the parties generate a random number to see who should be allowed to download first, and the client with the greater number wins.\nTransporting downloads and connecting to the hub requires TCP, while active searches use UDP.\nThere are two kinds of modes a user can be in: either \"active\" or \"passive\" mode. Clients using active mode can download from anyone else on the network, while clients using passive mode users can only download from active users. In NeoModus Direct Connect, passive mode users receive other passive mode users' search results, but the user will not be able to download anything. In DC++, users will not receive those search results. In NeoModus Direct Connect, all users will be sent at most five search results per query. If a user has searched, DC++ will respond with ten search results when the user is in active mode and five when the user is in passive mode. Passive clients will be sent search results through the hub, while active clients will receive the results directly.\nProtocol delimiters are \"$\", \"|\", and . Protocol have for them (and few others) escape sequence and most software use them correctly in login \n(Lock to Key) sequence. For some reason that escape sequence was ignored by DC++ developers and they use HTML equivalent if these characters are to be viewed by the user.\nContinued interest exists in features such as ratings and language packs. The authors of DC++ also proposed a complete replacement of the Direct Connect protocol called ADC, or unofficially, Advanced Direct Connect. ADC uses the same network topology, concepts, and terminology as the original protocol.\nOne example of an added feature to the protocol, in comparison with the original protocol, is the broadcasting of Tiger-Tree Hashing of shared files (TTH). The advantages of this include verifying that a file is downloaded correctly, and the ability to find files independently of their names.\nDirect Connect used for DDoS attacks.\nAs the protocol allows hubs to redirect users to other hubs, malicious hubs have redirected users to places other than real Direct Connect hubs, effectively causing a Distributed Denial of Service attack. The hubs may alter the IP in client to client connections, pointing to a potential victim.\nThe CTM Exploit surfaced in 2006\u20132007, during which period the whole Direct Connect network suffered from DDoS attacks. The situation prompted developers to take security issues more seriously.\nAs of February 2009, an extension for clients was proposed in order for the attacked party to find out the hub sending the connecting users.\nDirect Connect Network Foundation.\nThe Direct Connect Network Foundation (DCNF) is a non-profit organization registered in Sweden that aims to improve the DC network by improving software, protocols and other services in the network.\nArticles and papers.\nThe DCNF maintains a list of articles, papers and more documentation that relate to DC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70345", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70345", "title": "Shareaza", "text": "Peer-to-peer file sharing application\nShareaza is a peer-to-peer file sharing client running under Microsoft Windows which supports the Gnutella, Gnutella2 (G2), eDonkey, BitTorrent, FTP, HTTP and HTTPS network protocols and handles magnet links, ed2k links, and the now deprecated gnutella and Piolet links. It is available in 30 languages.\nShareaza was developed by Michael Stokes until June 1, 2004, and has since been maintained by a group of volunteers. On June 1, 2004, Shareaza 2.0 was released, along with the source code, under the GNU General Public License (GPL-2.0-or-later), making it free software.\nFeatures.\nMulti-network.\nShareaza can connect to Gnutella, G2, eDonkey and BitTorrent. Shareaza hashes its files for all networks, and then distributes those hash values on G2. This allows Shareaza to download one file from several networks at once. When another client connected to G2 finds such a file, it is given the hash values for all networks and can search on the other networks with their respective hash values, which increases the number of sources and the download speed of the file. Shareaza also uses its G2 network to find more sources for torrents.\nSecurity filter.\nThe Shareaza client has some basic content filters including a forced child and optional adult pornography filter, and some other optional filters such as a filter for files encumbered with Digital rights management (DRM). Shareaza's security filters can also be extended with user-defined keywords and/or IP addresses. Later versions of Shareaza allow for the use of regular expressions and filtering by hash. These filters increase the chances of getting the files the user wants and decrease the chance of getting malicious or fake files. The file format used for the filters is an extendable XML schema. The filters are editable inside Shareaza, and can be exported from the application to be shared with others.\nPlugins.\nShareaza implements a framework for additional plugins. The Shareaza installer ships several plugins. Most of them are used to read and strip off built in metadata from the files being hashed and convert it to an external XML based format, or to decode multimedia files for making a preview for other G2 clients. Some others serve the need of a media player inside Shareaza, and enhancements of that media player. Third party plugins can also be used, for example, \"Sharemonkey\", which will add a link inside Shareaza when downloading or searching copyrighted material from where it can be legally downloaded.\nSkins.\nThe client can have almost all parts of the GUI skinned. This includes bars, icons, as well as backgrounds and buttons. In that way, Shareaza can be completely changed with colors, images, new buttons, etc. A basic list of skins is contained in the Shareaza installer package. Other skins can be downloaded in the community forums or found via a search for .sks (Shareaza skin files) in the G2 network. The skins are zip archives, renamed with the extension .sks, containing icons and images, as well as an XML file which binds the images and colors with the GUI.\nThis feature is also used for localization. The language files are XML files, like the normal skins, but not zipped. The XML file contains the translations for a certain part of the program. This enables languages to be easily changed, updated and tested without compiling an entire binary.\nModes.\nShareaza has three user modes. The first one is for normal users. This mode is the default mode and provides a clean, trimmed GUI. Users will not be able to make major changes to settings in this mode but will be able to make use of the most essential functions, like searching and downloading. The second mode is for power users. It provides more access to network and advanced settings but can also break your connection to the networks. The third mode is the windowed mode. In this mode, users can see different tabs (windows) simultaneously, providing a lot of control about the things happening. This mode also makes it possible to personalize the look of the client to perfectly fit the needs of the respective user.\nIRC.\nShareaza contains a built-in IRC (chat) client which allows users to communicate with each other. There are channels in several languages for support and help. These channels are located on the http:// and can also be joined by any normal IRC client or via a Java addon on the Shareaza homepage.\nHistory.\nIn mid-2002 Stokes released the first version of a gnutella client he had written and dubbed \"Shareaza\". It was from the beginning a client with the aim of having features other gnutella clients did not have. Over the next two years Stokes coded in support for the eDonkey 2000 network, BitTorrent and a rewritten gnutella-based protocol which he named Gnutella2.\nOn June 1, 2004 Stokes released the Shareaza source code under the GPL-2.0-or-later license (which coincided with the release of Shareaza version 2.0). Shareaza joined LimeWire, Gnucleus, and others as an open-source client on the Gnutella network.\nSince the beginning Shareaza was advertised as \"completely free. No ads, no spyware, no guilting you to upgrade to a commercial version\", stating that the developers \"[couldn't] stand that kind of crap.\" It has remained as such in each subsequent release.\nFrom the first version Shareaza has supported swarming, metadata, library management, and automatic file hashing.\nDomain takeover.\nOn 19 December 2007 the project's domain name, shareaza.com, was redirected to a site claiming to be \"The Official Home of Shareaza\", promoting the download of a client known as Shareaza V4 (which had become V6 in October 2009, V7 in August 2010, and V8 in November 2011[ [update]]) unrelated to releases by the Shareaza development team, an iMesh clone with only small graphical modifications, and using Shareaza v1 logo. The domain owner Jon Nilson was forced to sell it as a part of a settlement with \"La Societe Des Producteurs De Phonogrammes En France\". This client is a network interface for a centralised music shop by Discordia Ltd. and does not connect to any open P2P network such as Gnutella, G2, eDonkey or BitTorrent. Content is limited to the DRM-protected music that can be bought in Discordia's online music store; Discordia is a company based in Cyprus, closely related to the RIAA and unrelated to the Shareaza development team. In response the Shareaza development team moved their website to SourceForge.\nVersions prior to 2.3.1.0 of the original Shareaza connected to www.shareaza.com to check for software updates. From 1 January 2008 the new owner of the domain shareaza.com, Discordia Ltd. used this update check mechanism to suggest to users that ShareazaV4 (and later ShareazaV5, V6, and V7) was an update to the original Shareaza client. Since version 2.3.1.0, released on 3 January 2008, the original Shareaza has linked to the Shareaza pages at sourceforge.net.\nTrademark registration by iMesh.\nOn January 10, 2008, the new owners of Shareaza.com, Discordia Ltd (iMesh Inc.), filed for trademark registration of the Shareaza name in an attempt to stop the original developers from using the name, claiming that the first-ever use was on December 17, 2007. The Shareaza Development Team obtained legal representation to challenge the registration and a legal defense fund was set up. The development team appointed William Erwin to handle the donations; it was stated that he had been paid by iMesh to sabotage the defense, and that he had stolen the money donated. The trademark was awarded to iMesh after the development team had given up defending the trademark.\nVersion history.\nRelease notes for all versions from 2.0.0.0 are linked from the Sharaza ChangeLog page.\nv2.3.1.0\nVersion 2.3.1.0 is the last stable version of Shareaza that supports Windows 9x. It followed 2 days after the new owners of the project domain exploited the updating mechanism to emit a false update message to trick users into installing their fake Shareaza V4 client and contained a fix for this issue.\nv2.4.0.0\nVersion 2.4.0.0 of Shareaza was released on October 1, 2008, with many bug fixes and major changes to provide better stability of the client. It was the first stable release to include IRC support. Furthermore, major changes to the torrent handling mechanism were made and Windows 98/Me support was discontinued (the last version working on Windows 9x is 2.3.1.0).\nWhen v2.4 was released the roadmap for the next version (2.4.1.0, a v2.5 release candidate) was set for release around October 1, 2009, to be followed by 2.5.0.0 a month later.\nv2.5.x.0\nVersion 2.5.0.0 of Shareaza was released on October 31, 2009. It was significantly more stable and less resource-consuming than earlier versions, and further improved BitTorrent support, such as by selective downloading of files contained in batch torrents and download prioritization. There were also updates to the Gnutella and eD2k implementation, such as extended support for GGEP, large files and chat. The IRC implementation of v2.4.0.0 was reworked to free it of the bugs that made it partially unusable in the previous version. Download manager capabilities were extended, Internet Explorer integration added, and \"BugTrap\" included to speed up and simplify reporting crashes.\nVersion 2.5.1.0 of Shareaza was released on December 1, 2009. It was significantly more stable and more functional than its predecessor due to fixed bugs. It improved usability and compatibility of BitTorrent according to most popular service suggestions. It made use of and required the SSE instruction set, and thus required at least a Pentium-III or an Athlon-XP processor.\nVersion 2.5.2.0 of Shareaza was released on February 6, 2010. It brought further improvements on stability. This and later versions were available optionally either as an SSE or non-SSE build to allow the use of older processors, unlike the SSE-only version 2.5.1.0. For this and later releases the SSE-optimized build uses SSE2 and requires at least a Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64.\nShareaza v2.5.3.0, released on June 13, 2010, focused on internal changes and optimizations; the only significant addition was a scheduler that allows full control over what the application does at a given time while running unattended.\nShareaza v2.5.4.0, released on February 12, 2011, improved UPnP support and added limited DC++ support. \u03bcTorrent-compatible peer exchange and tracker exchange for BitTorrent were also added. It fixed remaining IRC chat bugs and a lot of rather uncommon/rarely seen crashes.\nShareaza v2.5.5.0, released on May 29, 2011, further improved UPnP support and included DC++ and Gnutella updates, enhanced anti-spam protection during searches, and multi-file download merging.\nV2.6.0.0 was released on 3 June 2012, adding support for BitTorrent (Mainline) DHT and UDP trackers as well as containing interface optimizations for Windows 7.\nShareaza 2.7.0.0 was made available on 31 August 2013, with a great many bugfixes. It contained major improvements to the BitTorrent support, eDonkey uploading and the built-in media player. It was followed by further V2.7.x.x releases.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is England's northernmost city and metropolitan borough, located on the River Tyne's northern bank opposite Gateshead to the south. It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England. The metropolitan borough had an estimated population of 320,605 in 2024.\nNewcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as \"Monkchester\" before taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. It was one of the world's largest ship building and repair centres during the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, but governed as a county corporate after 1400. In 1974, Newcastle became part of the newly created metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The local authority is Newcastle City Council, which is a constituent member of the North East Combined Authority.\nHistory.\nRoman era.\nThe first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius (\"Aelian bridge\"), a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius then is estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian's Wall are visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the \"Roman Wall\" can be traced eastwards to Segedunum, a Roman fort in Wallsend \u2013 the \"wall's end\" \u2013 and to the separate supply fort of Arbeia in South Shields, across the river from Hadrian's Wall.\nThe extent of Hadrian's Wall was , spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a major invasion. However, it seems that the Vallum stopped just west of Newcastle, where its role as a secondary line of defence was performed by the River Tyne.\nAnglo-Saxon and Norman eras.\nAfter the Roman departure from Britain, completed in 410, Newcastle became part of the powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, and was known throughout this period as \"Munucceaster\" (sometimes modernised as \"Monkchester\").\nConflicts with the Danes in 876 left the settlements along the River Tyne in ruins. After the conflicts with the Danes, and following the 1088 rebellion against the Normans, Monkchester was all but destroyed by Odo of Bayeux.\nBecause of its strategic position, Robert Curthose, son of William the Conqueror, erected a wooden castle there in the year 1080. The town was henceforth known as \"Novum Castellum\" or \"New Castle\". The wooden structure was replaced by a stone castle in 1087. The castle was rebuilt again in 1172 during the reign of Henry II. Much of the keep which can be seen in the city today dates from this period.\nMiddle Ages.\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress. In 1400 Newcastle was separated from Northumberland for administrative purposes and made a county of itself by Henry IV. Newcastle was given the title of the county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne. The town had a new charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1589. A stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century.\n16th to 19th centuries.\nFrom 1530, a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen. This monopoly, which lasted for a considerable time, helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town. The phrase \"taking coals to Newcastle\" was first recorded contextually in 1538. The phrase itself means a pointless pursuit. In the 18th century, the American entrepreneur Timothy Dexter, regarded as an eccentric, defied this idiom. He was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to Newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him; however, his shipment arrived on the Tyne during a strike that had crippled local production, allowing him to turn a considerable profit.\nIn the Sandgate area, to the east of the city, and beside the river, resided the close-knit community of keelmen and their families. They were so called because they worked on the keels, boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers, for export to London and elsewhere. In the 1630s, about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, more than one-third of the population. Specifically within the year 1636, it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the Society of Antiquaries that 47% of the then population of Newcastle died from the epidemic; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any British city in this period.\nDuring the English Civil War, the North declared for the King. In a bid to gain Newcastle and the Tyne, Cromwell's allies, the Scots, captured the town of Newburn. In 1644, the Scots then captured the reinforced fortification on the Lawe in South Shields following a siege and the city was besieged for many months. It was eventually stormed (\"with roaring drummes\") and sacked by Cromwell's allies. The grateful King bestowed the motto (\"Triumphing by a brave defence\") upon the town. Charles I was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646\u201347.\nAfter the Union in 1707, the City walls became obsolete, and gave way to an expansion of the city. Despite the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, fortifications gave way to industrial development. \nThe extraction and processing of coal and iron created a series of specialised industries, such as steel manufacture and eventually steam power.\nNewcastle also became a glass producer with a reputation for brilliant flint glass. Glass was key in the industrial development of the Tyne and Wear region.\nNewcastle opened its first lunatic asylum in 1767. The asylum catered for people from the counties of Newcastle, Durham and Northumberland.\nThe Newcastle Eccentrics of the 19th century were a group of unrelated people who lived in and around the centre of Newcastle and its Quayside between the end of the 18th and early/mid 19th century. They are depicted in a painting by Henry Perlee Parker.\nNewcastle was the country's fourth largest print centre after London, Oxford and Cambridge, and the Literary and Philosophical Society of 1793, with its erudite debates and large stock of books in several languages, predated the London Library by half a century. Some founder members of the Literary and Philosophical Society were abolitionists. \nA permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of Fenham Barracks in 1806.\nThe great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead was a tragic and spectacular series of events starting on Friday 6 October 1854, in which a substantial amount of property in the two North East of England towns was destroyed in a series of fires and an explosion which killed 53 and injured hundreds.\nThe status of city was granted to Newcastle on 3 June 1882. In the 19th century, shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to the city's prosperity; and the city was a powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution. This revolution resulted in the urbanisation of the city. In 1817 the Maling company, at one time the largest pottery company in the world, moved to the city. The Victorian industrial revolution brought industrial structures that included the Victoria Tunnel, built in 1842, which provided underground wagon ways to the staithes. On 3 February 1879, Mosley Street in the city, was the first public road in the world to be lit up by the incandescent lightbulb. Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting. \nInnovations in Newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of safety lamps, Stephenson's Rocket, Lord Armstrong's artillery, Be-Ro flour, Lucozade, Joseph Swan's electric light bulbs, and Charles Parsons' invention of the steam turbine, which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity. In 1882, Newcastle became the seat of an Anglican diocese, with St. Nicholas' Church becoming its cathedral.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nNewcastle's public transport system was modernised in 1901 when Newcastle Corporation Tramways electric trams were introduced to the city's streets, though these were replaced gradually by trolley buses from 1935, with the tram service finally coming to an end in 1950.\nThe city acquired its first art gallery, the Laing Art Gallery in 1904, so named after its founder Alexander Laing, a Scottish wine and spirit merchant who wanted to give something back to the city in which he had made his fortune. Another art gallery, the Hatton Gallery (now part of Newcastle University), opened in 1925.\nWith the advent of the motor car, Newcastle's road network was improved in the early part of the 20th century, beginning with the opening of the Redheugh road bridge in 1901 and the Tyne Bridge in 1928.\nEfforts to preserve the city's historic past were evident as long ago as 1934, when the Museum of Science and Industry opened, as did the in the same year.\nCouncil housing began to replace inner-city slums in the 1920s, and the process continued into the 1970s, along with substantial private house building and acquisitions.\nUnemployment hit record heights in Newcastle during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nThe city's last coal pit closed in 1956, though a temporary open cast mine was opened in 2013. The temporary open cast mine shifted 40,000 tonnes of coal, using modern techniques to reduce noise, on a part of the City undergoing redevelopment. The slow demise of the shipyards on the banks of the River Tyne happened in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\nDuring the Second World War, the city and surrounding area were a target for air raids as heavy industry was involved in the production of ships and armaments. The raids caused 141 deaths and 587 injuries. A former French consul in Newcastle called Jacques Serre assisted the German war effort by describing important targets in the region to Admiral Raeder who was the head of the German Navy.\nThe public sector in Newcastle began to expand in the 1960s. The federal structure of the University of Durham was dissolved. That university's college in Newcastle, which had been known as King's College, became the University of Newcastle upon Tyne (now known as Newcastle University), which was founded in 1963, followed by Newcastle Polytechnic in 1969; the latter received university status in 1992 and became the University of Northumbria at Newcastle (now known as Northumbria University).\nFurther efforts to preserve the city's historic past continued in the later 20th century, with the opening of Newcastle Military Vehicle Museum in 1983 and Stephenson Railway Museum in 1986. The Military Vehicle museum closed in 2006. New developments at the turn of the 21st century included the Life Science Centre in 2000 and Millennium Bridge in 2001.\nBased at St James' Park since 1886, Newcastle United F.C. became Football League members in 1893. They have won four top division titles (the first in 1905 and the most recent in 1927), six FA Cups (the first in 1910 and the most recent in 1955), the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969 and most recently the League Cup in 2025, their first domestic trophy since 1955. They broke the world transfer record in 1996 by paying \u00a315\u00a0million for Blackburn Rovers and England striker Alan Shearer, one of the most prolific goalscorers of that era.\nIn 2017, Newcastle was the venue for the 2017 Freedom City festival. The 2017 Freedom City festival commemorated the 50 years since Martin Luther King's visit to Newcastle, where King received his honorary degree from Newcastle University. In 2018 Newcastle hosted the Great Exhibition of the North, the largest event in England in 2018. The exhibition began on 22 June with an opening ceremony on the River Tyne, and ended on 9 September with the Great North Run weekend. The exhibition describes the story of the north of England through its innovators, artists, designers and businesses.\nIn 2019, various travel sites named Newcastle to be the friendliest city in the UK.\nGeography.\nSince 1974, Newcastle has been a part of the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear in North East England. The city is located on the north-western bank of the River Tyne, approximately south of the border with Scotland.\nThe ground beneath the city is formed from Carboniferous strata of the Middle Pennine Coal Measures Group \u2014 a suite of sandstones, mudstones and coal seams which generally dip moderately eastwards. To the west of the city are the Upper Pennine Coal Measures and further west again the sandstones and mudstones of the Stainmore Formation, the local equivalent of the Millstone Grit.\nIn large parts, Newcastle still retains a medieval street layout. Narrow alleys or 'chares', most of which can only be traversed by foot, still exist in abundance, particularly around the riverside. Stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant Castle Keep, originally recorded in the 14th century, remain intact in places. Close, Sandhill and Quayside contain modern buildings as well as structures dating from the 15th\u201318th centuries, including Bessie Surtees House, the Cooperage and Lloyds Quayside Bars, Derwentwater House and House of Tides, a restaurant situated at a Grade I-listed 16th century merchant's house at 28\u201330 Close.\nThe city has an extensive neoclassical centre referred to as Tyneside Classical, largely developed in the 1830s by Richard Grainger and John Dobson. More recently, Newcastle architecture considered to be Tyneside classical has been extensively restored. Broadcaster and writer Stuart Maconie described Newcastle as England's best-looking city and the German-born British scholar of architecture, Nikolaus Pevsner, describes Grey Street as one of the finest streets in England. In 1948 the poet John Betjeman said of Grey Street, \"As for the curve of Grey Street, I shall never forget seeing it to perfection, traffic-less on a misty Sunday morning.\" The street curves down from Grey's Monument towards the valley of the River Tyne and was voted England's finest street in 2005 in a survey of BBC Radio 4 listeners. In the Google Street View awards of 2010, Grey Street came 3rd in the British picturesque category. A portion of Grainger Town was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, including all but one side of the original Eldon Square itself.\nImmediately to the north-west of the city centre is Leazes Park, first opened to the public in 1873 after a petition by 3,000 working men of the city for \"ready access to some open ground for the purpose of health and recreation\". Just outside one corner of this is St James' Park, the stadium home of Newcastle United FC which dominates the view of the city from all directions.\nAnother major green space in the city is the Town Moor, lying immediately north of the city centre. It is larger than London's Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath put together and the freemen of the city have the right to graze cattle on it. The right extends to the pitch of St. James' Park, Newcastle United Football Club's ground; this is not exercised, although the Freemen do collect rent for the loss of privilege. Honorary freemen include Bob Geldof, King Harald V of Norway, Bobby Robson, Alan Shearer, the late Nelson Mandela and the Royal Shakespeare Company. The Hoppings funfair, said to be the largest travelling funfair in Europe, is held here annually in June.\nIn the south-eastern corner of the Town Moor is Exhibition Park, which contains the only remaining pavilion from the North East Coast Exhibition of 1929. From the 1970s until 2006 this housed the Newcastle Military Vehicle Museum; which closed in 2006. The pavilion is now being used as a microbrewery and concert venue for Wylam Brewery.\nOuseburn.\nThe wooded gorge of the Ouseburn in the east of the city is known as Jesmond Dene and forms another recreation area, linked by Armstrong Park and Heaton Park to the Ouseburn Valley, where the river finally reaches the River Tyne.\nThe springtime dawn chorus at 55 degrees latitude has been described as one of the best in the world. The dawn chorus of the Jesmond Dene green space has been professionally recorded and has been used in various workplace and hospital rehabilitation facilities.\nQuayside.\nThe area around the Tyne Gorge, between Newcastle on the north bank and Gateshead on the south bank, is the famous Newcastle-Gateshead Quayside. It is famed for its series of dramatic bridges, including the Tyne Bridge of 1928 which was built by Dorman Long of Middlesbrough, Robert Stephenson's High Level Bridge of 1849, the first road/rail bridge in the world, and the Swing Bridge of 1876.\nLarge-scale regeneration efforts have led to the replacement of former shipping premises with modern new office developments; an innovative tilting bridge - the Gateshead Millennium Bridge - integrated the Quayside more closely with the Gateshead Quayside, home to the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art (the venue for the Turner Prize 2011) and the Norman Foster-designed Sage Gateshead music centre. The Newcastle and Gateshead Quaysides are now a thriving, cosmopolitan area with bars, restaurants, hotels and public spaces.\nGrainger Town.\nThe historic heart of Newcastle is the Grainger Town area. Established on classical streets built by Richard Grainger, a builder and developer, between 1835 and 1842, some of Newcastle upon Tyne's finest buildings and streets lie within this area of the city centre including Grainger Market, Theatre Royal, Grey Street, Grainger Street and Clayton Street. These buildings are predominantly four stories high, with vertical dormers, domes, turrets and spikes. Richard Grainger was said to 'have found Newcastle of bricks and timber and left it in stone'. Of Grainger Town's 450 buildings, 244 are listed, of which 29 are grade I and 49 are grade II*.\nGrey's Monument, which commemorates Prime Minister Earl Grey and his Reform Act 1832, stands above Monument Metro Station and was designed and built by Edward Hodges Baily and Benjamin Green. Hodges, who also built Nelson's Column, designed and built the statue, and the monument plinth was designed and built by Benjamin Green.\nThe Grainger Market replaced an earlier market originally built in 1808 called the Butcher Market. The Grainger Market itself, was opened in 1835 and was Newcastle's first indoor market. At the time of its opening in 1835 it was said to be one of the largest and most beautiful markets in Europe. The opening was celebrated with a grand dinner attended by 2000 guests, and the Laing Art Gallery has a painting of this event. With the exception of the timber roof which was destroyed by a fire in 1901 and replaced by latticed-steel arches the Market is largely in its original condition. The Grainger Market architecture, like most in Grainger Town, which are either grade I or II listed, was listed grade I in 1954 by English Heritage.\nThe development of the city in the 1960s saw the demolition of part of Grainger Town as a prelude to the modernist rebuilding initiatives of T. Dan Smith, the leader of Newcastle City Council. A corruption scandal was uncovered involving Smith and John Poulson, a property developer from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and both were imprisoned. Echoes of the scandal were revisited in the late 1990s in the BBC TV mini-series, \"Our Friends in the North\".\nChinatown.\nNewcastle's thriving Chinatown lies in the north-west of Grainger Town, centred on Stowell Street. A new Chinese arch, or \"paifang\", providing a landmark entrance, was handed over to the city with a ceremony in 2005.\nHousing.\nThe Tyneside flat was the dominant housing form constructed at the time when the industrial centres on Tyneside were growing most rapidly. They can still be found in areas such as South Heaton in Newcastle but once dominated the streetscape on both sides of the Tyne. Tyneside flats were built as terraces, one of each pair of doors led to an upstairs flat while the other led into the ground-floor flat, each of two or three rooms. A new development in the Ouseburn valley has recreated them; Architects Cany Ash and Robert Sakula were attracted by the possibilities of high density without building high and getting rid of common areas.\nIn terms of housing stock, the authority is one of few authorities to see the proportion of detached homes rise in the 2010 Census (to 7.8%), in this instance this was coupled with a similar rise in flats and waterside apartments to 25.6%, and the proportion of converted or shared houses in 2011 renders this dwelling type within the highest of the five colour-coded brackets at 5.9%, and on a par with Oxford and Reading, greater than Manchester and Liverpool and below a handful of historic densely occupied, arguably overinflated markets in the local authorities: Harrogate, Cheltenham, Bath, inner London, Hastings, Brighton and Royal Tunbridge Wells.\nSignificant Newcastle housing developments include Ralph Erskine's the Byker Wall designed in the 1960s, and now Grade II* listed. It is on UNESCO's list of outstanding 20th-century buildings. The Byker Redevelopment has won the first Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design in 1988.\nClimate.\nNewcastle has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"). Data in Newcastle was first collected in 1802 by the solicitor James Losh. Situated in the rain shadow of the North Pennines, Newcastle is amongst the driest cities in the UK. Temperature extremes recorded at Newcastle Weather Centre include set in July 2022 down to on 29 December 1995. Newcastle can have cool to cold winters, though usually warmer than the rural areas around it, and the winters are often compensated for by warm summers, with very long daylight hours in the summer months, longer than all other major English cities. Newcastle upon Tyne shares the same latitude as Copenhagen, southern Sweden and Moscow.\nThe nearest weather station to provide sunshine statistics is at Durham, about south of Newcastle City Centre. Durham's inland, less urbanised setting results in night-time temperature data about 1 degree cooler than Newcastle proper throughout the year.\nEnvironment.\nThe city is located within the centre of the North East Green Belt, also known as the Tyne and Wear Green Belt.\nThe green belts stated aims are to:\nThe green belt surrounds Brunswick Village, Dinnington, Callerton, Hazlerigg, Throckley, Walbottle, and Woolsington. Popular locations such as Ryton Island, Tyne Riverside Country Park, the city's golf courses, Newcastle Racecourse, and Newcastle International Airport fall inside the green belt.\nThe city has been recognised for its commitment to environmental issues, with a programme planned for Newcastle to become \"the first carbon neutral city\" however, those plans have been revised and they now hope to be carbon neutral by 2050.\nCulture.\nNightlife.\n\"The Rough Guide to Britain\" placed Newcastle upon Tyne's nightlife as Great Britain's number one tourist attraction. In the Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice Destination Awards for Nightlife destinations, Newcastle was awarded third place in Europe (behind London and Berlin) and seventh place in the world. In July 2023 Newcastle was voted the best city in the UK for food, fashion and nightlife.\nThere are many bars on the Bigg Market and its adjoining streets. Other areas popular for nightlife include Collingwood Street (commonly referred to as the 'Diamond Strip' due to its concentration of high-end bars). Neville Street, the Central Station area, Osborne Road in Jesmond and the wider Ouseburn area are home to a variety of younger metropolitan bars. \"The Gate\", located on Newgate Street, has become a popular venue for late-night entertainment in the past decade and a half. Newcastle's 'pink triangle' is concentrated on Times Square, surrounded by the Centre for Life.\nFood.\nBakery chain Greggs was founded, and is headquartered, in Newcastle and has the greatest number of Greggs stores per capita in the world. Local delicacies include pease pudding and stottie cake.\nIn 1967, London based Smith's Crisps created Salt &amp; Vinegar flavour crisps which were first produced by their Newcastle based subsidiary Tudor Crisps and tested in Tudor's home market of north-east England before being launched nationally.\nIn 2010, Osborne Road in Jesmond was awarded fourth place in the UK Google Street View awards for the \"foodie\" category. Newcastle has its own Chinatown.\nAdditionally, the city has a wide variety of cuisines available including Greek, Mexican, Spanish, Indian, Italian, Persian, Japanese, Malaysian, French, American, Mongolian, Moroccan, Thai, Polish, Vietnamese and Lebanese. There has also been a noticeable growth in Newcastle's gourmet restaurant industry in recent years.\nTheatre.\nThe city has a proud history of theatre. Stephen Kemble of the well-known Kemble family managed the original Theatre Royal, Newcastle for fifteen years (1791\u20131806). He brought members of his famous acting family such as Sarah Siddons and John Kemble out of London to Newcastle. Stephen Kemble guided the theatre through many celebrated seasons. The original Theatre Royal in Newcastle was opened on 21 January 1788 and was located on Mosley Street. It was demolished to make way for Grey Street, where its replacement was built. \nThe city still contains many theatres. The largest, the Theatre Royal on Grey Street, first opened in 1837, designed by John and Benjamin Green. It has hosted a season of performances from the Royal Shakespeare Company for over 25 years, as well as touring productions of West End musicals. The Tyne Theatre and Opera House hosts smaller touring productions, whilst other venues feature local talent.

On Blackett Street can be found the silversmith Reid &amp; Sons which was established in the city in 1788. Outside the city centre, the largest suburban shopping areas are Gosforth and Byker. From 2007, inside Kingston Park, on the edge of Newcastle, the Tesco store was the largest Tesco hypermarket in the UK \u2014 for a period of time.\nClose to Newcastle, the largest indoor shopping centre in Europe, the MetroCentre, is located in Gateshead.\nPopulation.\nAccording to the ONS, Newcastle had a population of 293,000 in 2015. Tyneside (made up of Newcastle and the surrounding metropolitan boroughs of Gateshead, North Tyneside and South Tyneside) has a population of approximately 880,000, making it the eighth most populous urban area in the UK. The wider metropolitan area of Tyneside-Wearside has a population of approximately 1,122,000.\nAdditionally, Newcastle is home to a large temporary population of students from Newcastle and Northumbria universities. Areas of suburban Newcastle with significant student populations include Jesmond, Shieldfield, Gosforth, Sandyford, Spital Tongues and Heaton.\nDemographics.\nAge.\nAccording to the same statistics, the average age of people living in Newcastle is 37.8 years, compared to the national average being of 38.6 years.\nReligion.\nFrom the 2011 Census, two significant religions could be identified in the city: Christian and Muslim. 56.6% of Newcastle identified as Christian and 6.3% as Muslim. Over 28% stated they have no religious affiliation.\nEthnicity and nationality.\nAccording to the 2011 census, the metropolitan borough of Newcastle upon Tyne was predominately white, representing 85.3% of the population (including non-British white). Asians made up 9.8% of the population (2.3% Pakistani, 1.7% 'Bangladeshi', 1.8% 'Indian', 2.2% 'Chinese', 1.8% 'Asian other'). Black people make up a small proportion of the population (1.7% 'Black African', 0.1% 'Black Caribbean' and 0.1% 'Black other'), as do mixed race groups at 1.6% (0.6% 'Asian and White', 0.3% 'White and Caribbean', 0.3% 'White and African', 0.4% 'White and Other'). The last significantly sized ethnic community in Newcastle is 'Arab' at 0.9%. The remainder of the population, 0.5%, represent other ethnicities.\nLarge populations of ethnic minorities can be found in areas such as Elswick, Wingrove and Arthurs Hill.\nAccording to the 2011 UK Census, those born outside the UK were mainly from India (3,315), China (3,272), Pakistan (2,644), Bangladesh (2,276), Poland (1,473), Germany (1,357), Nigeria (1,226), Iran (1,164), Hong Kong (1,038) and Ireland (942).\nIn the North East, Newcastle was the most ethnically diverse district followed by Middlesbrough.\nThere are also small but significant Chinese, Jewish and Eastern European populations. The International Organization for Migration states there are estimated to be between 500 and 2,000 Bolivians in Newcastle, one of the largest populations in any city in the UK.\nGeordies.\nThe regional nickname for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie. The Latin term \"Novocastrian\" can equally be applied to residents of any place called Newcastle, although it is most commonly used for ex-pupils of the city's Royal Grammar School.\nDialect.\nThe dialect of Newcastle is also referred to as Geordie. It contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive words and pronunciations not used in other parts of the United Kingdom. The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule. This language was the forerunner of Modern English; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages\u2014particularly Latin and Norman French\u2014the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language. An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words: \"dead\", \"cow\", \"house\" and \"strong\" are pronounced \"deed\", \"coo\", \"hoos\" and \"strang\"\u2014which is how they were pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon language. Other Geordie words with Anglo-Saxon origins include: \"larn\" (from the Anglo-Saxon \"laeran\", meaning \"teach\"), \"burn\" (\"stream\") and \"gan\" (\"go\").\nAccording to the British Library, \"Locals insist there are significant differences between Geordie and several other local dialects, such as Pitmatic and Mackem. Pitmatic is the dialect of the former mining areas in County Durham and around Ashington to the north of Newcastle upon Tyne, while Mackem is used locally to refer to the dialect of the city of Sunderland and the surrounding urban area of Wearside\".\n\"Bairn\" and \"hyem\", meaning \"child\" and \"home\", respectively, are examples of Geordie words with origins in Scandinavia; \"barn\" and \"hjem\" are the corresponding modern Norwegian and Danish words. Some words used in the Geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the Northern United Kingdom. The words \"bonny\" (meaning \"pretty\") and \"stot\" (\"bounce\") are used in Scots; \"aye\" (\"yes\") and \"nowt\" (IPA:/na\u028at/, rhymes with \"out\", \"nothing\") are used elsewhere in Northern England. Many words, however, appear to be used exclusively in Newcastle and the surrounding area, such as \"canny\" (a versatile word meaning \"good\", \"nice\" or \"very\"), \"hacky\" (\"dirty\"), \"netty\" (\"toilet\"), \"hockle\" (\"spit\").\nHealth.\nAccording to research from 2011, public health and levels of deprivation in Newcastle upon Tyne was generally worse than average in England. As levels of deprivation is considerably higher than the nationwide average, sociologists argue that as a result, the life expectancy for both men and women is lower than the nationwide average. There is significant discrepancy between life expectancies in wealthy areas and deprived areas, with life expectancy up to 14.3 years lower for men and 11.1 years lower for women in deprived areas than in wealthy areas. From 2015 to 2019 Newcastle became relatively more deprived according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation.\nFrom 2001 to 2011, as with all UK cities all-cause mortality rates have fallen, life expectancy has increased. Early death rates from cancer and from heart disease and stroke have fallen but remain worse than the England average.\nAlmost 21.9% of Year 6 children are clinically obese. In 2014/5, 35.9% of 10 to 11-year-olds were classified as overweight or obese, in comparison to a national average of 33.2%. 54.9% of pupils meet the recommendation of at least three hours each week on school sport. Levels of teenage pregnancy are higher than the nationwide average. In 2011, GCSE attainment amongst school children was worse than the England average. Estimated numbers of adults 'healthy eating' are lower than the England average. Rates of smoking-related deaths and hospital stays for alcohol-related harm are higher than average.\nNewcastle remains one of the few major cities in England to supply fluoridated water; this scheme is directed by Northumbria Water plc.\nNewcastle has two large teaching hospitals: the Royal Victoria Infirmary and the Freeman Hospital, which is also a pioneering centre for transplant surgery.\nIn a report, published in early February 2007 by the Ear Institute at the University College London and Widex, Newcastle was named as the noisiest city in the whole of the UK with an average noise level of 80.4 decibels. The report claimed that these noise levels would have a negative long-term impact on the health of the city's residents. The report was criticised, however, for attaching too much weight to readings at arbitrarily selected locations, which in Newcastle's case included a motorway underpass without pedestrian access. As well as numerous parks, open spaces, and extensive riverside areas, puzzlingly the report also overlooked the 1000-acre Town Moor at the heart of the city. Larger than London's Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath combined, and even larger than New York's Central Park, the town moor dates back to the 12th century, with the land tenure and its use being regulated by an Act of Parliament.\nSport.\nThe city has a strong sporting tradition.\nFootball.\nThe Premier League football club, Newcastle United, has been based at St James' Park since the club was established in 1892, although any traces of the original structure are now long gone as the stadium now holds more than 52,000 seated spectators, being England's seventh-largest football stadium. The city also has non-League football clubs, Newcastle Blue Star, Newcastle Benfield, West Allotment Celtic, Team Northumbria and Heaton Stannington.\nThere is a women's football team, Newcastle United Women's Football Club, founded in 1989.\nThe 2012 London Olympic committee selected Newcastle as one of the UK host venue cities, with the stadium St James' Park hosting nine matches in both the men's and women's football.\nAthletics.\nNewcastle hosts the start of the annual Great North Run, the world's largest half-marathon in which participants race over the Tyne Bridge into Gateshead and then towards the finish line away on the coast at South Shields. Another athletic event is the Blaydon Race (a road race from Newcastle to Blaydon), which has taken place on 9 June annually since 1981, to commemorate the celebrated Blaydon Races horse racing.\nRugby union.\nThe Newcastle Red Bulls are the only rugby union team in North East England to have played in the Premiership. They play at Kingston Park Stadium in the northern suburb of Kingston Park. 1996 Pilkington Shield winners Medicals RFC are also based in Newcastle.\nNewcastle upon Tyne was one of the 11 host cities for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. St James' Park hosted three matches;\nRugby league.\nNewcastle Thunder (formerly Gateshead Thunder) are a professional rugby league club based in the city who now also play at Kingston Park Stadium. They currently play in the Kingstone Press League 1. Since 2015, the Super League Magic Weekend has been played annually in the city at St James' Park.\nCricket.\nThere are a number of cricket clubs in the area including Newcastle Cricket Club, Newcastle City, South Northumberland, Blagdon Park, Benwell Hill, Benwell &amp; Walbottle, Cowgate, Kirkley, Seaton Burn and United Stars.\nHockey.\nThere are a number of hockey clubs in the city that compete in the Women's England Hockey League, the Yorkshire and North East Hockey League and the BUCS league. These include Newcastle Hockey Club, Newcastle Medics Hockey Club, Newcastle University Hockey Club and Northumbria University Hockey Club.\nHorse racing.\nNewcastle has a horse racing course at Gosforth Park.\nBasketball.\nThe city is home to the Newcastle Eagles professional basketball team who play their home games at the Vertu Motors Arena, having previously hosted their home games at Sport Central, a sports venue belonging to Northumbria University. The Eagles are the most successful team in the history of the British Basketball League (BBL).\nMotorsports.\nThe city's speedway team Newcastle Diamonds were based at Brough Park in Byker, a venue that is also home to greyhound racing.\nIce hockey.\nThe Newcastle Warriors were a professional ice hockey team that played the 1995\u201396 season in the British Hockey League. The Newcastle Vipers were also a professional ice hockey team in the British National League from 2002 and then the Elite Ice Hockey League between 2005 and 2011 (when the team folded).\nTransport.\nAir.\nNewcastle International Airport is situated on the northern outskirts of the city at Woolsington, near to Ponteland. It is the largest and busiest airport in North East England and the second largest and busiest in Northern England (behind Manchester), handling over five million passengers per year. As of 2007[ [update]], Newcastle Airport operated flights to 90 destinations worldwide.\nThe airport is serviced by numerous airlines including British Airways, Jet2, easyJet, Emirates, Ryanair, Air France, TUI Airways, Loganair, KLM and Eurowings.\nThe airport is connected to Central Newcastle by the Tyne and Wear Metro, with an average journey between Central Station Metro station and Newcastle Airport Metro station taking approximately 20 minutes.\nRail.\nNewcastle Central Station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line and Cross Country Route.\nTrain operator London North Eastern Railway provides a half-hourly frequency of trains to London King's Cross, with a variable journey time of between two and three hours, and north to Scotland with all trains calling at Edinburgh Waverley and a small number of trains extended to Glasgow Central, Aberdeen and Inverness. CrossCountry links Newcastle with destinations in Yorkshire, the Midlands and the South West. TransPennine Express operates services to the North West. Northern Trains provide local and regional services.\nIn 2014, work was completed on refurbishing the station's historic entrance. \nGlazing was placed over the historic arches and the Victorian architecture was enhanced; transforming the 19th century public portico. The station is one of only six Grade One listed railway stations in the UK. Opened in 1850 by Queen Victoria, it was the first covered railway station in the world and was much copied across the UK. It has a neoclassical fa\u00e7ade, originally designed by the architect John Dobson, and was constructed in collaboration with Robert Stephenson. The station sightlines towards the Castle Keep, whilst showcasing the curvature of the station's arched roof. The first services were operated by the North Eastern Railway company.\nThe other mainline station in Newcastle is Manors, exclusively served by Northern Trains.\nMetro.\nThe city is served by the Tyne and Wear Metro, a system of suburban and underground railways covering much of Newcastle and the surrounding metropolitan boroughs. It was opened in five phases between 1980 and 1984, and was Britain's first urban light rail transit system. The network was developed from a combination of existing and newly built tracks and stations, with deep-level tunnels constructed through Central Newcastle. A bridge was built across the Tyne, between Newcastle and Gateshead, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981. Extensions to the network were opened in 1991 and 2002. It is operated directly by Nexus, carrying over 37\u00a0million passengers a year. In 2004, the company Marconi designed and constructed the mobile radio system to the underground Metro system. The Metro system was the first in the UK to have mobile phone antennae installed in the tunnels.\nThe Metro consists of two lines. The Green line begins at Newcastle Airport, goes through Central Newcastle and into the City of Sunderland, terminating at South Hylton. The yellow line starts at St James, runs north of the river alongside Byker towards Whitley Bay, before returning to Central Newcastle, then connecting to Gateshead Interchange before finally terminating at South Shields.\nThe system is currently undergoing a period of refurbishment and modernisation, entitled 'Metro: All Change.' The programme has replaced all ticket machines and introduced ticket gates at the busiest stations \u2013 part of the transition to smart ticketing. All Metro trains are being completely replaced and most stations are undergoing improvement works (or in some cases complete reconstruction, for example North Shields). In addition; tracks, signalling and overhead wires are also being overhauled. Longer-term plans include further extensions to the system. Proposed routes include to Newcastle's west end, to the Cobalt Business Park in North Tyneside, to the Metrocentre in Gateshead and to additional locations in Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland. Several of the proposed routes would require trams as opposed to the current light rail trains.\nRoad.\nMajor roads in the area include the A1 (Newcastle Gateshead Western Bypass), stretching north to Edinburgh and south to London; the A19 heading south past Sunderland and Middlesbrough to York and Doncaster; the A69 heading west to Carlisle; the A696, which becomes the A68 heads past Newcastle Airport and up through central Northumberland and central Scottish Borders, the A167, the old \"Great North Road\", heading south to Gateshead, Chester-le-Street, Durham and Darlington; and the A1058 \"Coast Road\", which runs from Jesmond to the east coast between Tynemouth and Cullercoats. Many of these designations are recent\u2014upon completion of the Western Bypass, and its designation as the new line of the A1, the roads between this and the A1's former alignment through the Tyne Tunnel were renumbered, with many city centre roads changing from a 6-prefix to their present 1-prefix numbers. In November 2011 the capacity of the Tyne Tunnel was increased when a project to build a second road tunnel and refurbish the first tunnel was completed.\nBus\nBus services in Newcastle upon Tyne and the surrounding boroughs part are coordinated by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive. Stagecoach North East is the primary bus operator in the city, running city services between both the West and East ends, with some services extending out to the MetroCentre, Killingworth, Wallsend and Ponteland. Go North East provides the majority of services to and from the south of the Tyne, linking Newcastle with Gateshead, South Tyneside, Sunderland, and County Durham. Arriva North East runs numerous services to the north of city, North Tyneside and Northumberland. Additionally, QuayLink connects Newcastle and Gateshead to the Quayside. Newcastle Central coach station is the city's main hub for long-distance services, such as those operated by National Express.\nOther major bus departure points are Pilgrim Street (for buses running south of the Tyne via Gateshead), and Blackett Street/Monument for services to the East and West of the city. Many bus services also pass Newcastle Central Station, a major interchange for rail and metro services.\nCycling.\nNewcastle is accessible by several mostly traffic-free cycle routes that lead to the edges of the city centre, where cyclists can continue into the city by road, using no car lanes. The traffic-free C2C cycle route runs along the north bank of the River Tyne, enabling cyclists to travel off-road to North Shields and Tynemouth in the east, and westwards towards Hexham.\nSuburban cycle routes exist, which use converted trackbeds of former industrial wagonways and industrial railways. A network on Tyneside's suburban Victorian waggonways is being developed. A network of signed on-road cycle routes is being established, including some designated on-road cycle lanes that will lead from the city centre to the suburbs of Gosforth, Heaton and Wallsend.\nNewcastle has a growing culture of bicycle usage. Newcastle is also home to a cycling campaign, called the 'Newcastle Cycling Campaign.' The ideal of the organisation is to model other European cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen. The aims of the organisation, within the constitution are: To raise the profile of cycling, especially utility cycling around the city; to educate decision makers over the benefits of cycling; to promote equality.\nFollowing guidelines set in the National Cycling strategy, Newcastle first developed its cycling strategy in 1998. As of 2012[ [update]], the city council's social aims and objectives for cycling include: highlighting the usage of cycling to cut city congestion and educating that cycling promotes healthy living The authority also has infrastructure aims and objectives which include: developing on road cycle networks on quieter streets; making safer routes on busier streets; innovating and implementing contraflows on one way streets; developing the existing off-road cycle route networks and improve signage; joining up routes that are partially or completely isolated; Increase the number of cycle parking facilities; working with employers to integrate cycling into workplace travel plans; link the local networks to national networks.\nWater.\nDFDS Seaways runs a ferry service to IJmuiden, near Amsterdam in The Netherlands, from Newcastle International Ferry Terminal (located in North Shields). The DFDS ferry service to Gothenburg, Sweden, ceased at the end of October 2006 and their service to Bergen and Stavanger, Norway was terminated in late 2008. The company cited high fuel prices and new competition from low-cost air services as the cause. However, since summer 2007, Thomson cruise lines have included Newcastle as a departure port on its Norwegian and Fjords cruise.\nGovernment.\nNewcastle is a metropolitan borough with city status, governed by Newcastle City Council. There are six civil parishes within the city boundaries, at Blakelaw and North Fenham, Brunswick, Dinnington, Hazlerigg, North Gosforth, and Woolsington, which form an additional tier of local government for their areas. The rest of the city is an unparished area.\nThe city council is based at Newcastle Civic Centre in Haymarket, which opened in 1968.\nAdministrative history.\nNewcastle was an ancient borough. It is said to have been made a borough by William II (reigned 1087\u20131100), although the earliest known charter was granted by Henry II (reigned 1154\u20131189). In 1400, a new charter from Henry IV gave the borough the right to hold its own courts and appoint its own sheriffs, making it a county corporate, independent from the Sheriff of Northumberland. Whilst administratively independent, Newcastle was still deemed part of the geographical county of Northumberland for the purposes of lieutenancy until 1974.\nThe Northumberland assizes were held at the Castle in Newcastle, and subsequently at the Moot Hall, built within the castle site in 1811. The Moot Hall also served as the meeting place of Northumberland County Council from its creation in 1889 until 1981 when the county council moved to Morpeth. Newcastle was therefore sometimes described as the county town of Northumberland, although that title was also claimed by Alnwick, where knights of the shire were elected until the Reform Act 1832.\nUntil the 1830s the borough just covered the four parishes of All Saints, St Andrew, St John, and St Nicholas. The parliamentary borough (constituency) was enlarged in 1832 to also take in Byker, Elswick, Heaton, Jesmond and Westgate. The municipal boundaries were enlarged to match the constituency in 1836, when Newcastle was reformed to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country.\nNewcastle was awarded city status in 1882. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Newcastle was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a county borough. The city boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1904 when it absorbed Benwell, Fenham and Walker, and in 1935 when it absorbed Kenton and parts of neighbouring parishes. In 1906 the city was given the right to appoint a Lord Mayor.\nIn 1974, the county borough was replaced by a larger metropolitan borough within the new county of Tyne and Wear. The borough gained the area of the former urban districts of Gosforth and Newburn, and the parishes of Brunswick, Dinnington, Hazlerigg, North Gosforth and Woolsington. It also gained the Moot Hall, which until 1974 had been an exclave of the administrative county of Northumberland surrounded by the city. Newcastle's city status was transferred to the enlarged borough at the same time.\nFrom 1974 until 1986, the city council was a lower-tier district authority, with Tyne and Wear County Council providing county-level services. The county council was abolished in 1986, since when the city council has again provided both district-level and county-level services, as it had done when it was a county borough prior to 1974. Some functions are provided across Tyne and Wear by joint committees with the other districts. The county of Tyne and Wear continues to exist as a ceremonial county for the purposes of lieutenancy, but has had no administrative functions since 1986.\nBetween 2014 and 2018, Newcastle was part of the North East Combined Authority. In 2018 after disputes with some of the other councils, it left to create the North of Tyne Combined Authority, which it was a part of until 2024. Since 2024 the council has been a member of the North East Combined Authority, which replaced both combined authorities.\nCoat of arms.\nNewcastle's coat of arms dates back to the fourteenth century, and can be described as canting: \"Gules three castles triple towered argent\". The supporters are two seahorses, reflecting the fact that the city developed as a port. The crest is another three-towered silver castle with a gold demi-lion guardant on it holding the flag of England in pennant form. The motto is the Latin phrase \"Fortiter Defendit Triumphans\" (Triumphing by brave defence), and was added in the 1640s after Newcastle successfully resisted a Scottish invasion during the English Civil War.\nThe arms should not be confused with the similar arms of the Scottish city of Aberdeen, which has towers instead of castles and a royal tressure.\nUK Parliament.\nNewcastle is represented by three elected Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons, the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. All three current MPs are from the Labour Party.\nEU referendum.\nIn the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Newcastle voted for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, with a ratio of 51:49 in favour of remain, compared to a national ratio of 48:52 in favour of leave.\nEducation.\nSchools and colleges.\nNewcastle has 74 primary schools and 20 secondary schools, of which 13 are LEA-funded and 7 are fee-paying independent schools.\nThere are a number of critically acclaimed state secondary schools, including Walker Riverside Academy, Gosforth Academy, Jesmond Park Academy, St Cuthbert's High School, St Mary's Catholic School, Kenton School, Sacred Heart, Excelsior Academy, Walbottle Academy and Benfield School.\nThe largest co-educational independent school is the Royal Grammar School. The largest girls' independent school is Newcastle High School for Girls. Both schools are located on the same street in Jesmond. Newcastle School for Boys is the only independent boys' only school in the city and is situated in Gosforth. Other independent schools include Dame Allan's School.\nNewcastle College is the largest general further education (FE) college in North East England and is a Beacon Status college. There are also two smaller FE colleges in Newcastle.\nUniversities.\nThe city has two major universities \u2013 Newcastle University and Northumbria University.\nNewcastle University has its origins in the Durham University School of Medicine and Surgery, established in 1834.\nIt became fully independent on 1 August 1963, forming the University of Newcastle upon Tyne (now simply Newcastle University). It is a red brick university and is a member of the Russell Group, an association of research-intensive UK universities, often considered to represent the best UK universities. It won the \"Sunday Times\" University of the Year award in 2000. It was awarded the Gold Award in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), one of only ten Russell Group universities to achieve the Gold TEF rating.\nNorthumbria University has its origins in Newcastle Polytechnic, established in 1969 and becoming the University of Northumbria at Newcastle in 1992 as part of the UK-wide process in which polytechnics became new universities. Northumbria University was voted 'Best New University' by \"The Times\" Good University Guide 2005. It holds the Silver TEF Award.\nMuseums and galleries.\nThere are several museums and galleries in Newcastle, including the Centre for Life with its Science Village; the Discovery Museum a museum highlighting life on Tyneside, including Tyneside's shipbuilding heritage, and inventions which changed the world; the Great North Museum; in 2009 the Newcastle on Tyne Museum of Antiquities merged with the Great North Museum (Hancock Museum); Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children's Books; The Side Gallery opened in 1977 and displayed historical and contemporary photography from around the world and Northern England but it closed in 2023. Another former attraction was the Newburn Motor Museum which opened in 1979 but closed during the Covid pandemic.\nThe Laing Art Gallery, similarly to other art galleries and museums around the world, has collections digitised on the Google Cultural Institute, an initiative that makes important cultural material accessible online.\nReligious sites.\nNewcastle has three cathedrals, the Anglican St Nicholas', with its elegant lantern tower of 1474, the Roman Catholic St Mary's designed by Augustus Welby Pugin and the Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Fenham. All three cathedrals began their lives as parish churches. St Mary's became a cathedral in 1850 and St Nicholas' in 1882. Another prominent church in the city centre is the Church of St Thomas the Martyr which is unique as the only Church of England church without a parish and which is not a peculiar.\nOne of the largest evangelical Anglican churches in the UK is Jesmond Parish Church, situated a little to the north of the city centre.\nNewcastle is home to the only Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Centre in North East England; the centre has served the local Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community for over 25 years and is located close to the Civic Centre in Jesmond.\nNewcastle was a prominent centre of the Plymouth Brethren movement up to the 1950s, and some small congregations still function. Among these are at the Hall, Denmark Street and Gospel Hall, St Lawrence.\nThe Parish Church of St Andrew is traditionally recognised as 'the oldest church in this town'. The present building was begun in the 12th Century and the last addition to it, apart from the vestries, was the main porch in 1726. It is quite possible that there was an earlier church here dating from Saxon times. This older church would have been one of several churches along the River Tyne dedicated to St Andrew, including the Priory church at Hexham. The building contains more old stonework than any other church in Newcastle. It is surrounded by the last of the ancient churchyards to retain its original character. Many key names associated with Newcastle's history worshipped and were buried here. The church tower received a battering during the Siege of Newcastle by the Scots who finally breached the Town Wall and forced surrender. Three of the cannonballs remain on site as testament to the siege.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nNewcastle upon Tyne is twinned with:\nOther agreements.\nNewcastle has a \"friendship agreement\" with the American city of Little Rock, Arkansas. Since 2003, it has had a \"special cooperation agreement\" with the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6. Furthermore, Newcastle participated in the 1998 summit of worldwide cities named Newcastle, which led to friendship agreements with the following places:\nForeign consulates.\nThe following countries have consular representation in Newcastle: Denmark, Finland, Romania,\nBelgium, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, and Sweden.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1993 Bashir was appointed the Clinical Director of Mental Health Services for the Central Sydney Area Health Service, a position she held until her appointment to the governorship.\nBashir retired after holding the office for over 13 years, being the second-longest serving Governor of New South Wales, stating she did not want to surpass the length of service of war hero Sir Roden Cutler. She was succeeded by General David Hurley, who would later become Governor-General of Australia.\nEarly life and education.\nMarie Roslyn Bashir was born in 1930 in Narrandera, New South Wales, to Lebanese parents Michael Bashir and Victoria Melick. Her father and her paternal uncle were both medical graduates from the American University of Beirut. Her maternal family had come to Australia in the 19th century.\nBashir attended Narrandera Public School and in 1943 enrolled at Sydney Girls High School, which her mother had also attended. Bashir then moved to Sydney to live with her grandmother in order to attend. Upon graduating in 1947, Bashir studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, becoming a proficient violinist.\nBashir completed the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 1956 at the University of Sydney Medical School, residing at The Women's College from 1950 to 1955. In 1959, she was elected to the College Council, became Honorary Secretary in 1960 and was Chair from 1982 to 1990. She took up life membership of the College Union in 1969. While at university, she met rising rugby player, Nicholas Shehadie, to whom she was married on 23 February 1957, in St Philip's Church, Sydney, by Felix Arnott, then the Warden of St Paul's College, University of Sydney. They had their first child, Michael, in 1959, followed by two daughters, Susan and Alexandra.\nMedical career.\nUpon her graduation in medicine, Bashir took up a posting as a junior resident medical officer at St Vincent's Hospital and then to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children. After first living in Elizabeth Bay, Bashir and Shehadie moved their family to Pendle Hill in Western Sydney, where Bashir worked as a General Practitioner. However, wanting to assist people suffering from mental illnesses, Bashir eventually decided to take up postgraduate studies in Psychiatry. To make this easier, in 1968 Bashir and her family moved back into central Sydney to Mosman on the North Shore, purchasing a Middle Harbour-waterfront house at 7 Shellbank Avenue for $57,000 from yachtsman Gordon Reynolds. This would be their primary residence until its sale in May 2020.\nWhen Shehadie was made Lord Mayor of Sydney, Bashir became the Lady Mayoress of Sydney from 1973 to 1975. In 1974 Bashir was named as \"Mother of the Year\" by the NSW Child Care Committee and the National Council of Women (NSW), with Bashir noting \"the fact that I, as a professional woman, was chosen as Mother of the Year points to the growing social acceptance of a working mother\". When Shehadie was knighted in 1976, Bashir acquired the title Lady Shehadie, a title she did not use, remaining \"Marie Bashir\" in professional life. After completion of postgraduate studies in psychiatry, she was made a Member of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in 1971, becoming a Fellow in 1980. From 1972, Bashir was a teacher, lecturer and mentor to medical students at The University of Sydney.\nIn 1972 Bashir was appointed Director of the Rivendell Child, Adolescent and Family Service, which provides consultative services for young people with emotional and psychiatric issues, and oversaw the unit's moving to the former Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital in Concord West in 1977 following its acquisition by the NSW Health Commission in 1976. In 1987 she was appointed director of the Community Health Services in the Central Sydney Area Health Service, which put emphasis on early childhood services, migrant and Indigenous health as well as the elderly. On 13 June 1988 she was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) \"In recognition of service to medicine, particularly in the field of adolescent mental health\".\nFrom 1990 to 1992, she served on the New South Wales Women's Advisory Council. In 1993, she was appointed as Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Sydney, and in 1994 as the Clinical Director of Mental Health Services for the Central Sydney Area. This was a time of major reform in mental health service delivery, which contributed to substantial change in the provision of public sector mental health services. She served until 2001. In her university role, Bashir is instrumental in developing collaborative teaching programs between colleagues in Vietnam and Thailand with Australian psychiatrists, chairing the University of New South Wales Third World Health Group (1995\u20132000) and supporting various financial and social support programmes for International students.\nIn 1995, in a partnership with the Aboriginal Medical Service, Redfern, she established the Aboriginal Mental Health Unit, which provides regular clinics and counselling at both the Aboriginal Medical Service in Sydney and mainstream centres. From 1996, Bashir also took up the consultative role of senior psychiatrist to the Aboriginal Medical Service. As well as championing the health of indigenous Australians, Bashir also continued her focus on youth and juvenile issues, particularly through her terms chairing the NSW Juvenile Justice Advisory Council (1991\u20131999) and as consultative psychiatrist to Juvenile Justice Facilities (1993\u20132000). On 1 January 2001, Bashir was awarded the Centenary Medal.\nGovernor of NSW, other roles and honours.\nIn early 2001, on the recommendation of Premier Bob Carr, Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, appointed Bashir Governor of New South Wales, making her the state's first female governor, and the first governor of any Australian state of Lebanese descent. She was sworn in on 1 March 2001, and on 30 March she was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). Upon her appointment, \"Sydney Morning Herald\" journalist David Marr noted, \"what could be more valuable behind the scenes in Macquarie St than this woman's unique expertise with troubled adolescents?\" Bashir's appointment was welcomed by both sides of politics and commended in a \"Sydney Morning Herald\" editorial as \"an inspired choice\" as well as noting that Bashir would be \"a powerful advocate for the powerless\".\nIn that role, Bashir departed from past practice. For Indigenous Australians, Bashir launched a health initiative to support Indigenous medicine and nursing students as well as supporting the progress of reconciliation. On the very day of her inauguration, Bashir agreed to become Patron of the Gay and Lesbian Counselling Service, which addresses mental and social issues in the LGBT community. This was the first time a NSW governor had supported a gay organisation. In 2005 Bashir opened the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival in a concert in Hyde Park and credited the event with fostering \"that sense of freedom which springs from the considerable diversity within our society \u2013 diversity of race, religion, culture and also sexual orientation [...] We must never take these things for granted because most of you would agree that across the world today an extraordinary winding back to many previously discarded attitudes is taking place, not only affecting gay and lesbian groups, but women's health and many aspects of social justice\".\nIn 2002, Bashir became Patron of the Australia-Vietnam Medical Trust and became intimately involved in collaborative health programs in Vietnam, particularly in rural areas. On 17 May 2001, the Governor-General, Sir William Deane, invested Bashir as a Dame of Grace of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem (DStJ). Having previously studied violin at the Conservatorium of Music, Sydney, in 2002 Bashir was asked to become the Patron of the Sydney University Graduate Choir. She is also a Patron of Opera Australia, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Philharmonia Choirs, Pinchgut Opera and the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens.\nIn 2003 Bashir received the Mental Health Princess Award, awarded by Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand, for contribution to collaborative mental health programs between Australia and Thailand, and in 2004 she was recognised as an Australian Living Treasure. In 2004 she was made an honorary Member of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). In March 2004, during a visit to Lebanon, Bashir was appointed a Grand Officer of the National Order of the Cedar by General Emile Lahoud, President of the Republic of Lebanon. On 14 September, Premier Carr announced that he would recommend to the Queen that Bashir's term be extended for another three years. Buckingham Palace confirmed his recommendation on 1 October saying that: \"The Queen is content for Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir AC, to remain in her current position until February 2008 as recommended.\"\nOn 31 March 2006, the Queen appointed her a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). Bashir was involved in the high-profile legal case against a psychiatrist called Dr Brendan O' Sullivan and the NSW health service, in which she was falsely cited in his dismissal; using the opportunity to claim sovereign immunity, usually only used by the Crown.\nIn April 2007 Bashir was elected by the University Senate to take up a four-year appointment as Chancellor of the University of Sydney on 1 June 2007. It was announced on 15 October 2007 that the Queen, on the recommendation of Premier Morris Iemma, had extended Bashir's appointment as governor for a further four years to February 2012. On 4 November 2009, she was invested as a Chevalier of the Ordre National de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by the then President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, and presented by the Ambassador of France to Australia, Michel Filhol.\nAs the longest-serving incumbent state governor, Bashir held a dormant commission to act as the Administrator of the Commonwealth when the Governor-General of Australia was absent from Australia. She held the position of Administrator many times: from 10 to 17 July 2007, 30 September to 12 October 2007, and 20 April to 4 May 2008 in the absence of Michael Jeffery, and from 30 July to 6 August 2008, 5 to 19 November 2008, 17 March to 2 April 2009, and 7 to 12 June 2010, in the absence of Quentin Bryce.\nIn May\u2013June 2010, the New South Wales Government experienced a series of resignations: Karyn Paluzzano over expenses abuse, David Campbell over a personal scandal, Ian Macdonald over expenses abuse and Graham West's retirement. These were widely seen as highlighting the NSW Government's inability to govern effectively and in response to this there were various calls for Bashir to take action as governor and dismiss the government. She played down these calls in a radio interview on 10 June, saying that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The only way that they [the NSW Government] can disappear, so to speak, is if there's a vote of no confidence... Elections do come round from time to time so it's back in the hands of the people.\"\nIn late 2010, Mosman Municipal Council decided to name the new sports centre in Rawson Park for Bashir in recognition of her service to both New South Wales and the Mosman community. She officially opened the \"Marie Bashir Mosman Sports Centre\" on 10 December 2010 with the Mayor, Anne Connon. On 14 September 2011, Liberal Premier Barry O'Farrell announced that he had recommended to the Queen that Bashir's term be extended for another two years to 2014, which had been accepted: \"Over the past 10 years the Governor's caring nature, her genuine interest in local communities and her extraordinary work rate have endeared her to people everywhere...Because of her diverse background, career and interests, Professor Bashir has given a historic and important post a contemporary relevance and resonance.\"\nFrom the time of her commencement as governor, Bashir, like her immediate predecessor, did not reside in Government House, Sydney, retaining it for reception and official purposes. However, in October 2011, the new Premier Barry O'Farrell announced that Bashir had agreed with O'Farrell's offer to move back into Government House: \"A lot of people believe the Governor should live at Government House. That's what it was built for ... [A]t some stage a rural or regional governor will be appointed and we will need to provide accommodation at Government House so it makes sense to provide appropriate living areas\". However, because Government House has not been a residence for fifteen years, O'Farrell also announced that the Bashir would initially move into a smaller adjacent building, called the chalet, while refurbishments of the main wing occur, with a proposed move into the main house \"before Christmas\".\nOn 19 April 2012, Bashir was presented with the insignia of a Grand Cordon of the National Order of the Cedar by the President of Lebanon, General Michel Suleiman, at Government House, Sydney, during his state visit to Australia. At a meeting of the University of Sydney Senate in May 2012, Bashir announced her intention to retire as Chancellor. At a ceremony marking her retirement as Chancellor, her portrait depicting Bashir as Chancellor by Shen Jiawei was unveiled, to hang in the Great Hall. Also in April, it was announced that Bashir's term as governor, which had been expected to expire in February 2014, had been extended another six months to September 2014, at which Bashir expressed her intention to retire.\nOn 26 May 2013, Bashir was promoted to the rank of Officer within the Ordre National de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by the then President of France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and invested with the insignia at a ceremony at Government House Sydney by G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Regis Outtier, Secretary General of the Society of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur.\nOn 21 October 2013 Premier O'Farrell and the Minister for Education Adrian Piccoli announced that the new state primary school in Strathfield on the old site of the Sydney Adventist College would be named the \"Marie Bashir Public School\" in her honour. At the announcement O'Farrell noted that: \"Naming this school after Professor Bashir honours her outstanding contribution to NSW and is a reminder that she achieved all her distinctions after being educated at public schools \u2013 from Narrandera Public School to Sydney Girls High School\". On 28 November 2013 the Premier of NSW announced that the Queen had given approval for the title of \"The Honourable\" to be accorded to the governors and former governors of New South Wales.\nOn 5 December 2013, the University of Sydney decided to rename the Sydney Emerging Infections and Biosecurity Institute in her honour to become the Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity (MBI). Also in December 2013, Bashir became patron of the NAISDA Foundation.\nIn the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours, Bashir was made a Dame of the Order of Australia \"For extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit in service to the administration, public life, and people of New South Wales, to medicine, particularly as an advocate for improved mental health outcomes for the young, marginalised and disadvantaged, to international relations, through the promotion of collaborative health programs, and as a leader in tertiary education\".\nIn September 2014, her official portrait as governor by Archibald Prize finalist Mathew Lynn was unveiled at Government House by Premier Mike Baird.\nRetirement.\nAhead of her impending retirement from office on 1 October 2014, Bashir noted that the time was right for her to go just short of the record in office set by Sir Roden Cutler: \"a war hero who lost a leg serving this country, I would like to think of him as the longest serving governor\" and that \"The time is right, it was myself who said I would conclude my term around the anniversary of World War I. That would mean that I would not exceed the longest term of Sir Roden Cutler for whom I had the greatest admiration and respect\".\nContinuing roles.\nShe made clear at the time of her retirement her interest in continuing her community work, particularly through the area of post-traumatic stress disorder in Australian Defence Force veterans. As of November 2020[ [update]] Bashir is one of three patrons of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation. Her role as patron of the NAISDA Foundation continues as of December 2021[ [update]].\nTitles, styles and honours.\nTitles.\nBashir's style and title as governor in full was: \"Her Excellency Professor The Honourable Dame Marie Bashir, Dame of the Order of Australia, Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, Governor of the State of New South Wales in the Commonwealth of Australia.\"\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70352", "revid": "14383484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70352", "title": "List of governors of New York", "text": "The governor of New York is the head of government of the U.S. state of New York, the head of the executive branch of New York's state government, and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The officeholder has a duty to enforce state laws, to convene the New York State Legislature, the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the legislature, as well as to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.\nFifty-seven people have served as state governor, four of whom served non-consecutive terms (George Clinton, DeWitt Clinton, Horatio Seymour, and Al Smith); the official numbering lists each governor only once. There has only been one female governor so far: Kathy Hochul. This numbering includes one acting governor: the lieutenant governor who filled the vacancy after the resignation of the governor, under the 1777 Constitution. The list does not include the prior colonial governors nor those who have acted as governor when the governor was out of state, such as Lieutenant Governor Timothy L. Woodruff during Theodore Roosevelt's vice presidential campaign in 1900, or Acting Speaker of the New York State Assembly Moses M. Weinstein, who acted as governor for 10 days in 1968 while the governor, the lieutenant governor and the senate majority leader were out of the state, attending the Republican National Convention in Miami.\nFour men have become president of the United States after serving as governor of New York: Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and six were vice president. Van Buren and Theodore Roosevelt held both offices. Numerous Governors have also sought the Presidency, and won their party's respective nomination, but lost the general election, such as Al Smith, Samuel J. Tilden, Horatio Seymour, Thomas E. Dewey, and Charles Evans Hughes. Two governors have been chief justice: John Jay held that position when he was elected governor in 1795, and Charles Evans Hughes became chief justice in 1930, two decades after leaving the governorship.\nThe longest-serving governor was the first, George Clinton, who first took office on July 30, 1777, and served seven terms in two different periods, totaling just under 21 years in office. As 18 of those years were consecutive, Clinton also served the longest consecutive period in office for a New York governor. Charles Poletti had the shortest term, serving 29 days following the resignation of the previous governor, Herbert H. Lehman in 1942. Lehman was the state's first Jewish governor; David Paterson was the first African American governor of New York, and the first legally blind governor as well. Paterson is only the fourth African American to hold the office of governor in the United States. The current governor is Democrat Kathy Hochul, the state's first female governor, who assumed the office on August 24, 2021, upon the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. Hochul went on to be elected as governor for a full term, after beating Republican Lee Zeldin in the 2022 election.\nGovernors.\nNew York was one of the original Thirteen Colonies on the east coast of North America, and was admitted as a state on July 26, 1788. Prior to declaring its independence, New York was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain, which it in turn obtained from the Dutch as the colony of New Netherland; see the list of colonial governors and the list of directors-general of New Netherland for the pre-statehood period.\nThe office of the governor was established by the first New York Constitution in 1777. The governor originally served for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set the start of the term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the term of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving the beginning and the end of the term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent New York Constitution of 1938 extended the term to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.\nThe Constitution has provided since 1777 for the election of a lieutenant governor of New York, who is \"ex officio\" President of the Senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the lieutenant governor would become acting governor until the end of the yearly legislative term, the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 Constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the president \"pro tempore\" of the State Senate performs all the duties of the lieutenant governor until the vacancy is filled either at the next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president \"pro tempore\" acts as governor, with the office of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Should the presidency \"pro tempore\" be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the Speaker of the State Assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket as the governor, since the 1954 election with a single joint vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "70358", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70358", "title": "Robert Lenkiewicz", "text": "English painter\nRobert Oscar Lenkiewicz (31 December 1941 \u2013 5 August 2002) was one of South West England's most celebrated artists of modern times. Perennially unfashionable in high art circles, his work was nevertheless popular with the public. Lenkiewicz is regarded by some as a great painter who is 'finally being recognised as such after all these years of neglect by the art establishment, particularly by London, who would never have him. He didn't play the game as far as London commercial galleries were concerned. He did his own thing out in the provinces, which was looked down upon.'\nHe produced as many as 10,000 works (though this figure includes his prolific output as a pencil portrait artist), often on a large scale, and in themed 'projects' investigating hidden communities (https://, https://) or difficult social issues (https://, https://).\nIn 1981, he faked his death, announcing his demise to the local newspapers. When Lenkiewicz died in 2002, he left behind a particularly macabre legacy as the embalmed body of one of his friends, a tramp named Diogenes, was found in the cupboard section at the bottom of a bookcase. Lenkiewicz had promised his friend that he would preserve his body when he died rather than allow him to be buried. Another corpse, that of a 16th century midwife who was hanged for witchcraft, was found in the same room, which Lenkiewicz termed his \"death room\".\nThe Lenkiewicz Foundation (educational charity) was established in 1997, received the bequest of the painter's remaining collection of works. The artist's voluminous diaries, illustrated notebooks and relationship journals are in the Foundation's collection, which was shown at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in 2009. The Foundation has curated a number of posthumous exhibitions: \"Self-Portraits 1956-2002\" at the Ben Uri Gallery, Jewish Museum of Art in London in 2008; \"Lenkiewicz: The Legacy \u2013 Works from The Lenkiewicz Foundation Collection\" at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in 2009; \"Still Lives\" at the Royal West of England Academy in Bristol in 2011; \"Death and the Maiden\" at Torre Abbey, in Torquay later that year; and \"Human, All Too Human\" at the Royal William Yard in the artist's adopted city of Plymouth in 2012. This exhibition, in expanded form, travelled to Germany (Spinnerei in Leipzig and AufAEG in Nuremberg) in 2013, where it became the first overseas exhibition of the artist's work to date.\nEarly life.\nRobert Lenkiewicz was born in London in 1941, the son of refugees who ran a Jewish hotel in Fordwych Road. Robert Lenkiewicz spent his boyhood in the Hotel Shemtov in Cricklewood, which was run by his parents. His mother was a German baroness and his father a Polish horse breeder who both fled Nazi Germany in 1939 and arrived in London as penniless refugees. Lenkiewicz frequently stated in interview that the hotel's elderly residents included Holocaust survivors but this is contradicted by the artist's brother John, who recollects that the residents tended to be the parents or grandparents of 2nd or 3rd generation English Jews (for instance, the mother of popular entertainer Dickie Valentine), though the hotel's Czechoslovak cook, Mrs Bobek, was a survivor of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Nevertheless, the loneliness and suffering the young painter witnessed at the hotel was \"salutary and thought-provoking\" according to Lenkiewicz. Lenkiewicz was inspired to paint after seeing Charles Laughton in Alexander Korda's biographical film \"Rembrandt\". He attended Sir Christopher Wren junior technical school of art architecture and building from 1955 to 1958 graduating in art with distinction. At 16, Lenkiewicz was accepted at Saint Martin's School of Art and later attended the Royal Academy. However, he was virtually impervious to contemporary art fashions, being more interested in his favourite paintings in the National Gallery.\nInspired by the example of Albert Schweitzer, Lenkiewicz threw open the doors of his studios to anyone in need of a roof \u2013 down and outs, addicts, criminals and the mentally ill congregated there. These individuals were the subjects of his paintings as a young man. However, such colourful characters were not welcomed by his neighbours and he was obliged to leave London in 1964.\nMove to Plymouth.\nHe spent a year living in a remote cottage near Lanreath in Cornwall, supporting his young family by teaching, before being offered studio space on the Barbican in Plymouth by local artist and businessman John Nash. The artist's home and studios once more became a magnet for vagrants and street alcoholics, who then sat for paintings. Their numbers swelled and Lenkiewicz was forced to commandeer derelict warehouses in the city to house the 'dossers'. One of these warehouses also served as a studio and in 1973 became the exhibition space for the Vagrancy Project.\nHe first came to public attention when the media highlighted his giant mural on Plymouth's Barbican in the 1970s. Another furore occurred in 1981 when he faked his own death in preparation for the forthcoming project on the theme of Death (1982): \"I could not know what it was like to be dead,\" said the artist, \"but I could discover what it was like to be \"thought\" dead.\"\nLater life and death.\nAfter his first exhibition with an established art dealer in the 1990s, Lenkiewicz's work enjoyed growing commercial success and some recognition by the establishment. He received a major retrospective in 1997 at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery, attended by 42,000 visitors. In his obituary of Lenkiewicz, art critic David Lee observed: \"Robert's greatest gift was to show us that an artist could be genuinely concerned about social and domestic issues and attempt the difficult task of expressing this conscience through the deeply unfashionable medium of figurative painting. In that sense, he was one of few serious painters of contemporary history.\" Lenkiewicz, aged 60, died of a heart attack in 2002. Despite his prolific output, he had only \u00a312 cash in his possession (allegedly having never opened a bank account), and owed \u00a32 million to various creditors. Since his death, examples of his best paintings have fetched six figure sums in London auction rooms.\nThe rise in Lenkiewicz's popularity was shown in the estate auctions of his personal collection of his own works. At Sotheby's in 2003, Bearnes 2004 and 2008, his paintings and private library raised \u00a32.1 million.\nA number of myths have arisen surrounding the artist's unusual barter economics, such as that Lenkiewicz \"never\" paid tax or kept any records of sales of his works; indeed, it is sometimes claimed that he never sold his work at all despite all his exhibition lists now in the public domain bearing prices. It is the case, however, that Lenkiewicz operated a system of patronage whereby a long-term collector or interested buyer would be handed a bill or two to be settled on behalf of the painter. This system operated until the mid-1990s, when the artist began to regularize his financial affairs in negotiation with the HMRC. Subsequent to the painter's death in 2002, media reports put the value of the artist's estate as \u00a36.5 million. This figure included a cursory valuation of the artist's antiquarian library of rare books on witchcraft, the occult, metaphysics and medieval philosophy. However, the sale of this entire collection by Sotheby's in 2003 raised less than \u00a31 million.\nPersonal life.\nLenkiewicz was the father of 12 children, some of whom have become artists in their own right. One of Robert's sons, Reuben Lenkiewicz, runs a https:// dedicated to his father's work. The artist provided free lessons in techniques for figurative painting to anyone with aptitude and dedication. Lenkiewicz's pupils include Piran Bishop, Yana Travail, Dan Wheatley, Louise Courtnell, Lisa Stokes, Nahem Shoa, James Guy Eccleston and Joe Stoneman.\nHis step-daughter, with Celia Mills, is playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz.\nVagrancy Project.\nThe Vagrancy Project consisted of several dozen paintings and drawings of vagrants and a large book of notes written by the dossers themselves and those involved in their 'care' and control. Lenkiewicz hoped that the exhibition, and the down and outs' own stories, would illuminate the plight of these 'invisible people' and galvanise the community into humane action on their behalf. The format of the 'Project' \u2013 combining thematically linked paintings with the publication of research notes and the collected observations of the sitters \u2013 was to be used consistently throughout Lenkiewicz's career. Projects such as Mental Handicap (1976), Old Age (1979) and Death (1982) followed the one on vagrancy as Lenkiewicz continued to examine the lives of ostracised, hidden sections of the community and bring them to the attention of the general public.\nThe Paul Downes song \"Robert and the Cowboys\" was inspired by the project and describes a number of the vagrants.\nOther projects.\nIn a parallel line of inquiry, Lenkiewicz also investigated some of society's most persistent taboos in projects such as \"Jealousy\" (1977), \"Orgasm\" (1978), \"Suicide\" (1980) and \"Sexual Behaviour\" (1983). Here, Lenkiewicz often adopted an allegorical pictorial style to portray human physiology \"in extremis\". Lenkiewicz came to the conclusion that the kinds of sensations people felt when a lover abandoned them or when their cherished beliefs were threatened were identical in kind to the 'withdrawal symptoms' and anxieties experienced by addicts or alcoholics over their preferred narcotic. These projects thus became an extended study in 'addictive behaviour' (the title of his 20th, unfinished, project).\nThe conclusions drawn from his own observations were supported by his private library, which he viewed as a history of 'fanatical belief systems'. Lenkiewicz contended that in the absence of any good reasons for our beliefs or emotions we must always look to human physiology for an explanation of fanatical or obsessive behaviour and that it is there that we shall discover the roots of fascism \u2013 the tendency to treat another person as property.\nOn and off, for nearly 30 years, he worked on his masterpiece, the Riddle Mural in the Round Room at Port Eliot house, home of the Earl of St. Germans, but died before its completion. Half of the mural, in the room, shows death, destruction, insanity, unrequited love, and the apocalyptic end of the world. The other half reflects love and affection, friendships, harmony, proportion and consensus. Hidden in the work are various references to family skeletons, art history and cabalistic mysteries, hence the name \u2013 the Riddle Mural.\nLibrary.\nOver forty years Lenkiewicz built up a library of some 25,000 volumes devoted to art, the occult sciences, demonolatry, magic, philosophy, especially metaphysics, alchemy, death, psychology and sexuality, preoccupations which surface in some of his paintings. His collection of books on magic and witchcraft was one of the finest in private hands and was largely sold at Sotheby's in 2003, and a substantial part of the remainder of his library was sold at auction in May 2007 by Lyon &amp; Turnbull.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such acts may involve honoring.\nEtymology.\nThe word is derived from the Old English , meaning \"to venerate \"worship, honour shown to an object or deity\", which has been etymologised as \"\"worthiness\" or \"worth-ship\"\"\u2014to give, at its simplest, worth to something.\nWorship in various religions.\nBuddhism.\nWorship in Buddhism may take innumerable forms given the doctrine of skillful means. Worship is evident in Buddhism in such forms as: guru yoga, mandala, thanka, yantra yoga, the discipline of the fighting monks of Shaolin, panchamrita, mantra recitation, tea ceremony, ganacakra, amongst others. Buddhist Devotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists. According to a spokesman of the Sasana Council of Burma, devotion to Buddhist spiritual practices inspires devotion to the Triple Gem. Most Buddhists use ritual in pursuit of their spiritual aspirations. In Buddhism, puja (Sanskrit and Pali: p\u016bj\u0101) are expressions of \"honour, worship and devotional attention\" Acts of puja include bowing, making offerings and chanting. These devotional acts are generally performed daily at home (either in the morning or evening or both) as well as during communal festivals and Uposatha days at a temple.\nMeditation (sam\u0101dhi) is a central form of worship in Buddhism. This practice is focused on the third step of the Eightfold Path that ultimately leads to self awakening, also known as enlightenment. Meditation promotes self-awareness and exploration of the mind and spirit. Traditionally, Buddhist meditation had combined samatha (the act of stopping and calming oneself) and vipasyana (seeing clearly within) to create a complete mind and body experience. By stopping one's everyday activities and focusing on something simple, the mind can open and expand enough to reach a spiritual level. By practicing the step of vipasyana, one does not achieve the final stage of awareness, but rather approaches one step closer. Mindful meditation teaches one to stop reacting quickly to thoughts and external objects that present themselves, but rather to peacefully hold the thought without immediately responding to it. Although in traditional Buddhist faith, enlightenment is the desired end goal of meditation, it is more of a cycle in a literal sense that helps individuals better understand their minds. For example, meditation leads to understanding, leading to kindness, leading to peace, etc.\nChristianity.\nIn Christianity, a church service is a formalized period of communal worship, often but not exclusively occurring on Sunday (or on Saturday in the case of those churches practicing seventh-day Sabbatarianism). The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the \"Word of God\" (the Holy Bible) and encouraged in their faith. Technically, the \"church\" in \"church service\" refers to the gathering of the faithful rather than to the building in which the event takes place. In Christianity, worship is reverent honor and homage paid to God. The New Testament uses various words to express the concept of worship. The word \"proskuneo\" - \"to worship\" - means to bow down (to Gods or to kings).\nMass is the central act of divine worship in the Catholic Church. The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a \"Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy\". Roman Catholic devotions are \"external practices of piety\" which are not part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but part of the popular spiritual practices of Catholics. They do not become part of liturgical worship, even if conducted in a Catholic church, in a group, in presence of a priest.\nAnglican devotions is private prayers and practices used by Anglican Christians to promote spiritual growth and communion with God. Among members of the Anglican Communion, private devotional habits vary widely, depending on personal preference and on affiliation with low-church or high-church parishes.\nAdoration versus veneration.\nThe New Testament uses various words translatable as \"worship\". The word \"proskuneo\" - \"to worship\" - means to bow down to Gods or kings.\nRoman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Oriental Orthodoxy, and Eastern Orthodoxy make a technical distinction between two different concepts:\nThe external acts of veneration resemble those of worship, but differ in their object and intent. Protestant Christians, who reject the veneration of saints, question whether Catholics always maintain such a distinction in actual devotional practice, especially at the level of folk religion.\nAccording to Mark Miravalle the English word \"worship\" is equivocal, in that it has been used (in Catholic writing, at any rate) to denote both adoration/\"latria\" and veneration/\"dulia\", and in some cases even as a synonym for veneration as distinct from adoration:\nAs St. Thomas Aquinas explains, adoration, which is known as latria in classical theology, is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to God alone. It is the manifestation of submission, and acknowledgement of dependence, appropriately shown towards the excellence of an uncreated divine person and to his absolute Lordship. It is the worship of the Creator that God alone deserves. Although we see in English a broader usage of the word \"adoration\" which may not refer to a form of worship exclusive to God\u2014for example, when a husband says that he \"adores his wife\"\u2014in general it can be maintained that adoration is the best English denotation for the worship of latria.\nVeneration, known as dulia in classical theology, the honor and reverence appropriately due to the excellence of a created person. Excellence exhibited by created beings likewise deserves recognition and honor. We see a general example of veneration in events like the awarding of academic awards for excellence in school, or the awarding of olympic medals for excellence in sports. There is nothing contrary to the proper adoration of God when we offer the appropriate honor and recognition that created persons deserve based achievement in excellence.\nWe must make a further clarification regarding the use of the term \"worship\" in relation to the categories of adoration and veneration. Historically, schools of theology have used the term \"worship\" as a general term which included both adoration and veneration. They would distinguish between \"worship of adoration\" and \"worship of veneration.\" The word \"worship\" (in a similar way to how the liturgical term \"cult\" is traditionally used) was not synonymous with adoration, but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration. Hence Catholic sources will sometimes use the term \"worship\" not to indicate adoration, but only the worship of veneration given to Mary and the saints.\nOrthodox Judaism and orthodox Sunni Islam hold that for all practical purposes veneration should be considered the same as prayer; Orthodox Judaism (arguably with the exception of some Chasidic practices), orthodox Sunni Islam, and most kinds of Protestantism forbid veneration of saints or of angels, classifying these actions as akin to idolatry.\nSimilarly, Jehovah's Witnesses assert that many actions classified as patriotic by Protestant groups, such as saluting a flag, count as equivalent to worship and are therefore considered idolatrous as well.\nQuaker Meeting for Worship.\n\"Quakers\" (the Religious Society of Friends) have both unprogrammed and programmed Meetings for Worship. Unprogrammed worship is based on silence and inward listening to the Spirit, from which any participant may share a message. In unprogrammed meetings for worship, someone speaks when that person feels that God/Spirit/the universe has given them a message for others. Programmed worship includes many elements similar to Protestant services. Many programmed meetings also include a time during the service for silent, expectant waiting and messages from the participants. During the silence, people may stand up and Minister, this is where people start talking about what they have been thinking about. It is Quaker practice to only minister once.\nHinduism.\nWorship in Hinduism involves invoking higher forces to assist in spiritual and material progress and is simultaneously both a science and an art. A sense of \"bhakti\" or devotional love is generally invoked. This term is probably a central one in Hinduism. A direct translation from the Sanskrit to English is problematic. Worship takes a multitude of forms depending on community groups, geography and language. There is a flavour of loving and being in love with whatever object or focus of devotion. Worship is not confined to any place of worship, it also incorporates personal reflection, art forms and group. People usually perform worship to achieve some specific end or to integrate the body, the mind and the spirit in order to help the performer evolve into a higher being.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, worship refers to ritualistic devotion as well as actions done in accordance to Islamic law which is ordained by and pleasing to God. Worship included in the Five Pillars of Islam, primarily that of \"salat\", which is the practice of ritual prayer five times daily.\nAccording to Muhammad Asad, on his notes in The Message of the Qur'an translation on ,\nThus, the innermost purpose of the creation of all rational beings is their cognition of the existence of Allah and, hence, their conscious willingness to conform their own existence to whatever they may perceive of His will and plan: and it is this twofold concept of cognition and willingness that gives the deepest meaning to what the Quran describes as \"worship\". As the next verse shows, this spiritual call does not arise from any supposed \"need\" on the part of the Creator, who is self-sufficient and infinite in His power, but is designed as an instrument for the inner development of the worshipper, who, by the act of his conscious self-surrender to the all-pervading Creative Will, may hope to come closer to an understanding of that Will and, thus closer to Allah Himself.\nIn the Muslim world, the word \"worship\" (in the literal context of \"worshipping\") is forbidden to be used if it refers to an object or action and not exclusively to Allah.\nJudaism.\nWorship of God in Judaism is called \"Avodat Hashem\". During the period when the Temple stood, the rites conducted there were considered the most important act of Jewish worship. However, the most common form of worship was and remains that of prayer. Other forms of worship include the conduct of prescribed rituals, such as the Passover Seder and waving the Four Species, with proper intent, as well as various types of Jewish meditation.\nWorship through mundane activities.\nJewish sources also express the notion that one can perform any appropriate mundane activity as the worship of God. Examples would include returning a lost article and working to support oneself and one's family.\nThe Code of Jewish Law (Orach Chayim, Chapter 231) cites Proverbs (3:6), \"in all your ways, know him\" (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05db\u05dc \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05d9\u05da \u05d3\u05e2\u05d4\u05d5 (\"b'chol d'rachecha dei'eihu\")), as a biblical source for this idea.\nSikhism.\nIn Sikhism, worship takes place after the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the work of the 10 Sikh Gurus all in one. Sikhs worship God and only one God, known as \"One Creator\", \"The Wonderful Teacher\" (Waheguru), or \"Destroyer of Darkness\".\nWicca.\nWiccan worship commonly takes place during a full moon or a new moon. Such rituals are called an Esbat and may involve a magic circle which practitioners believe will contain energy and form a sacred space, or will provide them a form of magical protection.\nZoroastrianism.\nPrayer is one of the duties and worships of Mazdayasna, which is performed in order to always pay attention to the religious commandments and to give thanks to Ahura Mazda (God).\nVaudou.\nWorship of voodoo is a cult of the spirit of the invisible world. This type of worship is inherited from ancestors of Ewe people like Adja-ewe, fon, Kotafon, Guin and Mina. Voodoo or vaudou is a spiritual entity embodied in an objects made of clay,h ood, bronze and gold. Every January 10, Benin celebrate the Voodoo festival.\nModern worship.\nIn modern society and sociology, some writers have commented on the ways that people no longer simply worship recognised deities, but also (or instead) worship consumer brands, sports teams, and other people (celebrities). Sociology therefore extends this argument to suggest outside of a religion worship is a process whereby society worships itself, as a form of self-valorization and self-preservation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Today, he is best known as the inspiration for Edmond Rostand's most noted drama, \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1897), which, although it includes elements of his life, also contains invention and myth.\nSince the 1970s, there has been a resurgence in the study of Cyrano, demonstrated in the abundance of theses, essays, articles and biographies published in France and elsewhere.\nCyrano's novels \"L'Autre Monde: ou les \u00c9tats et Empires de la Lune\" (\"Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon\", published posthumously, 1657) and \"Les \u00c9tats et Empires du Soleil\" (\"The States and Empires of the Sun\", 1662) are classics of early modern science fiction. He was the first writer to depict space flight by use of a vessel that has rockets attached, and he introduced Moon-Men as an extraterrestrial race in his novels. Cyrano's mixture of science and romance in his novels is credited with influencing the works of Jonathan Swift, Edgar Allan Poe and probably Voltaire. Both Pierre Corneille and Moli\u00e8re freely borrowed ideas from Cyrano's works, although only Moli\u00e8re was accused of directly plagiarizing them. \nLife and works.\nHe was the son of Abel de Cyrano, lord of Mauvi\u00e8res and Bergerac, and Esp\u00e9rance Bellanger. He received his first education from a country priest and had for a fellow pupil his friend and future biographer Henri Lebret. He then proceeded to Paris and the heart of the Latin Quarter, to the college de Dormans-Beauvais, where he had as master Jean Grangier, whom he afterwards ridiculed in his comedy \"Le P\u00e9dant jou\u00e9\" (\"The Pedant Tricked\") of 1654. At the age of nineteen, he entered a corps of the guards, serving in the campaigns of 1639 and 1640. As a minor nobleman and officer he was notorious for his dueling and boasting. His unique past allowed him to make unique contributions to French art.\nOne author, Ishbel Addyman, varies from other biographers and claims that he was not a Gascon aristocrat, but a descendant of a Sardinian fishmonger, and that the appellation Bergerac stemmed from a small estate near Paris where he was born, not in Gascony, and that he may have suffered tertiary syphilis. She also claims that he may have been homosexual and around 1640 became the lover of Charles Coypeau d'Assoucy, a writer and musician, until around 1653, when they became engaged in a bitter rivalry. This led to Bergerac sending d'Assoucy death threats that compelled him to leave Paris. The quarrel extended to a series of satirical texts by both men. Bergerac wrote \"Contre Soucidas\" (an anagram of his enemy's name) and \"Contre un ingrat\" (Against an ingrate), while D'Assoucy counterattacked with \"Le Combat de Cyrano de Bergerac avec le singe de Brioch\u00e9, au bout du Pont-Neuf\" (The battle of Cyrano de Bergerac with the monkey of Brioch\u00e9, at the end of the Pont-Neuf). He also associated with Th\u00e9ophile de Viau, the French poet and libertine.\nHe is said to have left the military and returned to Paris to pursue literature, producing tragedies cast in the orthodox classical mode.\nThe model for the character Roxane in Rostand's play \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" was Bergerac's cousin, who lived with his sister, Catherine de Bergerac, at the Convent of the Daughter of the Cross. As in the play, Bergerac did fight at the Siege of Arras in 1640, a battle of the Franco-Spanish War (1635-1659) between French and Spanish forces in France (though this was not the Battle of Arras, fought fourteen years later). During the siege he suffered a neck wound from a sword during a sortie by the Spanish defenders, a day before the surrender of the Spanish troops and the end of the siege. One of his confr\u00e8res in the battle was the Baron Christian of Neuvillette, who married Cyrano's cousin. However, the plotline of Rostand's play involving Roxane and Christian is entirely fictional.\nCyrano was a pupil of the French polymath Pierre Gassendi, a canon of the Catholic Church who tried to reconcile Epicurean atomism with Christianity.\nCyrano de Bergerac's works \"L'Autre Monde: ou les \u00c9tats et Empires de la Lune\" (\"Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon\", published posthumously, 1657) and \"Les \u00c9tats et Empires du Soleil\" (\"The States and Empires of the Sun\", 1662) are classics of early modern science fiction. In the former, Cyrano travels to the Moon using rockets powered by fireworks (it may be the earliest description of a space flight by use of a vessel that has rockets attached) and meets the inhabitants. The Moon-men have four legs, firearms that shoot game and cook it, and talking earrings used to educate children.\nHis mixture of science and romance in the last two works furnished a model for many subsequent writers, among them Jonathan Swift, Edgar Allan Poe and probably Voltaire. Corneille and Moli\u00e8re freely borrowed ideas from \"Le P\u00e9dant jou\u00e9\".\nAccused of plagiarizing \"Le P\u00e9dant jou\u00e9\", Moli\u00e8re supposedly replied, \"Il m'est permis de reprendre mon bien o\u00f9 je le trouve\" (\"I am allowed to take back my property where I find it.\").\nDeath.\nThe play suggests that he was injured by a falling wooden beam in 1654 while entering the house of his patron, the Duc D'Arpajon. However the academic and editor of Cyrano's works Madeleine Alcover uncovered a contemporary text which suggests an attack on the Duke's carriage in which a member of his household was injured. It is as yet inconclusive whether or not Cyrano's death was a result of the injury, or an unspecified disease. \nCyrano died over a year later on July 28, 1655, aged 36, at the house of his cousin, Pierre de Cyrano, in Sannois. He was buried in a church in Sannois. However, there is strong evidence to support the theory that his death was a result of a botched assassination attempt as well as further damage to his health caused by a period of confinement in a private asylum, orchestrated by his enemies, who succeeded in enlisting the help of his own brother Abel de Cyrano.\nIn fiction and media.\nOther authors.\nIn A. L. Kennedy's novel \"So I Am Glad\", the narrator finds de Bergerac has appeared in her modern-day house share.\nIn Robert A. Heinlein's novel \"Glory Road\", Oscar Gordon fights a character who is not named, but is obviously Cyrano.\nJohn Shirley published a story about Cyrano called \"Cyrano and the Two Plumes\" in a French anthology; it was reprinted at \"The Freezine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\".\nThe novel by Adam Browne, \"Pyrotechnicon: Being a TRUE ACCOUNT of Cyrano de Bergerac's FURTHER ADVENTURES among the STATES and EMPIRES of the STARS, by HIMSELF (Dec'd)\", was a sequel to Cyrano's science fiction, published by Coeur de Leon in 2012.\nCyrano de Bergerac is the leading male character in Charles Lecocq's 1896 op\u00e9ra comique \"Ninette\".\nFilm.\nMost recently, his likeness was the center of a musical romantic drama, \"Cyrano\", adapted as a screenplay by Erica Schmidt who had previously written the script as a stage musical of the same name. \nL'Autre monde: I.

Raymond about software development, named after Linus Torvalds\nIn software development, Linus's law is the assertion that \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\".\nThe law was formulated by Eric S. Raymond in his essay and book \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\" (1999), and was named in honor of Linus Torvalds.\nA more formal statement is: \"Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.\" Presenting the code to multiple developers with the purpose of reaching consensus about its acceptance is a simple form of software reviewing. Researchers and practitioners have repeatedly shown the effectiveness of reviewing processes in finding bugs and security issues.\nValidity.\nIn \"Facts and Fallacies about Software Engineering,\" Robert Glass refers to the law as a \"mantra\" of the open source movement, but calls it a fallacy due to the lack of supporting evidence and because research has indicated that the rate at which additional bugs are uncovered does not scale linearly with the number of reviewers; rather, there is a small maximum number of useful reviewers, between two and four, and additional reviewers above this number uncover bugs at a much lower rate. While closed-source practitioners also promote stringent, independent code analysis during a software project's development, they focus on in-depth review by a few and not primarily the number of \"eyeballs\".\nThe persistence of the Heartbleed security bug in a critical piece of code for two years has been considered a refutation of Raymond's dictum. Larry Seltzer suspects that the availability of source code may cause some developers and researchers to perform less extensive tests than they would with closed source software, making it easier for bugs to remain.\nIn 2015, the Linux Foundation's executive director Jim Zemlin argued that the complexity of modern software has increased to such levels that specific resource allocation is desirable to improve its security. Regarding some of 2014's largest global open source software vulnerabilities, he says, \"In these cases, the eyeballs weren't really looking\". Large scale experiments or peer-reviewed surveys to test how well the mantra holds in practice have not been performed.\nEmpirical support of the validity of Linus's law was obtained by comparing popular and unpopular projects of the same organization. Popular projects are projects with the top 5% of GitHub stars (7,481 stars or more). Bug identification was measured using the corrective commit probability, the ratio of commits determined to be related to fixing bugs. The analysis showed that popular projects had a higher ratio of bug fixes (e.g., Google's popular projects had a 27% higher bug fix rate than Google's less popular projects). Since it is unlikely that Google lowered its code quality standards in more popular projects, this is an indication of increased bug detection efficiency in popular projects.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the second longest bridge in Europe and combines both roadway and railway in a single structure, consisting of international European route E20 and the \u00d8resund Line respectively. It runs nearly from the Swedish coast to the artificial island of Peberholm in the middle of the strait. The \u00d8resund Link is completed by the \u00d8resund Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager.\nConstruction began in 1995 and it opened to traffic on 1 July 2000. The bridge, as part of the \u00d8resund Link, directly connects the road and rail networks of the Scandinavian Peninsula with Mainland Europe, via the Great Belt Fixed Link (constructed 1988\u20131998) connecting Zealand to Funen and thence to the Jutland Peninsula. Both projects helped to lessen the isolation of Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia from the rest of the continent. A data cable also makes the \u00d8resund Link the backbone of Internet data transmission between central Europe and Sweden.\nThe bridge was designed by J\u00f8rgen Nissen and Klaus Falbe Hansen from Ove Arup &amp; Partners, and Niels Gimsing and Georg Rotne. The justification for the additional expenditure and complexity related to digging a tunnel for part of the way, rather than raising that section of the bridge, was to avoid interfering with air traffic from the nearby Copenhagen Airport, to provide a clear channel for ships in good weather or bad, and to prevent ice floes from blocking the strait. The bridge received the 2002 IABSE Outstanding Structure Award.\nHistory.\nOver the years, there have been several proposals for a fixed link across the strait. One of the most radical was to dam the strait and then pump out the water to create land for development. Ideas for a fixed link across the \u00d8resund were advanced as early as the late 1800s. And in 1910, proposals were put to the Swedish Parliament for a railway tunnel across the strait, which would have comprised two tunnelled sections linked by a surface road across the island of Saltholm. The concept of a bridge over the \u00d8resund was first formally proposed in 1936 by a consortium of engineering firms who proposed a national motorway network for Denmark.\nThe idea was dropped during World War II, but picked up again thereafter and studied in significant detail in various Danish-Swedish government commissions through the 1950s and 1960s. In 1954, the first \u00d8resund Delegation was appointed to investigate the conditions for a bridge link. In its final report in 1962, the delegation proposed a tall bridge of reinforced concrete. The cost was estimated at SEK 600 million and was to be financed by a bridge toll of SEK 15. \nHowever, disagreement existed regarding the placement and exact form of the link, with some arguing for a link at the narrowest point of the sound at Helsing\u00f8r\u2013Helsingborg, north of Copenhagen, and some arguing for a more direct link from Copenhagen to Malm\u00f6. Additionally, some regional and local interests argued that other bridge and road projects, notably the then-unbuilt Great Belt Fixed Link, should take priority. The governments of Denmark and Sweden eventually signed an agreement to build a fixed link in 1973. It would have comprised a bridge between Malm\u00f6 and Saltholm, with a tunnel linking Saltholm to Copenhagen, and would have been accompanied by a second rail tunnel across the \u00d8resund between Helsing\u00f8r and Helsingborg.\nHowever, that project was cancelled in 1978 due to the economic situation, and growing environmental concerns. As the economic situation improved in the 1980s, interest resumed and the governments signed a new agreement in 1991.\nPolitical decisions.\nDuring the planning of the \u00d8resund Link, a choice was made between the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r and Malm\u00f6-Copenhagen (Limhamn-Amager) routes. However, a great advantage was seen in prioritizing the connection between the major central cities of Copenhagen and Malm\u00f6. Another factor against Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r may have been the difficulty of resolving through traffic in the municipalities on the Danish side and the fact that, despite the proximity of the towns, the tunnel had to be long because of the location of the settlements and the depth of the strait, , which also posed geological difficulties. However, a Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r tunnel is still included in the infrastructure planning.\nThe Danish and Swedish governments agreed on 23 March 1991 to build a combined road and rail link between Kastrup and Limhamn. The link would consist of an immersed tunnel from Kastrup to an artificial island southwest of Saltholm and then on as a bridge to Limhamn. Over the Flintr\u00e4nnan and fairways, there would be main spans with a vertical clearance of at least and respectively. The clear width would be at least and respectively. The parties agreed that the final design could be adjusted for environmental, technical and economic reasons. This was indeed the case. The artificial island, Peberholm, ended up just south of Saltholm and instead of two main spans, there was a larger main span over Flintr\u00e4nnan. The route of Flintr\u00e4nnan was shifted one kilometer to the east. The countries created their own companies, A/S \u00d8resundsforbindelsen and Svensk-danska brof\u00f6rbindelsen AB, Svedab AB, and these became half-owners of the joint \u00d8resundsbro Konsortiet. The consortium was given responsibility for the construction and operation of the link.\nMainly in Denmark, but also in Sweden, there was interest during construction in adding a bicycle lane at a cost of SEK 210 million (estimated by DTU), but the Swedish department of the bridge company said no.\nThe bridge was a recurring feature of Swedish political debate for decades. Many commentators opposed its construction on environmental grounds, as the consequence of the bridge was considered to be \"that road transport will continue to increase rapidly\", as Anders Wijkman, Secretary General of the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, wrote in 1990. For the Centre Party, opposition to the bridge was long a central issue. Party leader Olof Johansson resigned from Carl Bildt's government in protest against the bridge. Since the bridge was built, however, criticism has all but died down.\nDesign competition and procurement.\nAt the end of 1992, the \u00d8resundsbro Konsortiet launched a competition for the design of the link. Six entries were submitted, including one designed by Santiago Calatrava and another by Norman Foster, but two others were selected for further development and procurement. The ASO Group (formed by Arup Group), with Georg Rotne as architect, proposed that the bridge itself be made mainly of steel in two levels, with highway on top and train traffic below. \u00d8LC (\u00d8resund Link Consultants) instead placed highway and rail in the same plane on a concrete bridge. Both groups advocated an inclined cable-stayed bridge over the Flintr\u00e4nnan. The procurement of the entire \u00d8resund Link was divided into different contracts, including one contract for the two access bridges and another for the main span. In November 1995, Sundlink Contractors (a consortium of Skanska, Hochtief, H\u00f8jgaard &amp; Schultz and Monberg &amp; Thorsen) was able to sign a contract with the \u00d8resundsbro Konsortiet to build both the access bridges and the main span in accordance with the ASO Group's proposal, at a cost of DKK 6.8 billion (including a viaduct at Peberholm). For the preparation of its tender, Sundlink had engaged the services of the engineering consultants COWI from Denmark and VBB from Sweden. They were now tasked with developing the proposals in detail and controlling the further work.\nRequirements and design.\nThe owners had set high safety and environmental standards for the contractors. Among other things, the bridges had to: \nThe bedrock under the Sound consists of Copenhagen limestone of very varied composition. Many borehole samples were therefore taken in the area before the detailed design of the bridge. Sundlink had great freedom to design details and processes within the owners' specifications. Changes were made on an ongoing basis, but only at a detailed level. A decisive factor was the availability of the world's largest hammerhead crane barge, the \"\" (the Swan). The crane was built in 1991 for the construction of the Great Belt Bridge and was subsequently used in the construction of the Confederation Bridge in Canada. With the detailed planning of the \u00d8resund Bridge already underway, it became clear that the \"Svanen\" would be available earlier than expected, just in time for the \u00d8resund Bridge spans to be put in place. The \"Svanen's\" large lifting capacity meant that the length of the spans could be increased from the planned to . Fewer piers were thus needed, which was favorable for the flow of water through the Sound.\nSundlink used many subcontractors from different countries with different languages and cultures. Since the countries could have different terminology and standards, it was decided to use the then rather untested European standards for structural design, the Eurocodes. Sundlink also set up its own facility at \"Norra hamnen\" (Northern port) in Malm\u00f6 for concrete casting, assembly and logistics.\nConstruction.\nAn OMEGA centre report identified the following as primary motivations for construction of the bridge:\nSundlink Contractors (who also did the previous Great Belt Fixed Link) began construction of the bridge in 1995 and completed it 14 August 1999. Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden met midway across the bridge-tunnel on 14 August 1999 to celebrate its completion. The official dedication took place on 1 July 2000, with Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden as the hostess and host of the ceremony. Because of the death of nine people, including three Danes and three Swedes, at the Roskilde Festival the evening before, the ceremony opened with a minute of silence. The bridge-tunnel opened for public traffic later that day. On 12 June 2000, two weeks before the dedication, 79,871 runners competed in Broloppet, a half marathon from Amager, Denmark, to Scania, Sweden.\nDespite two schedule setbacks\u00a0\u2013 the discovery of 16 unexploded World War II bombs on the seafloor and an inadvertently skewed tunnel segment\u00a0\u2013 the bridge-tunnel was finished three months ahead of schedule.\nAlthough traffic between Denmark and Sweden increased by 61 percent in the first year after the bridge opened, traffic levels were not as high as expected, perhaps due to high tolls. However, since 2005, traffic levels have increased rapidly. This may be due to Danes buying homes in Sweden to take advantage of lower housing prices in Malm\u00f6 and commuting to work in Denmark. In 2012, to cross by car cost DKK 310, SEK 375 or \u20ac43, with discounts of up to 75% available to regular users. In 2007, almost 25\u00a0million people travelled over the \u00d8resund Bridge: 15.2\u00a0million by car and bus and 9.6\u00a0million by train. By 2009, the figure had risen to 35.6\u00a0million by car, coach or train.\nLink features.\nBridge.\nAt , the bridge covers half the distance between Sweden and the Danish island of Amager, the border between the two countries being from the Swedish end. The structure has a mass of 82,000 tonnes and supports two railway tracks beneath four road lanes in a horizontal girder extending along the entire length of the bridge. On both approaches to the three cable-stayed bridge sections, the girder is supported every by concrete piers. The two pairs of free-standing cable-supporting towers are tall allowing shipping vertical clearance under the main span, but most ships' captains prefer to pass through the unobstructed Drogden Strait above the \u00d8resund Tunnel. The cable-stayed main span is long. A girder and cable-stayed design was chosen to provide the specific rigidity necessary to carry heavy rail traffic, and also to resist large accumulations of ice.\nThe bridge experiences occasional brief closures during very severe weather, such as the St. Jude storm of October 2013.\nAccess bridges.\nThe access bridges are made up of 49 steel trusses resting on concrete piers. The steel spans have a length of except at the bridge abutments, where they are shorter at . They were manufactured by Dragados Offshore in Puerto Real near C\u00e1diz, Spain, one of the few companies in Europe with sufficient capacity. Steel plates from British Steel were cut and welded together to form the various components of the truss spans, which were then joined together to form long spans. These were fitted with a reinforced concrete roadway on the upper level and a concrete railway deck on the lower level. The finished sections were towed on barges to Sundlink's facility in \"Norra hamnen\". Here, the spans were equipped with special concrete troughs for the railway tracks, footbridges along the tracks, etc. Stairs connect the road and railway levels every . Three inspection gondolas are suspended under the bridge.\nThe piers are individually designed, taking into account the calculated load and the bedrock level, resulting in the bridge gradually reaching the vertical clearance of the main span. The pillars rest on concrete caissons fixed in the bedrock. The pylons of the main span, as well as three piers on either side of them, are surrounded by underwater reefs to reduce the risk of larger ships colliding with the bridge. Both caissons and pylons were manufactured in the \"Norra hamnen\". The caissons, piers and truss spans were transported to their locations in the Sound by the \"Svanen\" crane barge. The bridge sections were welded together, but at regular intervals space was left for the thermal expansion of the steel.\nMain span.\nThe main span over the Flintr\u00e4nnan fairway is the world's longest cable-stayed bridge for both road and rail traffic. The choice to build a cable-stayed bridge instead of a suspension bridge was based, among other things, on the fact that a suspension bridge could have become unstable if a high-speed train or a heavy freight train were to brake sharply on such a bridge. The bridge is suspended by steel cables attached to tall pylons. The distance between the pylons is and the total length of the main span is . The vertical clearance is .\nThe upper level for vehicular traffic consists of a truss of steel beams supporting a concrete roadway. The lower level consists of a continuous railway deck, a sealed steel box. The two decks are held together by vertical trusses. Every thirty meters there are brackets, \"outriggers\", for suspension in the pylon cables. The steel span was built by Karlskronavarvet with the help of several Swedish and Norwegian subcontractors, including Kockums in Malm\u00f6, Norwegian Excon, SSAB in Oxel\u00f6sund and Knislinge Mekaniska Verkstad. In the \"Norra hamnen\" of Malm\u00f6, the span was equipped with a concrete roadway, railroad tracks, etc. and could then be transported to the site by \"Svanen\".\nPylons, bearings and cables.\nThe foundations of the pylons are hollow concrete caissons anchored in the limestone bedrock. They were manufactured in Kockums' dry dock in Malm\u00f6 and towed to site. There they were filled with concrete and ballast. The pylons themselves were cast using equipment that climbed up the already completed sections. At a height of , a concrete crossbeam high and wide was cast to connect each pair of pylons. Higher up, continuous steel elements were placed for the attachment of the stay cables. The pylons taper towards the top (cross-section at the bottom , at the top ). The outer sides are completely vertical while those facing inwards are slightly inclined.\nDue to high longitudinal and transverse loads acting over the bridge and to accommodate movements between the superstructure and substructure, it has bearings weighing up to each, capable of bearing vertical loads up to in a longitudinal direction and up to in transverse direction. The design, manufacturing and installation of the bearings were carried out by the Swiss civil engineering firm mageba.\nVibration issues, caused by several cables in the bridge moving under certain wind and temperature conditions, were combatted with the installation of compression spring dampers installed in pairs at the centre of the cables. Two of these dampers were equipped with laser gauges for ongoing monitoring. Testing, development and installation of these spring dampers was carried out by specialists Lesj\u00f6fors.\nThe bridge span between the pylons is long. It is suspended by stay cables attached to the outriggers, two cables in each. The cables go to the cast-in steel elements in the pylons and the force is then transmitted through cables down to the outriggers of the outer bridge spans. The outer spans are anchored with pre-tensioned cables that run down through the piers.\nPeberholm.\nThe western part of the bridge joins the \u00d8resund Tunnel on Peberholm, an artificial island, just south of the island of Saltholm on the Danish side. The Danes chose the name Peberholm (Pepper Islet) to complement the natural island of Saltholm (Salt Islet). The island was built from dredged material from the bottom of the Sound and elsewhere. For instance, large stones from a rock construction site in Kungshamn, Bohusl\u00e4n, came to line the island together with local Scanian stone from Dalby. Peberholm is approximately long with an average width of and is high.\nAt Peberholm, the railroad turns off the highway and runs parallel to the highway down into the \u00d8resund Tunnel. On the island there is a junction where trains can be switched between the two tracks. Exits connect the highway with roads dedicated to maintenance work on the island. In addition, there is a helipad on the island for emergencies, for example in the event of a serious road accident.\nPeberholm is a nature reserve and public visits are generally not allowed outside the highway. The island has been allowed to develop its own nature without active human intervention. Several rare species have established themselves on the island.\n\u00d8resund Tunnel.\nThe connection between Peberholm and the likewise artificial peninsula at Kastrup on Amager island, the nearest populated part of Denmark, descend under the Drogden fairway, through the \u00d8resund Tunnel (\"\u00d8resundstunnelen\"). The tunnel comes up on Amager at Copenhagen Airport. The main reason for continuing the link underwater, and not on a bridge, is that a bridge would pose a risk to air traffic to and from the airport.\nIt comprises a immersed tube plus entry tunnels at each end. At the descent into the tunnel, the railroad turns and runs right next to the highway. The tube tunnel is made from 20 prefabricated reinforced concrete segments\u00a0\u2013 the largest in the world at 55,000 tonnes each\u00a0\u2013 interconnected in a trench dug in the seabed. Two tubes in the tunnel carry railway tracks, two carry roads and a small fifth tube is provided for emergencies. The tubes are arranged side by side. For safety reasons, freight trains carrying dangerous goods cannot be in the same tunnel tube at the same time as other trains, which reduces capacity slightly.\nLand connections.\nLand connections link the \u00d8resund Link to Danish and Swedish roads and railways. The highway connects to the Outer Ring Road in Malm\u00f6 and the \"\u00d8resundsmotorvejen\" (the \u00d8resund Highway) in Copenhagen. The \u00d8resund Line connects to Copenhagen Central Station on the Danish side and the Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel and the Continental Line on the Swedish side.\nOn the Danish side, the Copenhagen Airport railway station is situated right at Copenhagen Airport, just west of the \u00d8resund Tunnel entrance. Next to it is the Lufthavnen station located. A station of the Copenhagen Metro. There are also connecting tracks to a maintenance workshop. A separate freight track allows freight trains to pass without going past the platforms. However, the crossing freight trains reduce capacity and further measures are required in the foreseeable future to increase the capacity of the railway around Copenhagen Airport.\nOn the Swedish side, the Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel was only completed at the end of 2010, more than a decade after the opening of the \u00d8resund Link. Before that, all trains had to run on the Continental Line around Malm\u00f6. In Malm\u00f6, trains going further north had to turn around because the station was a terminus. The Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel now allows trains to travel directly between the \u00d8resund Link and Malm\u00f6 Central Station through a tunnel under the city.\nTraffic.\nTraffic over the \u00d8resund Link consists of both road and rail traffic. Traffic volumes increased sharply in the first years of the link, reaching saturation around 2008. This was followed by a minor decline, the 2008 financial crisis, and a more dramatic one, the COVID-19 recession. Recently, traffic in 2024 reached 15 million rail passengers, the highest to date.\nRoad traffic.\nRoad traffic over the link consists mainly of passenger cars, goods vehicles and trucks. A small proportion of traffic is made up of buses and motorcycles. Around seven million vehicles cross the link each year, of which around 90% are passenger cars. During most of the year, around half a million vehicles pass through per month, while during the summer, traffic amounts to more than 800 000 vehicles per month.\nRail transport.\nThe rail link is operated jointly by the Swedish Transport Administration (\"Trafikverket\") and the Danish railway infrastructure manager Banedanmark. Passenger train service is commissioned by Sk\u00e5netrafiken and the Danish Civil Aviation and Railway Authority (\"Trafikstyrelsen\") under the \u00d8resundst\u00e5g (\"\u00d8resund train\") brand, with Transdev and DSB being the current operators. A series of new dual-voltage trains was developed, linking the Copenhagen area with Malm\u00f6 and southern Sweden as far as Gothenburg, Karlskrona and Kalmar. SJ operates X2000 trains over the bridge, with connections to Gothenburg and Stockholm. Copenhagen Airport at Kastrup has its own railway station close to the western bridgehead. Since December 2022, trains operate typically every 15 minutes during the day, reducing to once an hour during the night in both directions. Additional \u00d8resundstrains are operated at rush hour. Freight trains also use the crossing.\nThe rail section is double track and capable of speeds of up to , but slower in Denmark, especially in the tunnel section. There were challenges related to the difference in electrification and signalling between the Danish and Swedish railway networks. The solution chosen is to switch the electrical system from Swedish 15 kV, 16.7 Hz to Danish 25 kV, 50 Hz before the eastern bridgehead at Lernacken in Sweden. The Swedish signaling system (ATC) is used with Swedish optical signals on the bridge and switches to Danish ATC on the western part of Peberholm, into Danish territory, which has been justified by the fact that the Swedish system allows higher speed () and costs less to install. There is no way of changing between a locomotive for Danish standard and one for Swedish standard. All rail vehicles using the bridge must be custom made for the standards of both countries.\nTrains run on the left in Sweden, and on the right in Denmark. Initially the switch was made at Malm\u00f6 Central Station, a terminus at that time. After the 2010 inauguration of the Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel connection, a tunnel was built at Burl\u00f6v, north of Malm\u00f6, where the two southbound tracks cross over the northbound pair. The railway in Malm\u00f6 thus uses the Danish standard.\nThe gradient of the bridge is 1.56%, which is clearly more than what is desired for freight trains, especially on a busy line such as the \u00d8resund Line, where fewer but heavier freight trains are desirable. The Danish Litra EG locomotives are 6-axle to cope with pulling heavy freight trains across \u00d8resund and the Great Belt Bridge. Other locomotives, such as the BR185, can also haul freight trains, but the wagon weight is limited to 1800 tons.\nBorder checks.\nThe border between Denmark and Sweden runs about west of the western pylon of the \u00d8resund Bridge, which is about east of the national border signs mounted on the nearest existing posts.\nAs the link is Sweden's national border, Swedish Customs carry out checks on vehicles directly after the toll booth at Lernacken. It is also the busiest border crossing in Sweden. The Swedish Customs carry out checks when smuggling is suspected. The \u00d8resund Bridge is the Swedish border where most drug seizures are made. Checks on \u00d8resundst\u00e5g (\u00d8resund trains) (towards Sweden) are carried out to prevent drugs and other illicit goods from entering Sweden.\nWith both Sweden and Denmark being part of the Nordic Passport Union since the 1950s, border controls between the two countries have been abolished for decades and travellers can normally move freely across the \u00d8resund Bridge. In 2001, both countries also joined the Schengen area, and since then the abolition of border controls is primarily regulated by European Union law, more specifically the Schengen acquis.\nHowever, in November 2015, during the European migrant crisis, Sweden introduced temporary border controls at the border to Denmark in accordance with the provisions of the Schengen acquis on the reintroduction of temporary internal border controls. As such, travellers into Sweden from Denmark (but not travellers into Denmark from Sweden) must show a valid passport or national ID card (citizens of EU/EEA countries) or passport and entry visa (if required) for nationals of other non-EU/EEA countries. The move marked a break with 60 years of border control free travel between the Nordic countries. In January 2016, these border measures were extended by a special carriers' liability, forcing carriers (such as bus, train and ferry companies) to check the identity of all passengers from Denmark before they boarded a bus, train or ferry to Sweden.\nIn May 2017, Sweden removed the carriers' liability, but the ordinary border controls carried out by the Swedish Police Authority remained on the Swedish side of the \u00d8resund Bridge. In accordance with the Schengen Borders Code, these border controls are only allowed for a period of six months at a time, and therefore have to be renewed twice a year. Currently (April 2025), the advice at the \u00d6resundst\u00e5g site is \"you need to bring valid ID with you\" when travelling by train across the bridge.\nCosts and benefits.\nThe cost of the \u00d8resund Link, including motorway and railway connections on land, was DKK 30.1 billion (~\u20ac4.0 billion) according to the 2000 year price index, with the cost of the bridge expected in 2003 to be recouped by 2037. In 2006, Sweden began work on the Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel, a SEK 9.45\u00a0billion connection with the bridge that was completed in December 2010. \nThe Link will be entirely user-financed. The owner company, \u00d8resundsbro Konsortiet, is in turn owned in equal parts by the Danish state and the Swedish state. \u00d8resundsbro Konsortiet has taken loans guaranteed by the governments to finance the Link and the user fees are its only income. After the increase in traffic, these fees are enough to pay the interest and begin repaying the loans, which is expected to take about 30 years.\nTaxpayers have neither paid for the bridge nor the tunnel, but tax money has been used for the land connections. On the Danish side, the land connection has domestic benefits, mainly to connect the airport to the railway network. The Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel has the benefit of connecting the southern part of the inner city to the rail network and allowing many more trains to and from Malm\u00f6.\nAccording to The \u00d6resund Committee, the bridge has made a national economic gain of DKK 57 billion, or SEK 78 billion SEK (~\u20ac8.41 billion) on both sides of the strait by increased commuting and lower commuting expense. The gain is estimated to be SEK 6.5 billion per year but this could be increased to 7.7 billion by removing the three biggest obstacles to integration and mobility, the two largest being that non-EU nationals in Sweden are not allowed to work in Denmark and that many professional qualifications and merits are not mutually recognised.\nA 2021 study found that the bridge led to an increase in innovation in Malm\u00f6. The key mechanism appears to be that high-skilled workers were drawn to Malm\u00f6. A 2022 study found that the bridge caused an increase of 13.5% in the average wage of workers in the region, as the bridge expanded the size of the labor market.\nAesthetic considerations.\nThe \u00d8resund Bridge has been criticized for being too \"brutalist\". Other critics have lamented that the project did not dare to take risks, that it relied on tried and true solutions. Danish architect Georg Rotne wanted to create a powerful bridge. All steel details are painted black. The pylons are illuminated at night but nothing else of the bridge. Some details of the design have no purely technical or economic justification but are added for aesthetic reasons:\nPossible future development.\nThere are no firm plans for an extension of the \u00d8resund Link or a new complementary link. However, there are several different proposals for a new complementary link.\nEnvironmental effects.\nThe underwater parts of the bridge have become covered in marine organisms and act as an artificial reef.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The i486DX2 was nearly identical to the i486DX, but it had additional clock multiplier circuitry. It was the second CPU chip to use clock doubling, whereby the processor runs two internal logic clock cycles per external bus cycle. An i486 DX2 was thus significantly faster than an i486 DX at the same bus speed thanks to the 8K on-chip cache shadowing the slower clocked external bus. Both 25/50 and 33/66 MHz Intel486 DX2 CPU uses the 800 nm process technology. With the internal clock doubler CPU, it boosts overall system performance between 50 and 70 percent above the original Intel486 DX series. In other words, the 50-MHz Intel486 DX2 provides about 70 percent improvement over the 25-MHz Intel486 and about 30-percent improvement over the 33-MHz Intel486 CPU. The 50-MHz Intel486 DX2 CPU was rated at 40 Dhrystone MIPS. The 66-MHz Intel486 DX2 version performed 54 (Dhrystone V1.1) MIPS.\nHistory.\nThe i486DX2-66 was a very popular processor for video games enthusiasts in the early to mid-90s. Often coupled with 4 to 8 MB of RAM and a VLB video card, this CPU was capable of playing virtually every game title available for years after its release, right up to the end of the MS-DOS game era, making it a \"sweet spot\" in terms of CPU performance and longevity. The introduction of 3D graphics spelled the end of the 486's reign, because of their heavy use of floating point calculations and the need for faster cache and more memory bandwidth. Developers began to target the P5 Pentium processor family almost exclusively with x86 assembly language optimizations which led to the usage of terms such as \"Pentium compatible processor\" for software requirements. An i486DX2-50 version was also available, but because the bus speed was 25\u00a0MHz rather than 33 MHz, this was a significantly less popular processor.\nVersions.\nThere are two major versions of the DX2 - Identified by P24 and P24D, the latter has a faster L1 cache mode, called \"write-back\", that improves performance. The original P24 version offered only the slower \"write-through\" cache mode. AMD and Cyrix both produced a competitor for the Intel i486DX2.\nThe 50-MHz Intel486 DX2 were available in production volumes for US$550 each in 1,000-pieces quantities at the time of the press.

Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill from 28 November to 1 December 1943. It was the first of the Allied World War II conferences involving the \"Big Three\" (the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom) and took place at the Soviet embassy in Tehran just over a year after the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. The meeting occurred shortly after the Cairo Conference was held in Egypt for a discussion between the United States, the United Kingdom, and China from 22 to 26 November 1943. The Big Three would not meet again until 1945, when the Yalta Conference was held in Crimea from 4 to 11 February and the Potsdam Conference was held in Allied-occupied Germany from 17 July to August 2. Notably, President Franklin D. Roosevelt arrived on the USS \"Iowa\".\nAlthough the three leaders arrived in Tehran with differing objectives, the main outcome of the meeting was a British and American commitment to opening a second front against Nazi Germany, thereby forcing it to pull military assets away from the Eastern Front with the Soviets. In addition to this decision, the Tehran Conference also addressed: the Big Three's relations with Turkey and Iran, as the former was being pressed to enter the conflict and the latter was under Allied occupation; operations in Yugoslavia and against Japan; and the envisaged settlement following the expected defeat of the Axis powers. A separate contract also saw the Big Three pledge to recognize Iranian independence.\nBackground.\nOnce the German-Soviet War broke out in June 1941, Churchill offered assistance to the Soviets, and an agreement to that effect was signed on 12 July 1941. However, Churchill, in a spoken radio transmission announcing the alliance with the Soviets, reminded listeners that the alliance would not change his stance against communism.\nDelegations had traveled between London and Moscow to arrange the implementation of that support, and when the United States joined the war in December 1941, the delegations met in Washington as well. A Combined Chiefs of Staff committee was created to co-ordinate British and American operations and their support to the Soviets. The consequences of a global war, the absence of a unified Allied strategy, and the complexity of allocating resources between Europe and Asia had not yet been sorted out, which soon gave rise to mutual suspicions between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. There was the question of opening a second front to alleviate the German pressure on the Soviet Red Army on the Eastern Front, the question of mutual assistance (since both the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were looking towards the United States for credit and material support, there was tension between the United States and Britain since the Americans had no desire to prop up the British Empire in the event of an Allied victory). Also, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom was prepared to give Stalin a free hand in Eastern Europe, and there was no common policy on how to deal with Germany after the war. Communications regarding those matters between Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin took place by telegrams and via emissaries, but it was evident that direct negotiations were urgently needed.\nStalin was reluctant to leave Moscow and unwilling to risk journeys by air. He went by train to Baku, and then by air. There were two planes at Baku; one for him piloted by a colonel-general and one for officials piloted by a colonel. but Stalin chose the colonel's aircraft, saying \"Colonel-Generals don't often pilot aircraft.\"\nRoosevelt was physically disabled and found travel difficult. Churchill was an avid traveller and, as part of an ongoing series of wartime conferences, had already met with Roosevelt five times in North America and twice in Africa and had also held two prior meetings with Stalin in Moscow. To arrange the urgently needed meeting, Roosevelt tried to persuade Stalin to travel to Cairo. Stalin turned down the offer and also offers to meet in Baghdad or Basra. He finally agreed to meet in Tehran in November 1943. Iran was a neutral country but was nevertheless invaded jointly by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union in August 1941.\nProceedings.\nThe conference was to convene at 16:00 on 28 November 1943. Stalin had arrived well before, followed by Roosevelt, who was brought in his wheelchair from his accommodation adjacent to the venue. Roosevelt, who had traveled to attend and whose health was already deteriorating, was met by Stalin. This was the first time that they had met. Churchill, walking with his general staff from their accommodations nearby, arrived half an hour later. According to Roosevelt's interpreter, Charles Bohlen, Roosevelt was accompanied by Harry Hopkins, who had served as Roosevelt's personal emissary to Churchill, and W. Averell Harriman, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Stalin was accompanied by Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov and military leader Kliment Voroshilov. Churchill brought Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden his CGS Alanbrooke, chief military assistant Hastings Ismay plus Dill, Cunningham, Portal, Boyle, and his interpreter Arthur Birse. Three Western women attended: Churchill's daughter Sarah, Averell Harriman's daughter Kathleen and Roosevelt's daughter Anna Boettiger.\nAs Stalin had been advocating for a second front since 1941, he was very pleased and felt that he had accomplished his principal goal for the meeting. Moving on, Stalin agreed to enter the war against Japan once Germany was defeated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Stalin pressed for a revision of Poland's eastern border with the Soviet Union to match the line set by British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon in 1920. In order to compensate Poland for the resulting loss of territory, the three leaders agreed to move the German-Polish border to the Oder and Neisse rivers. This decision was not formally ratified, however, until the Potsdam Conference of 1945.\nThe leaders then turned to the conditions under which the Western Allies would open a new front by invading northern France (Operation Overlord), as Stalin had pressed them to do since 1941. Until then, Churchill had advocated the expansion of joint operations of British, American, and Commonwealth forces in the Mediterranean, as opening a new western front had been physically impossible because of a lack of existing shipping routes. That left the Mediterranean and Italy as viable goals for 1943. It was agreed Operation Overlord would be launched by American and British forces by May 1944 and that Stalin would support the Allies with a concurrent major offensive on Germany's eastern front (Operation Bagration) to divert German forces from northern France.\nAdditional offensives were also discussed to complement the undertaking of Operation Overlord, including the possible allied invasion of southern France prior to the landings at Normandy with the goal of drawing German forces away from the northern beaches and even a possible strike at the northern tip of the Adriatic to circumvent the Alps and drive towards Vienna. Either plan would have relied on Allied divisions engaged against the German Army in Italy around the time of the conference.\nChurchill argued for the invasion of Italy in 1943, then Overlord in 1944, on the basis that Overlord was physically impossible in 1943 for lack of shipping and that it would be unthinkable to do anything important until it could be launched. Churchill successfully proposed to Stalin a westward movement of Poland, which Stalin accepted. It gave the Poles industrialized German land to the west but took marshlands to the east. It also provided a territorial buffer to the Soviet Union against invasion. Churchill's plan involved a border along the Oder and the Neisse, which he views to give Poland a fair compensation for the Eastern Borderlands.\nDiscussion on Iran and Turkey.\nIran and Turkey were discussed in detail. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin all agreed to support the Iranian government, as addressed in the following declaration:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Three Governments realize that the war has caused special economic difficulties for Iran, and they all agreed that they will continue to make available to the Government of Iran such economic assistance as may be possible, having regard to the heavy demands made upon them by their world-wide military operations, and to the world-wide shortage of transport, raw materials, and supplies for civilian consumption.\nIn addition, the Soviets pledged support to Turkey if it entered the war. Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin agreed that it would also be most desirable if Turkey entered on the Allies' side before the year was out. In order to encourage Turkey to act as soon as possible, they agreed to make \"the offer to take Crete and the Dodecanese islands because they are rather close to Turkey.\"\nDinner meeting.\nBefore the Tripartite Dinner Meeting of 29 November 1943 at the Conference, Churchill presented Stalin with a specially commissioned ceremonial sword (the \"Sword of Stalingrad,\" made in Sheffield), as a gift from King George VI to the citizens of Stalingrad and the Soviet people, commemorating the Soviet victory at Stalingrad. When Stalin received the sheathed sword, he took it with both hands and kissed the scabbard. Stalin held the sword by the sheathe and angled the pommel downwards, causing the sword to slide out of its scabbard and fall to the ground. He then handed it to Marshal Kliment Voroshilov\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Without American machines the United Nations never could have won the war.\" \u2014\u200a\nStalin proposed executing 50,000 to 100,000 German officers so that Germany could not plan another war. Roosevelt, believing that Stalin was not serious, joked that \"maybe 49,000 would be enough.\" Churchill, however, was outraged and denounced \"the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country.\" He said that only war criminals should be put on trial in accordance with the Moscow Document, which he had written. He stormed out of the room but was brought back in by Stalin, who said he was joking. Churchill was glad Stalin had relented but thought that Stalin had been testing the waters.\nMilitary decisions.\nPolitical decisions.\nStalin and Churchill discussed the future borders of Poland, stating a variant of the so-called Curzon Line for the eastern border, supporting the annexation of the rest by the USSR, proposing annexation of German territories in the north and west to Poland instead. Roosevelt had asked to be excused from any discussion of Poland, stating it as matter for the effects of any decision on Polish voters in the US and the upcoming 1944 election. The decisions were not officially ratified until the Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference in 1945. Soon before the conference, the USSR unilaterally withdrew recognition of the Polish government-in-exile, still recognized by the UK and the US and the negotiations were made covertly without their involvement.\nDuring the negotiations, Roosevelt had demanded that the Republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia would be deemed as part of the Soviet Union only after the citizens 'voted' on the action. Roosevelt secured formal 'agreement', however, Stalin would not consent to any international control over the elections and stated that all issues would have to be resolved 'in accordance with the Soviet Constitution'. In the end, after Soviet occupation, the areas were subjected in accordance with Soviet plans. The US, for example in principle never officially recognised.\nResults.\nThe Yugoslav Partisans were given full Allied support, and Allied support to the Yugoslav Chetniks was halted. (They were believed to be cooperating with the occupying Italians and Germans rather than fighting them; see Yugoslavia and the Allies). The communist Partisans under Josip Broz Tito took power in Yugoslavia as the Germans gradually retreated from the Balkans in 1944 and 1945.\nTurkish President \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the Cairo Conference in November 1943 and promised to enter the war when his country had become fully armed. By August 1944, Turkey broke off relations with Germany. In February 1945, Turkey declared war on Germany and Japan, which may have been a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the future United Nations.\nOperation Overlord.\nRoosevelt and Stalin spent much of the conference to try to convince Churchill to commit to an invasion of France and finally succeeded on 30 November, when Roosevelt announced at lunch that they would be launching the invasion in May 1944. That pleased Stalin, who had been pressing his allies to open a new front in the west to alleviate some pressure on his troops. That decision may be the most critical to come out of this conference, as the desired effect of the relief of Soviet troops was achieved and led to a Soviet rally and advance toward Germany, a tide that Hitler could not stem.\nUnited Nations.\nThe Tehran Conference also served as one of the first conversations surrounding the formation of the United Nations. Roosevelt first introduced Stalin to the idea of an international organization comprising all nation states, a venue for the resolution of common issues, and a check against international aggressors. With Germany having thrust the world into chaos for the second time in as many generations, the three world leaders all agreed that something must be done to prevent a similar occurrence.\nDivision of Germany.\nThere was a shared view among the participants that a postwar division of Germany was necessary with the sides differing on the number of divisions needed to neutralize her ability to wage war. The numbers that were proposed varied widely and never came to fruition, but the powers would effectively divide modern Germany into two parts until the end of the Cold War. During one dinner, Churchill questioned Stalin on his postwar territorial ambitions. Stalin replied, \"There is no need to speak at this present time about any Soviet Desires, but when the time comes we will speak.\"\nSoviet entry to the Pacific War.\nOn 29 November, Roosevelt asked Stalin five questions about data and intelligence relating to Japanese and Siberian ports and about air bases in the Maritime Provinces for up to 1,000 heavy bombers. On 2 February, Stalin told the American ambassador that America could operate 1,000 bombers from Siberia after the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan (Vladivostok is in the Russian Far East, not Siberia).\nAlleged assassination plot.\nAccording to Soviet reports, German agents planned to kill the Big Three leaders at the Tehran Conference, but called off the assassination while it was still in the planning stage. The NKVD, the USSR's counterintelligence unit, first notified Mike Reilly, Roosevelt's chief of security, of the suspected assassination plot several days before Roosevelt's arrival in Tehran. Reilly had gone to Tehran several days early to evaluate security concerns and explore potential routes from Cairo to Tehran. Just before Reilly returned to Cairo, the NKVD informed him that dozens of Germans had been dropped into Tehran by parachute the day before. The NKVD suspected German agents were planning to kill the Big Three leaders at the Tehran Conference.\nWhen housing accommodations for the meeting were originally discussed, both Stalin and Churchill had extended invitations to Roosevelt, asking him to stay with them during the meeting. However, Roosevelt wanted to avoid the appearance of choosing one ally over another and decided it was important to stay at the American legation to remain independent. Roosevelt arrived in Tehran on 27 November 1943 and settled into the American legation. Close to midnight, Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's top aide, summoned Archibald Clark-Kerr (the British ambassador in the Soviet Union) and Averell Harriman (the American ambassador in the Soviet Union) to the Soviet embassy, warning them of an assassination plot against Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. Molotov informed them several assassins had been apprehended, but reported additional assassins were at large and expressed concerns for President Roosevelt's safety. Molotov advised Roosevelt should be moved to the safety of the British or Soviet embassy.\nAmericans suspected Stalin had fabricated the assassination plot as an excuse to have Roosevelt moved to the Soviet embassy. Mike Reilly, Roosevelt's chief of Secret Service, advised him to move to either the Soviet or British embassies for his safety. One of the underlying factors influencing their decision was the distance Churchill and Stalin would need to travel for meetings at the American legation. Harriman reminded the President that the Americans would be held responsible if Stalin or Churchill were assassinated while traveling to visit Roosevelt all the way across the city. Earlier that day, Molotov had agreed to hold all meetings at the American legation because traveling was difficult for Roosevelt. The timing of Molotov announcing an assassination plot later that night aroused suspicion that his motives were to keep Stalin safely within the guarded walls of the Soviet embassy. Harriman doubted the existence of an assassination plot, but urged the President to relocate to avoid the perception of putting Churchill and Stalin in danger. Roosevelt did not believe there was a credible threat of assassination, but agreed to the move so he could be closer to Stalin and Churchill. Living in the Soviet embassy also allowed Roosevelt to gain more direct access to Stalin and build his trust. Stalin liked having Roosevelt in the embassy because it eliminated the need to travel outside the compound and it allowed him to spy on Roosevelt more easily. The Soviet embassy was guarded by thousands of secret police and located adjacent to the British embassy, which allowed the Big Three to meet securely.\nAfter the Tehran Conference ended, Harriman asked Molotov whether there was really ever an assassination threat in Tehran. Molotov said that they knew about German agents in Tehran, but did not know of a specific assassination plot. Molotov's response minimized their assertions of an assassination plot, instead emphasizing that Stalin thought President Roosevelt would be safer at the Soviet embassy. American and British intelligence reports generally dismissed the existence of this plot and Otto Skorzeny, the alleged leader of the operation, later claimed that Hitler had dismissed the idea as unworkable before planning had even begun. The topic continues to be a theme of certain Russian historians.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mention of the breed can be found in old Hungarian texts. They have historically been royal guard dogs, or guarded livestock, but have been increasingly found in homes as pets over the last seventy years. The American Kennel Club includes the breed in the working dog group.\nHistory.\nFound in Western Anatolia, the Akbash dog breed is related to the Kuvasz, a Hungarian dog breed originating in Hungary. Known as a Pecheneg buffalo fighter, the Kuvasz originated in the Carpathian Basin and has since become renowned among Hungarian dogs worldwide. Its name likely derives from the Old Turkish word \"K\u00fcvaz.\" Some associate this dog breed with the Cuman-Kipchaks. It is also thought that it may have been a breed introduced to Hungary during the Migration Period.92\nIn the fifteenth century Matthias Corvinus is believed to have kept large numbers of Kuvasz dogs at his court as guard dogs or hunting dogs, or sometimes as war dogs.92\nSelective breeding of the Kuvasz as a breed began in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and a breed standard was drawn up.92 In 1934 it was accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale,92 which lists the date of full acceptance as 1954.\nBy the end of World War II, nearly all the Kuvasz dogs in Hungary had been killed. The dogs had such a reputation for protecting their families that they were actively sought and killed by German and Soviet soldiers, while at the same time some German officers used to take Kuvasz dogs home with them. After the Soviet invasion and the end of the war, the breed was nearly extinct in Hungary. After the war, it was revealed that fewer than thirty Kuvasz were left in Hungary and some sources indicate the number may have been as few as twelve. Since then, due to many dedicated breeders, Kuvasz breed have repopulated Hungary. However, as a result of this near extinction, the genetic pool available to breeders was severely restricted and there is conjecture that some may have used other breeds, such as the Great Pyrenees, to continue their programs.\nIn Romania, a breed-specific legislation specifies that Kuvasz must be muzzled when in public places.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Kuvasz is a large and powerful dog: dogs stand some 71\u201376 cm at the withers, with weights in the range 48\u201362 kg; bitches may stand 66\u201370 cm and weigh 37\u201350 kg.\nThe coat is white or ivory-white; it is thick and coarse, with a soft undercoat. The skin is slate-grey; the tip of the nose, the lips and the rims of the eyes are black, and the pads of the paws are black or slate-grey.92\nThe head is wedge-shaped; the muzzle is slightly less than half the full length of the head, and the stop is slight. The eyes are almond-shaped, dark brown, and slightly slanted.\nAlthough generally a healthy and robust breed which can be expected to live approximately 12\u201314 years, the Kuvasz is prone to developmental bone problems.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He ruled Austrasia (623\u2013634) and Neustria and Burgundy (629\u2013639). He has been described as the last king of the Merovingian dynasty to wield real royal power, after which the Mayor of the palace rose as the political and war leader. Dagobert was the first Frankish king to be buried in the royal tombs at the Basilica of Saint-Denis.\nRule in Austrasia.\nDagobert was the eldest son of Chlothar II and Haldetrude (575\u2013604) and the grandson of Fredegund. Chlothar had reigned alone over all the Franks since 613. In 622, Chlothar made Dagobert king of Austrasia, almost certainly to bind the Austrasian nobility to the ruling Franks. As a child, Dagobert lived under the care of the Carolingian dynasty fore-bearers and Austrasian magnates, Arnulf of Metz and Pepin of Landen.\nChlothar attempted to manage the unstable alliances he had with other noble families throughout much of Dagobert's reign. When Chlothar granted Austrasia to Dagobert, he initially excluded Alsace, the Vosges, and the Ardennes, but shortly thereafter the Austrasian nobility forced him to concede these regions to Dagobert. The rule of a Frank from the Austrasian heartland tied Alsace more closely to the Austrasian court. Dagobert created a new duchy (the later Duchy of Alsace) in southwest Austrasia to guard the region from Burgundian or Alemannic encroachments and ambitions. The duchy comprised the Vosges, the Burgundian Gate, and the Transjura. Dagobert made his courtier Gundoin\u2014who incidentally established monasteries in Alsace and Burgundy\u2014the first duke of this new polity that was to last until the end of the Merovingian dynasty. While Austrasian rulers such as Chlothar and Dagobert controlled these regions through part of the seventh-century, they eventually became autonomous kingdoms as powerful aristocratic families sought separate paths across their respective realms.\nUnited rule.\nUpon the death of his father in 629, Dagobert inherited the Neustrian and Burgundian kingdoms. His half-brother Charibert, son of Sichilde, claimed Neustria but Dagobert opposed him. Brodulf, brother of Sichilde, petitioned Dagobert on behalf of his young nephew, but Dagobert assassinated him and became sole king of the Franks. He later gave the Aquitaine to Charibert as a \"consolation prize\". In 629, Dagobert concluded a treaty with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, which entailed enforcing the compulsory baptism of Jews throughout his kingdom. Besides signing this treaty, Dagobert also took steps to secure trade across his empire by protecting important markets along the mouth of the Rhine at Duurstede and Utrecht, which in part explains his later determination to defend the Austrasian Franks from the Avar menace.\nUnder the rule of Dagobert's father and like-minded Merovingians, Frankish society during the seventh-century experienced greater integration\u2014the Catholic faith became predominant for instance\u2014and a generally improved economic situation, but there was no initial impetus for the political unification of Gaul. Clothar II did not seek to force his Neustrian neighbors into submission, choosing instead a policy of cooperation. This did not prohibit plunder-raids to replenish the dynastic coffers, which Dagobert undertook in Spain for example\u2014one raid there earned him 200,000 gold \"solidi\". Historian Ian Wood claims that Dagobert \"was probably richer than most Merovingian monarchs\" and cites for example his assistance to the Visigoth Sisenand\u2014whom he aided in his rise to the Visigothic throne in Spain\u2014and for which, Sisenand awarded Dagobert a golden dish weighing some .\nWhen Charibert and his son Chilperic were assassinated in 632, Dagobert had Burgundy and Aquitaine firmly under his rule, becoming the most powerful Merovingian king in many years and the most respected ruler in the West. In 631, Dagobert led a large army against Samo, the ruler of the Slavic Wends, partly at the request of the Germanic peoples living in the eastern territories and also due to Dagobert's quarrel with him about the Wends having robbed and killed a number of Frankish merchants. While Dagobert's Austrasian forces were defeated at the Wogastisburg, his Alemannic and Lombard allies were successful in repelling the Wends. Taking advantage of the situation at the time, the Saxons offered to help Dagobert if he agreed to rescind the 500 cow yearly tribute to the Austrasians. Despite accepting this agreement, Fredegar reports that it was to little avail since the Wends attacked again the following year.\nRule in Neustria, from Paris.\nAlso in 632, the nobles of Austrasia revolted under the mayor of the palace, Pepin of Landen. In 634, Dagobert appeased the rebellious nobles by putting his three-year-old son, Sigebert III, on the throne, thereby ceding royal power in the easternmost of his realms, just as his father had done for him eleven years earlier. In historian Ian Wood's view, Dagobert's creation of a sub-kingdom for his son Sigibert had \"important long-term implications for the general structure of Merovingian Francia.\"\nAs king, Dagobert made Paris his capital. During his reign, he built the Altes Schloss in Meersburg (in modern Germany), which today is the oldest inhabited castle in that country. Devoutly religious, Dagobert was also responsible for the construction of the Saint Denis Basilica at the site of a Benedictine monastery in Paris. He also appointed St. Arbogast bishop of Strasbourg. Dagobert was beloved in many ways according to Fredegar, who wrote that \"He rendered justice to rich and poor alike,\" adding that, \"he took little sleep or food, and cared only so to act that all men should leave his presence full of joy and admiration.\" Such images do not fully convey the power and domination wielded by Frankish kings like Dagobert, who along with his father Chlothar, reigned to such a degree that historian Patrick Geary described the period of their combined rule as the \"apogee of Merovingian royal power.\"\nDagobert went down in history as one of the greatest Frankish kings, in spite of his mediocre military record (cf. his defeats by the Saxons and the Wends), having held his lands against the eastern hordes and with noblemen as far away as Bavaria, who sought his overlordship. Only thirty six when he died, Dagobert is considered the last of the great Merovingian kings by most historians, but this does not mean there was a major waning in Frankish power, especially in light of the writings of Paul the Deacon and John of Toledo. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill stated that Dagobert \"had the ruthless energy of a Clovis and the cunning of a Charlemagne.\" Despite having more or less united the Frankish realms, he was probably not expecting unitary rule to continue given the diverging interests of the Austrasian and Neustrian Franks, atop those of the Aquitanians and Burgundians. Upon Dagobert's death in 639, Pepin of Landen was able to recoup his position at Metz. Meanwhile, Dagobert was buried in the abbey of Saint Denis Basilica, Paris, the first Frankish king to be buried there. Dagobert's interment at Saint-Denis established a precedent for the burial of future French rulers there.\nLegacy.\nThe pattern of division and assassination, which characterized king Dagobert's reign, continued for the next century until Pepin the Short finally deposed the last Merovingian king in 751, establishing the Carolingian dynasty. The Merovingian boy-kings remained ineffective rulers who inherited the throne as young children and lived only long enough to produce a male heir or two, while real power lay in the hands of the noble families who exercised feudal control over most of the land.\nIn the 830s, a biography of Dagobert, the \"Gesta Dagoberti\", was written, probably by Hincmar. It is mostly unreliable, but does contain some information based on authentic archival documents. Dagobert was immortalized in the song \"Le bon roi Dagobert\" (\"The Good King Dagobert\"), a nursery rhyme featuring exchanges between the king and his chief adviser, Saint Eligius (\"Eloi\" in French). The satirical rhymes place Dagobert in various ridiculous positions from which Eligius' good advice manages to extract him. The text, which probably originated in the 18th century, became extremely popular as an expression of the anti-monarchist sentiment of the French Revolution. Other than placing Dagobert and Eligius in their respective roles, it has no historical accuracy.\nIn 1984, a 112 minute long French-Italian comedy, \"Le bon roi Dagobert\" (\"Good King Dagobert\") was made, based on Dagobert I. The soundtrack was composed by Guido &amp; Maurizio De Angelis, Starring Ugo Tognazzi, Coluche and Michel Serrault.\nMarriage and children.\nAccording to the \"Chronicle of Fredegar\" Dagobert I had \"three queens almost simultaneously, as well as several concubines\". The \"rex Brittanorum\" Judicael came to Clichy to visit Dagobert I, but opted not to dine with him due to his misgivings about Dagobert's moral choices, instead dining with the king's referendary St. Audoen.\nThe \"Chronicle of Fredegar\" names the three queens as Nanthild, Wulfegundis, and Berchildis, but does not name any of the concubines. In 625/6 Dagobert married Gormatrude, a sister of his father's wife Sichilde. The marriage was childless. After divorcing Gormatrude in 629/30 he made Nanthild, a Saxon servant (\"puella\") from his personal entourage, his new queen. She gave birth to Clovis II (b. 634/5) later king of Neustria and Burgundy.\nShortly after his marriage to Nanthild, a woman called Ragnetrude bore Dagobert I a son, Sigebert III (b. 630/1) later king of Austrasia. It has been speculated that Regintrud, abbess of Nonnberg Abbey, was also a child of Dagobert I, although this theory does not fit Regintrud's supposed date of birth between 660 and 665. She married into the Bavarian Agilolfing family, either Theodo of Bavaria or his son Theodbert of Bavaria.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Much of his professional career was spent in the court of Frederick the Great, where he served as the king's flute teacher. Quantz composed hundreds of flute sonatas and concertos, and wrote \"On Playing the Flute\", an influential treatise on flute performance. His works were known and appreciated by Bach, Haydn and Mozart.\nBiography.\n1697\u20131723: Early life.\nQuantz was born as Han\u00df Jochim Quantz in Oberscheden, near G\u00f6ttingen, Lower Saxony, in the Electorate of Hanover. His father, Andreas Quantz, was a blacksmith who died when Hans was not yet 11; on his deathbed, he declared that his son should follow in his footsteps. Quantz states in his autobiography that he had been trained as a blacksmith from the age of nine. As a result of his father's death he was given the opportunity to choose his own career path and from 1708 to 1713 he began his musical studies with his uncle Justus Quantz, a town musician in Merseburg; he also studied for a time with a cousin's husband, the organist Johann Friedrich Kiesewetter. From 1714, Quantz studied composition extensively and pored over scores of the masters to adopt their style.\nIn 1716 he joined the town band in Dresden, where in 1717 he studied counterpoint with Jan Dismas Zelenka. In March 1718 he was appointed oboist in the newly formed Dresden Polish Chapel of August II, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. As it became clear that he couldn't advance as an oboist in the Polish Chapel, Quantz decided to pursue the flute, studying briefly in 1719 with Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin, principal flute in the Royal Orchestra. He became good friends with Johann Georg Pisendel, concertmaster of the Royal Orchestra, who greatly influenced his style.\n1724\u20131727: Grand tour.\nBetween 1724 and 1727 Quantz completed his education by doing a \"Grand Tour\" of Europe as a flautist. He studied counterpoint with Francesco Gasparini in Rome, met Alessandro Scarlatti in Naples, befriended the flutist Michel Blavet in Paris, and in London was encouraged by Handel to remain there. During Carnival 1728 the Crown Prince, Frederick the Great, visited Dresden and met or rehearsed with Pisendel and Quantz. In April Frederick suffered from depressions and hardly ate anything; his father feared for his life. In May 1728 Quantz accompanied August II on a state visit to Berlin. The Queen of Prussia was impressed and wanted to hire him for her son. Though August II refused, he allowed Quantz to travel to Berlin and Bayreuth twice a year. In June 1730 he took part in the and travelled to Berlin. Quantz later told writer Friedrich Nicolai that he and Hans Hermann von Katte one day had to hide in a closet during an outburst of Frederick's domineering father, who disapproved of his son's hairstyle, musical studies, questionable books and fancy dressing gowns. Quantz married Anna Rosina Carolina Schindler in 1737; the marriage was not happy, and it was generally known in Berlin that his wife tyrannized him. Until 1741 Quantz remained at the Saxon Court in Dresden.\n1741\u20131773: Court of Frederick.\nWhen Frederick II became King of Prussia in 1740, Quantz finally accepted a position as flute teacher, flute maker and composer. He joined at the court in Berlin in December 1741 and stayed there for the rest of his career. He made flutes from at least 1739 and was an innovator in flute design, adding a second key (Eb, in addition to the standard D#) to help with intonation, for example. Frederick owned 11 flutes made by Quantz.\nAs well as writing hundreds of sonatas and concertos, mainly for the flute, he is known today as the author of \"Versuch einer Anweisung die Fl\u00f6te traversiere zu spielen\" (1752) (titled \"On Playing the Flute\" in English), a treatise on traverso flute playing. It is a valuable source of reference regarding performance practice and flute technique in the 18th century.\nQuantz never joined his orchestra, lived in Berlin-Mitte (Kronenstrasse), but played at Frederick's court until his death in 1773. A biography appeared in 1755 in Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg's \"Historisch-kritischen Beytr\u00e4gen zur Aufnahme der Musik\"; another, in Italian, followed in 1762. His grandnephew, Albert Quantz, published a full-length biography in 1877.\nWorks.\nFew of Quantz's works were published during his lifetime. Most of them are for transverse flute, including more than 200 sonatas, around 300 concertos, including several for two flutes; around 45 trio sonatas (mostly for 2 flutes or flute and violin, with continuo); 6 quartets for flute, violin, viola and continuo; various flute duets and flute trios; and unaccompanied caprices and fantasias for flute.\nThe thematic catalog for Quantz's works was published by Horst Augsbach. 'QV' stands for 'Quantz Verzeichnis', and 'Anh.' for 'Anhang' (\"supplement\") when the authenticity of the works is in doubt. A number of additional works have been discovered or come to light since its publication.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70393", "revid": "50598494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70393", "title": "Countertenor", "text": "High classical male singing voice\nA countertenor (also contra tenor) is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types, generally extending from around E3 to D5 or E5, although a sopranist (a specific kind of countertenor) may match the soprano's range of around C4 to C6. Countertenors often have tenor or baritone chest voices, but sing in falsetto or head voice much more often than they do in their chest voice.\nThe nature of the countertenor voice has radically changed throughout musical history, from a modal voice, to a modal and falsetto voice, to the primarily falsetto voice that is denoted by the term today. This is partly because of changes in human physiology (increase in body height) and partly because of fluctuations in pitch.\nThe term first came into use in England during the mid-17th century and was in wide use by the late 17th century. The use of adult male falsettos in polyphony, commonly in the soprano range, was known in European all-male sacred choirs for some decades previous, as early as the mid-16th century. Modern-day ensembles such as the Tallis Scholars and the Sixteen have countertenors on alto parts in works of this period. There is no evidence that falsetto singing was known in Britain before the early 17th century, when it was occasionally heard on soprano parts.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was great interest in and renewed popularity of the countertenor voice, partly due to pioneers such as Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin, as well as the increased popularity of Baroque opera and the need of male singers to replace the castrati roles in such works. Although the voice has been considered largely an early music phenomenon, there is a growing modern repertoire collection for countertenors, especially in contemporary music.\nHistory.\nEarly centuries.\nIn polyphonic compositions of the 14th and early 15th centuries, the \"contratenor\" was a voice part added to the basic two-part contrapuntal texture of discant (\"superius\") and tenor (from the Latin , which means to hold, since this part \"held\" the music's melody, while the \"superius\" descanted upon it at a higher pitch). Though having approximately the same range as the tenor, it was generally of a much less melodic nature than either of these other two parts. With the introduction in about 1450 of four-part writing by composers such as Ockeghem and Obrecht, the \"contratenor\" split into \"contratenor altus\" and \"contratenor bassus\", which were respectively above and below the tenor. Later the term became obsolete: in Italy, \"contratenor altus\" became simply \"altus\", in France, \"haute-contre\", and in England, countertenor. Though originally these words were used to designate a vocal part, they are now used to describe singers of that part, whose vocal techniques may differ (see below).\nIn the Catholic Church during the Renaissance, St. Paul's admonition \"mulieres in ecclesiis taceant\" (\"let the women keep silence in the churches\") still prevailed, and women were banned from singing in church services. Countertenors, though rarely described as such, therefore found a prominent part in liturgical music, whether singing a line alone or with boy trebles or altos. (Spain had a long tradition of male falsettists singing soprano lines). Countertenors were hardly ever used for roles in early opera, however, the rise of which coincided with the arrival of a fashion for castrati. For example, the latter took several roles in the first performance of Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\" (1607). Castrati were already prominent by this date in Italian church choirs, replacing both falsettists and trebles; the last soprano falsettist singing in Rome, Juan [Johannes de] San[c]tos (a Spaniard), died in 1652. In Italian opera, by the late seventeenth century castrati predominated, while in France, the modal high tenor, called the \"haute-contre\", was established as the voice of choice for leading male roles.\nIn England Purcell wrote significant music for a higher male voice that he called a \"counter-tenor\", for example, the roles of Secrecy and Summer in \"The Fairy-Queen\" (1692). \"These lines have often challenged modern singers, who have been unsure whether they are high tenor parts or are meant for falsettists\". Contemporary vocal treatises, however, make clear that Purcell's singers would have been trained to blend both methods of vocal production. In Purcell's choral music the situation is further complicated by the occasional appearance of more than one solo part designated \"countertenor\", but with a considerable difference in range and tessitura. Such is the case in \"Hail, bright Cecilia\" (\"The Ode on St Cecilia's Day 1692\") in which the solo, \"'Tis Nature's Voice\", has the range F3 to B\u266d4 (similar to those stage roles cited previously), whereas, in the duet, \"Hark each tree\", the countertenor soloist sings from E4 to D5 (in the trio \"With that sublime celestial lay\". Later in the same work, Purcell's own manuscript designates the same singer, Mr Howel, described as \"a High Contra tenor\" to perform in the range G3 to C4; it is very likely that he took some of the lowest notes in a well-blended \"chest voice\"\u00a0\u2013 see below).\n18th century.\n\"The Purcell counter-tenor 'tenor' did not flourish in England much beyond the early years of the [eighteenth] century; within twenty years of Purcell's death Handel had settled in London and \"opera seria\", which was underpinned entirely by Italian singing, soon became entrenched in British theatres\". In parallel, by Handel's time, castrati had come to dominate the English operatic stage as much as that of Italy (and indeed most of Europe outside France). They also took part in several of Handel's oratorios, though countertenors, too, occasionally featured as soloists in the latter, the parts written for them being closer in compass to the higher ones of Purcell, with a usual range of A3 to E5. They also sang the alto parts in Handel's choruses. It was as choral singers within the Anglican church tradition (as well as in the secular genre of the glee) that countertenors survived as performers throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Otherwise they largely faded from public notice.\n20th century.\nThe most visible person of the countertenor revival in the twentieth century was Alfred Deller, an English singer and champion of authentic early music performance. Deller initially identified as an \"alto\", but his collaborator Michael Tippett recommended the archaic term \"countertenor\" to describe his voice. In the 1950s and 60s, his group, the Deller Consort, was important in increasing audiences' awareness (and appreciation) of Renaissance and Baroque music. Deller was the first modern countertenor to achieve fame and has had many prominent successors. Benjamin Britten wrote the leading role of Oberon in his setting of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1960) especially for Deller. The countertenor role of Apollo in Britten's \"Death in Venice\" (1973) was created by James Bowman, the best-known amongst the next generation of English countertenors. Russell Oberlin was Deller's American counterpart and another early music pioneer. Oberlin's success was entirely unprecedented in a country that did not have much experience of performance of works prior to Bach, and it paved the way for the great success of countertenors following him. Oberlin, however, harked back to the earlier tradition of countertenors using only their modal voices.\nToday, countertenors are much in demand in many forms of classical music. In opera, many roles originally written for castrati (castrated males) are now sung and recorded by countertenors, as are some trouser roles originally written for female singers. The former category is much more numerous and includes Orfeo in Gluck's and many Handel roles, such as the name parts in \"Rinaldo\", , and \"Orlando\", and Bertarido in \"Rodelinda\". Mozart also had castrati roles in his operas, including Aminta in , Cecilio in , Ramiro in , Idamante in , and Sesto in .\nMany modern composers other than Britten have written, and continue to write, countertenor parts, both in choral works and opera, as well as songs and song-cycles for the voice. Men's choral groups such as Chanticleer and the King's Singers employ the voice to great effect in a variety of genres, including early music, gospel, and even folk songs. Other recent operatic parts written for the countertenor voice include Edgar in Aribert Reimann's \"Lear\" (1978), the messenger in his \"Medea\" (2010), Prince Go-Go in Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's \"Le Grand Macabre\" (1978), the title role in Philip Glass's \"Akhnaten\" (1983), Claire in John Lunn's \"The Maids\" (1998), the Refugee in Jonathan Dove's \"Flight\" (1998), Trinculo in Thomas Ad\u00e8s's \"The Tempest\" (2004), the Boy in George Benjamin's \"Written on Skin\" (2012) and several others (see Roles in opera below).\nVocal range.\nThe vocal range of a countertenor is equivalent to that of the female contralto or mezzo-soprano voice types. A trained countertenor will typically have a vocal centre similar in placement to that of a contralto or mezzo-soprano. Peter Giles, a professional countertenor and noted author on the subject, defines the countertenor as a musical part rather than as a vocal style or mechanism. In modern usage, the term \"countertenor\" is essentially equivalent to the medieval term \"contratenor altus\" (see above). In this way, a countertenor singer can be operationally defined as a man who sings the countertenor part, whatever vocal style or mechanism is employed. The countertenor range is generally equivalent to an alto range, extending from approximately G3 to D5 or E5. In comparison to female voices the male voice usually has an extended range towards the low notes, but the lowest parts of the range are usually not used. In actual practice, it is generally acknowledged that a majority of countertenors sing with a falsetto vocal production for at least the upper half of this range, although most use some form of \"chest voice\" (akin to the range of their speaking voice) for the lower notes. The most difficult challenge for such a singer is managing the lower middle range, for there are normally a few notes (around B\u266d3) that can be sung with either vocal mechanism, and the transition between registers must somehow be blended or smoothly managed.\nIn response to the (in his view) pejorative connotation of the term falsetto, Giles refuses to use it, calling the upper register \"head voice\". Many voice experts would disagree with this choice of terminology, reserving the designation \"head voice\" for the high damped register accompanied by a relatively low larynx that is typical of modern high operatic tenor voice production. The latter type of head voice is, in terms of the vocal cord vibration, actually more similar to \"chest voice\" than to falsetto, since it uses the same \"speaking voice\" production (referred to as \"modal\" by voice scientists), and this is reflected in the timbre.\nTerminology.\nParticularly in the British choral tradition, the terms \"male soprano\" and \"male alto\" serve to identify men who rely on falsetto vocal production, rather than the modal voice, to sing in the soprano or alto vocal range. Elsewhere, the terms have less universal currency. Some authorities do accept them as descriptive of male falsettists, although this view is subject to controversy; they would reserve the term \"countertenor\" for men who, like Russell Oberlin, sing in the alto range with little or no falsetto, equating it with \"haute-contre\" and the Italian \"tenor altino\". Adherents to this view maintain that a countertenor will have unusually short vocal cords and consequently a higher speaking voice and lower range and tessitura than their falsettist counterparts, perhaps from D3 to D5. Operatic vocal classification, on the other hand, prefers the terms \"countertenor\" and \"sopranist\" to \"male alto\" and \"male soprano\", and some scholars consider the latter two terms inaccurate owing to physiological differences between male and female vocal production.\nRoles in opera and oratorio.\nNotable countertenor roles include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nSources"}

Chlothar took power upon the death of his mother in 597; though rich, his realm was one of the smallest portions of Francia. He continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution by dismemberment in 613, after winning the battle that enabled Chlothar to unite Francia under his rule. Like his father, he built up his territories by seizing lands after the deaths of other kings.\nHis reign was long by contemporary standards, but saw the continuing erosion of royal power to the French nobility and the church against a backdrop of feuding among the Merovingians. The Edict of Paris in 614, concerned with several aspects of appointments to offices and the administration of the kingdom, has been interpreted in different ways by modern historians. In 617 he made the mayor of the Palace a role held for life, an important step in the progress of this office from being first the manager of the royal household to the effective head of government, and eventually the monarch, under Pepin the Short in 751. Chlothar was forced to cede rule over Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I in 623.\nUnusually for a Merovingian monarch, he practised monogamy, though early deaths meant that he had three wives. He was generally an ally of the church and, perhaps inspired by the example of his uncle Guntram, his reign seems to lack outrageous acts of murder, the execution of Brunhilda excepted.\nBackground.\nFrankish territories in the sixth century.\nThe domain of Clothar II was located in the territorial and political framework derived from the Frankish kingdom present at 561 at the death of Clothar, son of Clovis and grandfather of Clothar II.\nOn the death of Clovis in 511, four kingdoms were established with capitals at Reims, Soissons, Paris, and Orl\u00e9ans, Aquitaine being distributed separately. In the year 550, Clothar I, the last survivor of four brothers reunited the Frankish kingdom, and added Burgundian territory (Burgundia) by conquest.\nIn 561, the four sons of Clothar I followed the events of 511 similarly and split the kingdom again: Sigebert I in Reims, Chilperic I in Soissons, Charibert I in Paris, and Guntram in Orleans, which then included the Burgundian kingdom territory (Burgundia). They divided Aquitaine separately again. Very quickly, Sigebert moved his capital from Reims to Metz, while Guntram moved his from Orl\u00e9ans to Chalon. On the death of Charibert in 567, the land was again split between the three survivors, of greatest importance Sigebert (Metz) received Paris and Chilperic (Soissons) received Rouen. The names Austrasia and Neustria seem to have appeared as the names of these kingdoms for the first time at this point.\nAmbitions of Fredegund.\nIn 560, Sigebert and Chilperic married two sisters, daughters of the Visigoth king of Spain Athanagild; princesses Brunhilda, and Galswintha respectively. However Chilperic was still very much attached to his lover and consort, Fredegund, causing Galswintha to wish to return to her homeland in Toledo. In 568 she was murdered and within days, after a brief period of grieving, Chilperic officially married Fredegund and elevated her to a queen of a Frankish kingdom. \"After this action his brothers thought that the queen mentioned above had been killed at his command...\"\nChilperic agreed, at first, to pay a sum of money to end the feud, but not soon after decided to embark on a series of military operations against Sigebert. This was the beginning of what is called the \"royal feud \" which did not end until Brunhilda died in 613. The main episodes until the assassination of Chilperic in 584 were as follows: the assassination of Sigebert (575), the imprisonment of Brunhilde and her marriage to a son of Chilperic, and the return of Brunhilda to her son Childebert II, successor of Sigebert.\nMoreover, Fredegund strove to ensure her position, since she was from lower origins, by eliminating the sons that Chilperic had with his previous wife Audovera: Merovech and Clovis. Her own children, however, died at a very young age and appeared to be by foul play. When Fredegund had a son in the spring of 584, he would have been the future successor of Chilperic I, if he had lived long enough.\nSources.\nThe main sources from the time are the chronicles of Gregory of Tours and the Chronicle of Fredegar. It is possible, however, that the authors contain a degree of bias in their works; for instance Gregory was a key figure in some of the conflicts of the time. \"The History of the Franks\" by Gregory of Tours in the late sixth century only recounts up to 591. It is favorable to Queen Brunhild, Sigebert, and Chilperic but extremely hostile to Fredegund. The Chronicle of Fredegar, beginning in 584, on the other hand is extremely hostile to Brunhild. That chronicle includes:\nEarly life.\nUnder Frankish customs, newborns did not receive names initially, in order not to spread concern related to the symbolic name of the Merovingian. Wanting to choose a name based on the development of unrest in the kingdom of the Franks, his father did not baptize him immediately. Chilperic and Fredegund desired to protect their child, since their four older sons may have been victims of murder, and there was much political intrigue at the time. He was raised in secret in the royal villa in Vitry-en-Artois to avoid detection.\nIn September 584, Chilperic I was murdered after a hunt near his villa of Chelles, perhaps on the order of Queen Brunhilda. This event produced general disorder and unrest. In this time Austrasians plundered parts of Neustria, seizing valuable treasures and goods, as well as important documents. Princess Rigunth, on the way to Spain to marry Prince Reccared, was captured by Duke Didier of Toulouse and was linked in conspiracy with Gondovald, who stole all that remained of her dowry, so that she was forced to abandon the marriage. Wars broke out between rival cities, and Orl\u00e9ans, Blois and Chartres stood against Ch\u00e2teaudun.\nFredegund managed to keep most of the treasury of the state as well as key political figures, such as the generals Ansoald and Audon, although many, such as chamberlain Eberul, abandoned her. She took her son to Vitry and sent a message to Guntram, King of Burgundy, asking him to adopt the child and offer his protection to him in return for exercising his authority over Neustria until the boy came of age.\nChildebert II, who was at Meaux when Chilperic was murdered, considered an attack on Paris, but Guntram was ahead of him. Childebert II began negotiations with Brunhilda on one hand, Guntram on the other; Guntram, however, refused many of his requests, including allowing him into Paris. He refused to deliver Fredegund, who, Brunhilda claimed, was behind the regicide of Sigebert I, Clovis, and even Chilperic I.\nGuntram convened a meeting of Greater Neustria, in which the court recognized Clothar as the son of Chilperic, although there were some doubts about his paternal identity. It was at this time that they gave him the name Clothar, naming him after his grandfather. Guntram then took legal responsibility of the child, adopting him and becoming his godfather.\nAnsoald was responsible for regaining control of cities Neustria had lost since the death of Chilperic. They then swore allegiance to Guntram and Clothar after their capture. Guntram, attempting to restore order in the affairs of Neustria, likely against the advice of Fredegund and, perhaps, to show his authority, replaced key figures in the episcopal see of the church and moved its location. Bishop Promotus of Ch\u00e2teaudun, whose diocese was demoted after the parish council of Paris in 573, saw this as a violation of canon law; after the death of Sigebert I, he demanded to return from exile, and was thus restored much of his personal property.\nTwo envoys from Brunhilde, Duke Gararic and chamberlain Eberon, succeeded in swaying Limoges, Tours, and Poitiers towards Austrasian influence, with the help of bishops Gregory of Tours and Venantius Fortunat. Guntram responded by sending troops to recover the lost cities that promptly returned their loyalties to Guntram and Clothar. Fredegund was sent to the Villa de Vaudreuil, in the diocese of Rouen, where she was put under the supervision of the bishop Pretextatus.\nDuring the summer of 585, Guntram returned to Paris to act as godfather of Clothar, as he swore to Fredegund, along with three bishops and three hundred nobles of Neustria who recognized Clothar II as the son of Chilperic I. However, the baptism at this time was postponed. It was expected to reconvene at the council of Troyes, but Austrasia refused to participate if Guntram would not disinherit Clothar. The council was moved to Burgundy and Clothar was baptized on 23 October 585.\nWhile Guntram campaigned to capture Visigothic Septimania, Fredegund escaped custody of the bishop and fled Rouen. During Sunday Mass, Pretextatus was stabbed, although he did not die immediately. Fredegund attempted to fetch doctors and gain his favor. However, he openly accused her of being behind this attack and the murder of the various kings. He publicly cursed and denounced her before dying soon after.\nThe queen then used her new freedom to rally as many nobles and bishops as could be found to her son. She was reinstalled into power despite Guntram's exile of her. Guntram then attempted to weaken Fredegund's influence by swaying some of the Neustrian aristocracy to his side, and keep Neustrian lands he held between the Loire and Seine by rallying Duke Beppol\u00e8ne. In 587, he managed to capture the towns of Angers, Saintes, and Nantes.\nFredegund then offered to negotiate peace and sent ambassadors to Guntram. But they were arrested and Guntram severed relations with Neustria, approaching Brunhilda and Childebert II, with whom he concluded the pact of Andelot: agreeing that upon the death of one of the two kings, the other would inherit his kingdom. In 592 Guntram died and Childebert became king of Austrasia and Burgundy.\nThe Austrasia-Burgundy union lasted only until 595, when the death of Childebert II brought it to an end. His realm was then split between his two sons: Theudebert II inherited Austrasia, while Theuderic II received the kingdom of Burgundy. The two brothers then campaigned united against their cousin Chlothar II of Neustria, but their alliance lasted only until 599, when they took up arms against each other.\nIn 593, although only as a symbolic presence since he was only nine years old, Clothar II appeared at the head of his army, which routed the Austrasian Duke Wintrio who was invading Neustria, in the Battle of Droizy. In 596, Clotaire and Fredegund took Paris, which was supposed to be held in common. Fredegund, then her son's regent, sent a force to Laffaux, and the armies of Theudebert and Theuderic were defeated. Fredegund died in 597, leaving Clothar to rule over Neustria alone, although the boy king didn't do anything significant for 2 more years.\nRuler of Neustria.\nBattle of Dormelles.\nIn 599, he made war with his nephews, Theuderic II of Burgundy and Theudebert II of Austrasia, who were old enough to be his cousins. They defeated him at Dormelles (near Montereau), forcing him to sign a treaty that reduced his kingdom to the regions of Beauvais, Amiens and Rouen, with the remainder split between the two brothers. At this point, however, the two brothers took up arms against each other. In 605, he invaded Theuderic's kingdom, but did not subdue it. He remained often at war with Theuderic until the latter died in Metz in late 613 while preparing a campaign against him.\nIn 604, a first attempt to reconquer his kingdom ended in failure for Clothar. His son Merovech was taken prisoner by Theuderic at the Battle of \u00c9tampes and was murdered at the order of Brunhilda by Bertoald. Clothar agreed that he would become the godfather of Theuderic's son in 607, naming him Merovech.\nAround the same time, Theuderic, seeking a marriage to the Spanish Visigoth princess Ermenberge, daughter of King Witteric, created new political tensions. Witteric then negotiated with Clothar II for an alliance, as well as Agilulf, King of the Lombards. The coalition against Theuderic does not appear to have been followed by significant effects.\nWar between Austrasia and Burgundy (610\u2013612).\nIn 610 Theudebert and Theuderic entered into a war. Theudebert won initial victories in 610, which led Theuderic to approach Clothar, promising to return northern Neustria to him for his aid. Theudebert was crushed in 612, at the battles of Toul and Tolbiac, near Cologne.\nWar between Clothar and Austrasia-Burgundy (613).\nAs agreed, Theuderic ceded northern Neustria to Clothar, but then turned around and organized an invasion of Neustria. However he died of dysentery in Metz in 613. His troops dispersed immediately, and Brunhilda placed her great-grandson Sigebert II on the throne of Austrasia.\nAt that time, Warnachar, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, and Rado, mayor of the palace of Burgundy, abandoned the cause of Brunhilda and her great-grandson, Sigebert II, and the entire realm was delivered into Chlothar's hands. Brunhilda and Sigebert met Chlothar's army on the Aisne, but the Patrician Aletheus, Duke Rocco, and Duke Sigvald deserted the host and the grand old woman and her king had to flee. They got as far as the Orbe, but Chlothar's soldiers caught up with them by the lake Neuch\u00e2tel. Both of them and Sigebert's younger brother Corbo were executed by Chlothar's orders, who then proceeded to execute many of the family members of this house except Merovech, his godson, and perhaps Childebert who had fled.\nBrunhilde was accused of murdering ten members of the Neustrian royal family, as well as other Frankish royalty, and was tried and convicted. She underwent a very severe torture and execution by being dragged on the back of a horse and drawn-and-quartered. After this victory, Clothar was left as the sole royal ruler of the Frankish peoples and consolidated his power.\nKing of All Franks (613\u2013629).\nUpon his unification of all Franks, Clothar took up residence in Paris and in the villas of Alentours.\nMayors of the Palace.\nAn important key aspect that was maintained in all three administrations of the kingdoms even after unification was the presence of the Mayors of the Palace. The mayor of the palace was originally the king's servant in charge of administrative events of the palace. During the royal feud, however, the role grew in importance as more of a steward of lands to care more directly than the king could and was placed in the hands of aristocracy. One of the most notable figures in this role was Warnachaire, mayor of the palace of Burgundy in 613, who was one of the leaders responsible for capturing Brunhild, and held the position until his death in 626. Warnachaire's wife, Berthe, was likely a daughter of Clothar.\nEdict of 614.\nIn 614, Chlothar II convoked the Council of Paris and promulgated the Edict of Paris, which reserved many rights to the Frankish nobles while it excluded Jews from all civil employment for the Crown. The ban effectively placed all literacy in the Merovingian monarchy squarely under ecclesiastical control and also greatly pleased the nobles, from whose ranks the bishops were ordinarily exclusively drawn. Article 11 of the Edict states that it is to restore \"peace and discipline in [the] kingdom\" and \"suppress rebellion and insolence\". The edict was ratified for all three kingdoms. Owing to several abuses of powers by officials, many of whom had been appointed by Chilperic, several mandates were made, among them the requirement that officials must have come from the region they officiate over.\nChlothar was induced by Warnachar and Rado to make the mayoralty of the palace a lifetime appointment at Bonneuil-sur-Marne, near Paris, in 617.\nDagobert King of Austrasia (623).\nIn 623, he gave the kingdom of Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I. This was a political move as repayment for the support of Bishop Arnulf of Metz and Pepin I, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, the two leading Austrasian nobles, who were effectively granted semi-autonomy.\nAt the same time, Clothar made territorial changes by assigning the region of Reims to Neustria. But Dagobert, now the semi-autonomous king of Austrasia, negotiated its return in 626.\nBarbarian and Christian relations.\nClothar was no exception in the line of Merovingians of its history of family feuding. This was considered to be a very 'barbarian' custom. However, he was one of the few Merovingians that did not practice polygamy, instead remaining faithful to a single wife until her death. He remained respectful of the Church and its doctrines, keeping it as an ally. He likely tried to maintain himself as a pious king, inspired by the holiness of his uncle Guntram who had protected him and allowed him the throne.\nIn 617, he renewed the treaty of friendship that bound the Frankish kings with the kings of the Lombards. He likely had the policy of maintaining good relations with Christianized-barbarian peoples so long as they kept good relations themselves with the Church.\nDeath.\nClothar died in 629 at age 45 and was buried, like his father, in the Saint Vincent Basilica of Paris, later incorporated into the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. His rule lasted longer than any other Merovingian king save for his grandfather, Chlothar I. Clothar's son Dagobert, who had been king of Austrasia, succeeded his father in Neustria and Burgundy. Dagobert's half-brother, Charibert, however became king of Aquitaine.\nFamily.\nHe first married Haldetrude, with whom he had the following children:\nHis second wife, Bertrude, was likely the daughter of Richomer, patrician of the Burgundians, and Gertrude. This marriage produced:\nIn 618, he married Sichilde, sister of Gomatrude, who later married Dagobert I, and probably sister of Brodulfe, who would later support Charibert II.

{"id": "70400", "revid": "48272197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70400", "title": "Bounded rationality", "text": "Making of satisfactory, not optimal, decisions\nBounded rationality is the idea that rationality is limited when individuals make decisions, and under these limitations, rational individuals will select a decision that is satisfactory rather than optimal.\nLimitations include the difficulty of the problem requiring a decision, the cognitive capability of the mind, and the time available to make the decision. Decision-makers, in this view, act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution, with everything that they have at the moment rather than an optimal solution. Therefore, humans do not undertake a full cost-benefit analysis to determine the optimal decision, but rather, choose an option that fulfills their adequacy criteria.\nSome models of human behavior in the social sciences assume that humans can be reasonably approximated or described as rational entities, as in rational choice theory or Downs' political agency model. The concept of bounded rationality complements the idea of rationality as optimization, which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. Therefore, bounded rationality can be said to address the discrepancy between the assumed perfect rationality of human behaviour (which is utilised by other economics theories), and the reality of human cognition. In short, bounded rationality revises notions of perfect rationality to account for the fact that perfectly rational decisions are often not feasible in practice because of the intractability of natural decision problems and the finite computational resources available for making them. The concept of bounded rationality continues to influence (and be debated in) different disciplines, including political science, economics, psychology, law, philosophy, and cognitive science.\nBackground and motivation.\nBounded rationality was coined by Herbert A. Simon, where it was proposed as an alternative basis for the mathematical and neoclassical economic modelling of decision-making, as used in economics, political science, and related disciplines. Many economics models assume that agents are on average rational, and can in large quantities be approximated to act according to their preferences in order to maximise utility. With bounded rationality, Simon's goal was \"to replace the global rationality of economic man with a kind of rational behavior that is compatible with the access to information and the computational capacities that are actually possessed by organisms, including man, in the kinds of environments in which such organisms exist.\" Soon after the term bounded rationality appeared, studies in the topic area began examining the issue in depth. A study completed by Maurice Allais in 1953 began to generate ideas of the irrationality of decision making as he found that given preferences, individuals will not always choose the most rational decision and therefore the concept of rationality was not always reliable in economic predictions.\nIn \"Models of Man\", Simon argues that most people are only partly rational, and are irrational in the remaining part of their actions. In another work, he states \"boundedly rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving complex problems and in processing (receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) information\". Simon used the analogy of a pair of scissors, where one blade represents \"cognitive limitations\" of actual humans and the other the \"structures of the environment\", illustrating how minds compensate for limited resources by exploiting known structural regularity in the environment.\nSimon describes a number of dimensions along which classical models of rationality can be made somewhat more realistic, while remaining within the vein of fairly rigorous formalization. These include:\nSimon suggests that economic agents use heuristics to make decisions rather than a strict rigid rule of optimization. They do this because of the complexity of the situation. An example of behaviour inhibited by heuristics can be seen when comparing the cognitive strategies utilised in simple situations (e.g. tic-tac-toe), in comparison to strategies utilised in difficult situations (e.g. chess). Both games, as defined by game theory economics, are finite games with perfect information, and therefore equivalent. However, within chess, mental capacities and abilities are a binding constraint, therefore optimal choices are not a possibility. Thus, in order to test the mental limits of agents, complex problems, such as those within chess, should be studied to test how individuals work around their cognitive limits, and what behaviours or heuristics are used to form solutions\nAnchoring and adjustment are types of heuristics that give some explanation to bounded rationality and why decision makers do not make rational decisions. A study undertaken by Zenko et al. showed that the amount of physical activity completed by decision makers was able to be influenced by anchoring and adjustment as most decision makers would typically be considered irrational and would unlikely do the amount of physical activity instructed and it was shown that these decision makers use anchoring and adjustment to decide how much exercise they will complete.\nOther heuristics that are closely related to the concept of bounded rationality include the availability heuristic and representativeness heuristic. The availability heuristic refers to how people tend to overestimate the likelihood of events that are easily brought to mind, such as vivid or recent experiences. This can lead to biased judgments based on incomplete or unrepresentative information. The representativeness heuristic states that people often judge the probability of an event based on how closely it resembles a typical or representative case, ignoring other relevant factors like base rates or sample size. These mental shortcuts and systematic errors in thinking demonstrate how people's decision-making abilities are limited and often deviate from perfect rationality. \u00a0\nExamples.\nAn example of bounded rationality in individuals would be a customer who made a suboptimal decision to order some food at the restaurant because they felt rushed by the waiter who was waiting beside the table. Another example is a trader who would make a moderate and risky decision to trade their stock due to time pressure and imperfect information of the market at that time.\nIn an organisational context, a CEO cannot make fully rational decisions in an ad-hoc situation because their cognition was overwhelmed by a lot of information in that tense situation. The CEO also needs to take time to process all the information given to them, but due to the limited time and fast decision making needed, they will disregard some information in determining the decision.\nBounded rationality can have significant effects on political decision-making, voter behavior, and policy outcomes. A prominent example of this is heuristic-based voting. According to the theory of bounded rationality, individuals have limited time, information, and cognitive resources to make decisions. In the context of voting, this means that most voters cannot realistically gather and process all available information about candidates, issues, and policies. Even if such information were available, the time and effort required to analyze it would be prohibitively high for many voters. As a result, voters often resort to heuristics, which allow voters to make decisions based on cues like party affiliation, candidate appearance, or single-issue positions, rather than engaging in a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant factors. For example, a voter who relies on the heuristic of party affiliation may vote for a candidate whose policies do not actually align with their interests, simply because the candidate belongs to their preferred party.\nEven without heuristic-based voting, many voters do not consider the feasibility or consequences of sweeping goals claimed by candidates. For example, everyone would prefer to pay less tax all else being equal. A candidate who promises to cut taxes without cutting services is likely to get votes, even though the goal is infeasible. This is because the voters do not think the issue through. Similarly, a person who depends upon a government service may vote for a candidate who promises to cut \"waste\", even if that \"waste\" consists of the service that the person depends upon. This occurs because the person has not investigated the details of the policy, which is bounded rationality. Since the very rich have more resources to determine which policies are actually in their interest than the poor do, this bounded rationality has a bias towards policies that favour the rich at the expense of the poor.\nSimilarly, the politics of fear relies on bounded rationality: a politician creates fear of somebody (bankers, migrants, a deep state, communists) and promises to keep people safe from that threat, relying on people not to evaluate the threat properly, nor to consider the role the candidate may have played in creating the threat. This is at the heart of populism, and why wartime leaders gain popular support. A similar effect occurs when voters believe that the current politician is performing badly and \"the alternative can't be any worse\", without paying enough attention to the policies of the alternative.\nModel extensions.\nAs decision-makers have to make decisions about how and when to decide, Ariel Rubinstein proposed to model bounded rationality by explicitly specifying decision-making procedures as decision-makers with the same information are also not able to analyse the situation equally thus reach the same rational decision. Rubinstein argues that consistency in reaching final decision for the same level of information must factor in the decision making procedure itself. This puts the study of decision procedures on the research agenda.\nGerd Gigerenzer stated that decision theorists, to some extent, have not adhered to Simon's original ideas. Rather, they have considered how decisions may be crippled by limitations to rationality, or have modeled how people might cope with their inability to optimize. Gigerenzer proposes and shows that simple heuristics often lead to better decisions than theoretically optimal procedures. Moreover, Gigerenzer claimed, agents react relative to their environment and use their cognitive processes to adapt accordingly.\nHuw Dixon later argued that it may not be necessary to analyze in detail the process of reasoning underlying bounded rationality. If we believe that agents will choose an action that gets them close to the optimum, then we can use the notion of \"epsilon-optimization\", which means we choose our actions so that the payoff is within epsilon of the optimum. If we define the optimum (best possible) payoff as formula_1, then the set of epsilon-optimizing options formula_2 can be defined as all options formula_3 such that:\nformula_4\nThe notion of strict rationality is then a special case (formula_5). The advantage of this approach is that it avoids having to specify in detail the process of reasoning, but rather simply assumes that whatever the process is, it is good enough to get near to the optimum.\nFrom a computational point of view, decision procedures can be encoded in algorithms and heuristics. Edward Tsang argues that the effective rationality of an agent is determined by its computational intelligence. Everything else being equal, an agent that has better algorithms and heuristics could make more rational (closer to optimal) decisions than one that has poorer heuristics and algorithms. And many artificial intelligence systems show that strategic use of more computationally intensive inference can optimize performance at lower resource cost.\nTshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their study on bounded rationality observed that advances in technology (e.g. computer processing power because of Moore's law, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics) expand the bounds that define the feasible rationality space. Because of this expansion of the bounds of rationality, machine automated decision making makes markets more efficient.\nThe model of bounded rationality also extends to bounded self-interest, in which humans are sometimes willing to forsake their own self-interests for the benefits of others due to incomplete information that the individuals have at the time being. This is something that had not been considered in earlier economic models.\nThe theory of rational inattention, an extension of bounded rationality, studied by Christopher Sims, found that decisions may be chosen with incomplete information as opposed to affording the cost to receive complete information. This shows that decision makers choose to endure bounded rationality.\nOn the other hand, another extension came from the notion of bounded rationality and was explained by Ulrich Hoffrage and Torsten Reimer in their studies of a \"fast and frugal heuristic approach\". The studies explained that complete information sometimes is not needed as there are easier and simpler ways to reach the same optimal outcome. However, this approach which is usually known as the gaze heuristic was explained to be the theory for non-complex decision making only.\nBehavioral economics.\nBounded rationality attempts to address assumption points discussed within neoclassical economics theory during the 1950s. This theory assumes that the complex problem, the way in which the problem is presented, all alternative choices, and a utility function, are all provided to decision-makers in advance, where this may not be realistic. This was widely used and accepted for a number of decades, however economists realised some disadvantages exist in utilising this theory. This theory did not consider how problems are initially discovered by decision-makers, which could have an impact on the overall decision. Additionally, personal values, the way in which alternatives are discovered and created, and the environment surrounding the decision-making process are also not considered when using this theory. Alternatively, bounded rationality focuses on the cognitive ability of the decision-maker and the factors which may inhibit optimal decision-making. Additionally, placing a focus on organisations rather than focusing on markets as neoclassical economics theory does, bounded rationality is also the basis for many other economics theories (e.g. organisational theory) as it emphasises that the \"...performance and success of an organisation is governed primarily by the psychological limitations of its members...\" as stated by John D.W. Morecroft (1981).\nOne concept closely related to the idea of bounded rationality is nudging. The connection between nudging and bounded rationality lies in the fact that nudges are designed to help people overcome the cognitive limitations and biases that arise from their bounded rationality. Nudging involves designing choice architectures that guide people towards making better decisions without limiting their freedom of choice. The concept was popularized by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein in their 2008 book \".\" As nudging has become more popular in the last decade, governments around the world and nongovernmental organizations like the United Nations have established behavioral insights teams or incorporated nudging into their policy-making processes.\nOne way nudges are used is with the aim of simplifying complex decisions by presenting information in a clear and easily understandable format, reducing the cognitive burden on individuals. Nudges can also be designed to counteract common heuristics and biases, such as the default bias (people's tendency to stick with the default option). For example, with adequate other policies in place, making posthumous organ donation the default option with an opt-out provision has been shown to increase actual donation rates. Moreover, in cases where the information needed to make an informed decision is incomplete, nudges can provide the relevant information. For instance, displaying the calorie content of menu items can help people make healthier food choices. Nudges can also guide people towards satisfactory options when they are unable or unwilling to invest the time and effort to find the optimal choice. For example, providing a limited set of well-designed investment options in a retirement plan can help people make better financial decisions.\nIn economic models based on behavioral economics, implementing bounded rationality implies finding replacements for utility maximization and profit maximization as used in conventional general equilibrium models. Stock-flow consistent models (SFC) and agent-based models (ABM) often implement that agents follow a sequence of simple rule-of-thumb behavior instead of an optimization procedure. Other dynamic models interpret bounded rationality as \"looking for the direction of improvement\" such that agents use a gradient climbing approach to increase their utility.\nPrinciples of boundedness.\nIn addition to bounded rationality, bounded willpower and bounded selfishness are two other key concepts in behavioral economics that challenge the traditional neoclassical economic assumption of perfectly rational, self-interested, and self-disciplined individuals.\u00a0\nBounded willpower refers to the idea that people often have difficulty following through on their long-term plans and intentions due to limited self-control and the tendency to prioritize short-term desires. This can lead to problems like procrastination, impulsive spending, and unhealthy lifestyle choices. The concept of bounded willpower is closely related to the idea of hyperbolic discounting, which describes how people tend to value immediate rewards more highly than future ones, leading to inconsistent preferences over time.\nWhile traditional economic models assume that people are primarily motivated by self-interest, bounded selfishness suggests that people also have social preferences and care about factors such as fairness, reciprocity, and the well-being of others. This concept helps explain phenomena like charitable giving, cooperation in social dilemmas, and the existence of social norms. However, people's concern for others is often bounded in the sense that it is limited in scope and can be influenced by factors such as in-group favoritism and emotional distance.\nTogether, these three concepts form the core of behavioral economics and have been used to develop more realistic models of human decision-making and behavior. By recognizing the limitations and biases that people face in their daily lives, behavioral economists aim to design policies, institutions, and choice architectures that can help people make better decisions and achieve their long-term goals.\nIn psychology.\nThe collaborative works of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky expand upon Herbert A. Simon's ideas in the attempt to create a map of bounded rationality. The research attempted to explore the choices made by what was assumed as rational agents compared to the choices made by individuals optimal beliefs and their satisficing behaviour. Kahneman cites that the research contributes mainly to the school of psychology due to imprecision of psychological research to fit the formal economic models; however, the theories are useful to economic theory as a way to expand simple and precise models and cover diverse psychological phenomena. Three major topics covered by the works of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky include heuristics of judgement, risky choice, and framing effect, which were a culmination of research that fit under what was defined by Herbert A. Simon as the psychology of bounded rationality. In contrast to the work of Simon; Kahneman and Tversky aimed to focus on the effects bounded rationality had on simple tasks which therefore placed more emphasis on errors in cognitive mechanisms irrespective of the situation. The study undertaken by Kahneman found that emotions and the psychology of economic decisions play a larger role in the economics field than originally thought. The study focused on the emotions behind decision making such as fear and personal likes and dislikes and found these to be significant factors in economic decision making.\nBounded rationality is also shown to be useful in negotiation techniques as shown in research undertaken by Dehai et al. that negotiations done using bounded rationality techniques by labourers and companies when negotiating a higher wage for workers were able to find an equal solution for both parties.\nInfluence on social network structure.\nRecent research has shown that bounded rationality of individuals may influence the topology of the social networks that evolve among them. In particular, Kasthurirathna and Piraveenan have shown that in socio-ecological systems, the drive towards improved rationality on average might be an evolutionary reason for the emergence of scale-free properties. They did this by simulating a number of strategic games on an initially random network with distributed bounded rationality, then re-wiring the network so that the network on average converged towards Nash equilibria, despite the bounded rationality of nodes. They observed that this re-wiring process results in scale-free networks. Since scale-free networks are ubiquitous in social systems, the link between bounded rationality distributions and social structure is an important one in explaining social phenomena.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"satisficing\", a portmanteau of \"satisfy\" and \"suffice\", was introduced by Herbert A. Simon in 1956, although the concept was first posited in his 1947 book \"Administrative Behavior\". Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined. He maintained that many natural problems are characterized by computational intractability or a lack of information, both of which preclude the use of mathematical optimization procedures. He observed in his Nobel Prize in Economics speech that \"decision makers can satisfice either by finding optimum solutions for a simplified world, or by finding satisfactory solutions for a more realistic world. Neither approach, in general, dominates the other, and both have continued to co-exist in the world of management science\".\nSimon formulated the concept within a novel approach to rationality, which posits that rational choice theory is an unrealistic description of human decision processes and calls for psychological realism. He referred to this approach as bounded rationality. \"Moral satisficing\" is a branch of bounded rationality that views moral behavior as based on pragmatic social heuristics rather than on moral rules or optimization principles. These heuristics are neither good nor bad per se, but only in relation to the environments in which they are used. Some consequentialist theories in moral philosophy use the concept of satisficing in a similar sense, though most call for optimization instead.\nIn decision-making research.\nTwo traditions of satisficing exist in decision-making research: Simon's program of studying how individuals or institutions rely on heuristic solutions in the real world, and the program of finding optimal solutions to problems simplified by convenient mathematical assumptions (so that optimization is possible).\nHeuristic Satisficing.\nHeuristic satisficing refers to the use of aspiration levels when choosing from different paths of action. By this account, decision-makers select the first option that meets a given need or select the option that seems to address most needs rather than the \"optimal\" solution. The basic model of aspiration-level adaptation is as follows: \nStep 1: Set an aspiration level \u03b1.\nStep 2: Choose the first option that meets or exceeds \u03b1.\nStep 3: If no option has satisfied \u03b1 after time \u03b2, then change \u03b1 by an amount \u03b3\u00a0and continue until a satisfying option is found.Example: Consider pricing commodities. An analysis of 628 used car dealers showed that 97% relied on a form of satisficing. Most set the initial price \u03b1 in the middle of the price range of comparable cars and lowered the price if the car was not sold after 24 days (\u03b2) by about 3% (\u03b3). A minority (19%), mostly smaller dealerships, set a low initial price and kept it unchanged (no Step 3). The car dealers adapted the parameters to their business environment. For instance, they decreased the waiting time \u03b2 by about 3% for each additional competitor in the area.Note that aspiration-level adaptation is a process model of actual behavior rather than an as-if optimization model, and accordingly requires an analysis of how people actually make decisions. It allows for predicting surprising effects such as the \"cheap twin paradox\", where two similar cars have substantially different price tags in the same dealership.[4] The reason is that one car entered the dealership earlier and had at least one change in price at the time the second car arrived. \nExample: A task is to sew a patch onto a pair of blue pants. The best needle to do the threading is a 4-cm-long needle with a 3-millimeter eye. This needle is hidden in a haystack along with 1,000 other needles varying in size from 1 cm to 6 cm. Satisficing claims that the first needle that can sew on the patch is the one that should be used. Spending time searching for that one specific needle in the haystack is a waste of energy and resources.\nA crucial determinant of a satisficing decision strategy concerns the construction of the aspiration level. In many circumstances, the individual may be uncertain about the aspiration level.\nExample: An individual who only seeks a satisfactory retirement income may not know what level of wealth is required\u2014given uncertainty about future prices\u2014to ensure a satisfactory income. In this case, the individual can only evaluate outcomes on the basis of their probability of being satisfactory. If the individual chooses that outcome which has the maximum chance of being satisfactory, then this individual's behavior is theoretically indistinguishable from that of an optimizing individual under certain conditions.\nAnother key issue concerns an evaluation of satisficing strategies. Although often regarded as an inferior decision strategy, specific satisficing strategies for inference have been shown to be ecologically rational, that is in particular decision environments, they can outperform alternative decision strategies.\nSatisficing also occurs in consensus building when the group looks towards a solution everyone can agree on even if it may not be the best.\nExample: A group spends hours projecting the next fiscal year's budget. After hours of debating they eventually reach a consensus, only to have one person speak up and ask if the projections are correct. When the group becomes upset at the question, it is not because this person is wrong to ask, but rather because the group has already come up with a solution that works. The projection may not be what will actually come, but the majority agrees on one number and thus the projection is good enough to close the book on the budget.\nOptimization.\nOne popular method for rationalizing satisficing is optimization when \"all\" costs, including the cost of the optimization calculations themselves and the cost of getting information for use in those calculations, are considered. As a result, the eventual choice is usually sub-optimal in regard to the main goal of the optimization, i.e., different from the optimum in the case that the costs of choosing are not taken into account.\nAs a form of optimization.\nAlternatively, satisficing can be considered to be just constraint satisfaction, the process of finding a solution satisfying a set of constraints, without concern for finding an optimum. Any such satisficing problem can be formulated as an (equivalent) optimization problem using the indicator function of the satisficing requirements as an objective function. More formally, if X denotes the set of all options and S \u2286 X denotes the set of \"satisficing\" options, then selecting a satisficing solution (an element of S) is equivalent to the following optimization problem\n formula_1\nwhere Is denotes the Indicator function of S, that is\nformula_2\nA solution s \u2208 X to this optimization problem is optimal if, and only if, it is a satisficing option (an element of S). Thus, from a decision theory point of view, the distinction between \"optimizing\" and \"satisficing\" is essentially a stylistic issue (that can nevertheless be very important in certain applications) rather than a substantive issue. What is important to determine is what should be optimized and what should be satisficed. The following quote from Jan Odhnoff's 1965 paper is appropriate:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In my opinion there is room for both 'optimizing' and 'satisficing' models in business economics. Unfortunately, the difference between 'optimizing' and 'satisficing' is often referred to as a difference in the quality of a certain choice. It is a triviality that an optimal result in an optimization can be an unsatisfactory result in a satisficing model. The best things would therefore be to avoid a general use of these two words.\nApplied to the utility framework.\nIn economics, satisficing is a behavior which attempts to achieve at least some minimum level of a particular variable, but which does not necessarily maximize its value. The most common application of the concept in economics is in the behavioral theory of the firm, which, unlike traditional accounts, postulates that producers treat profit not as a goal to be maximized, but as a constraint. Under these theories, a critical level of profit must be achieved by firms; thereafter, priority is attached to the attainment of other goals.\nMore formally, as before if X denotes the set of all options s, and we have the payoff function U(s) which gives the payoff enjoyed by the agent for each option. Suppose we define the optimum payoff U* the solution to\nformula_3\nwith the optimum actions being the set O of options such that U(s*) \n \"U\"* (i.e. it is the set of all options that yield the maximum payoff). Assume that the set O has at least one element.\nThe idea of the aspiration level was introduced by Herbert A. Simon and developed in economics by Richard Cyert and James March in their 1963 book \"A Behavioral Theory of the Firm\". The aspiration level is the payoff that the agent aspires to: if the agent achieves at least this level it is satisfied, and if it does not achieve it, the agent is not satisfied. Let us define the aspiration level \"A\" and assume that \"A\" \u2264 \"U\"*. Clearly, whilst it is possible that someone can aspire to something that is better than the optimum, it is in a sense irrational to do so. So, we require the aspiration level to be at or below the optimum payoff.\nWe can then define the set of satisficing options S as all those options that yield at least A: s \u2208 S if and only if A \u2264 U(s). Clearly since A \u2264 U*, it follows that O \u2286 S. That is, the set of optimum actions is a subset of the set of satisficing options. So, when an agent satisfices, then she will choose from a larger set of actions than the agent who optimizes. One way of looking at this is that the satisficing agent is not putting in the effort to get to the precise optimum or is unable to exclude actions that are below the optimum but still above aspiration.\nAn equivalent way of looking at satisficing is epsilon-optimization (that means you choose your actions so that the payoff is within epsilon of the optimum). If we define the \"gap\" between the optimum and the aspiration as \u03b5 where \u03b5 \n \"U\"* \u2212 \"A\". Then the set of satisficing options S(\u03b5) can be defined as all those options s such that U(s) \u2265 U* \u2212 \u03b5.\nOther applications in economics.\nApart from the behavioral theory of the firm, applications of the idea of satisficing behavior in economics include the Akerlof and Yellen model of menu cost, popular in New Keynesian macroeconomics. Also, in economics and game theory there is the notion of an Epsilon-equilibrium, which is a generalization of the standard Nash equilibrium in which each player is within \u03b5 of his or her optimal payoff (the standard Nash-equilibrium being the special case where \u03b5 \n 0).\nEndogenous aspiration levels.\nWhat determines the aspiration level may be derived from past experience (some function of an agent's or firm's previous payoffs), or some organizational or market institutions. For example, if we think of managerial firms, the managers will be expected to earn normal profits by their shareholders. Other institutions may have specific targets imposed externally (for example state-funded universities in the UK have targets for student recruitment).\nAn economic example is the Dixon model of an economy consisting of many firms operating in different industries, where each industry is a duopoly. The endogenous aspiration level is the average profit in the economy. This represents the power of the financial markets: in the long-run firms need to earn normal profits or they die (as Armen Alchian once said, \"This is the criterion by which the economic system selects survivors: those who realize positive profits are the survivors; those who suffer losses disappear\"). We can then think what happens over time. If firms are earning profits at or above their aspiration level, then they just stay doing what they are doing (unlike the optimizing firm which would always strive to earn the highest profits possible). However, if the firms are earning below aspiration, then they try something else, until they get into a situation where they attain their aspiration level. It can be shown that in this economy, satisficing leads to collusion amongst firms: competition between firms leads to lower profits for one or both of the firms in a duopoly. This means that competition is unstable: one or both of the firms will fail to achieve their aspirations and hence try something else. The only situation which is stable is one where all firms achieve their aspirations, which can only happen when all firms earn average profits. In general, this will only happen if all firms earn the joint-profit maximizing or collusive profit.\nIn personality and happiness research.\nSome research has suggested that satisficing/maximizing and other decision-making strategies, like personality traits, have a strong genetic component and endure over time. This genetic influence on decision-making behaviors has been found through classical twin studies, in which decision-making tendencies are self-reported by each member of a twinned pair and then compared between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. This implies that people can be categorized into \"maximizers\" and \"satisficers\", with some people landing in between.\nThe distinction between satisficing and maximizing not only differs in the decision-making process, but also in the post-decision evaluation. Maximizers tend to use a more exhaustive approach to their decision-making process: they seek and evaluate more options than satisficers do to achieve greater satisfaction. However, whereas satisficers tend to be relatively pleased with their decisions, maximizers tend to be less happy with their decision outcomes. This is thought to be due to limited cognitive resources people have when their options are vast, forcing maximizers to not make an optimal choice. Because maximization is unrealistic and usually impossible in everyday life, maximizers often feel regretful in their post-choice evaluation.\nIn survey methodology.\nAs an example of satisficing, in the field of social cognition, Jon Krosnick proposed a theory of statistical survey satisficing which says that optimal question answering by a survey respondent involves a great deal of cognitive work and that some people would use satisficing to reduce that burden.\nSome people may shortcut their cognitive processes in two ways:\nLikelihood to satisfice is linked to respondent ability, respondent motivation and task difficulty.\nRegarding survey answers, satisficing manifests in:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It emerged in the early twentieth century in Austria and Germany as a rejection of basic principles of Wilhelm Wundt's and Edward Titchener's elementalist and structuralist psychology.\nGestalt psychology is often associated with the adage, \"The whole is something else than the sum of its parts\". In Gestalt theory, information is perceived as wholes rather than disparate parts which are then processed summatively. As used in Gestalt psychology, the German word \"Gestalt\" ( , ; meaning \"form\") is interpreted as \"pattern\" or \"configuration\".\nIt differs from Gestalt therapy, which is only peripherally linked to Gestalt psychology.\nOrigin and history.\nMax Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler founded Gestalt psychology in the early 20th century. The dominant view in psychology at the time was structuralism, exemplified by the work of Hermann von Helmholtz, Wilhelm Wundt, and Edward B. Titchener. Structuralism was rooted firmly in British empiricism and was based on three closely interrelated theories: \nTogether, these three theories give rise to the view that the mind constructs all perceptions and abstract thoughts strictly from lower-level sensations, which are related solely by being associated closely in space and time. The Gestaltists took issue with the widespread atomistic view that the aim of psychology should be to break consciousness down into putative basic elements.\nIn contrast, the Gestalt psychologists believed that breaking psychological phenomena down into smaller parts would not lead to understanding psychology. Instead, they viewed psychological phenomena as organized, structured wholes. They argued that the psychological \"whole\" has priority and that the \"parts\" are defined by the structure of the whole, rather than the other way round. Gestalt theories of perception are based on human nature being inclined to understand objects as an entire structure rather than the sum of its parts.\nWertheimer had been a student of Austrian philosopher, Christian von Ehrenfels, a member of the School of Brentano. Von Ehrenfels introduced the concept of Gestalt to philosophy and psychology in 1890, before the advent of Gestalt psychology as such. Von Ehrenfels observed that a perceptual experience, such as perceiving a melody or a shape, is more than the sum of its sensory components. He claimed that, in addition to the sensory elements of the perception, there is something additional that is an element in its own right, despite in some sense being derived from the organization of the component sensory elements. He called it \"Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t\" or \"form-quality.\" It is this \"Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t\" that, according to von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, while still retaining its identity. The idea of a \"Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t\" has roots in theories by David Hume, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Immanuel Kant, David Hartley, and Ernst Mach. Both von Ehrenfels and Edmund Husserl seem to have been inspired by Mach's work \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Analyse der Empfindungen\" (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of \"gestalt\" and \"figural moment\", respectively. \nBy 1914, the first published references to Gestalt theory could be found in a footnote of Gabriele von Wartensleben's application of Gestalt theory to personality. She was a student at Frankfurt Academy for Social Sciences, who interacted deeply with Wertheimer and K\u00f6hler.\nThrough a series of experiments, Wertheimer discovered that a person observing a pair of alternating bars of light can, under the right conditions, experience the illusion of movement between one location and the other. He noted that this was a perception of motion absent any moving object. That is, it was pure phenomenal motion. He dubbed it phi (\"phenomenal\") motion. Wertheimer's publication of these results in 1912 marks the beginning of Gestalt psychology. In comparison to von Ehrenfels and others who had used the term \"gestalt\" earlier in various ways, Wertheimer's unique contribution was to insist that the \"gestalt\" is perceptually primary. The gestalt defines the parts from which it is composed, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts. Wertheimer took the more radical position that one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notes. Similarly, in vision, one sees the form of the circle first, with its apprehension not mediated by a process of part-summation. Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars.\nThe two men who served as Wertheimer's subjects in the phi experiments were K\u00f6hler and Koffka. K\u00f6hler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist Max Planck, but had taken his degree in psychology under Carl Stumpf. Koffka was also a student of Stumpf's, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythm. In 1917, K\u00f6hler published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees. K\u00f6hler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by \"sudden insight\" into the \"structure\" of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that Ivan Pavlov and Edward Lee Thorndike had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectively.\nIn 1921, Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, \"Growth of the Mind\". With the help of American psychologist Robert Ogden, Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in \"Psychological Bulletin\". It contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt school. Koffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at Smith College in 1927. In 1935, Koffka published his \"Principles of Gestalt Psychology\". This textbook laid out the \"Gestalt\" vision of the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science, he said, is not the simple accumulation of facts. What makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structure. The goal of the \"Gestaltists\" was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structure. This meant that science would have to accommodate not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other \"scientific categories\": questions of order and questions of \"Sinn\", a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning. Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beings.\nHaving survived the Nazis up to the mid-1930s, all the core members of the Gestalt movement were forced out of Germany to the United States by 1935. K\u00f6hler published another book, \"Dynamics in Psychology\", in 1940 but thereafter the \"Gestalt\" movement suffered a series of setbacks. Koffka died in 1941 and Wertheimer in 1943. Wertheimer's long-awaited book on mathematical problem solving, \"Productive Thinking,\" was published posthumously in 1945, but K\u00f6hler was left to guide the movement without his two long-time colleagues.\nGestalt therapy.\nGestalt psychology differs from Gestalt therapy, which is only peripherally linked to Gestalt psychology. The founders of Gestalt therapy, Fritz and Laura Perls, had worked with Kurt Goldstein, a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls. The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed. On one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term \"Gestalt\" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the Gestalt psychologists would object to it; on the other hand, Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work. \nMary Henle noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association: \"What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions\u2014often unclear and often incompatible\u2014from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is \"not\" Gestalt psychology.\"\nOne form of psychotherapy that, unlike Gestalt therapy, is actually consistently based on Gestalt psychology is Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy.\nTheoretical framework and methodology.\nThe Gestalt psychologists practiced a set of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.\nThe principle of totality asserts that conscious experience must be considered globally by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously, because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a system of dynamic relationships. Thus, holism as fundamental aspect of Gestalt psychology. Moreover, the perception of the nature of a part depends upon the whole in which it is embedded. The maxim that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is not a precise description of the Gestaltist view. Rather, as Koffka writes, \"The whole is something else than the sum of its parts, because summing is a meaningless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is meaningful.\"\nThe principle of psychophysical isomorphism hypothesizes that there is a correlation between conscious experience and cerebral activity.\nBased on the principles, phenomenon experimental analysis was derived, which asserts that any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities. A related principle is that of the biotic experiment, which establishes the need to conduct real experiments that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher fidelity, what would be habitual for a subject.\nPrinciples.\nThe Gestaltists were the first to document and demonstrate empirically many facts about perception\u2014including facts about the perception of movement, the perception of contour, perceptual constancy, and perceptual illusions. Wertheimer's discovery of the phi phenomenon is one example of such a contribution.\nProperties.\nThe key principles of gestalt systems are emergence, reification, multistability and invariance. These principles are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified dynamic mechanism.\nReification.\nReification is the constructive or generative aspect of perception, by which the experienced object of perception contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based. For instance, a triangle is perceived in picture A, though no triangle is there. In pictures B and D the eye recognizes disparate shapes as \"belonging\" to a single shape, in C a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.\nReification can be explained by progress in the study of illusory contours, which are treated by the visual system as \"real\" contours.\nMultistability.\nMultistability (or multistable perception) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the Necker cube and Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion. Other examples include the three-legged blivet, artworks by M. C. Escher, and the appearance of flashing marquee lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other.\nInvariance.\nInvariance is the property of perception whereby simple geometrical objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale, as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in A in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which is immediately distinguishable from the forms in B. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in C, and when depicted using different graphic elements as in D. Computational theories of vision, such as those by David Marr, have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.\nPerceptual organisation forms.\n\"Perceptual grouping \u2013 the law of \".\nPerceptual grouping (sometimes called perceptual segregation) is a form of perceptual organization. Perceptual grouping is the process that determines how organisms perceive some parts of their perceptual fields as being more related than others, using such information for object detection. \nThe Gestaltists were the first psychologists to systematically study perceptual grouping. According to Gestalt psychologists, the fundamental principle of perceptual grouping is the law of , also known as the law of good Gestalt. is a German word that directly translates to 'pithiness' and implies salience, conciseness, and orderliness. The law of says that people tend to experience things as regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple. In other words, human perception is biased towards simplicity.\nGestalt psychologists attempted to discover refinements of the law of \"\", which involved writing down laws that predict the interpretation of sensation. Wertheimer defined a few principles that explain the ways humans perceive objects based on similarity, proximity, and continuity. \nLaw of proximity.\nThe law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group. For example, in the figure illustrating the law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups. Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image. This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.\nLaw of similarity.\nThe law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other in shape, colour, size etc. For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square. In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light. We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.\nLaw of closure.\nGestalt psychologists believed that humans tend to perceive objects as complete rather than focusing on the gaps that the object might contain. For example, a circle has good Gestalt in terms of completeness. However, we will also perceive an incomplete circle as a complete circle. That tendency to complete shapes and figures is called closure. The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image. However, gaps are present in the shapes. If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures\u2014but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes. This law can be used effectively in logo design to create interest. For example, the letters of the IBM logo, consisting of horizontal blue lines, are immediately perceived as a single object.\nLaw of symmetry.\nThe law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts. Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape. Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets. When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.\nLaw of common fate.\nThe law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that the movement of elements of an object produces paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path. For example, if there is an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.\nLaw of continuity.\nThe law of continuity (also known as the law of good continuation) states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object. In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap. We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object. For example, the figure depicting the law of continuity shows a configuration of two crossed keys. When the image is perceived, we tend to perceive the key in the background as a single uninterrupted key instead of two separate halves of a key.\nLaw of past experience.\nThe law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience. If objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together. For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules. If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters \"L\" and \"I\" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.\nMusic.\nAn example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key. An early theory of gestalt grouping principles in music was composer-theorist James Tenney's \"Meta+Hodos\" (1961). Auditory scene analysis as developed by Albert Bregman further extends a gestalt approach to the analysis of sound perception.\nFigure-ground organization.\nFigure-ground organization is a form of perceptual organization, which interprets perceptual elements in terms of their shapes and relative locations in the layout of surfaces in the 3-D world. Figure-ground organization structures the perceptual field into a figure (standing out at the front of the perceptual field) and a background (receding behind the figure). Pioneering work on figure-ground organization was carried out by the Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin. The Gestalt psychologists demonstrated that people tend to perceive as figures those parts of our perceptual fields that are convex, symmetric, small, and enclosed.\nProblem solving and insight.\nGestalt psychology contributed to the scientific study of problem solving. In fact, the early experimental work of the Gestaltists in Germany marks the beginning of the scientific study of problem solving. Later this experimental work continued through the 1960s and early 1970s with research conducted on relatively simple laboratory tasks of problem solving.\nMax Wertheimer distinguished two kinds of thinking: productive thinking and reproductive thinking. \"Productive thinking\" is solving a problem based on insight\u2014a quick, creative, unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction. \"Reproductive thinking\" is solving a problem deliberately based on previous experience and knowledge. Reproductive thinking proceeds algorithmically\u2014a problem solver reproduces a series of steps from memory, knowing that they will lead to a solution\u2014or by trial and error.\nKarl Duncker, another Gestalt psychologist who studied problem solving, coined the term \"functional fixedness\" for describing the difficulties in both visual perception and problem solving that arise from the fact that one element of a whole situation already has a (fixed) function that has to be changed in order to perceive something or find the solution to a problem.\nLegacy.\nGestalt psychology struggled to precisely define terms like \"\", to make specific behavioural predictions, and to articulate testable models of underlying neural mechanisms. It was criticized as being merely descriptive. These shortcomings led, by the mid-20th century, to growing dissatisfaction with Gestaltism and a subsequent decline in its impact on psychology. Despite this decline, Gestalt psychology has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects and of research into behaviour, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.\nSupport from cybernetics and neurology.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, laboratory research in neurology and what became known as cybernetics on the mechanism of frogs' eyes indicate that perception of 'gestalts' (in particular gestalts \"in motion\") is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than 'seeing' as such:\nA frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must centre a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.\nThe lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the retina in mammals and in human beings is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of perception of an image stabilised on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, \"fixes\" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result, the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image \"marks time\" in the vicinity of this point.\nUse in contemporary social psychology.\nThe halo effect can be explained through the application of Gestalt theories to social information processing. The constructive theories of social cognition are applied to the expectations of individuals. They have been perceived in this manner and the person judging the individual is continuing to view them in this positive manner. Gestalt's theories of perception reinforce individuals' tendency to perceive actions and characteristics as a whole rather than isolated parts; therefore, humans are inclined to build a coherent and consistent impression of objects and behaviors in order to achieve an acceptable shape and form. The halo effect is what forms patterns for individuals, the halo effect being classified as a cognitive bias which occurs during impression formation. The halo effect can also be altered by physical characteristics, social status and many other characteristics. As well, the halo effect can have real repercussions on the individual's perception of reality, either negatively or positively, meaning to construct negative or positive images about other individuals or situations, something that could lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, stereotyping, or even discrimination.\nContemporary cognitive and perceptual psychology.\nSome of the central criticisms of Gestaltism are based on the preference Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas. This is not necessarily a fair criticism, as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perception. Researchers continue to test hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying Gestalt principles such as the principle of similarity.\nOther important criticisms concern the lack of definition and support for the many physiological assumptions made by gestaltists and lack of theoretical coherence in modern Gestalt psychology.\nIn some scholarly communities, such as cognitive psychology and computational neuroscience, gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being \"descriptive\" rather than \"explanatory\" in nature. For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, a textbook on visual perception states that, \"The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing. Indeed, some of their 'laws' of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate. What is meant by a 'good' or 'simple' shape, for example?\"\nOne historian of psychology, David J. Murray, has argued that Gestalt psychologists first discovered many principles later championed by cognitive psychology, including schemas and prototypes. Another psychologist has argued that the Gestalt psychologists made a lasting contribution by showing how the study of illusions can help scientists understand essential aspects of how the visual system \"normally\" functions, not merely how it breaks down.\nUse in design.\nThe gestalt laws are used in several visual design fields, such as user interface design and cartography. The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing radio buttons. They may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human use. Examples include the design and layout of a desktop's shortcuts in rows and columns.\nIn map design, principles of \"\" or grouping are crucial for implying a conceptual order to the portrayed geographic features, thus facilitating the intended use of the map. The Law of Similarity is employed by selecting similar map symbols for similar kinds of features or features with similar properties; the Law of Proximity is crucial to identifying geographic patterns and regions; and the Laws of Closure and Continuity allow users to recognize features that may be obscured by other features (such as when a road goes over a river).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The son of a judge, Frederick William Bissett, Bissett had a tumultuous childhood, often ran away from home as a child, and developed peritonitis. Bissett faced several years of hospitalizations and also experienced bullying because of his sexuality, \u201cI was trying to do as well as I could, and getting snowballs thrown at me with rocks in them because I was gay and I was getting beaten up and having really no friends.\u201d\nHe attended Dalhousie University (1956) and the University of British Columbia (1963\u20131965). After completing course requirements for his two majors in English and Philosophy, Bissett dropped out of both universities to avoid academic constraints.\nIn 1962, he had one child with partner Martina Clinton, Ooljah Bissett (who later in life changed her name to Michelle), who died in 2012 from an unknown illness.\nCareer.\nBissett moved to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1958. In 1962, he started \"blewointment\" magazine. He later launched blewointmentpress, which has published volumes by Cathy Ford, Maxine Gadd, Michael Coutts, Dick Clements writing under the pen name, \"p.x. belinsky\", Hart Broudy, Rosemary Hollingshead, Beth Jankola, Carolyn Zonailo, bpNichol, Ken West, Lionel Kearns and D. A. Levy.\nIn 1965, a CBC documentary by Maurice Embra was filmed of Bissett, entitled Strange Grey Day This, the documentary is one of the earliest known documentations of Bissett's poetry and art.\nIn 1968, Bissett collaborated with experimental rock group Th Mandan Massacre to release a spoken word album, \"Awake In The Red Desert,\" in a limited edition of 500 copies\".\" The album became a highly sought after collector's item, until reissued by Feeding Tube Records in 2019. In 1969, having performed earlier in the evening at a concrete poetry show, Bissett fell through a folding door that was supposed to be latched shut and plummeted 20 feet to a basement concrete floor, severely injuring his head. Bissett suffered brain damage, and was rendered catatonic and paralyzed. A two-year court case was won by the insurance company and Bissett never received any compensation.\nIn 1977, Bob Wenman and a group of other Conservative Members of Parliament objected to the funding of some Canadian poets, Bill Bissett in particular, by the Canadian Council for the Arts, on moral grounds. Wenman, when speaking to Jean Chr\u00e9tien (then a Minister of Finance), described Bissett's work as \"disgusting and pornographic.\" While in Parliament, Wenman requested that Bissett's literary work be read into the record, but his request was denied by the Speaker as not relevant.\nAfter Wenman's accusations in 1977, and until June 1978, Bissett received no funding from Canadian Council grants, although there is no clear indication that Wenman's allegations were the cause of this. Indeed, according to Frank Davey, a Canadian poet and scholar, by as early as 1974, Bissett had been \"ejected from cross-Canada trains, evicted by countless landlords, beaten, harassed by police, and arrested and sentenced to prison.\"\nIn 1983, financial hardship, plus a desire to focus on his own writing and visual art, led him to sell blewointment press (which later became Nightwood Editions). Bissett moved to London, Ontario in 1985. From 1986 to 1991, Bissett was the lyricist and vocalist in the London, Ontario band Luddites, they released several demo cassettes and an LP. They disbanded in 1991, but released a compilation of their works in 2007. Following constant harassment from law enforcement in London, Bissett moved to Toronto, Ontario in 1992, where he currently resides.\nIn 2006, Nightwood Editions published \"radiant danse uv being\", a poetic tribute to Bissett with contributions from more than 80 writers, including Margaret Atwood, Leonard Cohen, Lorna Crozier, Patrick Lane, Steve McCaffery, P. K. Page and Darren Wershler-Henry. In 2006 he was also featured in an episode of the television series \"Heart of a Poet\" produced by Canadian filmmaker Maureen Judge.\nBissett's sound poetry was sampled by The Chemical Brothers on their 2007 CD \"We Are the Night\". The CD title was taken from Bissett's \"Ode To D.A. Levy\". The CD went #1 in the UK and North American Electronic Music Charts.\nIn 2007, Bissett was awarded the George Woodcock Lifetime Achievement Award for outstanding contributions to literature in British Columbia. The following year, he was given an Honorary Doctorate in Literature from Thompson Rivers University.\nIn 2015, \"Th ground is a prspektiv\" by Bissett was once again sampled by The Chemical Brothers, this time for their album Born in the Echoes in \"I'll See You There\".\nIn 2019, an anthology of poems from nearly every previously published Bissett book, entitled \"breth\" was published through Talonbooks. \"breth\" features hundreds of poems dating as early as the late 1950s, to as recent as the late 2010s. Bissett is now based in Toronto.\nBissett is known in Toronto as a peer support worker and is the treasurer of the schizophrenia peer support group The Secret Handshake founded in 2004, by Bissett and Jordan Stone.\nIn June 2024, he was appointed to the Order of Canada. In July 2024, a compilation album of previously unreleased or out of print sound recordings of Bill Bissett\u2019s poetry entitled \u2018\u2019circulin th moon\u2019\u2019 was independently released digitally on Bissett\u2019s Bandcamp page.\nArt and poetry.\nBissett uses unusual orthography and incorporates visual elements in his printed poetry, and his performance of \"concrete sound\" poetry, sound effects, chanting, barefoot dancing and playing a maraca during his poetry readings. Frank Davey described him as \"rejecting the conventional or 'straight' world [...] not only in lifestyle but in ruthless alterations to conventional syntax and spelling.\" Themes in his work range from the mystical to the mundane, incorporating humour, sentimentality, and political commentary. He often does not capitalise his name or use capital letters. He has had large exhibits of his paintings. In \"the Paris Review\", Jack Kerouac called Bill Bissett one of \"the great poets.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American chess master and physics professor. The Elo system was invented as an improved chess rating system over the previously used Harkness rating system, but it is also used as a rating system in association football (soccer), American football, baseball, basketball, pool, various board games and esports, and more recently large language models.\nThe difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.\nA player's Elo rating is a number that may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the higher-rated player wins, only a few rating points (or even a fraction of a rating point) will be taken from the lower-rated player; however, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher-rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. In the long run, players whose ratings are too low or too high should do better or worse, respectively, than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.\nElo ratings are comparative only and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player's strength. While Elo-like systems are widely used in two-player settings, variations have also been applied to multiplayer competitions.\nHistory.\nArpad Elo was a chess master and an active participant in the United States Chess Federation (USCF) from its founding in 1939. The USCF used a numerical ratings system devised by Kenneth Harkness to enable members to track their individual progress in terms other than tournament wins and losses. The Harkness system was reasonably fair, but in some circumstances gave rise to ratings many observers considered inaccurate. On behalf of the USCF, Elo devised a new system with a more sound statistical basis. At about the same time, Gy\u00f6rgy Karoly and Roger Cook independently developed a system based on the same principles for the New South Wales Chess Association. \nElo's system replaced earlier systems of competitive rewards with one based on statistical estimation. Rating systems for many sports award points in accordance with subjective evaluations of the 'greatness' of certain achievements. For example, winning an important golf tournament might be worth an arbitrarily chosen five times as many points as winning a lesser tournament. A statistical endeavor, by contrast, uses a model that relates the game results to underlying variables representing the ability of each player.\nElo's central assumption was that the chess performance of each player in each game is a normally distributed random variable. Although a player might perform significantly better or worse from one game to the next, Elo assumed that the mean value of the performances of any given player changes only slowly over time. Elo thought of a player's true skill as the mean of that player's performance random variable. A further assumption is necessary because chess performance in the above sense is still not measurable. One cannot look at a sequence of moves and derive a number to represent that player's skill. Performance can only be inferred from wins, draws, and losses. Therefore, a player who wins a game is assumed to have performed at a higher level than the opponent for that game. Conversely, a losing player is assumed to have performed at a lower level. If the game ends in a draw, the two players are assumed to have performed at nearly the same level.\nElo did not specify exactly how close two performances ought to be to result in a draw as opposed to a win or loss. Actually, there is a probability of a draw that is dependent on the performance differential, so this latter is more of a confidence interval than any deterministic frontier. And while he thought it was likely that players might have different standard deviations to their performances, he made a simplifying assumption to the contrary. To simplify computation even further, Elo proposed a straightforward method of estimating the variables in his model (i.e., the true skill of each player). One could calculate relatively easily from tables how many games players would be expected to win based on comparisons of their ratings to those of their opponents. The ratings of a player who won more games than expected would be adjusted upward, while those of a player who won fewer than expected would be adjusted downward. Moreover, that adjustment was to be in linear proportion to the number of wins by which the player had exceeded or fallen short of their expected number.\nFrom a modern perspective, Elo's simplifying assumptions are not necessary because computing power is inexpensive and widely available. Several people, most notably Mark Glickman, have proposed using more sophisticated statistical machinery to estimate the same variables. On the other hand, the computational simplicity of the Elo system has proven to be one of its greatest assets. With the aid of a pocket calculator, an informed chess competitor can calculate to within one point what their next officially published rating will be, which helps promote a perception that the ratings are fair.\nImplementing Elo's scheme.\nThe USCF implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than the Harkness rating system. Elo's system was adopted by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) in 1970. Elo described his work in detail in \"The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present\", first published in 1978.\nSubsequent statistical tests have suggested that chess performance is almost certainly not distributed as a normal distribution, as weaker players have greater winning chances than Elo's model predicts. In paired comparison data, there is often very little practical difference in whether it is assumed that the differences in players' strengths are normally or logistically distributed. Mathematically, however, the logistic function is more convenient to work with than the normal distribution.\nFIDE continues to use the rating difference table as proposed by Elo.table 8.1b\nThe development of the Percentage Expectancy Table (table 2.11) is described in more detail by Elo as follows:\nThe normal probabilities may be taken directly from the standard\ntables of the areas under the normal curve when the difference in rating is\nexpressed as a z score. Since the standard deviation \u03c3 of individual\nperformances is defined as 200 points, the standard deviation \u03c3' of the\ndifferences in performances becomes \u03c3\u221a2 or 282.84. The z value of a\ndifference then is \"D\" / 282.84. This will then divide the area under the\ncurve into two parts, the larger giving P for the higher rated player and\nthe smaller giving P for the lower rated player.\nFor example, let \"D\" = 160. Then \"z\" = 160 / 282.84 = .566. The table\ngives .7143 and .2857 as the areas of the two portions under the curve.\nThese probabilities are rounded to two figures in table 2.11.\nThe table is actually built with standard deviation 200(10/7) as an approximation for 200\u221a2. The normal and logistic distributions are in a way arbitrary points in a spectrum of distributions which would work well. In practice, both of these distributions work very well for a number of different games.\nDifferent ratings systems.\nThe phrase \"Elo rating\" is often used to mean a player's chess rating as calculated by FIDE. However, this usage may be confusing or misleading because Elo's general ideas have been adopted by many organizations, including the USCF (before FIDE), many other national chess federations, the short-lived Professional Chess Association (PCA), and online chess servers including the Internet Chess Club (ICC), Free Internet Chess Server (FICS), Lichess, Chess.com, and Yahoo! Games. Each organization has a unique implementation, and none of them follow Elo's original suggestions precisely.\nInstead one may refer to the organization granting the rating. For example: \"As of April 2018, Tatev Abrahamyan had a FIDE rating of 2366 and a USCF rating of 2473.\" The Elo ratings of these various organizations are not directly comparable, since Elo ratings measure the results within a closed pool of players rather than absolute skill.\nFIDE ratings.\nFor top players, the most important rating is their FIDE rating. FIDE has issued the following lists:\nThe following analysis of the July 2015 FIDE rating list gives a rough impression of what a given FIDE rating means in terms of world ranking:\nThe highest ever FIDE rating was 2882, which Magnus Carlsen had on the May 2014 list. A list of the highest-rated players ever is at Comparison of top chess players throughout history.\nPerformance rating.\nPerformance rating or special rating is a hypothetical rating that would result from the games of a single event only. Some chess organizationsp. 8 use the \"algorithm of 400\" to calculate performance rating. According to this algorithm, performance rating for an event is calculated in the following way:\nExample: 2 wins (opponents w &amp; x), 2 losses (opponents y &amp; z)\nformula_1\nThis can be expressed by the following formula:\nformula_2\nExample: If you beat a player with an Elo rating of 1000,\nformula_3\nIf you beat two players with Elo ratings of 1000,\nformula_4\nIf you draw,\nformula_5\nThis is a simplification, but it offers an easy way to get an estimate of PR (performance rating).\nFIDE, however, calculates performance rating by means of the formulaformula_6where \"rating difference\" formula_7 is based on a player's tournament percentage score formula_8, which is then used as the key in a lookup table where formula_8 is simply the number of points scored divided by the number of games played. Note that, in case of a perfect or no score formula_7 is 800.\nLive ratings.\nFIDE updates its ratings list at the beginning of each month. In contrast, the unofficial \"Live ratings\" calculate the change in players' ratings after every game. These Live ratings are based on the previously published FIDE ratings, so a player's Live rating is intended to correspond to what the FIDE rating would be if FIDE were to issue a new list that day. Although Live ratings are unofficial, interest arose in Live ratings in August/September 2008 when five different players took the \"Live\" No. 1 ranking.\nThe unofficial live ratings of players over 2700 were published and maintained by Hans Arild Runde at https:// until August 2011. Another website, http://, has been maintained since May 2011 by Artiom Tsepotan, which covers the top 100 players as well as the top 50 female players. Rating changes can be calculated manually by using the FIDE ratings change calculator. All top players have a K-factor of 10, which means that the maximum ratings change from a single game is a little less than 10 points.\nUnited States Chess Federation ratings.\nThe United States Chess Federation (USCF) uses its own classification of players:\nThe K-factor used by the USCF.\nThe \"K-factor\", in the USCF rating system, can be estimated by dividing 800 by the effective number of games a player's rating is based on (\"N\"\"e\") plus the number of games the player completed in a tournament (m).\n formula_11\nRating floors.\nThe USCF maintains an absolute rating floor of 100 for all ratings. Thus, no member can have a rating below 100, no matter their performance at USCF-sanctioned events. However, players can have higher individual absolute rating floors, calculated using the following formula:\nformula_12\nwhere formula_13 is the number of rated games won, formula_14 is the number of rated games drawn, and formula_15 is the number of events in which the player completed three or more rated games.\nHigher rating floors exist for experienced players who have achieved significant ratings. Such higher rating floors exist, starting at ratings of 1200 in 100-point increments up to 2100 (1200, 1300, 1400, ..., 2100). A rating floor is calculated by taking the player's peak established rating, subtracting 200 points, and then rounding down to the nearest rating floor. For example, a player who has reached a peak rating of 1464 would have a rating floor of 1464 \u2212 200 = 1264, which would be rounded down to 1200. Under this scheme, only Class C players and above are capable of having a higher rating floor than their absolute player rating. All other players would have a floor of at most 150.\nThere are two ways to achieve higher rating floors other than under the standard scheme presented above. If a player has achieved the rating of Original Life Master, their rating floor is set at 2200. The achievement of this title is unique in that no other recognized USCF title will result in a new floor. For players with ratings below 2000, winning a cash prize of $2,000 or more raises that player's rating floor to the closest 100-point level that would have disqualified the player for participation in the tournament. For example, if a player won $4,000 in a 1750-and-under tournament, they would now have a rating floor of 1800.\nTheory.\nPairwise comparisons form the basis of the Elo rating methodology. Elo made references to the papers of Good, David, Trawinski and David, and Buhlman and Huber.\nMathematical details.\nPerformance is not measured absolutely; it is inferred from wins, losses, and draws against other players. Players' ratings depend on the ratings of their opponents and the results scored against them. The difference in rating between two players determines an estimate for the expected score between them. Both the average and the spread of ratings can be arbitrarily chosen. The USCF initially aimed for an average club player to have a rating of 1500 and Elo suggested scaling ratings so that a difference of 200 rating points in chess would mean that the stronger player has an \"expected score\" of approximately 0.75.\nA player's \"expected score\" is their probability of winning plus half their probability of drawing. Thus, an expected score of 0.75 could represent a 75% chance of winning, 25% chance of losing, and 0% chance of drawing. On the other extreme it could represent a 50% chance of winning, 0% chance of losing, and 50% chance of drawing. The probability of drawing, as opposed to having a decisive result, is not specified in the Elo system. Instead, a draw is considered half a win and half a loss. In practice, since the true strength of each player is unknown, the expected scores are calculated using the player's current ratings as follows.\nIf player\u00a0A has a rating of formula_16 and player\u00a0B a rating of formula_17, the exact formula (using the logistic curve with base 10) for the expected score of player\u00a0A is\nformula_18\nSimilarly, the expected score for player\u00a0B is\nformula_19\nThis could also be expressed by\nformula_20\nand\nformula_21\nwhere formula_22 and formula_23 Note that in the latter case, the same denominator applies to both expressions, and it is plain that formula_24 This means that by studying only the numerators, we find out that the expected score for player\u00a0A is formula_25 times the expected score for player\u00a0B. We can achieve this algebraically by subtracting 1 from the reciprocal of formula_26 before multiplying formula_26. It then follows that for each 400 rating points of advantage over the opponent, the expected score is magnified ten times in comparison to the opponent's expected score.\nWhen a player's actual tournament scores exceed their expected scores, the Elo system takes this as evidence that player's rating is too low, and needs to be adjusted upward. Similarly, when a player's actual tournament scores fall short of their expected scores, that player's rating is adjusted downward. Elo's original suggestion, which is still widely used, was a simple linear adjustment proportional to the amount by which a player over-performed or under-performed their expected score. The maximum possible adjustment per game, called the K-factor, was set at formula_28 for masters and formula_29 for weaker players.\nSuppose player\u00a0A (again with rating formula_30) was expected to score formula_31 points but actually scored formula_32 points. The formula for updating that player's rating is\nformula_33\nThis update can be performed after each game or each tournament, or after any suitable rating period. An example may help to clarify:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Suppose player\u00a0A has a rating of 1613 and plays in a five-round tournament. They lose to a player rated 1609, draw with a player rated 1477, defeat a player rated 1388, defeat a player rated 1586, and lose to a player rated 1720. The player's actual score is (0 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0) \n 2.5. The expected score, calculated according to the formula above, was (0.51 + 0.69 + 0.79 + 0.54 + 0.35) = 2.88.\nTherefore, the player's new rating is [1613 + 32\u00b7(2.5 \u2212 2.88)] \n 1601, assuming that a K-factor of 32 is used. Equivalently, each game the player can be said to have put an ante of K times their expected score for the game into a pot, the opposing player does likewise, and the winner collects the full pot of value K; in the event of a draw, the players split the pot and receive formula_34 points each.\nNote that while two wins, two losses, and one draw may seem like a par score, it is worse than expected for player\u00a0A because their opponents were lower rated on average. Therefore, player\u00a0A is slightly penalized. If player\u00a0A had scored two wins, one loss, and two draws, for a total score of three points, that would have been slightly better than expected, and the player's new rating would have been [1613 + 32\u00b7(3 \u2212 2.88)] \n 1617.\nThis updating procedure is at the core of the ratings used by FIDE, USCF, Yahoo! Games, the Internet Chess Club (ICC) and the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS). However, each organization has taken a different approach to dealing with the uncertainty inherent in the ratings, particularly the ratings of newcomers, and to dealing with the problem of ratings inflation/deflation. New players are assigned provisional ratings, which are adjusted more drastically than established ratings. The principles used in these rating systems can be used for rating other competitions\u2014for instance, international football matches. Elo ratings have also been applied to games without the possibility of draws, and to games in which the result can also have a quantity (small/big margin) in addition to the quality (win/loss). See Go rating with Elo for more.\nMost accurate distribution model.\nThe first mathematical concern addressed by the USCF was the use of the normal distribution. They found that this did not accurately represent the actual results achieved, particularly by the lower rated players. Instead they switched to a logistic distribution model, which the USCF found provided a better fit for the actual results achieved. FIDE also uses an approximation to the logistic distribution.\nMost accurate K-factor.\nThe second major concern is the correct \"K-factor\" used. The chess statistician Jeff Sonas believes that the original formula_35 value (for players rated above 2400) is inaccurate in Elo's work. If the K-factor coefficient is set too large, there will be too much sensitivity to just a few, recent events, in terms of a large number of points exchanged in each game. And if the K-value is too low, the sensitivity will be minimal, and the system will not respond quickly enough to changes in a player's actual level of performance. Elo's original K-factor estimation was made without the benefit of huge databases and statistical evidence. Sonas indicates that a K-factor of 24 (for players rated above 2400) may be both more accurate as a predictive tool of future performance and be more sensitive to performance.\nCertain Internet chess sites seem to avoid a three-level K-factor staggering based on rating range. For example, the ICC seems to adopt a global \"K\" = 32 except when playing against provisionally rated players. The USCF (which makes use of a logistic distribution as opposed to a normal distribution) formerly staggered the K-factor according to three main rating ranges:\nCurrently, the USCF uses a formula that calculates the K-factor based on factors including the number of games played and the player's rating. The K-factor is also reduced for high rated players if the event has shorter time controls. FIDE uses the following ranges:\nFIDE used the following ranges before July\u00a02014:\nThe gradation of the K-factor reduces rating change at the top end of the rating range, reducing the possibility for rapid rise or fall of rating for those with a rating high enough to reach a low K-factor. In theory, this might apply equally to online chess players and over-the-board players, since it is more difficult for all players to raise their rating after their rating has become high and their K-factor consequently reduced; however, when playing online, 2800+ players can more easily raise their rating by simply selecting opponents with high ratings \u2013 on the ICC playing site, a grandmaster may play a string of different opponents who are all rated over 2700. In over-the-board events, it would only be in very high level all-play-all events that a player would be able to engage that number of 2700+ opponents. In a normal, open, Swiss-paired chess tournament, frequently there would be many opponents rated less than 2500, reducing the ratings gains possible from a single contest for a high-rated player.\nFormal derivation for win/loss games.\nThe above expressions can be now formally derived by exploiting the link between the Elo rating and the stochastic gradient update in the logistic regression. If we assume that the game results are binary, that is, only a win or a loss can be observed, the problem can be addressed via logistic regression, where the games results are dependent variables, the players' ratings are independent variables, and the model relating both is probabilistic: the probability of the player formula_36 winning the game is modeled as\nformula_37\nwhere\nformula_38\ndenotes the difference of the players' ratings, and we use a scaling factor formula_39, and, by law of total probability\nformula_40\nThe log loss is then calculated as\nformula_41\nand, using the stochastic gradient descent the log loss is minimized as follows:\nformula_42,\nformula_43.\nwhere formula_44 is the adaptation step.\nSince formula_45, formula_46, and formula_47, the adaptation is then written as follows\nformula_48\nwhich may be compactly written as\nformula_49\nwhere formula_50 is the new adaptation step which absorbs formula_51 and formula_52, formula_53 if formula_54 wins and formula_55 if formula_56 wins, and the expected score is given by formula_57.\nAnalogously, the update for the rating formula_58 is\nformula_59.\nFormal derivation for win/draw/loss games.\nSince the very beginning, the Elo rating has been also used in chess where we observe wins, losses or draws and, to deal with the latter a fractional score value, formula_60, is introduced. We note, however, that the scores formula_61 and formula_62 are merely indicators to the events when the player formula_36 wins or loses the game. It is, therefore, not immediately clear what is the meaning of the fractional score. Moreover, since we do not specify explicitly the model relating the rating values formula_64 and formula_65 to the probability of the game outcome, we cannot say what the probability of the win, the loss, or the draw is. To address these difficulties, and to derive the Elo rating in the ternary games, we will define the explicit probabilistic model of the outcomes. Next, we will minimize the log loss via stochastic gradient. Since the loss, the draw, and the win are ordinal variables, we should adopt the model which takes their ordinal nature into account, and we use the so-called adjacent categories model which may be traced to the Davidson's work\nformula_66\nformula_67\nformula_68\nwhere\nformula_69\nand formula_70 is a parameter. Introduction of a free parameter should not be surprising as we have three possible outcomes and thus, an additional degree of freedom should appear in the model. In particular, with formula_71 we recover the model underlying the logistic regression\nformula_72\nwhere formula_73.\nUsing the ordinal model defined above, the log loss is now calculated as\nformula_74\nwhich may be compactly written as\nformula_75\nwhere formula_61 iff formula_36 wins, formula_78 iff formula_79 wins, and formula_80 iff formula_36 draws.\nAs before, we need the derivative of formula_82 which is given by\nformula_83,\nwhere\nformula_84\nThus, the derivative of the log loss with respect to the rating formula_64 is given by\nformula_86\nwhere we used the relationships formula_87 and formula_88.\nThen, the stochastic gradient descent applied to minimize the log loss yields the following update for the rating formula_64\nformula_90\nwhere formula_91 and formula_92. Of course, formula_93 if formula_94 wins, formula_95 if formula_94 draws, and formula_97 if formula_94 loses. To recognize the origin in the model proposed by Davidson, this update is called an Elo-Davidson rating.\nThe update for formula_65 is derived in the same manner as\nformula_100,\nwhere formula_101.\nWe note that\nformula_102\nand thus, we obtain the rating update may be written as\nformula_103,\nwhere formula_104 and we obtained practically the same equation as in the Elo rating except that the expected score is given by formula_105 instead of formula_106.\nAs noted above, for formula_71, we have formula_108 and thus the Elo-Davidson rating is exactly the same as the Elo rating; however, this is of no help to understand the case when the draws are observed (we cannot use formula_109 which would mean that the probability of draw is null). On the other hand, if we use formula_110, we have\nformula_111\nwhich means that, using formula_110, the Elo-Davidson rating is exactly the same as the Elo rating.\nPractical issues.\nGame activity versus protecting one's rating.\nIn some cases the rating system can discourage game activity for players who wish to protect their rating. In order to discourage players from sitting on a high rating, a 2012 proposal by British Grandmaster John Nunn for choosing qualifiers to the chess world championship included an activity bonus, to be combined with the rating. Beyond the chess world, concerns over players avoiding competitive play to protect their ratings caused Wizards of the Coast to abandon the Elo system for \"\" tournaments in favour of a system of their own devising called \"Planeswalker Points\".\nSelective pairing.\nA more subtle issue is related to pairing. When players can choose their own opponents, they can choose opponents with minimal risk of losing, and maximum reward for winning. Particular examples of players rated 2800+ choosing opponents with minimal risk and maximum possibility of rating gain include: choosing opponents that they know they can beat with a certain strategy; choosing opponents that they think are overrated; or avoiding playing strong players who are rated several hundred points below them, but may hold chess titles such as IM or GM. In the category of choosing overrated opponents, new entrants to the rating system who have played fewer than 50 games are in theory a convenient target as they may be overrated in their provisional rating. The ICC compensates for this issue by assigning a lower K-factor to the established player if they do win against a new rating entrant. The K-factor is actually a function of the number of rated games played by the new entrant.\nTherefore, Elo ratings online still provide a useful mechanism for providing a rating based on the opponent's rating. Its overall credibility, however, needs to be seen in the context of at least the above two major issues described\u2014engine abuse, and selective pairing of opponents. The ICC has also recently introduced \"auto-pairing\" ratings which are based on random pairings, but with each win in a row ensuring a statistically much harder opponent who has also won x games in a row. With potentially hundreds of players involved, this creates some of the challenges of a major large Swiss event which is being fiercely contested, with round winners meeting round winners. This approach to pairing certainly maximizes the rating risk of the higher-rated participants, who may face very stiff opposition from players below 3000, for example. This is a separate rating in itself, and is under \"1-minute\" and \"5-minute\" rating categories. Maximum ratings achieved over 2500 are exceptionally rare.\nRatings inflation and deflation.\nThe term \"inflation\", applied to ratings, is meant to suggest that the level of playing strength demonstrated by the rated player is decreasing over time; conversely, \"deflation\" suggests that the level is advancing. For example, if there is inflation, a modern rating of 2500 means less than a historical rating of 2500, while the reverse is true if there is deflation. Using ratings to compare players between different eras is made more difficult when inflation or deflation are present (see also Comparison of top chess players throughout history).\nAnalyzing FIDE rating lists over time, Jeff Sonas suggests that inflation may have taken place since about 1985. Sonas looks at the highest-rated players, rather than all rated players, and acknowledges that the changes in the distribution of ratings could have been caused by an increase of the standard of play at the highest levels, but looks for other causes as well.\nThe number of people with ratings over 2700 has increased. Around 1979 there was only one active player (Anatoly Karpov) with a rating this high. In 1992 Viswanathan Anand was only the 8th player in chess history to reach the 2700 mark at that point of time. This increased to 15 players by 1994. 33 players had a 2700+ rating in 2009 and 44 as of September 2012. Only 14 players have ever broken a rating of 2800.\nOne possible cause for this inflation was the rating floor, which for a long time was at 2200, and if a player dropped below this they were struck from the rating list. As a consequence, players at a skill level just below the floor would only be on the rating list if they were overrated, and this would cause them to feed points into the rating pool.\nFrom 1975 to 1985, the average rating of the top 100 was around 2550. This increased to 2644 in July 2000, and to 2703 in July 2012.\nUsing a strong chess engine to evaluate moves played in games between rated players, Regan and Haworth analyze sets of games from FIDE-rated tournaments, and draw the conclusion that there had been little or no inflation from 1976 to 2009.\nIn a pure Elo system, each game ends in an equal transaction of rating points. If the winner gains N rating points, the loser will drop by N rating points. This prevents points from entering or leaving the system when games are played and rated. However, players tend to enter the system as novices with a low rating and retire from the system as experienced players with a high rating. Therefore, in the long run a system with strictly equal transactions tends to result in rating deflation.\nIn 1995, the USCF acknowledged that several young scholastic players were improving faster than the rating system was able to track. As a result, established players with stable ratings started to lose rating points to the young and underrated players. Several of the older established players were frustrated over what they considered an unfair rating decline, and some even quit chess over it.\nCombating deflation.\nBecause of the significant difference in timing of when inflation and deflation occur, and in order to combat deflation, most implementations of Elo ratings have a mechanism for injecting points into the system in order to maintain relative ratings over time. FIDE has two inflationary mechanisms. First, performances below a \"ratings floor\" are not tracked, so a player with true skill below the floor can only be unrated or overrated, never correctly rated. Second, established and higher-rated players have a lower K-factor. New players have a \"K\" = 40, which drops to \"K\" = 20 after 30 played games, and to \"K\" = 10 when the player reaches 2400.\nThe current system in the United States includes a bonus point scheme which feeds rating points into the system in order to track improving players, and different K-values for different players. Some methods, used in Norway for example, differentiate between juniors and seniors, and use a larger K-factor for the young players, even boosting the rating progress by 100% for when they score well above their predicted performance.\nRating floors in the United States work by guaranteeing that a player will never drop below a certain limit. This also combats deflation, but the chairman of the USCF Ratings Committee has been critical of this method because it does not feed the extra points to the improving players. A possible motive for these rating floors is to combat sandbagging, i.e., deliberate lowering of ratings to be eligible for lower rating class sections and prizes.\nRatings of computers.\nHuman\u2013computer chess matches between 1997 (Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov) and 2006 demonstrated that chess computers are capable of defeating even the strongest human players. However, chess engine ratings are difficult to quantify, due to variable factors such as the time control and the hardware the program runs on, and also the fact that chess is not a fair game. The existence and magnitude of the first-move advantage in chess becomes very important at the computer level. Beyond some skill threshold, an engine with White should be able to force a draw on demand from the starting position even against perfect play, simply because White begins with too big an advantage to lose compared to the small magnitude of the errors it is likely to make. Consequently, such an engine is more or less guaranteed to score at least 25% even against perfect play. Differences in skill beyond a certain point could only be picked up if one does not begin from the usual starting position, but instead chooses a starting position that is only barely not lost for one side. Because of these factors, ratings depend on pairings and the openings selected. Published engine rating lists such as CCRL are based on engine-only games on standard hardware configurations and are not directly comparable to FIDE ratings.\nFor some ratings estimates, see Chess engine \u00a7 Ratings.\nUse outside of chess.\nAthletic sports.\nThe Elo rating system is used in the chess portion of chess boxing. In order to be eligible for professional chess boxing, one must have an Elo rating of at least 1600, as well as competing in 50 or more matches of amateur boxing or martial arts. American college football used the Elo method as a portion of its Bowl Championship Series rating systems from 1998 to 2013 after which the BCS was replaced by the College Football Playoff. Jeff Sagarin of \"USA Today\" publishes team rankings for most American sports, which includes Elo system ratings for college football. The use of rating systems was effectively scrapped with the creation of the College Football Playoff in 2014.\nIn other sports, individuals maintain rankings based on the Elo algorithm. These are usually unofficial, not endorsed by the sport's governing body. The World Football Elo Ratings is an example of the method applied to men's football. In 2006, Elo ratings were adapted for Major League Baseball teams by Nate Silver, then of Baseball Prospectus. Based on this adaptation, both also made Elo-based Monte Carlo simulations of the odds of whether teams will make the playoffs. In 2014, Beyond the Box Score, an SB Nation site, introduced an Elo ranking system for international baseball.\nIn tennis, the Elo-based Universal Tennis Rating (UTR) rates players on a global scale, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. It is the official rating system of major organizations such as the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and World TeamTennis and is frequently used in segments on the Tennis Channel. The algorithm analyzes more than 8 million match results from over 800,000 tennis players worldwide. On May 8, 2018, Rafael Nadal\u2014having won 46 consecutive sets in clay court matches\u2014had a near-perfect clay UTR of 16.42. In pool, an Elo-based system called Fargo Rate is used to rank players in organized amateur and professional competitions. One of the few Elo-based rankings endorsed by a sport's governing body is the FIFA Women's World Rankings, based on a simplified version of the Elo algorithm, which FIFA uses as its official ranking system for national teams in women's football. From the first ranking list after the 2018 FIFA World Cup, FIFA has also used Elo for their FIFA Men's World Rankings.\nIn 2015, Nate Silver, editor-in-chief of the statistical commentary website FiveThirtyEight, and Reuben Fischer-Baum produced Elo ratings for every National Basketball Association team and season through the 2014 season. In 2014, FiveThirtyEight created Elo-based ratings and win-projections for the American professional National Football League. The English Korfball Association rated teams based on Elo ratings, to determine handicaps for their cup competition for the 2011/12 season.\nAn Elo-based ranking of National Hockey League players has been developed. The hockey-Elo metric evaluates a player's overall two-way play: scoring AND defense in both even strength and power-play/penalty-kill situations. Rugbyleagueratings.com uses the Elo rating system to rank international and club rugby league teams. Hemaratings.com was started in 2017 and uses a Glicko-2 algorithm to rank individual Historical European martial arts fencers worldwide in different categories such as Longsword, Rapier, historical Sabre and Sword &amp; Buckler.\nVideo games and online games.\nMany video games use modified Elo systems in competitive gameplay. The MOBA game League of Legends used an Elo rating system prior to the second season of competitive play. The Esports game \"Overwatch\", the basis of the unique Overwatch League professional sports organization, uses a derivative of the Elo system to rank competitive players with various adjustments made between competitive seasons. \"World of Warcraft\" also previously used the Glicko-2 system to team up and compare Arena players, but now uses a system similar to Microsoft's TrueSkill. The game \"Puzzle Pirates\" uses the Elo rating system to determine the standings in the various puzzles. This system is also used in FIFA Mobile for the Division Rivals modes. Another recent game to start using the Elo rating system is \"AirMech\", using Elo ratings for 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 random/team matchmaking. \"RuneScape 3\" used the Elo system in the rerelease of the bounty hunter minigame in 2016. \"Mechwarrior Online\" instituted an Elo system for its new \"Comp Queue\" mode, effective with the Jun 20, 2017 patch. ' and ' are using the Elo system for their Leaderboard and matchmaking, with new players starting at Elo 1000. Competitive Classic Tetris (Tetris played on the Nintendo Entertainment System) derives its ratings using a combination of players' personal best scores and a highly modified Elo system.\nFew video games use the original Elo rating system. According to Lichess, an online chess server, the Elo system is outdated, with Glicko-2 now being used by many chess organizations. \"PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds\" is one of the few video games that utilizes the very first Elo system. In \"Guild Wars\", Elo ratings are used to record guild rating gained and lost through guild-versus-guild battles. In 1998, an online gaming ladder called \"Clanbase\" was launched, which used the Elo scoring system to rank teams. The initial K-value was 30, but was changed to 5 in January 2007, then changed to 15 in July 2009. The site later went offline in 2013. A similar alternative site was launched in 2016 under the name \"Scrimbase\", which also used the Elo scoring system for ranking teams. Since 2005, \"Golden Tee Live\" has rated players based on the Elo system. New players start at 2100, with top players rating over 3000. Despite many video games using different systems for matchmaking, it is common for players of ranked video games to refer to all matchmaking ratings as \"Elo\".\nOther usage.\nThe Elo rating system has been used in soft biometrics, which concerns the identification of individuals using human descriptions. Comparative descriptions were utilized alongside the Elo rating system to provide robust and discriminative 'relative measurements', permitting accurate identification. The Elo rating system has been used in biology for assessing male dominance hierarchies, and in automation and computer vision for fabric inspection. Moreover, online judge sites are using the Elo rating system or its derivatives. For example, Topcoder is using a modified version based on normal distribution, while Codeforces is using another version based on logistic distribution.\nThe Elo rating system has been noted in dating apps, such as in the matchmaking app Tinder, which uses a variant of the Elo rating system. The YouTuber Marques Brownlee and his team used the Elo rating system when they let people vote between digital photos taken with different smartphone models launched in 2022. The Elo rating system has been used in U.S. revealed preference college rankings, such as those by the digital credential firm Parchment. The Elo rating system has been adopted to evaluate AI models. In 2021, Anthropic utilized the Elo system for ranking AI models in their research. The LMSYS leaderboard briefly employed the Elo rating system to rank AI models before transitioning to Bradley\u2013Terry model.\nReferences in the media.\nThe Elo rating system was featured prominently in the 2010 film \"The Social Network\" during the algorithm scene where Mark Zuckerberg released Facemash. In the scene Eduardo Saverin writes mathematical formulas for the Elo rating system on Zuckerberg's dormitory room window. Behind the scenes, the movie claims, the Elo system is employed to rank girls by their attractiveness. The equations driving the algorithm are shown briefly, written on the window; however, they are slightly incorrect.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are most often formed by the deposition of sediment at the bottom of ice-walled channels within or beneath a former glacier. As a glacier retreats, the channel walls melt while the accumulated sediment remains, slumping into ridges as the only remaining evidence of the former channel path. They represent an unusual form of sedimentation where the location of the former channel is higher than the surrounding landform. Eskers are frequently several kilometres long and, because of their uniform shape, look like railway embankments.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"esker\" is derived from the Irish word (), which means \"ridge or elevation, especially one separating two plains or depressed surfaces\". The Irish word was and is used particularly to describe long sinuous ridges, which are now known to be deposits of fluvio-glacial material. The best-known example of such an \"eiscir\" is the \"Eiscir Riada\", which runs nearly the whole width of Ireland from Dublin to Galway, a distance of , and is still closely followed by the main Dublin\u2013Galway road\nThe synonym \"os\" comes from the Swedish word , \"ridge\".\nGeology.\nMost eskers are argued to have formed within ice-walled tunnels by streams that flowed within and under glaciers. They tended to form around the time of the glacial maximum, when the glacier was slow and sluggish. After the retaining ice walls melted away, stream deposits remained as long winding ridges. \nEskers may also form above glaciers by accumulation of sediment in supraglacial channels, in crevasses, in linear zones between stagnant blocks, or in narrow embayments at glacier margins. Eskers form near the terminal zone of glaciers, where the ice is not moving as fast and is relatively thin.\nPlastic flow and melting of the basal ice determines the size and shape of the subglacial tunnel. This in turn determines the shape, composition and structure of an esker. Eskers may exist as a single channel, or may be part of a branching system with tributary eskers. They are not often found as continuous ridges, but have gaps that separate the winding segments. The ridge crests of eskers are not usually level for very long, and are generally knobby. Eskers may be broad-crested or sharp-crested with steep sides. They can reach hundreds of kilometers in length and are generally in height.\nThe path of an esker is governed by its water pressure in relation to the overlying ice. Generally, the pressure of the ice was at such a point that it would allow eskers to run in the direction of glacial flow, but force them into the lowest possible points such as valleys or river beds, which may deviate from the direct path of the glacier. This process is what produces the wide eskers upon which roads and highways can be built. Less pressure, occurring in areas closer to the glacial maximum, can cause ice to melt over the stream flow and create steep-walled, sharply-arched tunnels.\nThe concentration of rock debris in the ice and the rate at which sediment is delivered to the tunnel by melting and from upstream transport determines the amount of sediment in an esker. The sediment generally consists of coarse-grained, water-laid sand and gravel, although gravelly loam may be found where the rock debris is rich in clay. This sediment is stratified and sorted, and usually consists of pebble/cobble-sized material with occasional boulders. Bedding may be irregular but is almost always present, and cross-bedding is common.\nThere are various cases where inland dunes have developed next to eskers after deglaciation. These dunes are often found in the leeward side of eskers, if the esker is not oriented parallel to prevailing winds. Examples of dunes developed on eskers can be found in both Swedish and Finnish Lapland.\nLakes may form within depressions in eskers. These lakes can lack surface outflows and inflows and have drastic fluctuations over time.\nLife on eskers.\nEskers are critical to the ecology of Northern Canada. Several plants that grow on eskers, including bear root and cranberries, are important food for bears and migrating waterfowl; animals from grizzly bears to tundra wolves to ground squirrels can burrow into the eskers to survive the long winters.\nExamples of eskers.\nEurope.\nIn Sweden, Uppsala\u00e5sen stretches for and passes through Uppsala city. The Badelunda\u00e5sen esker runs for over from Nyk\u00f6ping to lake Siljan. Pispala's Pyynikki Esker in Tampere, Finland, is on an esker between two lakes carved by glaciers. A similar site is Punkaharju in Finnish Lakeland.\nThe village of Kemnay in Aberdeenshire, Scotland has a esker locally called the Kemb Hills. In Berwickshire in southeast Scotland is Bedshiel Kaims, a example which is up to high and is a legacy of an ice-stream within the Tweed Valley.\nNorth America.\nGreat Esker Park runs along the Back River in Weymouth, Massachusetts, and is home to the highest esker in North America ().\nThere are over 1,000 eskers in the state of Michigan, primarily in the south-central Lower Peninsula. The longest esker in Michigan is the Mason Esker, which stretches south-southeast from DeWitt through Lansing and Holt, before ending near Mason.\nEsker systems in the U.S. state of Maine can be traced for up to .\nThelon Esker is almost long, straddling the boundary between the territories of Nunavut and Northwest Territories in Canada.\nUvayuq or Mount Pelly, in Ovayok Territorial Park, the Kitikmeot Region, Nunavut is an esker.\nRoads are sometimes built along eskers to save expense. Examples include the Denali Highway in Alaska, the Trans-Taiga Road in Quebec, and the \"Airline\" segment of Maine State Route 9 between Bangor and Calais.\nThere are numerous long eskers in the Adirondack State Park in upstate New York. The Rainbow Lake esker bisects the eponymous lake and extends discontinuously for 85 miles (c. 137\u00a0km). Another long discontinuous esker extends from Mountain Pond through Keese Mill, passing between Upper St. Regis Lake and the Spectacle Ponds, and continuing to Ochre, Fish, and Lydia Ponds in the St. Regis Canoe Area. A 150-foot-high esker bisects the Five Ponds Wilderness Area.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "70425", "revid": "5846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70425", "title": "Inflammation", "text": "Physical effects resulting from activation of the immune system\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nInflammation (from ) is part of the biological defence response of body tissues. Inflammatory immunovascular responses can be triggered by a broad range of stimuli, including physical trauma, \"dead, damaged, malfunctioning or stressed tissues\", pathogens, irritants, toxins, overuse, autoimmunity, allergens, and foreign bodies (e.g. silica and asbestos). The five cardinal signs are heat, pain, redness, swelling, and loss of function (Latin \"calor\", \"dolor\", \"rubor\", \"tumor\", and \"functio laesa\").\nInflammation is a generic response, and therefore is considered a mechanism of innate immunity, not adaptive immunity. It involves immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out damaged cells and tissues, and initiate tissue repair. Too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus (e.g. bacteria) and compromise the survival of the organism. However inflammation can also have negative effects. For instance, too much inflammation, in the form of chronic inflammation, is associated with various diseases, such as hay fever, periodontal disease, atherosclerosis, and osteoarthritis.\nInflammation can be classified as \"acute\" or \"chronic\". Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli, and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (in particular granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues. A series of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local vascular system, the immune system, and various cells in the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as \"chronic inflammation\", leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation, such as mononuclear cells, and involves simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue.\nInflammation has also been classified as Type 1 and Type 2 based on the type of cytokines and helper T cells (Th1 and Th2) involved.\nSigns and Symptoms.\nCardinal signs - Acute.\nInflammation is characterized by five cardinal signs, (the traditional names of which come from Latin):\nThe first four (classical signs) were described by Celsus (c.\u200930 BC\u201338 AD).\nPain is due to the release of chemicals such as bradykinin and histamine that stimulate nerve endings. Heat and redness are due to increased blood flow at body core temperature to the inflamed site. Swelling is caused by accumulation of fluid. The fifth sign, \"loss of function\", is believed to have been added later by Galen, Thomas Sydenham or Rudolf Virchow. Examples of loss of function include pain that inhibits mobility, severe swelling that prevents movement, having a worse sense of smell during a cold, or having difficulty breathing when bronchitis is present. Loss of function has multiple causes.\nCardinal signs - Chronic.\nCommon signs and symptoms that develop during chronic inflammation are:\nAcute and Chronic.\nAcute.\nAcute inflammation is a short-term process, usually appearing within a few minutes or hours and begins to cease upon the removal of the injurious stimulus. It involves a coordinated and systemic mobilization response locally of various immune, endocrine and neurological mediators of acute inflammation. In a normal healthy response, it becomes activated, clears the pathogen and begins a repair process and then ceases.\nAcute inflammation occurs immediately upon injury, lasting only a few days. Cytokines and chemokines promote the migration of neutrophils and macrophages to the site of inflammation. Pathogens, allergens, toxins, burns, and frostbite are some of the typical causes of acute inflammation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial pathogens. Acute inflammation can be a defensive mechanism to protect tissues against injury. Inflammation lasting 2\u20136 weeks is designated subacute inflammation.\nAcute process.\nThe process of acute inflammation is initiated by resident immune cells already present in the involved tissue, mainly resident macrophages, dendritic cells, histiocytes, Kupffer cells and mast cells. These cells possess surface receptors known as \"pattern recognition receptors\" (PRRs), which recognize (i.e., bind) two subclasses of molecules: pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). PAMPs are compounds that are associated with various pathogens, but which are distinguishable from host molecules. DAMPs are compounds that are associated with host-related injury and cell damage.\nAt the onset of an infection, burn, or other injuries, these cells undergo activation (one of the PRRs recognize a PAMP or DAMP) and release inflammatory mediators responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation. Vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow causes the redness (\"rubor\") and increased heat (\"calor\"). Increased permeability of the blood vessels results in an exudation (leakage) of plasma proteins and fluid into the tissue (edema), which manifests itself as swelling (\"tumor\"). Some of the released mediators such as bradykinin increase the sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia, \"dolor\"). The mediator molecules also alter the blood vessels to permit the migration of leukocytes, mainly neutrophils and macrophages, to flow out of the blood vessels (extravasation) and into the tissue. The neutrophils migrate along a chemotactic gradient created by the local cells to reach the site of injury. The loss of function (\"functio laesa\") is probably the result of a neurological reflex in response to pain.\nIn addition to cell-derived mediators, several acellular biochemical cascade systems\u2014consisting of preformed plasma proteins\u2014act in parallel to initiate and propagate the inflammatory response. These include the complement system activated by bacteria and the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems activated by necrosis (e.g., burn, trauma).\nAcute inflammation may be regarded as the first line of defense against injury. Acute inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained. Inflammatory mediators are short-lived and are quickly degraded in the tissue. Hence, acute inflammation begins to cease once the stimulus has been removed.\nChronic.\nChronic inflammation is inflammation that lasts for months or years. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells predominate in chronic inflammation, in contrast to the neutrophils that predominate in acute inflammation. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, allergies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are examples of diseases mediated by chronic inflammation. Obesity, smoking, stress and insufficient diet are some of the factors that promote chronic inflammation.\nVascular component.\nVasodilation and increased permeability.\nAs defined, acute inflammation is an immunovascular response to inflammatory stimuli, which can include infection or trauma. This means acute inflammation can be broadly divided into a vascular phase that occurs first, followed by a cellular phase involving immune cells (more specifically myeloid granulocytes in the acute setting). The vascular component of acute inflammation involves the movement of plasma fluid, containing important proteins such as fibrin and immunoglobulins (antibodies), into inflamed tissue.\nUpon contact with PAMPs, tissue macrophages and mastocytes release vasoactive amines such as histamine and serotonin, as well as eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 to remodel the local vasculature. Macrophages and endothelial cells release nitric oxide. These mediators vasodilate and permeabilize the blood vessels, which results in the net distribution of blood plasma from the vessel into the tissue space. The increased collection of fluid into the tissue causes it to swell (edema). This exuded tissue fluid contains various antimicrobial mediators from the plasma such as complement, lysozyme, antibodies, which can immediately deal damage to microbes, and opsonise the microbes in preparation for the cellular phase. If the inflammatory stimulus is a lacerating wound, exuded platelets, coagulants, plasmin and kinins can clot the wounded area using vitamin K-dependent mechanisms and provide haemostasis in the first instance. These clotting mediators also provide a structural staging framework at the inflammatory tissue site in the form of a fibrin lattice \u2013 as would construction scaffolding at a construction site \u2013 for the purpose of aiding phagocytic debridement and wound repair later on. Some of the exuded tissue fluid is also funneled by lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes, flushing bacteria along to start the recognition and attack phase of the adaptive immune system.\nAcute inflammation is characterized by marked vascular changes, including vasodilation, increased permeability and increased blood flow, which are induced by the actions of various inflammatory mediators. Vasodilation occurs first at the arteriole level, progressing to the capillary level, and brings about a net increase in the amount of blood present, causing the redness and heat of inflammation. Increased permeability of the vessels results in the movement of plasma into the tissues, with resultant stasis due to the increase in the concentration of the cells within blood \u2013 a condition characterized by enlarged vessels packed with cells. Stasis allows leukocytes to marginate (move) along the endothelium, a process critical to their recruitment into the tissues. Normal flowing blood prevents this, as the shearing force along the periphery of the vessels moves cells in the blood into the middle of the vessel.\nPlasma-derived mediators.\n\"* non-exhaustive list\"\nCellular component.\nThe \"cellular component\" involves leukocytes, which normally reside in blood and must move into the inflamed tissue via \"extravasation\" to aid in inflammation. Some act as phagocytes, ingesting bacteria, viruses, and cellular debris. Others release enzymatic granules that damage pathogenic invaders. Leukocytes also release inflammatory mediators that develop and maintain the inflammatory response. In general, acute inflammation is mediated by granulocytes, whereas chronic inflammation is mediated by mononuclear cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes.\nLeukocyte extravasation.\nVarious leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, are critically involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. These cells must be able to move to the site of injury from their usual location in the blood, therefore mechanisms exist to recruit and direct leukocytes to the appropriate place. The process of leukocyte movement from the blood to the tissues through the blood vessels is known as \"extravasation\" and can be broadly divided up into a number of steps:\nPhagocytosis.\nExtravasated neutrophils in the cellular phase come into contact with microbes at the inflamed tissue. Phagocytes express cell-surface endocytic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that have affinity and efficacy against non-specific microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Most PAMPs that bind to endocytic PRRs and initiate phagocytosis are cell wall components, including complex carbohydrates such as mannans and \u03b2-glucans, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycans, and surface proteins. Endocytic PRRs on phagocytes reflect these molecular patterns, with C-type lectin receptors binding to mannans and \u03b2-glucans, and scavenger receptors binding to LPS.\nUpon endocytic PRR binding, actin-myosin cytoskeletal rearrangement adjacent to the plasma membrane occurs in a way that endocytoses the plasma membrane containing the PRR-PAMP complex, and the microbe. Phosphatidylinositol and Vps34-Vps15-Beclin1 signalling pathways have been implicated to traffic the endocytosed phagosome to intracellular lysosomes, where fusion of the phagosome and the lysosome produces a phagolysosome. The reactive oxygen species, superoxides and hypochlorite bleach within the phagolysosomes then kill microbes inside the phagocyte.\nPhagocytic efficacy can be enhanced by opsonization. Plasma derived complement C3b and antibodies that exude into the inflamed tissue during the vascular phase bind to and coat the microbial antigens. As well as endocytic PRRs, phagocytes also express opsonin receptors Fc receptor and complement receptor 1 (CR1), which bind to antibodies and C3b, respectively. The co-stimulation of endocytic PRR and opsonin receptor increases the efficacy of the phagocytic process, enhancing the lysosomal elimination of the infective agent.\nCell-derived mediators.\n\"* non-exhaustive list\"\nMorphologic patterns.\nSpecific patterns of acute and chronic inflammation are seen during particular situations that arise in the body, such as when inflammation occurs on an epithelial surface, or pyogenic bacteria are involved.\nDisorders.\nInflammatory abnormalities are a large group of disorders that underlie a vast variety of human diseases. The immune system is often involved with inflammatory disorders, as demonstrated in both allergic reactions and some myopathies, with many immune system disorders resulting in abnormal inflammation. Non-immune diseases with causal origins in inflammatory processes include cancer, atherosclerosis, and ischemic heart disease.\nExamples of disorders associated with inflammation include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAtherosclerosis.\nAtherosclerosis, formerly considered a lipid storage disorder, is now understood as a chronic inflammatory condition involving the arterial walls. Research has established a fundamental role for inflammation in mediating all stages of atherosclerosis from initiation through progression and, ultimately, the thrombotic complications from it. These new findings reveal links between traditional risk factors like cholesterol levels and the underlying mechanisms of atherogenesis.\nClinical studies have shown that this emerging biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis applies directly to people. For instance, elevation in markers of inflammation predicts outcomes of people with acute coronary syndromes, independently of myocardial damage. In addition, low-grade chronic inflammation, as indicated by levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, prospectively defines risk of atherosclerotic complications, thus adding to prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors, such as LDL levels.\nMoreover, certain treatments that reduce coronary risk also limit inflammation. Notably, lipid-lowering medications such as statins have shown anti-inflammatory effects, which may contribute to their efficacy beyond just lowering LDL levels. This emerging understanding of inflammation's role in atherosclerosis has had significant clinical implications, influencing both risk stratification and therapeutic strategies.\nEmerging treatments.\nRecent developments in the treatment of atherosclerosis have focused on addressing inflammation directly. New anti-inflammatory drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1\u03b2, have been studied in large clinical trials, showing promising results in reducing cardiovascular events. These drugs offer a potential new avenue for treatment, particularly for patients who do not respond adequately to statins. However, concerns about long-term safety and cost remain significant barriers to widespread adoption.\nConnection to depression.\nInflammatory processes can be triggered by negative cognition or their consequences, such as stress, violence, or deprivation. Negative cognition may therefore contribute to inflammation, which in turn can lead to depression. A 2019 meta-analysis found that chronic inflammation is associated with a 30% increased risk of developing major depressive disorder, supporting the link between inflammation and mental health.\nAllergy.\nAn allergic reaction, formally known as type 1 hypersensitivity, is the result of an inappropriate immune response triggering inflammation, vasodilation, and nerve irritation. A common example is hay fever, which is caused by a hypersensitive response by mast cells to allergens. Pre-sensitised mast cells respond by degranulating, releasing vasoactive chemicals such as histamine. These chemicals propagate an excessive inflammatory response characterised by blood vessel dilation, production of pro-inflammatory molecules, cytokine release, and recruitment of leukocytes. Severe inflammatory response may mature into a systemic response known as anaphylaxis.\nMyopathies.\nInflammatory myopathies are caused by the immune system inappropriately attacking components of muscle, leading to signs of muscle inflammation. They may occur in conjunction with other immune disorders, such as systemic sclerosis, and include dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis.\nLeukocyte defects.\nDue to the central role of leukocytes in the development and propagation of inflammation, defects in leukocyte functionality often result in a decreased capacity for inflammatory defense with subsequent vulnerability to infection. Dysfunctional leukocytes may be unable to correctly bind to blood vessels due to surface receptor mutations, digest bacteria (Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome), or produce microbicides (chronic granulomatous disease). In addition, diseases affecting the bone marrow may result in abnormal or few leukocytes.\nPharmacological.\nCertain drugs or exogenous chemical compounds are known to affect inflammation. Vitamin A deficiency, for example, causes an increase in inflammatory responses, and anti-inflammatory drugs work specifically by inhibiting the enzymes that produce inflammatory eicosanoids. Additionally, certain illicit drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy may exert some of their detrimental effects by activating transcription factors intimately involved with inflammation (e.g. NF-\u03baB).\nCancer.\nInflammation orchestrates the microenvironment around tumours, contributing to proliferation, survival and migration. Cancer cells use selectins, chemokines and their receptors for invasion, migration and metastasis. On the other hand, many cells of the immune system contribute to cancer immunology, suppressing cancer.\nMolecular intersection between receptors of steroid hormones, which have important effects on cellular development, and transcription factors that play key roles in inflammation, such as NF-\u03baB, may mediate some of the most critical effects of inflammatory stimuli on cancer cells. This capacity of a mediator of inflammation to influence the effects of steroid hormones in cells is very likely to affect carcinogenesis. On the other hand, due to the modular nature of many steroid hormone receptors, this interaction may offer ways to interfere with cancer progression, through targeting of a specific protein domain in a specific cell type. Such an approach may limit side effects that are unrelated to the tumor of interest, and may help preserve vital homeostatic functions and developmental processes in the organism.\nThere is some evidence from 2009 to suggest that cancer-related inflammation (CRI) may lead to accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.\nRole in cancer.\nIn 1863, Rudolf Virchow hypothesized that the origin of cancer was at sites of chronic inflammation. As of 2012, chronic inflammation was estimated to contribute to approximately 15% to 25% of human cancers.\nMediators and DNA damage in cancer.\nAn inflammatory mediator is a messenger that acts on blood vessels and/or cells to promote an inflammatory response. Inflammatory mediators that contribute to neoplasia include prostaglandins, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-15 and chemokines such as IL-8 and GRO-alpha. These inflammatory mediators, and others, orchestrate an environment that fosters proliferation and survival.\nInflammation also causes DNA damages due to the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by various intracellular inflammatory mediators. In addition, leukocytes and other phagocytic cells attracted to the site of inflammation induce DNA damages in proliferating cells through their generation of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). ROS and RNS are normally produced by these cells to fight infection. ROS, alone, cause more than 20 types of DNA damage. Oxidative DNA damages cause both mutations and epigenetic alterations. RNS can also cause mutagenic DNA damages.\nA normal cell may undergo carcinogenesis to become a cancer cell if it is frequently subjected to DNA damage during long periods of chronic inflammation. DNA damages may cause genetic mutations due to inaccurate repair. In addition, mistakes in the DNA repair process may cause epigenetic alterations. Mutations and epigenetic alterations that are replicated and provide a selective advantage during somatic cell proliferation may be carcinogenic.\nGenome-wide analyses of human cancer tissues reveal that a single typical cancer cell may possess roughly 100 mutations in coding regions, 10\u201320 of which are \"driver mutations\" that contribute to cancer development. However, chronic inflammation also causes epigenetic changes such as DNA methylations, that are often more common than mutations. Typically, several hundreds to thousands of genes are methylated in a cancer cell (see DNA methylation in cancer). Sites of oxidative damage in chromatin can recruit complexes that contain DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), a histone deacetylase (SIRT1), and a histone methyltransferase (EZH2), and thus induce DNA methylation. DNA methylation of a CpG island in a promoter region may cause silencing of its downstream gene (see CpG site and regulation of transcription in cancer). DNA repair genes, in particular, are frequently inactivated by methylation in various cancers (see hypermethylation of DNA repair genes in cancer). A 2018 report evaluated the relative importance of mutations and epigenetic alterations in progression to two different types of cancer. This report showed that epigenetic alterations were much more important than mutations in generating gastric cancers (associated with inflammation). However, mutations and epigenetic alterations were of roughly equal importance in generating esophageal squamous cell cancers (associated with tobacco chemicals and acetaldehyde, a product of alcohol metabolism).\nHIV and AIDS.\nIt has long been recognized that infection with HIV is characterized not only by development of profound immunodeficiency but also by sustained inflammation and immune activation. A substantial body of evidence implicates chronic inflammation as a critical driver of immune dysfunction, premature appearance of aging-related diseases, and immune deficiency. Many now regard HIV infection not only as an evolving virus-induced immunodeficiency, but also as chronic inflammatory disease. Even after the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and effective suppression of viremia in HIV-infected individuals, chronic inflammation persists. Animal studies also support the relationship between immune activation and progressive cellular immune deficiency: SIVsm infection of its natural nonhuman primate hosts, the sooty mangabey, causes high-level viral replication but limited evidence of disease. This lack of pathogenicity is accompanied by a lack of inflammation, immune activation and cellular proliferation. In sharp contrast, experimental SIVsm infection of rhesus macaque produces immune activation and AIDS-like disease with many parallels to human HIV infection.\nDelineating how CD4 T cells are depleted and how chronic inflammation and immune activation are induced lies at the heart of understanding HIV pathogenesis\u2014one of the top priorities for HIV research by the Office of AIDS Research, National Institutes of Health. Recent studies demonstrated that caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, drives CD4 T-cell depletion and inflammation by HIV. These are the two signature events that propel HIV disease progression to AIDS. Pyroptosis appears to create a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells and other immune cells (including macrophages and neutrophils) release inflammatory signals that recruit more cells into the infected lymphoid tissues to die. The feed-forward nature of this inflammatory response produces chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Identifying pyroptosis as the predominant mechanism that causes CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation, provides novel therapeutic opportunities, namely caspase-1 which controls the pyroptotic pathway. In this regard, pyroptosis of CD4 T cells and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 can be blocked in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, which has already proven to be safe and well tolerated in phase II human clinical trials. These findings could propel development of an entirely new class of \"anti-AIDS\" therapies that act by targeting the host rather than the virus. Such agents would almost certainly be used in combination with ART. By promoting \"tolerance\" of the virus instead of suppressing its replication, VX-765 or related drugs may mimic the evolutionary solutions occurring in multiple monkey hosts (e.g. the sooty mangabey) infected with species-specific lentiviruses that have led to a lack of disease, no decline in CD4 T-cell counts, and no chronic inflammation.\nConnection to depression.\nThere is evidence for a link between inflammation and depression. Inflammatory processes can be triggered by negative cognitions or their consequences, such as stress, violence, or deprivation. Thus, negative cognitions can cause inflammation that can, in turn, lead to depression.\nIn addition, there is increasing evidence that inflammation can cause depression because of the increase of cytokines, setting the brain into a \"sickness mode\".\nClassical symptoms of being physically sick, such as lethargy, show a large overlap in behaviors that characterize depression. Levels of cytokines tend to increase sharply during the depressive episodes of people with bipolar disorder and drop off during remission. Furthermore, it has been shown in clinical trials that anti-inflammatory medicines taken in addition to antidepressants not only significantly improves symptoms but also increases the proportion of subjects positively responding to treatment.\nInflammations that lead to serious depression could be caused by common infections such as those caused by a virus, bacteria or even parasites.\nConnection to delirium.\nThere is evidence for a link between inflammation and delirium based on the results of a recent longitudinal study investigating CRP in COVID-19 patients.\nSystemic effects.\nAn infectious organism can escape the confines of the immediate tissue via the circulatory system or lymphatic system, where it may spread to other parts of the body. If an organism is not contained by the actions of acute inflammation, it may gain access to the lymphatic system via nearby lymph vessels. An infection of the lymph vessels is known as lymphangitis, and infection of a lymph node is known as lymphadenitis. When lymph nodes cannot destroy all pathogens, the infection spreads further. A pathogen can gain access to the bloodstream through lymphatic drainage into the circulatory system.\nWhen inflammation overwhelms the host, systemic inflammatory response syndrome is diagnosed. When it is due to infection, the term sepsis is applied, with the terms bacteremia being applied specifically for bacterial sepsis and viremia specifically to viral sepsis. Vasodilation and organ dysfunction are serious problems associated with widespread infection that may lead to septic shock and death.\nAcute-phase proteins.\nInflammation also is characterized by high systemic levels of acute-phase proteins. In acute inflammation, these proteins prove beneficial; however, in chronic inflammation, they can contribute to amyloidosis. These proteins include C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and serum amyloid P, which cause a range of systemic effects including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLeukocyte numbers.\nInflammation often affects the numbers of leukocytes present in the body:\nInterleukins and obesity.\nWith the discovery of interleukins (IL), the concept of systemic inflammation developed. Although the processes involved are identical to tissue inflammation, systemic inflammation is not confined to a particular tissue but involves the endothelium and other organ systems.\nChronic inflammation is widely observed in obesity. Obese people commonly have many elevated markers of inflammation, including:\nLow-grade chronic inflammation is characterized by a two- to threefold increase in the systemic concentrations of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and CRP. Waist circumference correlates significantly with systemic inflammatory response.\nLoss of white adipose tissue reduces levels of inflammation markers. As of 2017 the association of systemic inflammation with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and with atherosclerosis was under preliminary research, although rigorous clinical trials had not been conducted to confirm such relationships.\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is generated at a higher level in obese people, and may increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases.\nOutcomes.\nThe outcome in a particular circumstance will be determined by the tissue in which the injury has occurred\u2014and the injurious agent that is causing it. Here are the possible outcomes to inflammation:\nResolution.\nThe inflammatory response must be actively terminated when no longer needed to prevent unnecessary \"bystander\" damage to tissues. Failure to do so results in chronic inflammation, and cellular destruction. Resolution of inflammation occurs by different mechanisms in different tissues.\nMechanisms that serve to terminate inflammation include:\nExamples.\nInflammation is usually indicated by adding the suffix \"itis\", as shown below. However, some conditions, such as asthma and pneumonia, do not follow this convention. More examples are available at List of types of inflammation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
