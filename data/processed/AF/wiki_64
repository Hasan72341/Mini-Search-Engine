Sukhoi designed military aircraft with Tupolev and Sukhoi for 50 years, and produced many notable Soviet planes such as the Sukhoi Su-7, Su-17, and Su-24. His planes set two altitude world records (1959, 1962) and two world speed records (1960, 1962). Sukhoi was honored in the Soviet Union as a Hero of Socialist Labor and awarded the Order of Lenin three times.\nBiography.\nPavel Osipovich Sukhoi was born 22 July 1895 in Hlybokaye, Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire, to ethnic Belarusian parents of peasant background. He had five sisters and no brothers. In 1900, Sukhoi's family moved to Gomel when his father, Osip Andreevich Sukhoi, got a job as a teacher at a school for the children of railway workers. From 1905 to 1914, Sukhoi attended the gymnasium in Gomel, now the Belarusian State University of Transport. In 1915, Sukhoi was admitted to the Imperial Moscow Technical School in Moscow after passing the entrance exams. However, Sukhoi's studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army following the escalation of World War I. \nSukhoi attended warrant officer training assigned to the artillery of the Russian Western Front. Sukhoi was in the Russian Army when it collapsed after the October Revolution in 1917, returning to Moscow to find his university was closed. Instead, Sukhoi returned to Gomel to live with his parents and was offered a place as a mathematics teacher in the small town of Luninets near Brest-Litovsk. In 1919, Sukhoi fled to Gomel as Polish troops advanced on Luninets during the Polish\u2013Soviet War, and began teaching at the school for the children of railway workers headed by his father. Around this time, Sukhoi contracted typhus and then scarlet fever which significantly affected his ability to speak, and he developed a reputation as a quiet person for the remainder of his life.\nIn 1920, Sukhoi was finally demobilized from the army because of his health-related problems, and the government of the Russian Soviet Republic issued a resolution to reopen institutions of higher education in Russia. Sukhoi returned to his studies at BMSTU and graduated in 1925 with his thesis titles \"Single-engined Pursuit Aircraft of 300 hp\" under the direction of aeronautics pioneer Andrei Tupolev. In March 1925, Sukhoi started working as an engineer and designer with the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) and Moscow Factory Number 156 under Tupolev. During the following years, Sukhoi designed and constructed aircraft including the record-setting Tupolev ANT-25 and the TB-1 and TB-3 heavy bombers. In 1932, Sukhoi was appointed head of the engineering and design department of TsAGI, and in 1938 he was promoted to head of the department of design. Sukhoi also developed a multi-purpose light aircraft, the Su-2, which saw service in the early years of the Eastern Front of World War II.\nIn September 1939, Sukhoi founded an independent engineering and design department named Sukhoi Design Bureau (OKB Sukhoi) located in Kharkiv. Sukhoi was not satisfied with the geographical location of the OKB, which was isolated from the scientific centers of Moscow. Sukhoi insisted that the OKB should relocate to an aerodrome in Moscow Oblast, and by the first half of 1940 the relocation was completed. By the winter of 1942, Sukhoi encountered another problem: since he had no production line of his own, he had nothing to do. Sukhoi had developed a new ground-attack aircraft, the Su-6, but Soviet leader Joseph Stalin decided that this plane should not be put into production, favouring production of the Ilyushin Il-2. \nIn the postwar years, Sukhoi was among the first Soviet aircraft designers who led the work on jet aircraft, creating several experimental jet fighters. From 1949, Sukhoi fell out of Stalin's favour and was forced to return to work under Tupolev, this time as Deputy Chief Designer. In 1953, the year of Stalin's death, Sukhoi was permitted to re-establish his own Sukhoi Design Bureau. Sukhoi produced several major serial combat aircraft during the Cold War, including the supersonic Su-7, which became the main Soviet fighter-bomber of the 1960s, and interceptors Su-9 and Su-15, which formed the backbone of the Soviet Air Defence Forces. Sukhoi also pioneered variable-sweep wing aircraft, such as the Su-17 and Su-24. Sukhoi also started a number of projects that were not developed, including the ambitious Mach-3-capable Sukhoi T-3 attack aircraft. From 1958 to 1974, Sukhoi served as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.\nSukhoi died on 15 September 1975 at the Barvikha sanatorium in Moscow, and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery. The last fighter Sukhoi designed was the T-10 (Su-27) but he did not live to see it fly.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the first Olympic champion in the 100 and 400 meter sprint races.\nBiography.\nBurke was born in Massachusetts in 1875. He competed for the Suffolk Athletic Club in South Boston and the Boston Athletic Association (BAA).\nBurke, a student at Boston University School of Law, was a reputed runner in the 400 meters and 440 yards, having won the AAU title (440 yards) in 1895. He had no such reputation for the first event he entered in the inaugural modern Olympic Games in Athens, 1896. With many top sprinters absent, Burke surprisingly won the 100 meters. He was also noted for his \"crouch start\", which was uncommon at that time but in standard use now. His time in the final was 12.0 seconds. In the preliminary heat, he had an even better time \u2013 11.8 seconds.\nAt the same Olympics, Burke also won the 400 meters, his top event. His times for that event were 58.4 seconds in the preliminary heats and 54.2 seconds in the final, in both of which Burke finished first.\nLater in his career, Burke specialized in the longer distances, winning IC4A titles in the 440 and 880 yards events. In 1897, he was one of the initiators of the annually held Boston Marathon, inspired by the success of the marathon event at the 1896 Olympics.\nBurke later became a lawyer, but was also an athletics coach and a part-time journalist, writing for \"The Boston Journal\" and the \"Boston Post\".\nDuring World War I, at an age when most soldiers had long since retired from active duty, Burke earned his aviator\u2019s wings at 43, making him the oldest man in the U.S. military to achieve this distinction. Burke died in 1929, aged 54.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the first non-American to win the event since Percy Williams of Canada took the gold medal in 1928, the only German to ever win the event in the history of the Olympics, the first man to run 100 meters in 10.0 seconds and the last White man to establish a world record in 100 meters dash.\nEarly life.\nAfter playing soccer all throughout his childhood Hary switched to sprinting at age 14. Only a few years later, in 1958, he won his first international title when he came first in the 100 m and the 4 \u00d7 100 m at the European Championships.\nAlso in 1958, Hary appeared to have run a new world record with a time of 10.0 seconds, but the track's slope of was found to exceed the maximum allowed .\nWorld record.\nOn June 21, 1960 at Letzigrund Stadium in Zurich Hary ran into the history books by running the 100 m in 10.0 seconds, a new word record. But the judges were so shocked, they said it must have been a false start. Hary was allowed a repeat run and ran another 10.0 seconds 35 minutes later.\nOlympic Games 1960 in Rome.\nThat same year, at the Olympics, he achieved his greatest moment of fame. After a nerve-wracking number of near-starts the six men finally came off the mark together, but within two strides Hary had accelerated to a half-meter lead. By the 50-meter mark Hary opened up a two-meter gap, towards the finish Duke\u2019s Dave Sime started closing in, but Hary sprinted to the gold medal in the 100 m dash with a time of 10.2 seconds completing the finest exhibition of sprinting in Olympic history.\nArmin Hary also won a 2nd Gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay when USA was disqualified for an illegal baton pass. Germany's time, 39.5 seconds, equaled their own world record.\nFastest starter.\nDue to his reaction time and quick acceleration out of the blocks Hary was often accused of jumping or anticipating the gun. Considered the fastest starter in the world, Hary was periodically tested for his quick reaction time, it was discovered that he had extraordinary reflexes. With the help of high speed photography Armin Hary\u2019s quick start sequence has been well documented and studied. Long believed to be physiologically impossible Hary\u2019s reaction time was recorded at 0.04 seconds compared to the average human\u2019s of 0.132 seconds.\nThe new IAAF false start rule of 0.100 is based on the fact that no human besides Hary has ever been able to react faster to the sound of the gun.\nHis iconic starts have earned him the nickname \u201cThief of Starts\u201d from the term \u201cThief of Hearts\u201d.\nSponsors.\nHe was also the first track star to be affected by the rivalry between Adidas and Puma; each of the two then-fledgling companies wanted the \"world's fastest man\" to wear its shoes at the 1960 Olympics, putting him right in the middle of the Dassler brother feud. During the companies expensive bidding war for the most famous athlete in the world, Hary realised that neither company had an exclusivity clause in their contract, so without telling the other, he signed with both.

Hary also has a daughter with acclaimed actress Helga Charlotte Tolle.\nEnd of career.\nIn the early 1960s Hary was forced to retire from sprinting after suffering serious injuries in a car accident.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1981, he was both the IAAF Golden Sprints and IAAF World Cup gold medallist. He is also a three-time European Cup gold medallist.\nWells was a multiple medallist for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games, winning two golds at the 1978 Commonwealth Games and completing a 100 metres/200 metres sprint double at the 1982 Commonwealth Games. He also recorded the fastest British 100/200 times from 1978\u20131983 and the fastest 100 m in 1984.\nBiography.\nEarly years and long jump.\nBorn in Edinburgh, Wells was educated at Fernieside Primary School and then Liberton High School. He left school at age 15 to begin an engineering apprenticeship. He was initially a triple jumper and long jumper, and was the Scottish indoor long jump champion in 1974.\nCommonwealth and European sprint titles.\nHe began concentrating on sprint events in 1976. In 1977 he won the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) Indoor 60 metres title, and won his first of seven outdoor Scottish sprint titles.\nIn the 1978 season, his times and victories continued to improve. He set a new British record at Gateshead 10.29, beating Don Quarrie and James Sanford, and also won the UK 100/200 Championships.\nAt the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, he won the gold medal in the 200 m and silver in the 100 m. He also won the 4 \u00d7 100 m running the second leg with Drew McMaster, David Jenkins and Cameron Sharp running the other three legs.\nThis success continued in 1979, when he won the European Cup 200 metres in Turin, Italy, beating the new world record holder Pietro Mennea on his home ground; he also finished 3rd in the 100 metres.\n1980 \u2013 Olympic success and the Koblenz showdown.\nAt the start of the 1980 season, Wells won the AAA's 100 metres, then went to the C\u00f4te d'Azur to finish preparing for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. He never used starting blocks, until a rule change forced him to do so for the Moscow Olympics. Prior to the Olympics, he was put under pressure by Margaret Thatcher in the boycott of the games led by the Americans. He responded by declining all media requests. His Olympic participation was threatened by chronic back pain that struck him shortly before the games began. Each day, he underwent four exhausting treatment sessions that left him too tired to train. Instead, when not undergoing treatment, he spent his time relaxing.\nIn Moscow, Wells qualified for the final, with a new British record 10.11 s, where he faced pre-race favourite Silvio Leonard of Cuba. Wells finished with an extreme lean which allowed his head and shoulder to cross the finish line before Leonard's chest in a photo finish; both men were given a final time of 10.25 s. Wells became the oldest Olympic 100 m champion at that time at the age of 28 years 83 days.\nThe 200 m final was another close affair. Wells won the silver medal behind Pietro Mennea, who beat him by 0.02 s; again he set a British record of 20.21 s. He went on to break a third British record, 38.62 s, with the sprint relay team that finished fourth in the final.\nIn a later interview, Wells said the two issues he faced prior to the games were inadvertently key factors in his success. He said in an interview to \"The Scotsman\", \"When we got to Moscow, [my wife and coach] Margot and I decided that I'd do six starts and see how it went. The fourth and fifth were full-out as if I was competing and I asked Margot what she thought: she said they were the best she'd ever seen me do. The rest had done me a lot of good, I was really fresh and committed, and those starts gave me the psychological edge over everyone else, which was key because the Olympics is all about your mental aptitude. You're at your fastest when you're relaxed and flowing (Wells' 10.11secs to qualify for the 100m final remains the Scottish record) rather than having to be aggressive.\"\nFollowing the Moscow Olympics, there was some suggestion that Wells's gold medal had been devalued by the boycott of the games. Wells accepted an invitation to take on the best USA sprinters of the day, among others, the ASV Weltklasse track meeting in Cologne in West Germany. Less than two weeks after the Moscow gold, he won the final in Koblenz in a time of 10.19s, beating Americans Stanley Floyd (10.21), Mel Lattany (10.25), Carl Lewis (10.30) and Harvey Glance (10.31). Lattany went straight over to Wells after crossing the line to say, \"For what it's worth, Allan, You're the Olympic champion and you would have been Olympic champion no matter who you ran against in Moscow.\"\nAt the end of 1980, Wells was awarded Scottish Sports Personality of the Year.\n1981 World Cup win.\nIn 1981, after a tour of Australia and New Zealand, Wells won the European Cup 100 metres, beating East German Frank Emmelmann. Wells also finished 2nd in the 200 m.\nHe then won the \"IAAF Golden sprints\" in Berlin, which was the most prominent sprint meeting in the world that year. Although finishing second to the Frenchman Hermann Panzo by 0.01 secs in the 100, Wells won the 200 beating the top four American sprinters Mel Lattany, Jeff Phillips, Stanley Floyd, Steve Williams as well as Canada's Ben Johnson in the 100/200, 10.15/20.15 (200 wind assist) for Wells to win the event in an aggregate 30.30.\nWells won the 100 metres at the IAAF World cup in Rome, beating Carl Lewis; Wells then finished 2nd in the world cup 200 in 20.53. Afterwards, he beat Mel Lattany and Stanley Floyd again, when he won a 200 in 20.26 in the Memorial Van Damme meeting in Brussels, Belgium.\nLater sprinting career.\nIn 1982, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Wells won two more Commonwealth Games titles in the 100 m, a wind-assisted 10.02. and then the 200 m, and a bronze medal in the relay. He shared the 200 m title with Mike McFarlane of England in 20.43 in a rare dead heat.\nIn 1983, he won his third European Cup title by winning the 200 metres in 20.72, beating his old adversary Pietro Mennea in London, and again took 2nd in the 100 m.\nHe then finished 4th in both the 100/200 sprint finals at the IAAF World Championships in Helsinki.\nAt age 32, he reached the 100 m semi-finals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and was a member of the relay team that finished 7th in the final.\nWells missed most of 1985 with injury. He was not selected for the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in 1986, as he had failed to compete at the Scottish trials. However, on 5 August at Gateshead, he beat both Ben Johnson and Atlee Mahorn, the respective Commonwealth 100 m and 200 m champions.\nWells gained additional attention at Gateshead for being the first to be seen sporting the now common Lycra running shorts. The sight of these led to him being dubbed Wilson of the Wizard (a comic book character).\nWells was consequently selected for Stuttgart in the European championships, coming fifth in both the 100 m and 200 m finals. He also had a victory against Linford Christie at Crystal Palace at the end of 1986 in 100 m at 10.31. One of his last victories was winning the Inverness Highland Games 100/200 double in 1987. In 1987 his best time was 10.28 and he qualified for the Rome World Championships but he\nwas injured.\nAlthough his later career was plagued by repeated back injuries, he still won a career total of 18 medals at major championships before retiring in his mid-30s. He and Don Quarrie and Pietro Mennea set a trend for sprinters in their mid thirties to compete longer in the late Eighties.\nAfter competitive retirement.\nSince 1982 Wells has lived in Surrey, with his wife Margot. After retirement, he was a coach for the British bobsleigh team. Margot was also a Scottish 100/100 hurdles champion. They are now based in Guildford, Surrey where she is a fitness consultant, and Allan is a retired systems engineer. Allan coached the Bank of Scotland specialist sprint squad alongside another former Scottish sprinter, Ian Mackie.\nWells's personal best for the 100 metres is 10.11, and for the 200 metres is 20.21, run at the Moscow 1980 games, and both are still Scottish records.\nHe also ran a wind-assisted (+5.9\u00a0m/s) 10.02 in Brisbane, 1982 (still the track record as of August\u00a02024 which he shares with Rohan Browning of Sydney, Australia from April\u00a02023), and (+3.7\u00a0m/s) 20.11 in Edinburgh, 1980.\nIn June 2015, a BBC documentary (Panorama: \"Catch Me If You Can\") uncovered allegations by Wells' former teammate of historical doping by the 1980 Olympic 100 m champion, beginning in 1977. Wells denied the allegations.\nAs of August 2024, Wells holds two track records for 200\u00a0metres, both of which had wind-assistance. They are Turin (20.29, 1979, +2.2\u00a0m/s) and Venice (20.26, 1981, +8.5\u00a0m/s).\nHonours and awards.\nWells was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1982 Birthday Honours for services to athletics. He was also inducted alongside Eric Liddell and Wyndham Halswelle (two other former Scottish Athletic Olympic Champions) into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.\nWells was the first baton holder for the Queen's Baton Relay for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, carrying the baton from Buckingham Palace in London in October 2013.\nIn July 2014, Wells received, along with his wife Margot, an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Edinburgh Napier University.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The King of the Belgians is the head of state, and the prime minister of Belgium is the head of government, in a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Federal legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. The federation is made up of (language-based) communities and (territorial) regions. Philippe is the seventh and current King of the Belgians, having ascended the throne on 21 July 2013.\nSince around 1970, the significant Belgian national political parties have split into distinct representations for each communities' interests, besides defense of their ideologies. These parties belong to three main political families, though all close to the centre: the right-wing Liberals, the social conservative Christian Democrats and the Socialists forming the left-wing. Other important newer parties are the Green parties and, nowadays mainly in Flanders, the nationalist and far-right parties. Politics is influenced by lobby groups, such as trade unions and employers' organizations such as the Federation of Belgian Enterprises. Majority rule is often superseded by a \"de facto\" confederal decision-making process where the minority (the French-speakers) enjoy important protections through specialty majorities (2/3 overall and majority in each of the 2 main communities). According to the V-Dem Democracy indices, Belgium was, in 2024, the 5th most electoral democratic country in the world.\nConstitution.\nThe Constitution of Belgium, the primary source of law and the basis of the political system of the Country, was established on February 7, 1831. It has been changed several times, but the most relevant reforms were made in 1970 and in 1993.\nIn 1970, in response to a growing civil conflict between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities in Brussels, the Government declared that \"the unitary state, its structure and functioning as laid down by law, had become obsolete\". The new constitution recognised the existence of strong communitarian and regional differences within Belgium, but sought to reconcile these differences through a diffusion of power to the communities and the regions.\nIn 1993, the parliament approved a constitutional package transforming Belgium into a full-fledged federal state.\nGovernment.\nExecutive.\nHead of state.\nThe King of the Belgians is the constitutional head of the Belgian state and holds office for life. The duties of the king are laid out by the Belgian Constitution and other laws enforced under it.\nAs titular head of state, the king plays a ceremonial and symbolic role in the nation. His main political function is to designate a political leader to form a new cabinet after an election or the resignation of a cabinet. In conditions where there is a \"constructive vote of no-confidence,\" the government has to resign and the lower house of Parliament proposes a new prime minister to the king. The king is also seen as playing a symbolic unifying role, representing a common national Belgian identity.\nPhilippe succeeded his father Albert II on 21 July 2013 upon his abdication.\nFederal government.\nThe executive power is held by the prime minister and the ministers, who together form the Council of Ministers, and by the secretaries of state, each of whom is deputy to a minister and is part of the federal Government, but does not sit in the Council of Ministers.\nMembers of the Federal Government, who are formally appointed by the King, are in fact drawn from the political parties which form the government coalition.\nThe Federal Government must enjoy the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives.\nThe total number of ministers, excluding the prime minister, cannot exceed 15. Also, the number of Dutch- and French-speaking ministers must be equal, with the possible exception of the prime minister.\nMinisters head executive departments of the government. The prime minister and his ministers administer the government and the various public services and the ministers must defend their policies and performance in person before the Chamber.\nRegional and community governments.\nThe regional and community parliaments and governments have jurisdiction over transportation, public works, water policy, cultural matters, education, public health, environment, housing, zoning, and economic and industrial policy. They rely on a system of revenue-sharing for funds. They have the authority to levy a very few taxes (mostly surcharges) and to contract loans. Moreover, they have obtained exclusive treaty-making power for those issues coming under their respective jurisdictions. Of total public spending (interest payments not considered), more than 30% is authorized by the regions and communities, although their financing comes for over 80% from national Belgian budgets; at the same time, the national government controls 100% of social security, and strictly limits the taxation policy by the federalized entities. As a result, Belgian institutions still control over 90% of the effective, global taxation levels on individuals and companies.\nThough since 1993 article 35 of the Constitution requires the creation of a list specifying federal as opposed to regional and communities' competences, such list was never created. Therefore, the federal government continues to exercise all competences not explicitly dedicated to the lesser levels.\nThe Flemish parties generally favour much larger community (and regional) autonomy, including financial and tax autonomy, while the francophone parties generally oppose it. The French-speaking parties tend to favour more state control.\nAs of October 2019, the regional executives are the following:\nProvincial and local government.\nThe two biggest regions, Flanders and Wallonia, are further subdivided into five provinces each. The Brussels-Capital Region is directly divided into 19 municipalities. In total, Belgium counts 581 municipalities. Provincial and local government is an exclusive competency of the regions. Therefore, one should see the relevant articles for more detailed information on provincial and local government.\nIn the Brussels region, there is another form of intermediate government, constituted by institutions from each of the two competent communities. Those institutions (COCOF for the French-speakers and VGC for the Flemings) have similar competencies, although only COCOF has legislative powers, given by the French Community. For Brussels community matters common to both communities there is a Common Community Commission.\nLegislative.\nLegislative powers in Belgium are divided between the national, the regional and the community levels.\nThe Belgian Federal Parliament consists of the Senate (Dutch: Senaat, French: S\u00e9nat) and the Chamber of Representatives (Dutch: Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers, French: Chambre des Repr\u00e9sentants). The Chamber has 150 members; the Senate has 60. All 150 representatives are elected directly via a system of proportional representation. The Senate consists of 50 senators elected by the parliaments of the communities and regions, and 10 senators co-opted by the others.\nSince the Constitutional reforms of 1993 and 2013, the two Houses of Parliament do not sit on a level of parity: other than in cases regarding the constitutional, institutional or federal structure or international relation, the consent of the Senate either is not required (so-called \"unicameral laws\", voted only by the House, such as the budget) or can be dispensed with by the House. The Chamber of Representatives is also the only house that votes the confidence to the Government.\nEach of the five components of the federal system (Flemish Community, French Community, German-speaking Community, Walloon Region and Brussels-Capital Region) have their own, directly elected unicameral council or parliament. They vote decrees (or ordinances in Brussels), that have the same value and are on the same juridical level as the federal laws.\nJudiciary.\nThe judicial system is based on civil law and originates from the Napoleonic Code. It has a judicial review of legislative acts. It accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction, with reservations. The Court of Appeals is one level below the Court of Cassation, an institution based on the French Court of Cassation. The Court of Cassation (Dutch: \"Hof van Cassatie\", French: \"Cour de Cassation\") is the most important court in Belgium. Judges are appointed for life by the Belgian monarch.\nElections and parties.\nElectoral system.\nThe election for the Belgian Chamber of Representatives is based on a system of open list proportional representation. Several months before an election, each party forms a list of candidates for each district. Parties are allowed to place as many candidates on their lists as there are seats available. The formation of the list is an internal process that varies with each party. The place on the list is considered to play a role in the election of a candidate, by giving stronger visibility to those high on the list; this phenomenon, however, seems to have lost importance since the last electoral reform.\nBelgian voters are given five options. They may:\nWhile there are some options to vote on more than one person, voters cannot vote for candidates of more than one candidate list (party). Doing so makes the vote invalid.\nPolitical campaigns in Belgium are relatively short, lasting only about one month. They are subjected to several limitations:\nBelgium is one of the few countries that has compulsory voting, thus having one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the world.\nElections for the Chamber of Representatives (Federal Parliament) are normally held every five years and coincide with those for the European Parliament. Before 2014, they were held every four years and were held separately.\nThe community and regional parliaments are elected every five years, and their elections coincide with those for the European Parliament as well.\nElections for the members of Belgium's municipal and provincial councils are held every six years.\nThe latest municipal and provincial elections were held in 2018 and the latest federal and regional elections were held in 2019.\nPolitical parties.\nIn Belgium, aside from a few minor German-speaking parties, most political parties are either Dutch-speaking (Flemish) or French-speaking; the only major bilingual party operating across all of Belgium is the Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB), a far-left party which has been represented in parliament since 2014. Parties run their own think tanks ( / ), research outfits that draft policy. When their party is in power, they serve as back offices for ministers' cabinets.\nAnother important characteristic of Belgian national politics is the highly federal nature of decision making. Important decisions require both a national majority (2/3 for constitutional changes), as well as majorities in the two main language groups. On top of that, both these communities can activate 'alarm bell'-procedures, delaying changes. In addition, there are no national parties to speak of. As a result of this, Belgian decision making can be slow and expensive. On top, it tends to significantly favour the more conservative parties. Given the historically very high public expenditure, and the very strict central control over taxation, even for revenues going to regions and communities, the tendency of Belgian governments to lower taxation and especially labour charges has been limited, at least if compared to radical-liberal approaches followed by certain other countries.\nHistory of the political landscape.\nFrom the creation of the Belgian state in 1830 and throughout most of the 19th century, two political parties dominated Belgian politics: the Catholic Party (Church-oriented and conservative) and the Liberal Party (anti-clerical and progressive). In the late 19th century, the Socialist Party arose to represent the emerging industrial working class. These three groups still dominate Belgian politics, but they have evolved substantially in character.\nIn the years before and after the Second World War, the linguistic problem became a stronger divisive issue in Belgian politics, with the emergence in the 1950s and 1960s of linguistic parties (Volksunie, FDF and Rassemblement Wallon). In the 1960s and 1970s, each of the main political parties of Belgium split into Flemish and French-speaking parties.\nAfter May 68, the country saw a growing environmental and left wing movement, that led to the foundation of the ecological parties Groen! and Ecolo.\nEspecially in Flanders, the 1980s saw the growth of the far right, represented by the Vlaams Belang, which became one of the larger parties of the country in the 1990s.\nDuring the years surrounding the new millennium, an attempt at restructuring the political landscape took place, mainly taking the form of political cartels.\nMain political parties.\nMain Flemish parties:\nMain French-speaking parties:\nGerman-speaking parties:\nTrade unions.\nBelgium is a highly unionised country, and organised labour is a powerful influence in politics. About 53% of all private sector and public service employees are labour union members. Not simply a \"bread and butter\" movement in the American sense, Belgian labour unions take positions on education, public finance, defence spending, environmental protection, women's rights, abortion, and other issues. They also provide a range of services, including the administration of unemployment benefits.\nBelgium's three principal trade union organizations are the Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CSC/ACV) (1,705,000 members), the General Federation of Belgian Labour (FGTB/ABVV) (1,198,000 members) and the General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium (CGSLB/ACLVB) which has 230,000 members.\nUntil the fifties, the FGTB/ABVV was the largest confederation, since then, however, the CSC/ACV has become the leading trade union force. In the most recent works council elections held in 2004 the CSC/ACV garnered close to 53% of the vote, the Socialist confederation obtained 36%, and the Liberal confederation 10%.\nThe Confederation of Catholic labour Unions (CSC/ACV). Organised in 1912, the CSC/ACV rejects the Marxist concept of \"class struggle\" and seeks to achieve a just social order based on Christian principles. The CSC/ACV is not formally linked to its party political counterparts, the Christian Democratic parties (CD&amp;V and CDH), but exercises great influence in their councils.\nThe Belgian Socialist Confederation of labour (FGTB/ABVV) derives from the socialist trade union movement, established in the late 19th century in Walloon industrial areas, Brussels, and urban areas of Flanders.\nLinguistic division.\nBelgium is a country in which language is a major political issue. In the 19th and early 20th century, Flemings did not enjoy the same rights as French-speakers, both de facto and de jure. When the country was founded in 1830 under a census voting system, only around 1% of the adult population could vote: nobility, haute-bourgeoisie and higher clerics, all of them French-speaking. A Flemish movement fought peacefully to gain equal rights, obtaining most of these. Minor issues exist also between German- and French-speakers.\nIn the 3rd century AD, Germanic Franks migrated into what is now Belgium. The less populated northern areas became Germanic, while in the southern part, where the Roman presence had been much stronger, Latin persisted despite the migrations of the Franks. This linguistic frontier has more or less endured.\nThe Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and the 19th century further accentuated the north\u2013south division. Francophone Wallonia became an early industrial boom area, affluent and politically dominant. Dutch-speaking Flanders remained agricultural and was economically and politically outdistanced by Wallonia and the capital. The elite during the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century spoke French, even in the Dutch-speaking area. In the 20th century, and particularly after the Second World War, Flanders saw an economic flowering while Wallonia became economically stagnant. As Flemings became more educated and more well off, and sought a fair and equal share of political power, tensions between the two communities rose.\nLinguistic demonstrations in the early 1960s led in 1962 to the establishment of a formal linguistic border and elaborate rules were made to protect minorities in linguistically mixed border areas. In 1970, the Constitution was amended. Flemish and francophone cultural councils were established with authority in matters relating to language and culture for the two language groups.\nThe 1970 constitutional revision did not finally settle the problem, however. A controversial amendment declared that Belgium consists of three cultural communities (the Flemish Community, the French(-speaking) Community and the German-speaking Community) and three economic regions (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels) each to be granted a significant measure of political autonomy. It was not until 1980, however, that an agreement could be reached on how to implement this new constitutional provision.\nIn August 1980, the Belgian Parliament passed a devolution bill and amended the Constitution, establishing:\nImmediately, the Flemings had their regional legislative council and government transfer its competencies to the community legislative council and government. That became competent for both cultural, language, and educational affairs, and for regional economic matters.\nSince 1984 the German language community of Belgium (in the eastern part of Li\u00e8ge Province) has had its own legislative assembly and executive, competent for cultural, language, and educational affairs.\nIn 1988\u201389 the Constitution was again amended to give additional responsibilities to the regions and communities. The most sweeping change was to devolve nearly all responsibilities for educational matters to the communities. Moreover, the regions and communities were provided additional revenue, and Brussels Region was given its own legislative assembly and executive.\nAnother important constitutional reform took place in the summer of 1993. It formally changed Belgium from a unitary to a federal state. It also (modestly) reformed the bicameral parliamentary system and provided for the direct election of the members of the community and regional legislative councils. The bilingual Brabant province was split into separate Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant provinces, whereas in the Brussels-Capital Region most of the elsewhere provincial powers are exercised by the region and the responsibilities of an elsewhere provincial governor towards the federal level, by the Governor of Brussels-Capital. However, the electoral and judicial districts of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde were not split.\nDespite the numerous constitution revisions, the matter is not completely settled. There is still a lot of political tension between French-speakers and Dutch-speakers, and, to a lesser degree, between French-speakers and the politically far weaker German-speakers.\nShift from linguistic to cultural and political animosity.\nAt the end of the 20th century, it became clear that the main opposition between Flemings and Walloons was not primarily linguistic anymore, but had shifted to major political and demographic differences. Flemish parties appear much more 'Anglo-Saxon' in policy choices, moving away from 'big state' philosophies. French-speaking parties, including their 'right-wing' parties, tend to favor big government and state support for the poor.\nThis became very obvious after the 2007 elections: in Flanders, the classical left-wing parties only captured 1/4 of the votes. On the French-speaking side, the left still carried 1/2 of the votes. One of the key differences centers on the policy towards everyone receiving allocations. Flemings strongly favor a policy focused at helping them regain their autonomy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Belgium has also 3,454 km\u00b2 (1,334 sq mi) of sea territories in the North Sea; including this, its total territory is 34,143 km\u00b2 (13,183 sq mi).\nBy provinces, the area (of 30,689 km\u00b2) is distributed as such:\nFor the purpose of total area, the Brussels-Capital Region should also be included, though no longer a province since the Brabant was split. \nOn 29 May 2000, 2,000 square meters were granted by the Netherlands to Belgium (a piece of land in Zelzate along the Ghent\u2013Terneuzen Canal).\nCompared to other countries, Belgium is 44% larger than Wales in the United Kingdom and about the size of Maryland in the United States. Belgium is actually used as an unusual unit of measurement in comparing country sizes.\nIn November 2016, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed to cede small, uninhabited parcels of land to reflect a change in course of the river Meuse (or Maas, in Dutch). The land swap is to take effect as of 2018.\nPhysical geography.\nBelgium has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west, the central plateau, and the Ardennes uplands in the south-east. The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by dikes or, further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. The second geographical region, the central plateau, lies further inland. This is a smooth, slowly rising area that has many fertile valleys and is irrigated by many waterways. Here one can also find rougher land, including caves and small gorges. The third geographical region, called the Ardennes, is more rugged than the first two. It is a thickly forested plateau, very rocky and not very good for farming, which extends into northern France and in Germany where it is named Eifel. This is where much of Belgium's wildlife can be found. Belgium's highest point, the Signal de Botrange is located in this region at only . Belgium has relatively few natural lakes and none of any great size.\nNotable natural regions include the Ardennes, Campine and High Fens.\nRivers and lakes.\nAll of Belgium is drained into the North Sea, except the municipality of Momignies (Macquenoise), which is drained by the river Oise into the English Channel. Three major rivers flow into the sea: the Scheldt (200\u00a0km in Belgium, 350\u00a0km in total), the Meuse (183\u00a0km in Belgium, 925\u00a0km in total) and the Yser (50\u00a0km in Belgium, 78\u00a0km in total). Other rivers are the Rupel, Senne, Sambre, Lesse, Ourthe, Lys and Dijle. The main lakes include the Lake Genval, Lake B\u00fctgenbach, Lake Eau d'Heure, Lake Gileppe, Lake Eupen and Lake Robertville.\nArtificial waterways.\nBelgium also has many artificial waterways or canals, among others the Brussels\u2013Scheldt Maritime Canal, the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Canal, the Canal du Centre and the Albert Canal in Antwerp.\nClimate.\nThe Belgian climate, like most of northwest Europe, is maritime temperate, with significant precipitation in all seasons (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Cfb\"; the average temperature is in January, and in July; the average precipitation is in January, and in July). Belgium usually has cool winters but temperatures as low as \u221216\u00a0\u00b0C (3\u00a0\u00b0F) have been registered and summers are comfortably warm but temperatures can occasionally rise as high as 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).\nMountain and hills.\nBelgium's highest point is the Signal de Botrange at 694 metres above the sea level. Other hills in Belgium include the Kemmelberg (159 m high) and the Koppenberg (77 m high) both known as part of the route of the cycle races Gent\u2013Wevelgem and the Tour of Flanders respectively.\nExtreme points.\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Belgium, the points that are farther north, south, east, west, high or low than any other location.\nThe Belgian National Geographic Institute calculated that the central point of Belgium lies at coordinates , in Nil-Saint-Vincent-Saint-Martin in the municipality of Walhain.\nNatural resources.\nNatural resources in Belgium include construction materials, silica sand and carbonates. Belgium used to have coal mines. As of 2012, the land use was as follows:\nAs of 2007, the estimated area of irrigated land was of 233.5\u00a0km2.\nEnvironment.\nBecause of its high population density and location in the centre of Western Europe, Belgium faces serious environmental problems. A 2003 report suggested that the water in Belgium's rivers was of the lowest quality in Europe, and bottom of the 122 countries studied. The environment is exposed to intense pressures from human activities: urbanisation, dense transportation network, industry, extensive animal breeding, and crop cultivation; air and water pollution also have repercussions for neighbouring countries; uncertainties regarding federal and regional responsibilities (now resolved) have slowed progress in tackling environmental challenges.\nIn Belgium forest cover is around 23% of the total land area, equivalent to 689,300 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 677,400 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 251,200 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 438,200 hectares (ha). For the year 2015, 47% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 53% private ownership and 0% with ownership listed as other or unknown. \nCities.\nThe main cities in Belgium in terms of population are Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, Charleroi and Li\u00e8ge. Other notable cities include Bruges, Namur, Leuven, Mons and Mechelen.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67303", "revid": "39276444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67303", "title": "Two Towers, Bologna", "text": "12th-century buildings in Bologna, Italy\nThe Two Towers (), both leaning, are symbols of Bologna, Italy, and the most prominent of the Towers of Bologna. They are located at the intersection of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old ring wall (\"mura dei torresotti\"). The taller one is the \"Asinelli\"; the smaller, with a greater lean, is the \"Garisenda\". They are named for the families which are traditionally credited with having constructed them between 1109 and 1119.\nTheir construction may have been a competition between the two families to show which was the more powerful, but the scarcity of documents from this period makes this uncertain. The name of the Asinelli family, for example, is documented for the first time in 1185, almost 70 years after the presumed construction of the tower.\nThe Two Towers were the subject of a poem in Giosu\u00e8 Carducci's \"Barbarian Odes\". Charles Dickens wrote about them in his \"Pictures from Italy\". Antal Szerb wrote about them in \"The Third Tower: Journeys in Italy\".\nAsinelli Tower.\nIt is believed that the Asinelli Tower initially had a height of ca. and was raised later to the current , with an overhanging battlement of 2.2 m (6.6 ft). In the 14th century, the city became its owner and used it as a prison and small stronghold.\nDuring this period, a wooden construction was added around the tower at a height of roughly 30 metres, about 100 feet, above ground, which was connected with an aerial footbridge to the Garisenda Tower. The footbridge was destroyed in a 1398 fire. Its addition is attributed to Giovanni Visconti, Duke of Milan, who allegedly wanted to use it to control the turbulent \"Mercato di Mezzo\", the central street, today the via Rizzoli, to suppress possible revolts. The Visconti had become the rulers of Bologna after the decline of the Signoria of the Pepoli family, but were rather unpopular in the city.\nSevere damage was caused by lightning that often resulted in small fires and collapses. In 1824 a lightning rod was installed. The tower has survived at least two documented large fires: the first in 1185 due to arson and a second in 1398.\nThe Asinelli Tower was used by the scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli in 1640 and Giovanni Battista Guglielmini in the 1700s for experiments to study the motion of heavy bodies and the Earth's rotation. In World War II, between 1943 and 1945, it was used as a sight post: during bombing attacks, four volunteers took posts at the top to direct rescue operations to places hit by Allied bombs. Later, an RAI television relay was installed on top.\nGarisenda Tower.\nThe Garisenda Tower today has a height of , with a lean of . Initially, it was approximately 60 metres (about 200 feet) high, but had to be lowered in the 14th century due to a yielding of the ground which left it slanting and dangerous. In the early 15th century, the tower was bought by the \"Arte dei Drappieri\", which remained the sole owner until the \"Garisenda\" became municipal property at the end of the 19th century.\nIt was cited several times by Dante in the \"Divine Comedy\" and \"The Rhymes\", a confirmation of his stay in Bologna, and by Goethe in his \"Italian Journey\".\nIn October 2023, the tower was sealed off by the city of Bologna after fears the structure was tilting too far. Bologna officials noted that the tower has leaned since it was built; it had sustained additional damage in the medieval era when ironwork and bakery ovens were built inside. On 2 December 2023, the city announced that the tower was in danger of collapsing, and it began constructing a barrier to contain debris in the event of a fall. According to the city officials, work to prevent the collapse of the tower is expected to take at least 10 years and cost \u20ac20 million.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67304", "revid": "49632817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67304", "title": "Economy of Belgium", "text": "The economy of Belgium is a highly developed, high-income, mixed economy. \nBelgium's economy has capitalised on the country's central geographic location, and has a well-developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. Belgium was the first European country to join the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century. It has since developed a highly-developed transportation infrastructure made up of ports (most notably the Port of Antwerp), canals, railways, and highways, in order to integrate its industry with that of its neighbours. Among OECD nations, Belgium has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure accounts for roughly 29% of GDP. \nBelgium's industry is concentrated mainly in the populous region of Flanders in the north, around Brussels and in the two biggest Walloon cities, Li\u00e8ge and Charleroi, along the \"Sillon industriel\". Belgium imports raw materials and semi-finished goods that are further processed and re-exported. Except for its coal, which is no longer economical to exploit, Belgium has few natural resources other than fertile soil. Despite the heavy industrial component, services dominate the country's economy and account for 77.2% of Belgium's gross domestic product (GDP), while agriculture accounts for 0.7%.\nWith exports equivalent to over two-thirds of the country's gross national income (GNI), Belgium depends heavily on world trade. Belgium's trade advantages are derived from its central geographic location and a highly skilled, multilingual, and productive work force. One of the founding members of the European Community, Belgium strongly supports deepening the powers of the present-day European Union (EU) to integrate European economies further. About three-quarters of its trade is with other EU countries. In 2021, Belgium's public debt was about 108% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).\nHistory.\nIn the twentieth century.\nFor 50 years through World War II, French-speaking Wallonia was a technically advanced, industrial region, with its industry concentrated along the sillon industriel, while Dutch-speaking Flanders was predominantly agricultural with some industry, mainly processing agricultural products and textiles. This disparity began to fade during the interwar period. When Belgium emerged from World War II with its industrial infrastructure relatively undamaged thanks to the Galopin doctrine, the stage was set for a period of rapid development, particularly in Flanders. The postwar boom years, enhanced by the establishment of the European Union and NATO headquarters in Brussels, contributed to the rapid expansion of light industry throughout most of Flanders, particularly along a corridor stretching between Brussels and Antwerp, which is the second-largest port in Europe, after the port of Rotterdam.\nForeign investment contributed significantly to Belgian economic growth in the 1960s. In particular, U.S. firms played a leading role in the expansion of light industrial and petrochemical industries in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe older, traditional industries of Wallonia, particularly the steel industry, began to lose their competitive edge during this period, but the general growth of world prosperity masked this deterioration until the 1973 and 1979 oil price shocks and resultant shifts in international demand sent the economy into a period of prolonged recession. In the 1980s and 1990s, the economic center of the country continued to shift northwards to Flanders with investments by multinationals (automotive industry, chemical industry) and growing local industrial agriculture (for textiles and food).\nThe early 1980s saw the country facing a difficult period of structural adjustment caused by declining demand for its traditional products, deteriorating economic performance, and neglected structural reform. Consequently, the 1980\u201382 recession shook Belgium to the core\u2014unemployment mounted, social welfare costs increased, personal debt soared, the government deficit climbed to 13% of GDP, and the national debt, although mostly held domestically, mushroomed.\nAgainst this grim backdrop, in 1982, Prime Minister Martens' center-right coalition government formulated an economic recovery program to promote export-led growth by enhancing the competitiveness of Belgium's export industries through an 8.5% devaluation. Economic growth rose from 2% in 1984 to a peak of 4% in 1989. In May 1990, the government linked the Belgian franc to the Deutsche Mark, primarily through closely tracking German interest rates. Consequently, as German interest rates rose after 1990, Belgian rates have increased and contributed to a decline in the economic growth rate. In 1992\u201393, the Belgian economy suffered the worst recession since World War II, with the real GDP declining 0.96% in 1993.\nOn 1 May 1998, Belgium became a first-tier member of the European Monetary Union.\nIn the twenty-first century.\nBelgium switched from the Belgian franc to the euro as its currency after 1 January 2002. Belgian per capita GDP ranks among the world's highest. In 2008, the per capita income (PPP) was $37,500. The federal government has not managed to present balanced budgets in recent years and public debt remains high, at 99% of 2009 GDP. In 2009, during the Great Recession, Belgium suffered negative growth and increased unemployment. GDP growth in 2009 was \u22121.5%.\nIn the era of COVID-19.\nEconomic Policy &amp; Impact of COVID-19.\nAs a response to the virus and in an attempt to counter it, the Belgian government implemented safety protocols that involved the closing of non-vital businesses, constrained travel, and limited workers for the public. This resulted in consequences for business alike\u2013though by disparate levels of impact, and the disruption and lockdown of cash flows. The sectors most impacted by the pandemic were entertainment, non-food trade, and accommodations, experiencing around 70% - 90% (2020) loss of revenue, while sectors like public administration and education experienced a 4% - 21% loss of revenue. These conditions caused the GDP to decrease by 3.3% as the end of the first quarter neared, then by 11.9% by the second quarter. After a pickup through the third quarter and stabilization during the fourth, the GDP collectively dropped 6.3% (2020).\nMaritime trade, which makes up about 7% of Belgium's GDP, fell approximately 3.4% (2020). Sectors like automotive declined and continue to see a decline to this day.\nHousehold incomes experienced drops in the face of COVID-19, with an approximate 40% who became unemployed and about a 65% decrease in market incomes overall (2020). During this time employment began to shift from on-site labor to off-site from home labor, with an approximate 62% working remotely.\nEconomic Policy of COVID-19.\nBelgium adopted various support policies as a response to the virus' shut down of various businesses and to tackle the rising unemployed population. They extended the duration of unemployment benefits from June to August, increased the benefits from 65% - 70% of previous wage, and provided a daily supplement of 5.63 euro (2020). Following their economic implementations, they also faced a debt of 117.8% of their GDP (2021).\nTrade unions.\nWith 65% of the workers belonging to a union, Belgium is a country with one of the highest percentages of trade union membership. Only the Scandinavian countries have a higher trade union density. The biggest union with around 1.7\u00a0million members is the Christian democrat Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (ACV-CSC) which was founded in 1904. The origins of the union can be traced back to the \"Anti-Socialist Cotton Workers Union\" that was founded in 1886. The second biggest union is the socialist General Federation of Belgian Labour (ABVV-FGTB) which has a membership of more than 1.5\u00a0million. The ABVV-FGTB traces its origins to 1857, when the first Belgian union was founded in Ghent by a group of weavers. This and other socialist unions became unified around 1898. The ABVV-FGTB in its current form dates back to 1945. The third major multi-sector union in Belgium is the liberal (classical liberal) union General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium (ACLVB-CGSLB) which is relatively small in comparison to the first two with a little under 290 thousand members. The ACLVB-CGSLB was founded in 1920 in an effort to unite the many small liberal unions. Back then the liberal union was known as the \"Nationale Centrale der Liberale Vakbonden van Belgi\u00eb\". In 1930, the ACLVB-CGSLB adopted its current name.\nBesides these \"big three\" there are a number of smaller unions, some more influential than others. These smaller unions tend to specialize in one profession or economic sector. Next to these specialized unions there is also the that rejects the pillarization of the \"big three\" trade unions (their affiliation with political parties). There is also a small Flemish nationalist union that exists only in the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium, called the . The last Belgian union worth mentioning is the very small, but highly active anarchist union called the .\nTrade.\nAbout 80% of Belgium's trade is with fellow EU member states. Given this high percentage, it seeks to diversify and expand trade opportunities with non-EU countries. The Belgian authorities are, as a rule, anti-protectionist and try to maintain a hospitable and open trade and investment climate. The European Commission negotiates on trade issues for all member states, which, in turn lessens bilateral trade disputes with Belgium.\nThe Belgian Government encourages new foreign investment as a means to promote employment. With regional devolution, Flanders, Brussels, and Wallonia are now courting potential foreign investors and offer a host of incentives and benefits. Foreign companies in Belgium account for approximately 11% of the total work force, with the U.S.\nAttracted by the EU 1992 single-market program, many foreign firms and lawyers have settled in Brussels since 1989.\nEmployment.\nThe social security system, which expanded rapidly during the prosperous 1950s and 1960s, includes a medical system, unemployment insurance coverage, child allowances, invalid benefits, and other benefits and pensions. With the onset of a recession in the 1970s, this system became an increasing burden on the economy and accounted for much of the government budget deficits. The national unemployment figures mask considerable differences between Flanders and Wallonia. Unemployment in Wallonia is mainly structural, while in Flanders it is cyclical. Flanders' unemployment levels are generally only about half those of Walloon. The southern region continues a difficult transition out of sunset industries (mainly coal and steel), while sunrise industries (chemicals, high-tech, and services) dominate in Flanders.\nBelgium's unemployment rate was 6.5% in 2008. A total of 4.99 million people make up Belgium's labor force. The vast majority of these people (80%), work in the service sector. The Belgian Industry claims 19% of the labor force; and agriculture claims 1%. As in other industrialized nations, pension and other social entitlement programs have become a major economic and political concern as the baby boomers approach retirement age.\nBudget.\nAlthough Belgium is a wealthy country, public expenditures far exceeded income for many years, and taxes were not diligently pursued. The Belgian Government reacted to the 1973 and 1979 oil price hikes by hiring the redundant work force into the public sector and subsidizing industries like coal, steel, textiles, glass, and shipbuilding, which had lost their international competitive edge. As a result, cumulative government debt reached 121% of GDP by the end of the 1980s. However, thanks to Belgium's high personal savings rate, the Belgian Government financed the deficit from mainly domestic savings, minimizing the deleterious effects on the overall economy.\nThe federal government ran a 7.1% budget deficit in 1992 at the time of the EU's Treaty of Maastricht, which established conditions for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) that led to adoption of the common Euro currency on 1 January 2002. Among other criteria spelled out under the Maastricht treaty, the Belgian Government had to attain a budget deficit of no greater than 3% of GDP by the end of 1997; Belgium achieved this, with a total budget deficit in 2001 (just prior to implementation of the Euro) that amounted to 0.2% of GDP. The government has balanced the budget every year since, until 2009 where it ran a deficit of about $25 billion. Belgium's accumulated public debt remains high at 99% of 2009 GDP. A slight decrease in the accumulated public debt compared to GDP has been seen, however, thanks to a higher economic growth rate compared to the budget growth rate, which pushed the percentage from 99% of GDP in 2009 to 95% of GDP in 2011, a four-point decrease in two years, a feat rare enough to mention in the Western World.\nRegional differences.\nThe economy of Belgium is varied and cannot be understood without taking the regional differences into account. Indeed, the Flemish and Walloon economies differ in many respects (consider for instance Eurostat and OECD statistics), and cities like Brussels, Antwerp, Li\u00e8ge, Bruges, Charleroi, or Ghent also exhibit significant differences. In general, productivity in Flanders is roughly 20% higher (per inhabitant) than in Wallonia. Brussels' GDP per capita is much higher than either region, although this is misleading, as many of those that work in the Brussels-Capital Region live in Flanders or Wallonia. Their output is counted in Brussels and not where they live, artificially raising the \"per capita\" GDP of Brussels and slightly lowering that of Flanders and Wallonia.\nUnemployment has remained consistently more than twice as high in Wallonia than in Flanders, and has been even higher in Brussels, during most of the last 20 years (2012: Flanders: 4.55%; Wallonia: 10.12% and Brussels: 17.47%).\nBrussels.\nBeing the \"de facto\" capital of the European Union, its economy is very service-oriented. It has a number of regional headquarters of multinational corporations. It is also host to a great number of European institutions, in addition to the Belgian federal government, the government of the Flemish Community and the government of the French Community. Brussels also has many commuters, with 230,000 coming from Flanders, and 130,000 from Wallonia. Much of the success of Brussels is based on the high educational skills of its workforce. As of July 2012, however, the statistical unemployment rate in Brussels was 20.6%.\nFlanders.\nIn 2004, the port of Antwerp was the second-largest European sea port by cargo volume, and the Antwerp freight railway station accounts for one-third of Belgian freight traffic. Antwerp is the first diamond market in the world, diamond exports account for roughly 1/10 of Belgian exports. The Antwerp-based BASF plant is the largest BASF-base outside Germany, and accounts on its own for about 2% of Belgian exports. Other industrial and service activities include car manufacturing, telecommunications, and photographic products.\nThe port of Bruges-Zeebrugge is one of the most important, modern and fastest growing ports in Europe. It is Europe's largest port for RoRo traffic and natural gas. It also is the world's largest port for the import and export of new vehicles. Tourism is also a major component of the economy of Bruges. Due to its pristine medieval city centre, Bruges has become a popular tourist destination. Annually about 2.5 million day tourists visit the city and in 2007 there were about 1.4 million overnight stays.\nThe port of Ghent, in the north of the city, is the third-largest port of Belgium. It is accessed by the Ghent\u2013Terneuzen Canal, which ends near the Dutch port of Terneuzen on the Western Scheldt. The port houses, among others, big companies like ArcelorMittal, Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks, Volvo Parts, Honda, and Stora Enso. Ghent University, the second-largest university of Belgium by number of students, and a number of research-oriented companies are situated in the central and southern part of the city. Tourism is increasingly becoming a major employer in the local area. Begonias have been cultivated in the Ghent area since 1860. Belgium is the world's largest producer of begonias, planting 60 million tubers per year. Eighty percent of the crop is exported.\nWallonia.\nIn the past, Li\u00e8ge was one of the most important steel-making centres in Europe. Starting in 1817, John Cockerill extensively developed the iron and steel industry. The industrial complex of Seraing was the largest in the world. Although now a shadow of its former self, steel production and the manufacture of steel goods remain important.\nLi\u00e8ge has also been an important centre for gunsmithing since the Middle Ages, and the arms industry is still strong with the headquarters of FN Herstal. The economy of the region is now diversified, the most important centers are mechanical industries (aircraft engine and spacecraft propulsion), space technology, information technology, biotechnology and also production of water, beer, and chocolate. Li\u00e8ge Science Park, south-east of the city, near the University of Li\u00e8ge campus, houses spin-offs and high technology businesses. Li\u00e8ge is also a very important logistics center: the city possesses the third-largest river port in Europe, directly connected to Antwerp, Rotterdam and Germany via the Meuse river and the Albert Canal. In 2006, Li\u00e8ge Airport was the 8th most important cargo airport in Europe. A new passenger terminal was opened in 2005. It is also the main hub and the headquarters of TNT Airways.\nCharleroi features an industrial area, iron and steel industry, glassworks, chemicals, and electrical engineering. Charleroi is in the center of a vast coal basin, called \"Pays Noir\". Many slag heaps still surround the city. Charleroi is also known for its publishing industry with Dupuis, one of the main publishers of Franco-Belgian comics, located in Marcinelle.\nData.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022\u20132027). Inflation under 5% is in green.\nCompanies.\nIn 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Belgium is the Services sector with 433,375 companies, followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate with 169,544 companies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

He was Olympic champion in 1924 in the 100 metres sprint, a feat depicted in the 1981 film \"Chariots of Fire\".\nEarly life and education.\nAbrahams's father, Isaac, was a Jewish immigrant from Polish Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire since the Partitions of Poland. He worked as a financier, and settled in Bedford with his Welsh Jewish wife, Esther Isaacs. Harold was born in Bedford in 1899. His eldest brother was the physician Sir Adolphe Abrahams (1883\u20131967), the founder of British sport medicine. His middle brother was another British Olympic athlete, long jumper Sir Sidney Abrahams (1885\u20131957).\nAbrahams was educated at Bedford School and Repton School, then both all-boys independent schools. Before attending university, Abrahams served in the British Army. Having been a cadet, he was commissioned in the Bedfordshire Regiment as a temporary second lieutenant on 5 March 1919; he relinquished his commission on 1 September 1921 having completed his period of service. \nHe studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, from 1919 to 1923. At Cambridge, he was a member of the Cambridge University Athletics Club (of which he was president 1922\u20131923), Cambridge University Liberal Club, the University Pitt Club, and the Gilbert and Sullivan Society. After university he trained as a lawyer. \nAbrahams was also a member of the Achilles Club, a track and field club formed in 1920 by and for past and present representatives of Oxford and Cambridge universities. One of the club's founding members was Evelyn Montague, who like Abrahams is also portrayed in the 1981 film \"Chariots of Fire.\"\nAthletics.\nAbrahams had been a sprinter and long jumper since his youth. He continued to compete in running while at Cambridge. Abrahams earned a place in the 1920 Olympic team, but was eliminated in the quarter-finals of both the 100 m and the 200 m, and finished 20th in the long jump. He was also part of the British relay team that took fourth place in the 4 \u00d7 100 m.\nThe following year, Abrahams finished second behind Harry Edward in the 100 yards and 220 yards events at the 1921 AAA Championships. He became the national long jump champion after winning the AAA Championships title at the 1923 AAA Championships.\nAfter graduating from Cambridge, he employed Sam Mussabini, a professional coach, who improved his style and training techniques in preparation for the 1924 Olympics in Paris, France.\nFor six months, Mussabini emphasised the 100 metres at Abrahams's direction, with the 200 metres as secondary. Through vigorous training, Abrahams perfected his start, stride and form. Abrahams won both the 100 yards and long jump titles at the 1924 AAA Championships and one month before the 1924 Games, Abrahams set the English record in the long jump , a record which stood for the next 32 years. The same day he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds, but the time was not submitted as a record because the track was on a slight downhill.\nAt the 1924 Summer Games, Abrahams won the 100 m in a time of 10.6 seconds, beating all the American favourites, including the 1920 gold-medal winner Charley Paddock. In third place was Arthur Porritt, later Governor-General of New Zealand and Queen's Surgeon. The Paris Olympics 100 m dash took place at 7 p.m. on 7 July 1924, and Abrahams and Porritt dined together at 7 p.m. on 7 July every year thereafter, until Abrahams's death in 1978. Teammate Eric Liddell, the British 100-yard dash record holder at that time, declined to compete in the Paris 100 m because one of the heats for the event was held on a Sunday. Both Liddell and Abrahams competed in the final of the 200 m race, with Liddell finishing third and Abrahams sixth. Liddell went on to win the gold medal in the 400 metres. Abrahams was the opening runner for the British 4 \u00d7 100 m team, which won the silver medal. He did not compete in the long jump.\nLater life.\nIn May 1925, Abrahams broke his leg while long-jumping, ending his athletic career. He returned to his legal career as a barrister. In 1928, he was team captain of the British Olympic team at Amsterdam and editor of the Official British Olympic Report for the same games. Subsequently, he worked as an athletics journalist for forty years, becoming a commentator on the sports for BBC radio.\nLater in his life, he also became president of the Jewish Athletic Association, and served as chairman for the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA).\nIn 1936, when the Amateur Athletic Union considered a boycott of Hitler's Olympics, Abrahams successfully led the fight against doing so. While the influential Avery Brundage minimized the scope of the Third Reich's persecution of Jews, Abrahams instead argued on pragmatic grounds: \u201cI do not believe that any real good will come if this resolution is adopted; on the contrary, I believe that it will do harm.\" He went on to report from the 1936 Berlin Olympics for the BBC, exuberantly covering Jack Lovelock's win in the 1500 metres: \u201cA hundred yards to go! Come on, Jack!! My God, he\u2019s done it. Jack, come on! Lovelock wins. Five yards, six yards, he wins. He\u2019s won. Hooray!\u201d His daughter reported that Abrahams had sat close to Hitler, and had said afterwards: \"I wish I'd shot him.\"\nAbrahams wrote a number of books, including \"Oxford Versus Cambridge. A Record Of Inter-University Contests From 1827-1930\" (co-written with John Bruce-Kerr), \"The Olympic Games, 1896\u20131952\" and \"The Rome Olympiad, 1960\".\nAlthough not an official timer, Abrahams was present when Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile in 1954.\nAbrahams died in Enfield on 14 January 1978, aged 78. He was buried in the same grave as his wife Sybil Evers, in St John the Baptist churchyard in Great Amwell, Hertfordshire.\nPersonal life.\nWhile at Cambridge, Abrahams was romantically involved with academic Christina McLeod Innes, and they became informally engaged, but their relationship waned and ended as Abrahams began focusing exclusively on his athletics and the Olympics. In early 1934, he met D'Oyly Carte Opera Company singer Sybil Evers, and they began a passionate on-and-off romance. According to his biographer Mark Ryan, Abrahams had a fear of commitment and old-fashioned ideas about the role of women in marriage, but he was able to overcome these, and the couple wed in December 1936. In the film \"Chariots of Fire\", Abrahams is instead depicted as dating D'Oyly Carte soprano Sybil Gordon (portrayed by Alice Krige), and the film portrays the couple as meeting a decade earlier than he and Evers actually did.\nAbrahams cut a strip of gold off his Olympic medal to make the bridal wedding ring. Both the medal and the ring (following Sybil's death) were later stolen, on separate occasions.\nSybil Evers could not have children, so they adopted an eight-week-old boy, Alan, in 1942, and a nearly three-year-old girl, Susan, in 1946; Susan (\"Sue\") later married the formerly imprisoned anti-nuclear activist Pat Pottle, with whom she had two sons.\nDuring the Nazi regime and war, the couple also fostered two Jewish refugees: a German boy called \"Ken Gardner\" (born Kurt Katzenstein), and an Austrian girl named Minka.\nSybil Evers died in 1963 at the age of 59. Abrahams set up two awards in her name: the Sybil Evers Memorial Prize for Singing (1965\u20131995), an annual cash prize awarded to the best female singer in her last year at the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art, and the Sybil Abrahams Memorial Trophy, presented each year from 1964 onward at Buckingham Palace by the Duke of Edinburgh, President of the British Amateur Athletics Association, to the best British woman athlete.\nAbrahams was active in freemasonry. He was a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, which was portrayed in \"Chariots of Fire\".\nHonours.\nAbrahams was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1957. Abrahams has been recognised with an English Heritage Blue plaque at his former home in Golders Green in northwest London, which was unveiled by his daughter Sue Pottle and nephew Tony Abrahams. Abrahams lived at Hodford Lodge, 2 Hodford Road, from 1923 to 1930, years during which he achieved his greatest successes.\nA plaque from the Heritage Foundation was unveiled at his birthplace, Rutland Road in Bedford, on 8 July 2012. This coincided with the Olympic torch relay passing through the town.\nAbrahams was immortalised in the 1981 film \"Chariots of Fire\", in which he was played by British actor Ben Cross. The film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. His memorial service serves as the framing device for the movie, which tells his story and that of Liddell.\nAbrahams was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the England Athletics Hall of Fame in 2009.\nIn July 2012, plans were announced to erect a memorial to Abrahams in Telford, Shropshire, to recognise that before the 1924 Olympics he won a gold medal in the 100-yard sprint at the Midlands Area AAA championships at St George's Recreation Club ground. The memorial, in the form of a plaque, was unveiled by Sue Pottle in October 2014 in the lounge of the club, which now possesses the medal he won at the event.\nNorris McWhirter once commented that Abrahams \"managed by sheer force of personality and with very few allies to raise athletics from a minor to a major national sport\". Reflecting in 1948 on Abrahams' athleticism, Philip Noel-Baker, Britain's 1912 Olympic captain and a Nobel Prize winner, wrote:\nI have always believed that Harold Abrahams was the only European sprinter who could have run with Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalfe, and the other great sprinters from the U.S. He was in their class, not only because of natural gifts \u2013 his magnificent physique, his splendid racing temperament, his flair for the big occasion \u2013 but because he understood athletics and had given more brainpower and more will power to the subject than any other runner of his day.\nArchives.\nArchives of Harold Abrahams are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Moroccan Belgians are the third-largest group, and the largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 340,359. According to Mich\u00e8le Tribalat in the beginning of 2020, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed 32.1% of the total population. According to Statbel, 65.5% of the Belgian population was Belgian with a Belgian background in 2024. The Belgian background by age group was 51.8% among those under 18, 62.1% among 18-64-year-olds and 85.5% among those aged 65 and over.\nOf these 'New Belgians', 55.1% are of non-Belgian European ancestry and 44.9% are from non-Western countries.\nThe rest consists mostly of French-speaking people from Brussels, Turks, Kurds, Dutch, French, Portuguese, Spaniards, Greeks, Bosniaks, Algerians, Congolese, Vietnamese, Poles, Indians, and Guineans (around 23% of Belgium's population is of non-Belgian origin). Approximately 30,000 Roma live in Belgium.\nThe exact number of French-speakers in Brussels is hard to determine, but it is estimated that 85% of the people living in Brussels use French and 10% use Dutch in their households, as the sole language or secondary language, while Arabic is also largely spoken. See the Brussels article for more details.\nIn the table are the top 30 countries by origin of the population of Belgium in 2020\nNaturalisation.\nForeign nationals can only apply for Belgian nationality after 5 years of legal residence in Belgium. The requirements for Belgium nationality are You have been legally resident in Belgium for at least 5 years, You have a right to remain indefinitely, You are integrated in Belgium, for example you have a certificate of integration, You speak and write 1 of the 3 national languages, and You have already worked at least 468 days. Since the year 2000 there has been 910,067 naturalised persons.\nLanguages.\nBelgium's three official languages are Dutch, spoken by about 60% of the population, French, spoken by about 40%, and German, spoken by less than 1%. The vast majority of Belgium's population, 99%, is literate as defined by the Belgian government, i.e. capable of reading and writing in an official language by the time a citizen has reached the age of 15. English is the official (meetings) language of the European Commission, 10% of the job market in Brussels.\nReligion.\nAs of 2012, 58% of Belgians identify as Catholic. Other Christians comprise 7% of the population. Muslims comprise 5%. 27% of Belgians are agnostics, atheists or otherwise irreligious.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The flower colour can vary from white to pale purple with purple spots, a symmetrical pattern of dark purple loops or dots and dashes. The lip has three lobes. The bracts are usually shorter than the flower. The lip is smaller than that of the very similar \"Dactylorhiza maculata\" and has three deeper cuts. The middle lobe is more than half as large as a lateral lobe. Some colonies are highly perfumed, attractive to day-flying moths. The leaves are narrow lanceolate, keeled and often dark-spotted.\nIdentification.\nIt is similar to other orchids in the \"Dactylorhiza maculata\" group. \"D.\u00a0maculata\" ssp. \"maculata\" is distinguished by having the lip less deeply trilobed, while \"D.\u00a0maculata\" subsp. \"saccifera\" has one spur large and saccular (sac-shaped) and the bracts of the inflorescence as long as or longer than the flowers. Outside of the \"maculata group\", \"D.\u00a0majalis\" is very similar to \"D.\u00a0maculata subsp. fuchsii\", but is distinguished by the following characters: the spots of the leaves are less elongated, the bracts of the inflorescence are longer and the lower transcend the inflorescence itself; it tends to be less cylindrical (a little more 'globular'), the stem is hollow (not solid) and the leaves are slightly larger. Other similar orchids are \"D.\u00a0incarnata\" and \"D.\u00a0majalis\" subsp. \"lapponica\" but these species have hollow stems and different habitat (fens and bogs).\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Dactylorhiza\u00a0maculata\" subsp. \"fuchsii\" is a Eurosiberian species occurring over Europe from Ireland in the west eastwards to Mongolia, the Altai Mountains and across northern Asia. It is sympatric with \"D.\u00a0maculata\".\nTypical habitats are, variously across the range, conifer, beech and chestnut forests, moderately wet meadows, bogs and margins of streams. The preferred substrate is supposedly calcareous although it seems not to be particularly linked to this type of substrate. In mountain, subalpine and alpine ecosystems \"D.\u00a0 maculata\" subsp. \"fuchsii\" is found from 900 to 2300\u00a0m above sea level. Elsewhere it is found from sea level.\nThe full list of areas (World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions) for \"D.\u00a0maculata\" subsp. \"fuchsii\" is Finland, Great Britain, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, Corsica, Italy, Romania, former Yugoslavia, Belarus, Baltic States, Central European Russia, East European Russia, North European Russia, South European Russia, Northwest European Russia, Ukraine, Altay, Buryatiya, Chita, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Tuva, West Siberia, Yakutiya, Xinjiang, Mongolia.\nIn Italy it is found mainly in the Alps in the northern Apennines. In Britain it is widespread, the most common orchid, occurring from alkaline marshes to chalk downland. After the bee orchid, \"Ophrys apifera\", it is the most successful orchid coloniser of waste land.\nEcology.\nPollination may be by bumblebees, or the longhorn beetle \"Alosterna tabacicolor\".\n\"Dactylorhiza maculata\" subsp. \"fuchsii\" forms mycorrhizal associations with fungi in the Tulasnellaceae and Ceratobasidium groups.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Dactylorhiza\" is Ancient Greek for finger root, referring to the shape of the plant's roots. The subspecies name \"fuchsii\" honours the 16th-century German botanist Leonhart Fuchs. The English name 'common spotted' refers to the species' abundance and the spots on its leaves. The French and German common names also honour Leonhart Fuchs.\nThis plant belongs to a problematic group of orchids. \"D.\u00a0maculata\" subsp. \"fuchsii\" is very variable in flower colour and flower morphology, plant height and the scent of flowers. This is due to the ease of introgression (the transfer of genetic material from one sympatric species to another, only partially isolated from the first, through interspecific hybridization and repeated backcrossing to a parental species), the ability of these plants to adapt quickly and easily to habitat and different substrates and possibly other causes. As a result, a multitude of forms have been defined for this plant. The World Checklist of Kew Gardens lists over 25 varieties, of which 7 are recognized as valid.\nHybrids.\nHybrids with other species of the same genus are frequent. Species include:\nThis plant hybridizes easily with species of different genera (intergeneric hybridization). The list below shows some of these intergeneric hybrids (these hybrids are not always recognized by all botanists):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The heads have gone through a number of changes over the years.\nIn a hard drive, the heads \"fly\" above the disk surface with clearance of as little as 3 nanometres. The flying height has been decreasing with each new generation of technology to enable higher areal density. The flying height of the head is controlled by the design of an air bearing etched onto the disk-facing surface of the \"slider\". The role of the air bearing is to maintain a constant flying height as the head moves over the surface of the disk. The air bearings are carefully designed to maintain the same height across the entire platter, despite differing speeds depending on the head distance from the center of the platter. If the head hits the disk's surface, a catastrophic head crash can result. The heads often have a diamond-like carbon coating.\nInductive heads.\nInductive heads use the same element for both reading and writing.\nTraditional head.\nThe heads themselves started out similar to the heads in tape recorders, simple devices made out of a tiny C-shaped piece of highly magnetizable material such as permalloy or ferrite wrapped in a fine wire coil. When writing, the coil is energized, a strong magnetic field forms in the gap of the C, and the recording surface adjacent to the gap is magnetized. When reading, the magnetized material rotates past the heads, the ferrite core concentrates the field, and a current is generated in the coil. In the gap the field is very strong and quite narrow. That gap is roughly equal to the thickness of the magnetic media on the recording surface. The gap determines the minimum size of a recorded area on the disk. Ferrite heads are large, and write fairly large features. They must also be flown fairly far from the surface thus requiring stronger fields and larger heads.\nMetal-in-gap (MIG) heads.\nMetal-in-gap (\"MIG\") heads are ferrite heads with a small piece of metal in the head gap that concentrates the field. This allows smaller features to be read and written. MIG heads were replaced by thin-film heads.\nThin-film heads.\nFirst introduced in 1979 on the IBM 3370 disk drive, thin-film technology uses photolithographic techniques similar to those used on semiconductor devices to fabricate hard drive heads. At the time, these heads had smaller size and greater precision than the ferrite-based heads then in use; they were electronically similar to them and used the same physics. Thin layers of magnetic (Ni\u2013Fe), insulating, and copper coil wiring materials were built on ceramic substrates that were then physically separated into individual read/write heads integrated with their air bearing, significantly reducing the manufacturing cost per unit. Thin-film heads were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin-film heads allowed 3.5\u00a0inch drives to reach 4\u00a0GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the head gap was a compromise between what worked best for reading and what worked best for writing.\nMagnetoresistive heads (MR heads).\nThe next head improvement in head design was to separate the writing element from the reading element allowing the optimization of a thin-film element for writing and a separate thin-film head element for reading. The separate read element uses the magnetoresistive (MR) effect which changes the resistance of a material in the presence of a magnetic field. These MR heads are able to read very small magnetic features reliably, but can not be used to create the strong field used for writing. The term \"AMR\" (Anisotropic MR) is used to distinguish it from the later introduced improvement in MR technology called \"GMR\" (giant magnetoresistance) and \"TMR\" (tunneling magnetoresistance).\nThe transition to perpendicular magnetic recording (\"PMR\") media has major implications for the write process and the write element of the head structure but less so for the MR read sensor of the head structure.\nAMR heads.\nThe introduction of the AMR head in 1990 by IBM led to a period of rapid areal density increases of about 100% per year.\nGMR heads.\nIn 1997 GMR, giant magnetoresistive heads started to replace AMR heads.\nSince the 1990s, a number of studies have been done on the effects of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), which may allow for even greater increases in density. But so far it has not led to practical applications because it requires low temperatures and large equipment size.\nTMR heads.\nIn 2004, the first drives to use tunneling MR (\"TMR\") heads were introduced by Seagate allowing 400 GB drives with 3 disk platters. Seagate introduced TMR heads featuring integrated microscopic heater coils to control the shape of the transducer region of the head during operation. The heater can be activated prior to the start of a write operation to ensure proximity of the write pole to the disk and medium. This improves the written magnetic transitions by ensuring that the head's write field fully saturates the magnetic disk medium. The same thermal actuation approach can be used to temporarily decrease the separation between the disk medium and the read sensor during the readback process, thus improving signal strength and resolution. By mid-2006 other manufacturers have begun to use similar approaches in their products.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Set in Hampshire in southern England, the story features a small group of rabbits. Although they live in their natural wild environment, with burrows, they are anthropomorphised, possessing their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry, and mythology. Evoking epic themes, the novel follows the rabbits as they escape the destruction of their warren and seek a place to establish a new home (the hill of Watership Down), encountering perils and temptations along the way.\n\"Watership Down\" was Richard Adams's debut novel. It was rejected by several publishers before Collings accepted the manuscript; the published book then won the annual Carnegie Medal (UK), annual Guardian Prize (UK), and other book awards. \nThe novel was adapted into a 2D animated feature film in 1978 and a 2D animated children's television series from 1999 and 2001. In 2018, the novel was adapted again, this time into a 3D animated series, which both aired in the UK and was made available on Netflix.\nAdams completed a sequel almost 25 years later, in 1996, \"Tales from Watership Down\", constructed as a collection of 19 short stories about El-ahrairah and the rabbits of the Watership Down warren.\nOrigin and publication history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"To Juliet and Rosamund, remembering the road to Stratford-on-Avon\"\n\u2014Dedication, \"Watership Down\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Master Rabbit I saw\" \u2014Walter de la Mare\n\u2014Line quoted in \"Watership Down\"; the poem can be seen as a possible source of inspiration.\nThe story began as tales that Richard Adams told his young daughters Juliet and Rosamund during long car journeys. He recounted in 2007 that he \"began telling the story of the rabbits... improvised off the top of [his] head, as [they] were driving along\". The daughters insisted he write it down\u2014\"they were very, very persistent\". After some delay, Adams began writing the novel in the evenings; he completed it 18 months later. The book is dedicated to the two girls.\nAdams's descriptions of wild rabbit behaviour were based on \"The Private Life of the Rabbit\" (1964), by British naturalist Ronald Lockley. The two later became friends, embarking on an Antarctic tour that became the subject of a co-authored book, \"Voyage Through the Antarctic\" (A. Lane, 1982).\nIn his autobiography, \"The Day Gone By\", Adams wrote that he based \"Watership Down\" and the stories in it on his experiences during Operation Market Garden, the Battle of Arnhem, in 1944. The character of Hazel, the leader of the group of rabbits, was modelled on Adams's commanding officer, Major John Gifford. He gave the warrior Bigwig the personality of Captain Desmond Kavanagh, who is buried at the Airborne Cemetery in Oosterbeek, The Netherlands.\n\"Watership Down\" was rejected seven times before it was accepted by Rex Collings. The one-man London publisher Collings wrote to an associate, \"I've just taken on a novel about rabbits, one of them with extra-sensory perception. Do you think I'm mad?\" The associate did call it \"a mad risk,\" in her obituary of Collings, to accept \"a book as bizarre by an unknown writer which had been turned down by the major London publishers; but,\" she continued, \"it was also dazzlingly brave and intuitive.\" Collings had little capital and could not pay an advance but \"he got a review copy onto every desk in London that mattered.\" Adams wrote that it was Collings who gave \"Watership Down\" its title. There was a second edition released in 1973.\nMacmillan USA, then a media giant, published the first U.S. edition in 1974; a Dutch edition was also published that year by Het Spectrum.\nPlot summary.\nPart 1: The Journey.\nIn the Sandleford warren, Fiver, a runty young rabbit who is a seer, receives a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction. He and his brother Hazel fail to convince the Threarah, their Chief Rabbit, of the need to evacuate; they then try to convince the other rabbits, but only succeed in gaining nine followers, all bucks (males) and no does (females). Captain Holly of the Sandleford Owsla, the warren's military caste, accuses the group of fomenting dissension against the Threarah. He tries to stop them from leaving, but is driven off.\nOnce out in the world, the traveling group of rabbits finds itself following the leadership of Hazel, who had been considered an unimportant member of the warren. The group travels far through dangerous territory. Bigwig and Silver, both former Owsla and the strongest rabbits among them, protect the others, helped by Hazel's good judgement and the ingenuity of the clever rabbit Blackberry. Along the way, they cross the River Enborne, and evade a badger, a dog, a crow, and a car. Hazel and Bigwig also stop three rabbits from attempting to return to the Sandleford warren.\nA rabbit named Cowslip invites Hazel's group to join his warren, where a farmer leaves food for the rabbits and shoots all the predators. Fiver senses death and deception in Cowslip's warren, but the rest of Hazel's group, enjoying the peace and good food, decide to ignore Fiver's warnings and the strange and evasive behaviour of the stranger rabbits. Later, Bigwig is caught in a snare, only surviving the ordeal thanks to Blackberry and Hazel's quick thinking. Deducing the truth, Fiver admonishes the rest in a wild lecture; the farmer feeds and protects the rabbits so he can harvest them for meat and skins, and Cowslip's rabbits invited the guests into their warren to increase their own odds of survival. The Sandleford rabbits, badly shaken, continue on their journey. They are joined by Strawberry, a buck who deserts Cowslip's warren.\nPart 2: On Watership Down.\nFiver's visions instruct the rabbits to seek a home atop the hills. The group eventually finds and settles in a beech hanger (a wooded hill) on Watership Down. While digging the new warren, they are joined by Captain Holly and his friend Bluebell. Holly is severely wounded, and both rabbits are ill from exhaustion, having escaped both the violent destruction of the Sandleford Warren by humans and an attack by Cowslip's rabbits along the way. Holly's ordeal has left him a changed rabbit and, after telling the others that Fiver's terrible vision has come true, he offers to join Hazel's band in whatever way they will have him. \nAlthough Watership Down is a peaceful habitat, Hazel realizes that, with all buck rabbits and no does, the warren will soon die out. With the help of their useful new friend, a black-headed gull named Kehaar, they discover a nearby warren called Efrafa, which is overcrowded. At Hazel's request, Holly leads a small embassy to Efrafa to present their request for does.\nHazel and Pipkin (the smallest rabbit) decide to scout out the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find a rabbit hutch. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the four hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Two nights later, Hazel leads a raid on the farm, which frees two does and a buck from the hutch. Hazel is wounded in the leg by the farmer's shotgun and presumed dead; Fiver's visions prompt him and Blackberry to return and rescue Hazel. When the embassy to Efrafa returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state run by the despotic General Woundwort, who refuses to allow anyone to leave his warren. Holly and his three companions have managed to escape with little more than their lives.\nPart 3: Efrafa.\nWhile they were imprisoned in Efrafa, Holly's group had met an Efrafan doe named Hyzenthlay, who wishes to leave the warren and can recruit other does to join in the escape. Hazel and Blackberry devise a plan to rescue Hyzenthlay's group and bring them to Watership Down. \nBigwig infiltrates Efrafa in the guise of a 'hlessi' (a wandering rabbit unattached to any warren). He is recruited into the Efrafan Owsla by Woundwort, while Hazel and several other Watership rabbits hide across the nearby River Test. With help from Kehaar, Bigwig manages to free Hyzenthlay and nine other does, as well as a condemned Efrafan prisoner named Blackavar. Woundwort and his officers pursue them, but the Watership rabbits and the escapees use a punt to float away down the Test and escape.\nPart 4: Hazel-rah.\nDownriver, the punt strikes a bridge, killing one doe. Once the rabbits are back on shore, they begin the long journey home, losing one more doe to a fox along the way. As they near Watership, they come across Captain Campion and his Efrafan patrol, who have been tracking them. Blackavar advises Hazel that the patrol must be killed to prevent them from reporting to Woundwort, but Hazel spares them and sends them off.\nA few weeks later, the Owsla of Efrafa, led by Woundwort, unexpectedly arrives to destroy the warren at Watership Down and take back the escapees. Fiver experiences another vision, which gives Hazel the solution to the problem. While Bigwig fights and injures Woundwort in a narrow tunnel, preventing the rest of the Efrafans from getting any further into the burrows, Hazel, Dandelion and Blackberry return to Nuthanger Farm. They release Bob, the farmer's Labrador, and lure him back to Watership Down. Bob attacks the Efrafans, who flee in terror, leaving Woundwort to stubbornly stand his ground unobserved. Following the fight, Bob returns to Nuthanger Farm with a few wounds, but there is no sign of Woundwort's body. Groundsel, one of the Efrafan officers, fervently believes the General must have survived.\nAfter releasing Bob, Hazel is attacked by Tab, one of the farmhouse cats. He is saved by young Lucy, the former owner of the escaped hutch rabbits, who shows him to the local doctor before releasing him. Upon returning to Watership, Hazel effects a lasting peace and friendship between the remaining Efrafans and the Watership rabbits. Some time later, Hazel and Campion, the intelligent new chief of Efrafa, send rabbits to start a new warren at Caesar's Belt, to relieve the effects of overcrowding at both their warrens.\nEpilogue.\nAs time goes on, the three warrens on the downs prosper under Hazel, Campion and Groundsel (their respective chiefs). General Woundwort is never seen or heard from again; he becomes a legend among the rabbits, and a sort of bogeyman to frighten rabbit kits. Kehaar rejoins his colony, but continues to visit the rabbits every winter. He refuses to search for Woundwort, showing that even he still fears him. \nYears later, on a cold March morning, an elderly Hazel is visited by El-ahrairah, the legendary rabbit folk hero and spiritual Prince of the Rabbits. He invites Hazel to join his Owsla, reassuring Hazel of Watership's future success and prosperity. Leaving his friends and his physical body behind, Hazel departs Watership Down with El-ahrairah.\nLapine language.\n\"Lapine\" is a fictional language created by author Richard Adams for the novel, where it is spoken by the rabbit characters. The language was again used in Adams's 1996 sequel, \"Tales from Watership Down\", and has appeared in both the film and television adaptations. The language fragments in the books consist of a few dozen distinct words, used mainly for the naming of rabbits, their mythological characters, and objects in their world. The name \"Lapine\" comes from the French word for rabbit.\nThemes.\n\"Watership Down\" has been described as an allegory, with the labours of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and Silver \"mirror[ing] the timeless struggles between tyranny and freedom, reason and blind emotion, and the individual and the corporate state.\" Adams draws on classical heroic and quest themes from Homer and Virgil, creating a story with epic motifs.\nThe Hero, the \"Odyssey\", and the \"Aeneid\".\nThe book explores the themes of exile, survival, heroism, leadership, political responsibility, and the \"making of a hero and a community\". Joan Bridgman's analysis of Adams's works in \"The Contemporary Review\" identifies the community and hero motifs: \"[T]he hero's journey into a realm of terrors to bring back some boon to save himself and his people\" is a powerful element in Adams's tale. This theme derives from the author's exposure to the works of mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his study of comparative mythology, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949), and in particular, Campbell's \"monomyth\" theory, also based on Carl Jung's view of the unconscious mind, that \"all the stories in the world are really one story.\"\nThe concept of the hero has invited comparisons between \"Watership Down's\" characters and those in Homer's \"Odyssey\" and Virgil's \"Aeneid\". Hazel's courage, Bigwig's strength, Blackberry's ingenuity and craftiness, and Dandelion's and Bluebell's poetry and storytelling all have parallels in the epic poem \"Odyssey\". Kenneth Kitchell declared, \"Hazel stands in the tradition of Odysseus, Aeneas, and others\". Tolkien scholar John Rateliff calls Adams's novel an \"Aeneid\" \"what-if\" book: what if the seer Cassandra (Fiver) had been believed and she and a company had fled Troy (Sandleford Warren) before its destruction? What if Hazel and his companions, like Odysseus, encounter a seductive home at Cowslip's Warren (Land of the Lotus Eaters)? Rateliff goes on to compare the rabbits' battle with Woundwort's Efrafans to Aeneas's fight with Turnus's Latins. \"By basing his story on one of the most popular books of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Adams taps into a very old myth: the flight from disaster, the heroic refugee in search of a new home, a story that was already over a thousand years old when Virgil told it in 19 BC.\"\nReligious symbolism.\nWhen asked in a 2007 BBC Radio interview about the religious symbolism in the novel, Adams said the story was \"nothing like that at all\". He said the rabbits in Watership Down did not worship; however, \"they believed passionately in El-ahrairah.\" Adams explained that he meant the book to be \"only a made-up story... in no sense an allegory or parable or any kind of political myth. I simply wrote down a story I told to my little girls.\" Instead, he explained, the \"let-in\" religious stories of El-ahrairah were meant more as legendary tales, similar to a rabbit Robin Hood, and these stories were interspersed throughout the book as humorous interjections to the often \"grim\" tales of the \"real story\".\nReception.\n\"The Economist\" heralded the book's publication, saying \"If there is no place for \"Watership Down\" in children's bookshops, then children's literature is dead.\" Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at \"Newsweek\", gave the novel a glowing review: \"Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created.\" Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that \"subtly speaks to a child\", with \"engaging characters and fast-paced action [that] make it readable.\" This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the \"New Statesman\": \"Adams... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one.\"\nD. Keith Mano, a science fiction writer and conservative social commentator writing in the \"National Review\", declared that the novel was \"pleasant enough, but it has about the same intellectual firepower as Dumbo.\" He pilloried it further: \"\"Watership Down\" is an adventure story, no more than that: rather a swashbuckling crude one to boot. There are virtuous rabbits and bad rabbits: if that's allegory, \"Bonanza\" is an allegory.\"\nJohn Rowe Townsend notes that the book quickly achieved such a high popularity despite the fact that it \"came out at a high price and in an unattractive jacket from a publisher who had hardly been heard of.\" Fred Inglis, in his book \"The Promise of Happiness: Value and meaning in children's fiction\", praises the author's use of prose to express the strangeness of ordinary human inventions from the rabbits' perspective.\n\"Watership Down\"'s universal motifs of liberation and self-determination have been identified with by readers from a diversity of backgrounds; the author Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own superimposition of the founding of Israel onto \"Watership Down\", has remarked \"Turns out plenty of other people have seen their histories in that book... some people see it as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism... a protest against materialism, against the corporate state. \"Watership Down\" can be Ireland after the famine, Rwanda after the massacres.\" Kadish has praised both the fantasy genre and \"Watership Down\" for its \"motifs [that] hit home in every culture... all passersby are welcome to bring their own subplots and plug into the archetype.\"\nAwards.\nAdams won the 1972 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. He also won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a similar award that authors may not win twice. In 1977 California schoolchildren selected it for the inaugural California Young Reader Medal in the Young Adult category, which annually honours one book from the last four years. In The Big Read, a 2003 survey of the British public, it was voted the forty-second greatest book of all time.\nCriticism of gender roles.\nThe 1993 Puffin Modern Classics edition of the novel contains an afterword by Nicholas Tucker, who wrote that stories such as \"Watership Down\" \"now fit rather uneasily into the modern world of consideration of both sexes\". He contrasted Hazel's sensitivity to Fiver with the \"far more mechanical\" attitude of the bucks towards the does portrayed as \"little more than passive baby-factories\".\nIn a 1974 \"New York Times Book Review\" essay \"Male Chauvinist Rabbits\", Selma G. Lanes alleges that the does are only \"instruments of reproduction to save his male rabbits' triumph from becoming a hollow victory.\" Lanes argued that this view of female rabbits came from Adams rather than his source text, Ronald Lockley's \"The Private Life of the Rabbit\" in which the rabbit world is matriarchal, and new warrens are initiated by dissatisfied young females.\nIn similar vein, literary critic Jane Resh Thomas said \"Watership Down\" \"draws upon... an anti-feminist social tradition which, removed from the usual human context and imposed upon rabbits, is eerie in its clarity\". Thomas also called it a \"splendid story\" in which \"anti-feminist bias... damages the novel in only a minor way\".\nAdams's 1996 sequel, \"Tales from Watership Down\" includes stories where the female rabbits play a more prominent role in the Watership Down warren.\nOwnership controversy.\nOn 27 May 2020, the high court in London ruled that Martin Rosen, the director of the 1978 film adaptation, had wrongly claimed that he owned all rights to the book, as well as terminating his contract for rights to the film. Rosen had entered into adaptation contracts worth more than $500,000 (\u00a3400,000), including licences for an audiobook adaptation and the 2018 television adaptation.\nIn his ruling, Judge Richard Hacon ordered Rosen to pay over $100,000 in damages for copyright infringement, unauthorised licence deals, and denying royalty payments to the Adams estate. Rosen was also directed to provide a record of all licence agreements involving \"Watership Down\", and pay court costs and the Adams estate's legal fees totalling \u00a328,000.\nAdaptations.\nMusic.\nIn the early 1970s Bo Hansson was introduced to the book by his girlfriend. This gave him an idea to create a new album in the same style as his \"Lord of the Rings\" album. In 1977 he released the all instrumental \"El-Ahrairah\". The title was taken directly from the pages of \"Watership Down\", with El-Ahrairah being the name of a trickster, folk-hero/deity rabbit, known as \"The Prince with a Thousand Enemies\". In other countries the album was released as \"Music Inspired by Watership Down\".\nFilm.\nIn 1978 Martin Rosen wrote and directed an animated film adaptation of \"Watership Down\". The voice cast included John Hurt, Richard Briers, Harry Andrews, Simon Cadell, Nigel Hawthorne, and Roy Kinnear. The film featured the song \"Bright Eyes\", sung by Art Garfunkel. Released as a single, the song became a UK number one hit although Richard Adams said that he hated it.\nAlthough the essentials of the plot remained relatively unchanged, the film omitted several side plots. Though the Watership Down warren eventually grew to seventeen rabbits with the additions of Strawberry, Holly, Bluebell, and three hutch rabbits liberated from the farm, the movie includes a band of only eight. Rosen's adaptation was praised for \"cutting through Adams' book... to get to the beating heart\".\nThe film has also seen some positive critical attention. In 1979 the film received a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Additionally, British television station Channel 4's 2006 documentary \"100 Greatest Cartoons\" named it the 86th greatest cartoon of all time. But, \"lovable bunnies notwithstanding, younger children might be troubled by the more graphic scenes. Numerous rabbits die in bloody fights, while one gets choked by a snare and another is snatched by a bird of prey.\"\nTelevision.\nFrom 1999 to 2001, the book was also adapted as an animated television series, broadcast on CITV in the UK and on YTV in Canada. Only the first two series were aired in the UK, while all three series were aired in Canada. It was produced by Martin Rosen and starred several well-known British actors, including Stephen Fry, Rik Mayall, Dawn French, John Hurt, and Richard Briers, running for a total of 39 episodes over three seasons. Although the story was broadly based on the novel and most characters and events retained, some of the story lines and characters (especially in later episodes) were entirely new. In 2003, the second season was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Original Music Score for a Dramatic Series.\n2018 animated series.\nIn July 2014, it was announced that the BBC would be airing a new animated series based on the book and in April 2016 that the series would be a co-production between the BBC and Netflix, consisting of four one-hour episodes, with a budget of \u00a320\u00a0million. The four-episode serial premiered on the BBC and Netflix on 23 December 2018, with the voices of James McAvoy as Hazel, John Boyega as Bigwig, and Ben Kingsley as General Woundwort. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for the performances of its voice cast, but received criticism for its tone and the quality of the computer animation.\nTheatre.\nIn 2006, \"Watership Down\" was again adapted for the stage, this time by Rona Munro. It ran at the Lyric Hammersmith in London. Directed by Melly Still, the cast included Matthew Burgess, Joseph Traynor, and Richard Simons. The tone of the production was inspired by the tension of war: in an interview with \"The Guardian\", Still commented, \"The closest humans come to feeling like rabbits is under war conditions... We've tried to capture that anxiety.\" A reviewer at \"The Times\" called the play \"an exciting, often brutal tale of survival\" and said that \"even when it's a muddle, it's a glorious one.\"\nIn 2011, \"Watership Down\" was adapted for the Lifeline Theatre in Chicago by John Hildreth. This production was directed by Katie McLean Hainsworth and the cast included Scott T. Barsotti, Chris Daley, Paul S. Holmquist, and Mandy Walsh.\nRole-playing game.\n\"Watership Down\" inspired the creation of \"Bunnies &amp; Burrows\", an early role-playing game in which the main characters are talking rabbits, published in 1976 by Fantasy Games Unlimited. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-humanoid roles, as well as the first with detailed martial arts and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by Steve Jackson Games as an official \"GURPS\" supplement in 1992.\nRadio.\nIn 2002, a two-part, two-hour dramatisation of \"Watership Down\" by Neville Teller was broadcast by BBC Radio 4.\nIn November 2016, a new two-part two-hour dramatisation, written by Brian Sibley, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.\nAudiobooks.\nIn the 1970s, the book was released by Argo Records read by Roy Dotrice, with musical background\u2014music by George Butterworth performed by Academy of St Martin in the Fields under the direction of Neville Marriner.\nAlexander Scourby narrated an unabridged edition, originally published on LP in the 1970s by the Talking Books program of the American Foundation for the Blind (NLSB). The LPs have been destroyed by NLSB and are very rare.\nIn 1984, \"Watership Down\" was adapted into a four-cassette audiobook by John Maher in association with the Australian Broadcasting Company's Renaissance Players. Produced by John Hannaford and narrated by Kerry Francis, the audiobook was distributed by The Mind's Eye.\nIn 1990, a 16-hour, 11-cassette recording read by John MacDonald was published by Books on Tape, Inc. of Santa Ana, CA.\nAndrew Sachs recorded a five and a half-hour abridged version of the story for Puffin Audiobooks.\nIn 2010, Audible.com released an unabridged digital download of the book, narrated by the multiple award-winning Ralph Cosham.\nIn 2019, Blackstone Audio Inc. released an unabridged version of \"Watership Down\" with a foreword by the author, Richard Adams. Peter Capaldi narrated the 17-hour, 31-minute book.\nGraphic novel.\nA new graphic novel version of \"Watership Down\" was released in 2023, adapted by award-winning author James Sturm and illustrated by bestselling artist Joe Sutphin.\nParodies.\nIn the American stop motion TV show \"Robot Chicken\", a parody of the book is done with the Fraggles, the main characters of the 80s show \"Fraggle Rock\", in place of the rabbits.\nThe November 1974 issue of \"National Lampoon\" magazine, released shortly after the resignation and pardon of President Richard Nixon, featured a satirical parody of the novel entitled \"Watergate Down\", written by Sean Kelly, in which rabbits are replaced by rats, described as animals with \"the morals of a Democrat and the ethics of a Republican\".\nThe Dropout \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" series \"Dimension 20\" has a side quest \"Burrow's End\" loosely based on \"Watership Down\". The main characters are Stoats looking for a new warren to live in.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67318", "revid": "35502160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67318", "title": "Geography of Chile", "text": "The geography of Chile is extremely diverse, as the country extends from a latitude of 17\u00b0South to Cape Horn at 56\u00b0, and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Andes in the east. Chile is situated in southern South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean and a small part of the South Atlantic Ocean. Chile's territorial shape is considered among the world's most unusual; from north to south, the country extends , and yet it only averages in width. Chile reaches from the middle of South America's west coast straight down to the southern tip of the continent, where it curves slightly eastward. The Diego Ram\u00edrez Islands and Cape Horn, the southernmost points in the Americas where the Pacific and Atlantic oceans meet, are Chilean territory. Chile's northern neighbors are Peru and Bolivia, and its border with Argentina to the east, at , is the world's third-longest. The total land area is . The very long coastline of gives Chile the 11th-largest exclusive economic zone of .\nPhysical geography.\nThe northern two-thirds of Chile lie on top of the telluric Nazca Plate, which, moving eastward about ten centimeters a year, is forcing its way under the continental plate of South America. This movement has resulted in the formation of the Peru\u2013Chile Trench. At its deepest point, the trench descends to over .\nThe same telluric displacements that created the Peru-Chile Trench make the country prone to earthquakes. During the twentieth century, Chile was struck by twenty-eight major earthquakes, all with a force greater than 6.9 on the Richter scale. The strongest of these occurred in 2010 (registering an estimated 8.8 on the Richter scale) and in Valdivia in 1960 (reaching 9.5). This latter earthquake occurred on May 22, the day after another major quake measuring 7.25 on the Richter scale, and affected an extensive section of south-central Chile. It caused a tsunami that destroyed several fishing villages in the south and raised or lowered sections of the coast as much as two meters. The convergence between the Earth's surface plates has also generated the Andes, a geologically young mountain range that in Chilean territory alone, includes about 620 volcanoes, many of which are active.\nApproximately 80 percent of Chile's terrain consists of mountainous formations. The majority of the Chilean population resides in close proximity to these mountain ranges. Additionally, there are other, less imposing mountain ranges present. These non-Andean mountains, though they can manifest in various locations, typically constitute parts of transverse and coastal ranges. The transverse ranges, notably found in the near north and far north natural regions, extend in diverse configurations from the Andes to the ocean, shaping valleys oriented in an east\u2013west direction. On the other hand, the coastal ranges are predominantly visible in the central region of the country, contributing to the formation of the Central Valley (\"Valle Central\") between these ranges and the Andes. In the southernmost reaches, the Central Valley merges with the waters of the ocean. Here, the elevated sections of the coastal range facing the Andes transform into a multitude of islands, creating a complex network of channels and fjords that have posed navigational challenges to seafarers.\nMuch of Chile's coastline is rugged. The Humboldt Current, which originates northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula (which juts into the Bellingshausen Sea) and runs the full length of the Chilean coast, makes the water cold. During the summer months, the temperature of the water off Chile's beaches in the central part of the country stays below . A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 564\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Chile, making it the 44th-ranked country in the world in terms of tidal flat area.\nChilean territory extends as far west as Polynesia. The best known of Chile's Pacific islands is Easter Island (Isla de Pascua, also known by its Polynesian name of Rapa Nui), with a population of 2,800 people. Located west of Chile's mainland port of Caldera, just below the Tropic of Capricorn, Easter Island provides Chile a gateway to the Pacific. It is noted for its 867 monoliths (moais), which are huge (up to twenty meters high) and mysterious, expressionless faces sculpted from volcanic stone. The Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, located west of Valpara\u00edso, are the locale of a small fishing settlement. They are famous for their lobster. One of the islands, Robinson Crusoe Island, is where Alexander Selkirk, the inspiration for Daniel Defoe's novel, was marooned for about four years.\nNatural regions.\nChile extends from about north of the Tropic of Capricorn to around north of the Antarctic Circle. Due to its length of Chile, the country can be geographically divided into multiple sections based on distinct climatic zones.. It is usually divided into five regions: the far north, the near north, central Chile, the south, and the far south. Each region has its own characteristic vegetation, fauna, climate, and distinct topography.\nFar North.\nThe far north (Norte Grande), which extends from the Peruvian border to about 27\u00b0 south latitude, a line roughly parallel to the Copiap\u00f3 River, is extremely arid. It mainly contains the Atacama Desert, one of the driest areas in the world. In certain areas, this desert does not register any rainfall at all. Geographically, the aridity can be explained by the following conditions:\nAverage monthly temperatures range at sea level between about during the summer and about during the winter. Most of the population lives in the coastal area, where the temperatures are more moderate and the humidity higher. Contrary to the image of monochrome barrenness that most people associate with deserts, the landscape is spectacular, with its crisscrossing hills and mountains of all shapes and sizes, each with a unique hue depending on its mineral composition, its distance from the observer, and the time of day.\nIn the far north, the land generally rises vertically from the ocean, sometimes to elevations well over . The Cordillera Domeyko in the north runs along the coast parallel to the Andes. This topography generates coastal microclimates because the fog that frequently forms over the cold ocean waters, as well as any low clouds, is trapped by the high bluffs. This airborne moisture condenses in the spines and leaves of the vegetation, forming droplets that fall to the ground and irrigate the plants' roots. Beyond the coastal bluffs, there is an area of rolling hills that encompasses the driest desert land; this area ends to the east with the Andes towering over it. The edges of the desert in some sections have subterranean aquifers that have permitted the development of forests made up mainly of tamarugos, spiny trees native to the area that grow to a height of about twenty-five meters. Most of those forests were cut down to fuel the fires of the many foundries established since colonial times to exploit the abundant deposits of copper, silver, and nitrate found in the area. The result was the creation of even drier surface conditions.\nThe far north is the only part of the country in which there is a large section of the Andean plateau. During summer the area receives considerable rainfall in what is commonly known as the \"Bolivian winter,\" forming shallow lakes of mostly saline waters (Salar de Llamara, Salar de Miraje, Salar de Atacama) that are home to a number of bird species, including the Chilean flamingo. Some of the water from the plateau trickles down the Andes in the form of narrow rivers, many of which form oases before being lost to evaporation or absorption into the desert sands, salt beds, and aquifers. However, some rivers do manage to reach the Pacific, including the Loa River, whose U-shaped course across the desert makes it Chile's longest river. The water rights for one of the rivers, the Lauca River, remain a source of dispute between Bolivia and Chile. These narrow rivers have carved fertile valleys in which exuberant vegetation creates a stark contrast to the bone-dry hills. In such areas, roads usually are usually built halfway up the arid elevations in order to maximize the intensive agricultural use of the irrigated land. They offer spectacular panoramic vistas, along with the harrowing experience of driving along the edges of cliffs.\nIn the far north, the kinds of fruits that grow well in the arid tropics thrive, and all kinds of vegetables can be grown year-round. However, the region's main economic foundation is its great mineral wealth. For instance, Chuquicamata, the world's largest open-pit copper mine, is located in the far north. Since the early 1970s, the fishing industry has also developed significantly in the main ports of the area, most notably Iquique and Antofagasta.\nNear North.\nThe near north (Norte Chico) extends from the Copiap\u00f3 River to about 32\u00b0 south latitude, or just north of Santiago. It is a semiarid region whose central area receives an average of about of rain during each of the four winter months, with trace amounts the rest of the year. The near north is also subject to droughts. The temperatures are moderate, with an average of during the summer and about during the winter at sea level. The winter rains and the melting of the snow that accumulates on the Andes produce rivers whose flow varies with the seasons, but carry water year-round. Their deep Transverse Valleys provide broad areas for cattle raising and, most important, fruit growing, an activity that has developed greatly since the mid-1970s. Nearly all Chilean pisco is produced in the near north.\nAs in the far north, the coastal areas of the near north have a distinct microclimate. In those sections where the airborne moisture of the sea is trapped by high bluffs overlooking the ocean, temperate rain forests develop as the vegetation precipitates the vapor in the form of a misty rain. Because the river valleys provide breaks in the coastal elevations, maritime moisture can penetrate inland and further moderate the generally arid climate in those valleys. The higher elevations in the interior sections are covered with shrubs and cacti of various kinds.\nCentral Chile.\nCentral Chile (Chile Central), home to a majority of the population, includes the three largest metropolitan areas\u2014Santiago, Valpara\u00edso, and Concepci\u00f3n. It extends from about 32\u00b0 south latitude to about 37\u00b0 south latitude. The climate is of the temperate Mediterranean type, with the amount of rainfall increasing considerably and progressively from north to south. In the Santiago area, the average monthly temperatures are about in the summer months of January and February and in the winter months of June and July; the average monthly precipitation is no more than a trace in January and February and in June and July. In Concepci\u00f3n, by contrast, the average monthly temperatures are somewhat lower in the summer at but higher in the winter at , and the amount of rain is much greater: in the summer, Concepci\u00f3n receives an average of 0.8 inches (20 mm) of rain per month; in June and July, the city is pounded by an average of 10 inches (253 mm.) per month. The numerous rivers greatly increase their flow as a result of the winter rains and the spring melting of the Andean snows, and they contract considerably in the summer. The combination of abundant snow in the Andes and relatively moderate winter temperatures creates excellent conditions for Alpine skiing.\nThe topography of central Chile includes a coastal range of mountains running parallel to the Andes. Lying between the two mountain ranges is the Central Valley, which contains some of the richest agricultural land in the country, especially in its northern portion. The area just north and south of Santiago is a large producer of fruits, including the grapes from which the best Chilean wines are made. Exports of fresh fruit began to rise dramatically in the mid-1970s because Chilean growers had the advantage of being able to reach markets in the Northern Hemisphere during winter in that part of the world. Most of these exports, such as grapes, apples, and peaches, go by refrigerator ships, while some, such as berries, go by air freight.\nThe southern portion of central Chile contains a mixture of some high-quality agricultural lands, many of which were originally covered with old-growth forests. They were cleared for agriculture but were soon exhausted of their organic matter and left to erode. Large tracts of this worn-out land, many of them on hilly terrain, have been reforested for the lumber, especially for the cellulose and paper industries. New investments during the 1980s in these industries transformed the rural economy of the region. The pre-Andean highlands and some of the taller and more massive mountains in the coastal range (principally the Cordillera de Nahuelbuta) still contain large tracts of old-growth forests of remarkable beauty, some of which have been set aside as national parks. Between the coastal mountains and the ocean, many areas of central Chile contain stretches of land that are lower than the Central Valley and are generally quite flat. The longest beaches can be found in such sections.\nSouth.\nAlthough many lakes can be found in the Andean and coastal regions of central Chile, the south (Sur de Chile) is definitely the country's most lacustrine area. Southern Chile stretches from below the B\u00edo-B\u00edo River at about 37\u00b0 south latitude to Chacao Channel at about 42\u00b0 south latitude. In this lake district of Chile, the valley between the Andes and the coastal range is closer to sea level, and the hundreds of rivers that descend from the Andes form lakes, some quite large, as they reach the lower elevations. They drain into the ocean through other rivers, some of which (principally the Calle-Calle River, which flows by the city of Valdivia) are the only ones in the country that are navigable for any stretch. The Central Valley's southernmost portion is submerged in the ocean and forms the Gulf of Ancud. Isla de Chilo\u00e9, with its rolling hills, is the last important elevation of the coastal range of mountains.\nThe south is one of the rainiest areas in the world. One of the wettest spots in the region is Valdivia, with an annual rainfall of . The summer months of January and February are the driest, with a monthly average precipitation of . The winter months of June and July each produce, on average, a deluge of . Temperatures in the area are moderate. In Valdivia, the two summer months average , whereas the winter months average .\nThe snow-covered Andes form a constant backdrop to vistas of clear blue or even turquoise waters, as at Todos los Santos Lake. The rivers that descend from the Andes rush over volcanic rocks, forming numerous white-water sections and waterfalls. The vegetation, including many ferns in the shady areas, is a lush green. Some sections still consist of old-growth forests, and in all seasons, but especially in the spring and summer, there are considerable amounts of wildflowers and flowering trees. The pastures in the northernmost section, around Osorno, are well suited for raising cattle; milk, cheese, and butter are important products of that area. All kinds of berries grow in the region, some of which are exported, and freshwater farming of various species of trout and salmon has developed, with cultivators taking advantage of the abundant supply of clear running water. The lumber industry is also important. A number of tourists, mainly Chileans and Argentines, visit the area during the summer.\nMany of Chile's distinctive animal species have been decimated as they have been pushed farther and farther into the remaining wilderness areas by human occupation of the land. This is the case with the huemul, a large deer, and the Chilean condor, the largest bird of its kind; both animals are on the national coat of arms. The remaining Chilean cougars, which are larger than the ones in California, have been driven to isolated national parks in the south by farmers who continue to hunt them because they kill sheep and goats.\nFar South.\nIn the far south (\"Chile Austral\"), which extends from approximately 42\u00b0 south latitude to Cape Horn, lie the Andes and the South Pacific. In the northern part of the far south, there is still plenty of rainfall. The summer months average , whereas the winter months average . The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Ais\u00e9n average in the summer months and in the winter months. The area generally is chilly and wet and houses a combination of channels, fjords, snow-capped mountains, and islands of all shapes and sizes within a narrow space. The southern part of the far south includes the city of Punta Arenas, which, with about 125,000 inhabitants, is the southernmost city in Chile. Punta Arenas receives much less precipitation than other parts of \"Zone Austral\"; its annual total is only , or slightly more than what Valdivia receives in the month of June alone. This precipitation is distributed more or less evenly throughout the year, with the two main summer months receiving a monthly average of and the winter months , some of it in the form of snow. Temperatures are colder than in the rest of the country. The summer months average , and the winter months average . The virtually constant wind from the South Pacific Ocean makes the air feel significantly colder.\nThe far south contains large expanses of pastures that are often used for raising sheep, even though overgrazing is an issue in some areas. The area's other main economic activity is oil and natural gas extraction from the areas around the Strait of Magellan. This strait is one of the world's important sea-lanes because it unites the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through a channel that avoids the rough open waters off Cape Horn. The channel is perilous, however, and Chilean pilots guide all vessels through it.\nArea and boundaries.\nArea.\n\"Total:\"\n\"Land:\"\n\"Water:\"\n\"Note:\"\nincludes Easter Island (\"Isla de Pascua\") and Isla Sala y G\u00f3mez\n\"Country rank\": 37th\nThis does not include the Chilean claims to Antarctica, which overlap with Argentinian and British claims.

The cities of Valparaiso and Concepcion are the next most populated cities, in that order. The population is 87.6% urbanized. In 2009, 12,037,290 people living in urban parts of Chile actually had functioning facilities in their homes, while 403,276 people did not have proper facilities in their dwellings. 100% of the urban population has some form of access to sanitation facilities, while 90.9% of rural people have these facilities available. This is much higher than the rural average for the world, which is 50.5% access to sanitation facilities.\nThe United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs note the average annual rate of population change from 2015 to 2017 was 1.022. The UN data also show live births per woman (2015\u20132017) averaging 1.765 and a combined infant mortality rate for both sexes at 6.258 per 1,000 live births.\nNatural hazards.\nNatural disasters are a significant cause of Chilean emigration. Earthquakes are common in Chile due to the country's location on the Nazca Plate and South American Plate. Chile as experienced some of the most powerful earthquakes in history with the Valdivia Earthquake in 1960 at 9.5 on the Richter scale and the Maule Earthquake at 8.8 in 2010. The top three countries to which Chilean emigrants are moving are Argentina, Peru, and the United States.\nChile's natural hazards include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. The natural hazards are attributed to Chile's location along the Ring of Fire. Severe earthquakes can trigger tsunamis in this country, which has 6,435 km of coastline. There are also more than three-dozen active volcanoes in Chile, with the most active being Llaima Volcano in the north Chilean Andes.\nUrban geography.\nThe three most populated cities in Chile are Santiago, Valpara\u00edso, and Concepci\u00f3n. The populations of these cities are: Santiago at 6,680,000, Valpara\u00edso at 967,000, and Concepci\u00f3n at 857,000. Santiago is located in central Chile, with the Mapocho River running through the city. Valpara\u00edso is located on the coast, approximately 116 km northwest of Santiago. Concepci\u00f3n is also a coastal city, situated near the mouth of the Biob\u00edo River.\nOrigins.\nIndustrial cities, such as Concepci\u00f3n and Talcahuano, began as colonial centers in the 1600s. Most of the large cities in Chile began as settlement locations for Spanish colonists, who lived in homes constructed from adobe. They have grown to be the densely populated urban conurbations for which they are known today.\nGentrification.\nGentrification is occurring in the municipal district of Santiago, effecting low-income residents. Housing availability has decreased by 50% for residents and rent for new apartments has increased, altering the average income of that location. The Floor Area Ratio, implemented by the state has resulted in highly dense and smaller living spaces.\nCultural geography.\nRacialized landscapes in Chile.\nDue to Chile's high population density in urban cities like Santiago, housing developments have increasingly expanded vertically. These high-rises are predominantly occupied by foreign migrants.\nReligious landscapes and sacred places.\nIn Chile, there are a number of pilgrimage and devotional sites dedicated to Catholic saints or popular religious figures associated with local cults. These include the Church of Our Lady of Andacollo, the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Tirana, and the Church of the Immaculate Conception of Lo V\u00e1squez.\nLa Virgen de Andacollo.\nWhile there are several tales of her origin and variations on her name, the Virgin Andacollo is honored on the first Sunday of every month in the plaza of Andacollo, Chile. The Virgin Andacollo is the Patron Saint of miners, believed to heal the sick and rescue those lost in the mines. On the first Sunday of October, the town of Andacollo celebrates their saint with La Fiesta Chico. Thousands of pilgrims come to the northern Chilean town each December for La Fiesta Grande. This event lasts from December 23 to 27. This celebration attracts as many as 500,000 people a annually.\n\"Animitas\".\nIt is not uncommon to come across roadside shrines in Chile. These shrines are called \"Animitas,\" and they are particularly common along rural highways or in lower-income towns. The shrines can be devoted to saints or to individuals who died tragically. These \"animitas\" mark the spot where the body and soul were beleived to have separated, and where the soul might linger.\nChurches of Chilo\u00e9.\nThe Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago is located in southern Chile and is home to the Churches of Chilo\u00e9. These churches date back to the early 17th century. Their history began when the first Jesuits arrived in Chile. There are more than 60 churches, 16 of which are recognized as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO and designated as national monuments in Chile. The Achao church is the oldest church that still stands and was built entirely without the use of nails.\nPolitical geography.\nBorder disputes with Bolivia.\nChile has long been in conflict with Bolivia over coastal and land sovereignty. The War of the Pacific was fought between Chile, Bolivia, and Peru in the late 1800s. The latter two had rich nitrate deposits. However, Peru established a monopoly over its deposits, and Bolivia applied export tariffs to Chile. After the war, Chile gained 120,000\u00a0km2 of land that included Antofagasta on the coastline of Bolivia. This has left Bolivia landlocked since 1904. Bolivians still fight for coastal and territorial sovereignty. Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia, has argued that Bolivia's landlocked status has made the country endure great \"historical injustice\". Morales has also argued that were Chile to return Antofagasta, it would have no significant effect on their country. The land Bolivia lost to Chile more than a century ago is now home to some of the largest copper mines in the world. Chile has no intention of ceding any land to Bolivia, but is very open to coastal access negotiations.\nIn October 2018, the International Court of Justice ruled against Bolivia in its dispute with Chile. The court ruled that Chile did not have to discuss granting Bolivia sea access.\nBorder disputes with Peru.\nThere have been continuous disputes between Chile and Peru since the 1800s due to the fact that they both claim boundary coastal lines. Peru claims the northern part of Chile, which is now southwest of Peru. This boundary \u201ctriangulation\u201d was intended to resolve territorial disagreements between the two countries. The decision was issued on January 27, 2014, by the International Court of Justice. The War of the Pacific occurred from the years 1879\u20131883; the conflict was driven by competition over mineral resources in the region. This led Chile to control maritime shipping to Peru and to send an army to invade Peru on October 8, 1879. A claim that Chile attempted to invade the United States in October 1880 is historically unsubstantiated and may be inaccurate. Armed resistance between Peru and Chile continued for several years. The United States later facilitated a peace agreement known as the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n, which was signed by both countries on October 20, 1883. In 2008, Peru brought a maritime dispute against Chile before the International Court of Justice. In 2014, the Court ruled in favor of Peru, resulting in Chile losing approximately 80 nautical miles from its northwestern ocean zone. This ruling significantly impacted Chilean fishers.\nBorder disputes with Argentina.\nBorder disputes between Chile and Argentina involve the Patagonia region; one of the most prominent disputes concerns the countries' southern ice fields. The disagreements began when Argentine maps started to include part of the southern ice fields. The dispute centers on water resources, as this contested area contains the second-largest reserve of potable water in the world. Despite differing views on territorial ownership, former President of Chile Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era stated that these issues would eventually be resolved.\nAgricultural geography.\nAgriculture accounts for 4.4% of GDP (industry 31.4%, services 64.3%). A 2017 estimate places 8.881 million people within the Chilean labor force, with 9.2% employed in agriculture by occupation. Chile's labor force ranks fifty-ninth globally according to the CIA World Factbook. Chile currently utilizes 14,015 hectares of agricultural land. Chilean agriculture includes the cultivation and trade of grapes, apples, pears, onions, wheat, corn, oats, peaches, garlic, asparagus, and beans. Grapes are the largest fruit export product, with an export value of $1.76 billion. Non-animal foods, fruit, and vegetable exports total about $11.7 billion. The beef and poultry industries, along with fish, wool, and timber, are also included. Animal products have an export value of $5.89 billion. Water-intensive industries are causing groundwater, lake, and river depletion in Chile. Illegal water extractions are becoming increasingly common. Exploiting the country's water resources has been detrimental to the citizens and animals that rely on them.\nClimate and weather.\nLocated on the west coast of South America, Chile has a total area of 756,102 km\u00b2. The country is divided into four distinct climate zones. One of these is the dry climate, located in the north, above Santiago; the Atacama Desert experiences temperatures of up to 90 \u00b0F. The central part of Chile has a warmer climate, reaching up to 82.4 \u00b0F. The inner region of Chile has a snow climate. In southern Chile, there is a wet climate influenced by the Mediterranean coastline, with the wet season lasting from May to August. Summer in Chile lasts from December through February, while winter spans June through August, with low temperatures reaching -2 \u00b0C.\nLand use.\nAs of 2011, Chile allocates 21.1% of its land to agriculture. Chile's allocation percentage is smaller than that of its neighboring countries\u2014Argentina (53.9%) and Bolivia (34.3%), but larger than Peru's (18.8%). Of the land Chile devotes to agriculture, only 1.7% is arable. Chile's diverse climate and relatively small land area are responsible for this low percentage. Some desert countries, such as Egypt, have a higher percentage of arable land than Chile.\nEconomic geography.\nChile maintains a market-oriented economy with high levels of foreign trade, supported by strong financial institutions. These factors have given Chile the highest sovereign bond rating in South America. Chile is committed to trade liberalization and has 26 trade agreements covering 60 countries. In May 2010, Chile became the first South American member of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Chile's top three import partners are China, the United States, and Brazil. In November 2005, Chile and China signed the China\u2013Chile Free Trade Agreement, under which more than 90% of Chile's imports enter China duty-free. The United States\u2013Chile Free Trade Agreement began in 2004; since 2015, 100% of U.S. imports have entered Chile duty-free. Consumer and industrial export products enter Chile duty-free as well. Since 2017, Chile and Brazil have been negotiating a trade deal that was projected to be signed by the end of 2018. Chile's top three export partners are China, the United States, and Japan. Chile and Japan were previously engaged in Economic Partnership Agreements. In 2018, Chile and Japan were among the eleven nations that signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact that aims to reduce tariffs, enforce environmental standards, and remove regulatory barriers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These include:\nDistricts.\nAnguilla is divided into fourteen districts:\nClimate.\nAnguilla features a tropical wet and dry climate under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. The island has a rather dry climate, moderated by northeast trade winds. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. Average daily maxima range from about in December to in July. With no mountains to slow or trap clouds, rainfall is erratic, averaging about per year, the wettest months being September and October, and the driest February and March. Anguilla is vulnerable to hurricanes from June to November, peak season August to mid-October.\nThe island suffered damage from Hurricane Luis in 1995, severe flooding of from Hurricane Lenny in 1999 and severe damage from Hurricane Irma in 2017, which remains the most powerful hurricane to hit the island.\nVegetation.\nAnguilla's coral and limestone terrain provide no subsistence possibilities for forests, woodland, pastures, crops, or arable lands. Its dry climate and thin soil hamper commercial agricultural development. In Anguilla forest cover is around 61% of the total land area, equivalent to 5,500 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, which was unchanged from 1990.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67325", "revid": "1319182029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67325", "title": "Economy of Anguilla", "text": "The economy of Anguilla depends heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing, and remittances from emigrants. Due to its small size, few natural resources, and reliance on tourism and foreign direct investment, Anguilla is vulnerable to external economic conditions in the United States, Canada and Europe. Therefore, economic growth in Anguilla can be very volatile. Anguilla's currency is the East Caribbean dollar, though the US dollar is also widely accepted. The exchange rate is fixed to the US dollar at US$1 = EC$2.70.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century, Anguilla's major product was salt produced by evaporation on the shores of the island's lakes, which was exported to the United States. Sugar, cotton, sweetcorn, and tobacco were also grown. By the beginning of World War I, the island had been almost entirely deforested by charcoal-burners. Most of the land was held by black sustenance farmers producing sweet potatoes, peas, beans, and corn and rearing sheep and goats. Salt continued to be exported to nearby Saint Thomas, along with phosphate of lime and cattle.\nModern Anguilla has focused its development on tourism, its related construction industry, and offshore finance. The first comprehensive financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994. \nThe economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects of Hurricane Luis in September. Hotels were hit particularly hard but a recovery occurred the following year. Another economic setback occurred during the aftermath of Hurricane Lenny in 2000. Before the 2008 worldwide crisis, the economy of Anguilla was growing strongly, especially the tourism sector, which was driving major new developments in partnerships with multi-national companies. Anguilla's tourism industry received a major boost when it was selected to host the World Travel Awards in December 2014. Known as \"the Oscars of the travel industry\", the awards ceremony was held at the CuisinArt Resort and Spa and was hosted by Vivica A. Fox. Anguilla was voted the World's Leading Luxury Island Destination from a short list of top-tier candidates such as St. Barts, the Maldives, and Mauritius. The economy, including the tourism sector, suffered its biggest setback in late 2017 due to the effects of Hurricane Irma in September, which was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island and which caused major material damage of $320\u00a0million. A lot of infrastructure was damaged, which was repaired in 2018/19 and the economy began to recover in 2019. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020/21, caused a setback in the economy.\nAnguilla's financial system comprises seven banks, two money services businesses, more than 40 company managers, more than 50 insurers, 12 brokers, more than 250 captive intermediaries, more than 50 mutual funds, and eight trust companies. In 2013, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, the regulator of Anguilla's banks, took control over Anguilla's indigenous banks and in 2016, fleeced the foreign depositors to prop up Anguilla's banking system and make local depositors whole.\nAnguilla has become a popular tax haven, having no capital gains, estate, profit, sales, or corporate taxes. In April 2011, faced with a mounting deficit, it introduced a 3% \"Interim Stabilisation Levy\", Anguilla's first form of income tax. Anguilla also has a 0.75% property tax.\nAnguilla aims to obtain 15% of its energy from solar power to become less reliant on expensive imported diesel. The Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network is helping the government gather the information it needs to change the territory's legislation, so that it can integrate renewables into its grid. Barbados has also made good progress in switching to renewables, but many other Small Island Developing States are still at the early stages of planning how to integrate renewable energy into their grids. \"For a small island we're very far ahead,\" said Beth Barry, Coordinator of the Anguilla Renewable Energy Office. \"We've got an Energy Policy and a draft Climate Change policy and have been focusing efforts on the question of sustainable energy supply for several years now. As a result, we have a lot of information we can share with other islands.\"\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, due to a skyrocketing interest in artificial intelligence, Anguilla was expected to profit in 2023 from a surge in demand for web addresses ending with the country's top-level domain .ai. The total number of registrations of .ai domain names had already doubled in 2022, and according to Vince Cate, who has managed the top-level domain, Anguilla will bring in as much as $30\u00a0million in domain-registration fees for 2023.\nIndustry.\nMajor industries in Anguilla include tourism, boat building, and offshore financial services. In 1997 there was an industrial production growth rate of 3.1%.\n42.6 GWh of electricity are consumed, produced entirely by fossil fuel.\nAgricultural products include small quantities of tobacco, vegetables, and cattle raising.\nIn 2011 Anguilla became the fifth-largest jurisdiction for Captive Insurance, behind Bermuda, Cayman, Vermont and Guernsey. The captive industry plays an ever-increasing and important part of Anguilla's financial services industry. Captive management firms, including Capstone Associated Services, have staffed offices in Anguilla in order to service the fast-growing captive insurance industry.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAttribution:"}

It was an initiative of the founders of the Professional Institute of Sales and Advertising (IPEVE) which at that time had been in existence for almost 20 years (1963).\nIn 1983, the university embarked on its academic programme with the creation of three faculties: the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Administrative Sciences, and the Faculty of Psychology. In 1989, two new faculties were created: the Faculty of Information and Communications and the Faculty of Engineering Sciences.\nIn 1991, the university decided to undergo the process of national accreditation with the aim of attaining the status of Autonomous University.\nOn March 18, 1993, the Superior Council for Education in plenary session ratified Universidad Diego Portales as successfully fulfilling its institution mission, for which it was designated as having \u201cFull Institutional Autonomy\u201d, authorized to bestow all categories of academic degree and title independently. Since 1993, the university has embarked on consolidation and growth in its academic programme.\nIn 1994, degree courses in Advertising and Design were transferred from IPEVE to Universidad Diego Portales, and the Bachelor of Arts degree programme was introduced. In 1999, the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Fine Arts was created and the Faculty of Humanities founded.\nIn 2002, Universidad Diego Portales took a step in its growth with the creation of new programs and its incursion into two new fields of knowledge: Health and Education. UDP that same year designed a plan for long-term infrastructure growth, involving the issue of a Security Bond guaranteed by the World Bank for approximately US$25 million, thus becoming the first educational institution to use this type of financing.\nIn 2004 Universidad Diego Portales became one of the first private universities to achieve institutional accreditation as a university from the National Undergraduate Accreditation Commission (CNAP) in three areas: Institutional Management, Undergraduate Teaching, and Equipment and Infrastructure.\nAcademic schools and programs.\nUniversidad Diego Portales offers 31 undergraduate programs in daytime and evening formats at its faculties.\nThere are 11,877 registered undergraduate students and more than 1,000 graduates students, with more than 16,000 in its alumni network.\nAdditionally, the university imparts postgraduate programmes.\nThe Faculty of Education and Humanities runs \nThe Faculty of Health Sciences, in conjunction with the IberoAmerican University Foundation, offers an International master's degree in Nutrition and Dietetics, and a postgraduate degree in Nutrition and Applied Dietetics.\nThe Faculty of Communications and Letters offers a programme leading to an International master's degree in communication and an International Diploma in Management Communication.\nThe Faculty of Law offers master's degrees in Infant\u2013Adolescent and Family Law, Constitutional Law and Public Institutions, and Criminal Law and the Penal Process; and postgraduate courses in Family Mediator Training.\nThe Faculties Economics and Business joined with the Faculty of Engineering through their Graduate Schools have developed an MBA programme with dual degree in Universitat Pompeu Fabra with specializations in Finance, Human Resources, Strategic Communication, Marketing and Quality Control and a Master in Finance; Masters programmes in Educational Management, Organizational Development and Behaviour, Information Technology Management, Systems Administration and Business Administration.\nThe Humanities Institute offers a master's degree programme in Contemporary Thought and a diploma in Contemporary Thought.\nIn 2005, there were 9959 registered postgraduate students.\nInternational relations and agreements.\nUDP has an extensive network of working alliances and agreements with renowned universities, research centres, foundations and overseas organizations in more than 25 countries.\nUDP maintains agreements with 120 universities from countries such as Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Honduras, Italy, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela.\nResearch and knowledge production.\nThe growing importance of knowledge in the development of nations has led UDP to implement a programme of research and knowledge production oriented towards the search for solutions to national problems of high public impact.\nIn consequence, the Centre for Juridical Research of the Faculty of Law has made significant contributions towards the Penal Procedures Reform which is being implemented throughout the country; two other centres belonging to the Faculty of Humanities and Education (Cognitive Development Centre) and the Faculty of Communication and Letters (Journalism and Advertising Research Centre, CIPP) are implementing programmes of public interest in the areas of cognitive development, community strengthening and the role of the communications media in society.\nAdded to the above, the Humanities Institute and the Social Sciences Research Institute have embarked on multidisciplinary research programmes oriented towards relevant national issues, contributing to the national debate on a permanent basis from a rigorous new perspective.\nThe university is implementing 21 programmes with external financing from the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT), the Fund for the Development of Art and Culture (FONDART), the Bicentennial Programme of the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), the Ministry of Planning and Cooperation (MIDEPLAN), the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC), the United Nations Development Programme and the National Council for Narcotics Control (UNDP-CONACE), and the European Commission's 6th Marco Programme, in the fields of Education, Psychology, Health, Law, Social Sciences, Humanities and Engineering. To these must be added the over 25 research projects that are financed internally.\nMoreover, members of the academic staff have published more than 50 articles in ISI-indexed publications from 2005 to June 2006.\nAn Astronomy \"Nucleus\" was formed in 2013, being part of the Faculty of Engineering and Sciences. It performs research in areas ranging from protoplanetary disks and extrasolar planets to supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and high redshift galaxies. The group has a strong focus on observational astronomy, performing observations at X-ray, optical, infrared, and submillimiter/radio wavelengths. Its research programs utilize the world-class telescopes located in the north of Chile as well as space-based observatories.\nAccreditation.\nAreas of accreditation from the National Undergraduate Accreditation Committee (CNAP) Institutional Accreditation 2008 to 2013.\nInfrastructure.\nWith the implementation of their Infrastructural Plan, UDP has established a solid presence in the centre of Santiago in buildings extending over an area of 94,582 square metres that serve its university community.\nThis colossal project is the result of the work of a team of architects from the academic staff of the Faculty of Architecture, Art and Design of the university. With this project, UDP possesses the largest student infrastructure in the University District of Santiago, considered and projected around the life of its students, empowering the development of their academic, sporting and social activities.\nUDP is building for economics faculty and postgrad, in \"Ciudad empresarial\", a business area in the north of Santiago. It is building a new library, central library of Diego Portales University, in downtown Santiago.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bordered by the Andes in the west and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, its neighboring countries are Chile to the west, Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, and Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast.\nIn terms of area, Argentina is the second largest country in South America after Brazil, and the eighth largest country in the world. Its total area is . Argentina claims a section of Antarctica (Argentine Antarctica) that is subject to the Antarctic Treaty. Argentina also asserts claims to several British South Atlantic islands.\nWith a population of 46.6 million, Argentina ranks as the world's 31st most populous country as of 2010[ [update]].\nGeneral characteristics.\nArgentina is located in the Southern part of South America, being the biggest country in the Southern Cone. It limits with Chile to the west and south, with the Argentina\u2013Chile border being its largest one. Bolivia and Paraguay limit Argentina in the north, the Argentina\u2013Paraguay border is the second largest one. The northern half of Argentina limits with Brazil and Uruguay to the east, and the southern half with the Atlantic Ocean. The Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory, are located to the east of southern Argentina, across the ocean. Argentina is located at a strategic point over the Strait of Magellan, the link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\nArgentina has a land area of 2,780,400\u00a0km\u00b2. It is the 8th largest country in the world, between India and Kazakhstan. It is the second largest country in South America, after Brazil, and the fourth largest in the Americas after Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The surface is almost eight times that of Germany, and four times that of Texas, and three-tenths the size of the United States. The Argentine Sea, the maritime claims of Argentina, include an exclusive economic zone of 200\u00a0nm.\nThe terrain is composed of plains to the East, with the Andes mountain range at the western border. Climate is mostly temperate, with an arid area at southeast Patagonia and subantartic climate at the southwest. The Iguazu Falls, one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature, is the largest waterfall system in the world. It is located at the frontier with Brazil, with both countries having part of it.\nAs for the national extreme points, the northernmost point is the confluence of the Grande de San Juan river and the Mojinete river, at the Jujuy Province. The southernmost point is the Cape San P\u00edo at the Tierra del Fuego Province, at the entry point of the Beagle Channel. The westernmost point is located at the Los Glaciares National Park, at the Santa Cruz Province. The easternmost point is the \"Hito V\" (CONALI), located at Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones. The highest point of Argentina is the Aconcagua mountain at the Mendoza Province, with 6962 m., which is also the highest point of South America. The lowest point is Laguna del Carb\u00f3n, at the Santa Cruz Province.\nIn Argentina forest cover is around 10% of the total land area, equivalent to 28,573,000 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 35,204,000 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 27,137,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 1,436,000 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 7% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 0% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 4% private ownership and 96% with ownership listed as other or unknown.\nRegions.\nThe Cuyo region is located in the middle-west of the country. It comprises the west of Catamarca and La Rioja, most of San Juan, and the center and north of Mendoza. It limits to the Argentine Northwest to the north, Chile to the west, the Pampas to the east, and the Patagonia to the south. Most of the region is part of the Andes mountain range. It is divided in the occidental range, whose mountains are largely uniform, and the oriental range, with more varied geographic features. The snow line is located at 5000 m. of altitude. There is a corridor between mountains with rivers and lakes, irrigated by the snow that melts during summer. Most of those rivers become tributaries of the Desaguadero River. The climate is arid, with few rains and even few clouds. There are few native trees, and most vegetation are bushes adapted to the climate. The fauna includes camelids such as guanacos and vicu\u00f1as, and vultures like the Andean condor.\nThe Gran Chaco region is located in the north of the country. It comprises the provinces of Formosa, Chaco, Santiago del Estero and north of Santa Fe. It limits to Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, the Argentine Norwest to the west, the Pampas to the south, and Paraguay and the Mesopotamia to the east. The land is completely flat, which leads to an abundance of swamps and vernal pools. The most important rivers are the Paraguay and Parana, and their tributaries Pilcomayo and Bermejo. The climate is subtropical, with a dry season to the west and without it to the east. There are xerophilous forests.\nThe Mesopotamia region is located in the east of the country, between the Parana and Uruguay rivers. It comprises the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, and Entre R\u00edos. It limits to Paraguay and Brazil to the north, Gran Chaco and pampas to the west, Brazil and Uruguay to the east, and the pampas to the south. Most of it is a plain, and the rivers end at the R\u00edo de la Plata, making the R\u00edo de la Plata Basin.\nThe Argentine Northwest region comprises the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Tucum\u00e1n, Catamarca, and La Rioja. It limits to Bolivia to the north, Chile to the west, Cuyo to the south and the Gran Chaco to the east. The region is divided into three subregions, the Puna to the west, valleys in the middle, and hills to the east. The Puna is a high treeless plateau, which continues to the west into the Atacama Desert in Chile. It has characteristic salt pans. There is very little water in that area, mostly in temporary streams. The hills and valleys are wetter, with the rain that comes from the east, and includes rivers such as the Salado and Bermejo. Climate is arid in the Puna and subtropical in the east.\nArgentina's provinces are divided in seven zones regarding climate and terrain. From North to South, West to East:\nMountains and hills.\nThe Andes mountain range is the longest mountain range in the world, running along Argentina's border with Chile. The highest peak in the Andes is Aconcagua, almost 7000 meters (almost 23000 feet) above sea level. Argentina is also famous for its glaciers. Cerro Cathedral is a famous ski resort in the Patagonian mountains at Nahuel Huap\u00ed National Park. The Cordillera de la Ramada is a range in San Juan, Argentina. Monte Fitz Roy is another famous mountain.\nWater resources.\nIn Argentina, the fluvial net is integrated by many systems of different economic relevance, which could be measured by their amount of flow and navigability. Water flow relevance is based on its potential to be used for irrigation and as a source of energy. Depending on where the water streams drain, rivers and creeks could be classified into three different kinds of watersheds:\nOn the other hand, lakes and lagoons are permanent accumulations of water over impervious depressions. Their difference is mainly based on their extension and depth. They are very important for stream regulation, as a source of energy, tourist attraction and its ichthyologic wealth. In Argentina, all major lakes are in Patagonia.\nRivers.\nMajor rivers in Argentina include the Pilcomayo, Paraguay, Bermejo, Colorado, R\u00edo Negro, Salado, Uruguay and the largest river, the Paran\u00e1. The latter two flow together before meeting the Atlantic Ocean, forming the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata. Regionally important rivers are the Atuel and Mendoza in the homonymous province, the Chubut in Patagonia, the R\u00edo Grande in Jujuy, and the San Francisco River in Salta.\nLakes.\nThere are several large lakes in Argentina, many of them in Patagonia. Among these are lakes Argentino and Viedma in Santa Cruz, Nahuel Huapi in R\u00edo Negro and Fagnano in Tierra del Fuego, and Colhu\u00e9 Huapi and Musters in Chubut. Lake Buenos Aires and O'Higgins/San Mart\u00edn Lake are shared with Chile. Mar Chiquita, C\u00f3rdoba, is the largest saltwater lake in the country. There are numerous reservoirs created by dams. Argentina features various hot springs, such as those at Termas de R\u00edo Hondo with temperatures between 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 65\u00a0\u00b0C.\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 3,091\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Argentina, making it the ninth ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.\nClimate.\nArgentina is subject to a variety of climates. The north of the country, including latitudes in and below the Tropic of Capricorn, is characterized by very hot, wet summers (which result in a number of swamp lands) with mild drier winters, and is subject to periodic droughts during the winter season.\nCentral Argentina has hot summers with tornadoes and thunderstorms (in western Argentina producing some of the world's largest hail), and cool winters. The southern regions have warm summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall, especially in mountainous zones. Higher elevations at all latitudes experience cooler conditions.\nPolitical geography.\nArgentina borders six countries with one, near the Falkland Islands, being a maritime border with the United Kingdom. Its largest and the world's second largest international land border is with Chile, which is long. The Argentina\u2013Paraguay border is long.\nStrategic importance:\nNational parks.\nThe National Parks of Argentina make up a network of thirty national parks in Argentina. The parks cover a very varied set of terrains and biotopes, from Barit\u00fa National Park on the northern border with Bolivia to Tierra del Fuego National Park in the far south of the continent (see List of national parks of Argentina).\nThe creation of the National Parks dates back to the 1903 donation of 73 square kilometers of land in the Lake District in the Andes foothills by Francisco Moreno. This formed the nucleus of a larger protected area in Patagonia around San Carlos de Bariloche. In 1934, a law was passed creating the National Parks system, formalizing the protected area as the Nahuel Huapi National Park and creating the Iguaz\u00fa National Park. The National Park Police Force was born, enforcing the new laws preventing tree-felling and hunting. Their early task was largely to establish national sovereignty over these disputed areas and to protect borders.\nFive further national parks were declared in 1937 in Patagonia and the service planned new towns and facilities to promote tourism and education. Six more were declared by 1970.\nIn 1970 a new law established new categories of protection, so that there now were National Parks, National Monuments, Educational Reserves and Natural Reserves. Three national parks were declared in the 1970s. In 1980, another new law affirmed the status of national parks - this law is still in place. The 1980s saw the service reaching out to local communities and local government to help in the running and development of the national parks. Ten more national parks were created with local co-operation, sometimes at local instigation. In 2000, Mburucuy\u00e1 and Copo National Parks were declared, and El Leoncito natural reserve was upgraded to a national park.\nThe headquarters of the National Park Service are in downtown Buenos Aires, on Santa Fe Avenue. A library and information center are open to the public. The administration also covers the national monuments, such as the Petrified Forest, and natural and educational reserves.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The president of Argentina is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the president. Legislative power is vested in the National Congress. The Judiciary is independent from the Executive and from the Legislature, and is vested in the Supreme Court and the lower national tribunals. From the own government is also called Presidency of the Nation ().\nExecutive branch.\nThe current composition of the executive branch includes solely the president, who is the head of state and is formally given the power over the administration to follow through with the interests of the nation. The president is also the chief of the Argentine Armed Forces.\nThe president and the vice president are elected through universal suffrage by the nation. The constitutional reform of 1994 introduced a \"two-round system\", more popularly known in the country as ballotage, by which the winning presidential ticket has to receive either more than 45% of the overall valid votes, or at least 40% of it and a 10% lead over the runner-up. In any other case, the two leading tickets get to face a second round whose victor will be decided by a simple majority. This mechanism was not necessary in the 1995 election, when it could have first come into use, nor in the ones in 1999, 2007, 2011, and 2019. However, it was instrumental in the selection of N\u00e9stor Kirchner in 2003, of Mauricio Macri in 2015, and, most recently, of Javier Milei in 2023.\nThe cabinet of ministers is appointed by the president, but is not technically part of the executive power. The vice president belongs to the legislative branch, since they also hold the presidency of the senate.\nCurrent ministries.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]]:\nLegislative branch.\nThe National Congress () constitutes the legislative branch of government. The Congress consists of the Senate (72 seats), presided by the Vice-President of the Nation, and the Chamber of Deputies (257 seats), currently presided by Juli\u00e1n Dom\u00ednguez, deputy for Buenos Aires province. Senators stay in office for six years, and deputies, for four.\nEach of the Provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires elect deputies and senators directly. Deputies are representatives of the whole people of the Nation, while Senators represent their districts. Each district elects a number of deputies roughly proportional to their overall population by proportional representation, and three senators: two for the majority, and one for the first minority. Members of both chambers are allowed indefinite re-elections.\nEvery two years, each of the 24 electoral districts (the twenty-three Provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) elects one half of their lower chamber representatives. Districts with an odd number of Deputies elect one more or one fewer of them on each election. As for the Senators, the twenty-four districts are divided into three groups consisting of eight districts. Every two years all eight districts of one of those groups elect all their three senators, assigning two of them from the party that obtains the majority, and one from the first minority party. Six years later, the same group of districts will hold its next senatorial elections.\nJudiciary branch.\nThe Judiciary Branch is composed of federal judges and others with different jurisdictions and of a Supreme Court with nine members (one President, one Vice President, and seven Ministers), appointed by the President with approval of the Senate, who may be deposed by Congress. As of December 2015 there are six vacancies, which then President Kirchner stated she did not intend to fill.\nProvincial and municipal governments.\nArgentina is divided into 23 districts called Provinces and one autonomous district, which hosts the national capital, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (which is conurbated into the province of Buenos Aires). Each of the provinces has its own constitution, laws, authorities, form of government, etc., though these must first and foremost comply with the national constitution and laws.\nThe government of each province has three branches. The Executive, Legislative and Judiciary. The Executive branch is led by a governor. The Legislative Branch may be organized as a unicameral or a bicameral system, i.e:, with either one or two chambers or houses; currently, eight of the 24 provinces has a bicameral legislature.\nEach province, except for Buenos Aires Province, is divided into districts called departments (\"departamentos\"). Departments are merely administrative divisions; they do not have governing structures or authorities of their own. They are in turn divided into municipalities (cities, towns and villages). Each province has its own naming conventions and government systems for different kinds of municipalities. For example, C\u00f3rdoba Province has \"municipios\" (cities) and \"comunas\" (towns); Santa Fe Province further distinguishes between first- and second- tier \"municipios\"; Chaco Province refers to every populated center as \"municipios\", in three categories.\nThe Province of Buenos Aires has a different system. Its territory is divided into 134 districts called \"partidos\", each of which usually contains several cities and towns.\nRegardless of the province, each department/partido has a head town (\"cabecera\"), often though not necessarily the largest urban center, and in some provinces often named the same as their parent district.\nMunicipalities are ruled by mayors, usually called Intendant (\"intendente\") in the case of cities and towns (the larger categories). A city has a legislative body called the Deliberative Council (\"Concejo Deliberante\"). The smaller towns have simpler systems, often ruled by commissions presided by a communal president (\"presidente communal\") or a similarly named authority.\nBuenos Aires city, seat of the National Government, was declared an autonomous city by the 1994 constitutional reform. Its mayor, formerly chosen by the President of the Republic, is now elected by the people, and receives the title of Chief of Government (\"Jefe de Gobierno\"). Other than that, Buenos Aires, as the provinces, has its own Legislative Branch (a unicameral Legislature) and elect deputies and senators as representatives to the National Congress."}

As a country, it had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal relative to other developed economies, which inspired an enormous wealth of literature and diverse analysis on the causes of this relative decline. Since independence from Spain in 1816, the country has defaulted on its debt nine times. Inflation has often risen to the double digits, even as high as 5,000%, resulting in several large currency devaluations.\nArgentina possesses definite comparative advantages in agriculture because the country is endowed with a vast amount of highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income. By 1913, Argentina was among the world's ten wealthiest states per capita.\nBeginning in the 1930s, the Argentine economy deteriorated notably. The single most important factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930 when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina was one of the most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962, the Argentine per capita GDP was higher than that of Austria, Italy, Japan, and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.\nThe era of import substitution ended in 1976, but at the same time growing government spending, large wage increases, and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s. The measures enacted during the last dictatorship also contributed to the huge foreign debt by the late 1980s which became equivalent to three-fourths of the GNP.\nIn the early 1990s, the government reined in inflation by implementing a currency board system and introducing a new convertible peso equal in value to the U.S. dollar and privatized numerous state-run companies using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt. However, a sustained recession at the turn of the 21st century culminated in a default, and the government again devalued the peso. By 2005 the economy had recovered, but the country again defaulted in 2014 and 2020.\nColonial economy.\nDuring the colonial period, present-day Argentina offered fewer economic advantages compared to other parts of the Spanish Empire, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy. It lacked deposits of gold or other precious metals and did not have established native civilizations to subject to the \"encomienda\".\nOnly two-thirds of its present territory were occupied during the colonial period, while the remaining third consisted of the Patagonian Plateau which remains sparsely populated to this day. The agricultural and livestock sector's output was principally consumed by the producers themselves and by the small local market. They only became associated with foreign trade towards the end of the 18th century.\nThe period between the 16th and the end of the 18th century was characterized by self-sufficient regional economies separated by considerable distances, a lack of road, maritime or river communications, and the hazards of land transport. By the end of the 18th century, a significant national economy came into being as Argentina developed a market in which reciprocal flows of capital, labor, and goods could take place on a significant scale between its regions.\nIn the colonial period, the territories that now make up Argentina were subject, like the rest of the Spanish territories in the Americas, to legal restrictions regarding how and with whom trade could be conducted. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, trade directly through the port of Buenos Aires, rather than via the official system of fleets out of the port of Lima in modern Per\u00fa, was forbidden except through special permission from the Crown. In practice, however, this did not mean that the colonial economy of what is now Argentina was closed to trade.\nIn addition to trade with Brazil and Guinea, which was legalized in the early seventeenth century, colonial Buenos Aires also conducted trade directly with Spain and other European powers through the so-called \"nav\u00edos de registro\"\u2014 ships with royal permission to sail outside the official fleet or Spanish treasure fleet system to conduct specific services, such as transport soldiers. Dutch and Basque merchants in particular played an important role, in partnership, in managing the system of \"nav\u00edos de registro\" to conduct trans-Atlantic trade with Buenos Aires. Even more important than the \"nav\u00edos\" was a system of contraband trade into which the \"nav\u00edos\" were inserted. Thus, in the second half of the seventeenth century an estimated 200 ships entered the port of Buenos Aires without any permission at all, as opposed to 34 \"nav\u00edos de registro\". On top of this system of largely technically illegal transatlantic trade was the \"situado\" system of funding from the royal treasury in Potos\u00ed, in Upper Peru, which supplied the military garrison in Buenos Aires. In practice, the \"situado\" funded, through a system of credit, a local economy in Buenos Aires which was itself inserted into the contraband economy.\nArgentinian historian Zacar\u00edas Moutoukias argues that this system of trade, in which Buenos Aires was linked with the mining economy of the Andes through the \"situado\" and to cross-Atlantic trade through contraband and the \"nav\u00edos de registro\", created an integrated political and commercial elite in Buenos Aires, made up of military officers, Crown officials and local merchants, and a political economy in which \"corruption\"\u2014that is, the violation of royal laws regarding trade\u2014was not an aberration but rather a defining characteristic. \u00a0For Moutoukias, \"corruption\" was simply \"the violation of a fixed set of norms that limited the integration of the crown\u2019s representatives with the local oligarchy\"\u2014a violation that was tacitly tolerated by the Crown because it was lucrative.\nHistorians like Milc\u00edades Pe\u00f1a consider this historical period of the Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets. Rodolfo Puiggr\u00f3s consider it instead a feudalist society, based on work relations such as the encomienda or slavery. Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but a hybrid system result of the interaction of the Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, still living in prehistory.\nThe Argentine territories, held back by their closed economies, the lack of any activity closely linked to foreign trade, and the scant amounts of labor and capital they consequently received, fell far behind those of other areas of the colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in C\u00f3rdoba and the Litoral, where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.\nThis trade was legally limited to Spain: the Spanish Crown enforced a monopsony which limited supplies and enabled Spanish merchants to mark up prices and increase profits. British and Portuguese merchants broke this monopsony by resorting to contraband trade.\nOther scholars reject the label of \"feudal\" to describe Argentine economy and society during the colonial period. Historian Jeremy Adelman, for example, describes an agrarian economy in the Argentinian interior in which both wage labor and production for the market were quite common during the colonial period. In the seventeenth century, this included the development of textile workshops (\"obrajes\"), the raising of mules for transport and the hunting of feral cattle herds to produce meat, leather and tallow\u2014 all of these economic activities supplied the mining economy of Potos\u00ed in the Andes. In the 18th century, the depletion of feral cattle herds led to the development of settled livestock agriculture in the Argentine Littoral and inland regions. The relative lack of extra-economic coercion due to ample access to land on the agrarian frontier, the prevalence of wage labor, the variety of types of land tenure (ownership, tenancy, a spectrum of usufruct rights) as well as a lack of a fixed and hegemonic landed elite all lead Adelman to reject the label of \"feudalism\" to describe the agrarian economy of what now makes up Argentina during the colonial period.\nThe British desire to trade with South America grew during the Industrial Revolution and the loss of their 13 colonies in North America during the American Revolution. To achieve their economic objectives, Britain initially launched the British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata to conquer key cities in Spanish America but they were defeated by the local forces of what is now Argentina and Uruguay not once but twice without the help of Spain. When they allied to Spain during the Napoleonic Wars, they requested the Spanish authorities to open commerce to Britain in return.\nThe first Argentine historians, such as Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre, attributed the free trade to \"The Representation of the Hacendados\" economic report by Mariano Moreno, but is currently considered the result of a general negotiation between Britain and Spain, as reflected in the Apodaca-Canning treaty of 1809. The actions of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros in Buenos Aires reflected similar outcomes emanating from the other Spanish cities of South America.\nCompared to other parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the development of the Argentine economy, mostly because of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many were destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.\nThe colonial livestock ranches were established toward the middle of the 18th century. The pace of growth in the region increased dramatically with the establishment in 1776 of the new Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata with Buenos Aires as its capital, and increased legal trading allowed by the Free Trade Act of 1778, which allowed for \"free and protected\" trade between Spain and its colonies. This trade system disintegrated during the Napoleonic era, and contraband became common again.\nPost-independence transition.\nDuring the early post-independence period, an important share of Argentina's exports came from cattle and sheep production. The livestock-raising economy was based upon the abundance of fertile land in the littoral provinces. Cropping apparently lacked comparative advantage compared to livestock grazing.\nExports rose 4% to 5% annually from 1810 to 1850 and 7% to 8% from 1850 to 1870. This growth was achieved through the extension of the frontier and greater efficiency in livestock production.\nAs a result of the diversification in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.\nMost poor gauchos joined forces with the most powerful caudillos in the vicinity. As the Federalist Party, they opposed the policies implemented by Buenos Aires, and waged the Argentine Civil Wars.\n1810\u20131829.\nAfter Argentina became independent in 1810, an era in which commerce was controlled by a small group of peninsular merchants came to an end. The Primera Junta, the first government established after the 1810 May Revolution, undertook a protectionist policy until their fall from government.\nThe First Triumvirate (1811\u20131812), influenced by Bernardino Rivadavia and Manuel Garc\u00eda, instead promoted unrestricted trade with Britain. The Second Triumvirate (1812\u20131814) and Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas (who controlled the Liga Federal during the 1815\u20131820 period) sought to restore the initial protectionist policy, but the Supreme Director restored free trade once more. Thus, the economy of the R\u00edo de la Plata became one of the most open economies in the world.\nBetween 1812 and 1816 divisions developed between a Unitarist faction centred on Buenos Aires and a Federalist faction in the provinces, which eventually led to a series of civil wars that ended with the conquest of Buenos Aires by Federalist caudillos at the Battle of Cepeda in 1820.\nEach province had its own money, and the same money had a different value from one province and another, and even among cities in the same province.\nThe government of Mart\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez (1820\u20131824) and his minister Bernardino Rivadavia, then Las Heras and finally Rivadavia himself as the first president of Argentina from 1826 to 1827, developed an economic plan deemed as \"The happy experience\". This plan increased the British influence in the national politics. It was based on five main pillars: complete free trade and no protectionist policies against British imports, finance with a central bank managed by British investors, absolute control of the port of Buenos Aires as the sole source of income from national customs, British exploitation of the national natural resources, and a Unitarist national organization centred in Buenos Aires. After Rivadavia resigned in 1827, ending the \"happy experience\", the federalist Manuel Dorrego assumed power as governor of Buenos Aires, but was soon executed by the unitarist Juan Lavalle during a military coup.\nThe exports of gold, allowed by the free trade policies, soon depleted the national reserves. This posed a great problem, as gold was the medium of exchange of the local economy. Rivadavia sought to fix it by establishing the \"Discount Bank\", a central bank for printing fiat money. Like a number of other central banks worldwide, this bank was not owned by the state, but by private investors, British in this case.\nThe report of the American John Murray Forbes to John Quincy Adams, sixth President of the United States, in 1824 mentioned that Britain had a huge influence in the economic power of the country.\nHe mentioned that the government in Buenos Aires was so eager to be on good terms with Britain and gain recognition of the declaration of independence that most official institutions (as the Bank) were under British control, and that Britain had similar control over the Argentine economy to that metropole of a colony, without the financial, civil or military costs. Even the lack of an Argentine merchant fleet allowed Britain to manage the maritime trade. Forbes's testimony should be appraised in perspective of the contemporary Anglo-American commercial rivalry, In light of the partial nature of the account and of his \"jealousy, even antipathy\" towards the English in Rio de la Plata.\nIn the mid-1820s, when Manuel Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda was Minister of Finance, the government borrowed heavily to finance new projects and to pay off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, the government received credit for \u00a3570,000 from the Baring Brothers in exchange for a debt of \u00a31,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.\n1829\u20131870.\nJuan Manuel de Rosas forced Lavalle to leave the province, and the federals ruled Buenos Aires until 1852. Rosas modified a number of policies of the Rivadavian period but maintained others: he set a customs law with protectionist policies, but kept the port under the exclusive control of Buenos Aires and refused to call a constituent assembly.\nThe customs law set trade barriers to products produced in the country, and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods, together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver. However, the law was not completely effective because of the control of the port, which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income. The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros. Despite the financial obstacles, the economy of Entre R\u00edos grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires, with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production.\nIn 1838 there was a new currency crisis, and the peso papel was devalued by 34%, and in 1839 when the peso papel lost 66% of its value. It was again devalued by 95% in 1845, and by 40% in 1851. The Alsina years, which coincided with the secession of Buenos Aires, saw an extremely poor economic performance. Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces of the Confederation caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket. Similarly, the Confederation faced harsh economic conditions. Urquiza, president of the Confederation, issued the 'law of differential rights', benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the Confederation and but not with Buenos Aires.\nThe end of the civil wars provided the political and legal stability necessary to assert property rights and cut transaction costs, contributing to the huge inflows of capital and labor resources that built modern Argentina. In 1866 an attempt was made to stabilize the currency, by introducing a system of convertibility, which restricted the monetary authorities to issue paper currency only if it was fully backed by gold or convertible foreign currency. The decades of the 1860s and 1880s experienced the most favorable performance of the economy overall, setting the stage for the so-called Golden Age of Argentine history. Nevertheless, the first years of independence included a difficult economic development. In spite of the new freedom caused by the inauguration of the republic, the country was not economically united: expansion in some parts and decline in other parts. Indeed, people experienced different levels of income and welfare. Therefore, it is unclear whether 1820\u20131870 brought an income or welfare improvement.\nIn the 60 years after the founding of the farming colony at Esperanza in 1856, the base of Argentine agriculture gradually shifted from livestock to crops.\nExport-led boom.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"In spite of its enormous advance which the Republic has made within the last ten years, the most cautious critic would not hesitate to aver that Argentina has but just entered upon the threshold of her greatness.\"\nPercy F. Martin, Through Five Republics of South America, 1905.\nArgentina, which had been insignificant during the first half of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America. This impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by the export of agricultural goods. A 2018 study describes Argentina as a \"super-exporter\" during the period 1880\u20131929 and credits the boom to low trade costs and trade liberalization on one hand and on the other hand to the fact that Argentina \"offered a diverse basket of products to the different European and American countries that consumed them\". The study concludes \"that Argentina took advantage of a multilateral and open economic system.\"\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, there was an intense process of colonization of the territory in the form of latifundia. Until 1875 wheat was imported as it was not grown in sufficient quantities to supply local demand; by 1903 the country supplied all its own needs and exported of wheat, enough to sustain 16,000,000 people.\nIn the 1870s real wages in Argentina were around 76% relative to Britain, rising to 96% in the first decade of the 20th century. GDP per capita rose from 35% of the United States average in 1880 to about 80% in 1905, similar to that of France, Germany and Canada.\n1870\u20131890.\nIn 1870, during Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's presidency, total debt amounted to 48 million gold pesos. A year later, it had almost doubled. Avellaneda became president after winning the 1874 presidential election. The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido Autonomista Nacional, Argentina's first national party; all the presidents until 1916 would come from this party. Avellaneda undertook the tough actions needed to get the debt under control. In 1876 convertibility was suspended. The inflation rate rose to almost 20% in the following year, but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted. Avellaneda's administration was the first to deliver a balance in the fiscal accounts since the mid-1850s. Avellaneda passed on to his successor, Julio Argentino Roca, a much more manageable economic environment.\nIn 1881, a currency reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which went into effect in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.\nThe profitability of the agricultural sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over \u00a320 million in 1880 to \u00a3157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom. Despite its dependence on the British market, Argentina managed a 6.7% annual rate of growth of exports between 1870 and 1890 as a result of successful geographic and commodity diversification.\nThe first Argentine railway, a road, had been built in 1854. By 1885, a total of of railways were open for traffic. The new railways brought livestock to Buenos Aires from the vast pampas, for slaughter and processing in the (mainly English) meat-packing plants, and then for shipment around the world. Some contemporary analysts lamented the export bias of the network configuration, while opposing the \"monopoly\" of private British companies on nationalist grounds. Others have since argued that the initial layout of the system was mostly shaped by domestic interests, and that it was not, in fact, strictly focused on the port of Buenos Aires.\nThe scarcity of labor and abundance of land induced a high marginal product of labor. European immigrants (chiefly Italians, Spaniards, French and Germans), tempted by the high wages, arrived in droves. The government subsidized European immigration for a short time in the late 1880s, but immigrants arrived in massive numbers even with no subsidy.\nBaring crisis to World War I.\nJu\u00e1rez Celman's administration saw a substantial increase in the ratio of debt to GDP toward the end of his tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation. The Baring Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina, and when Celman's government was unable to meet its payments to the House of Baring, a financial crisis ensued. Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the Baring Brothers faced failure. The crisis was caused by the lack of co-ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which ultimately led to the collapse of the banking system. The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies program, and it was abolished in 1891. Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed, and imports had to be cut sharply. Exports were less affected, but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898.\nCelman's successor, Carlos Pellegrini, laid the foundations for a return to stability and growth after the restoration of convertibility in 1899. He also reformed the banking sector in ways that were to restore stability in the medium term. Rapid growth rates soon returned: in 1903\u20131913, GDP increased at an annual rate of 7.7%, and industry grew even faster, jumping by 9.6%. By 1906, Argentina had cleared the last remnants of the 1890 default and a year later the country re-entered the international bond markets.\nAll the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal instability was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873\u201377 and 1890\u201391 played a crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labor force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of \u00a359 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.\nInterwar period.\n1914\u20131929.\nArgentina, like many other countries, entered into a recession following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States during the war and would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.\nAs a consequence, investable funds became increasingly concentrated in a single institution, the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), creating a financial system vulnerable to rent-seeking. Rediscounting and non-performing loans grew steadily at the BNA after 1914, polluting its balance sheet. This corrosion of balance sheets was a result of crony loans to the other banks and the private sector. In its rediscounting actions the BNA was not engaged in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.\nHowever, unlike its neighbors, Argentina had relatively healthy growth rates during the 1920s, not being as affected by the worldwide collapse of commodity prices. For instance, during the 1920s, automobile ownership per capita in Argentina was the highest in the Southern Hemisphere, and grew to become the 4th highest in the world.\nFor all its success, by the 1920s Argentina was not an industrialized country by the standards of Britain, Germany or the United States. In the structure of its economy and its role as a commodity exporter, it has been compared to Canada and Australia during this period, in the framework of the Staple Theory. A major hindrance to full industrialization was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. YPF, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.\nExports of frozen beef, especially to Great Britain, proved highly profitable after the invention of refrigerated ships in the 1870s. However Britain imposed new restrictions on meat imports in the late 1920s, which sharply reduced beef imports from Argentina. Ranchers responded by switching from livestock to crop production, but there was lasting damage to the Argentine economy.\nGreat Depression.\nThe Great Depression had a comparatively mild effect on Argentina: the unemployment rate never went above 10%, and the country largely recovered by 1935. However, the Depression permanently halted its economic expansion. Actually, much like other agricultural exporters, the economy was already in a downturn beginning in 1927, a result of declining prices.\nArgentina abandoned the gold standard in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversi\u00f3n was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw the value of its exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.\nIn response to the Great Depression, successive governments pursued a strategy designed to transform Argentina into a country self-sufficient in industry as well as agriculture. The strategy of growth was based on import substitution in which tariffs and quotas for final goods were raised. The import-substitution process had progressively been adopted since the late 19th century, but the Great Depression intensified it. The government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agriculture, and agricultural production fell dramatically.\nIn 1930, the armed forces forced the Radicals from power and improved economic conditions, but political turbulence intensified. In 1932, Argentina required immigrants to have a labor contract prior to arrival, or proof of financial means of support. The Roca-Runciman Treaty of 1933 gave Argentina a quota of the British market for exports of its primary products, but the discriminatory British imperial tariffs and the effects of deflation in Britain actually led to a small decline of Argentine exports to Great Britain.\nUnemployment resulting from the Great Depression caused unrest. The industrial growth spurt of the 1930s gradually slowed. The economic conditions of the 1930s contributed to the process of internal migration from the countryside and smaller towns to the cities, especially Buenos Aires, where there were greater opportunities for employment. The urban working classes led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to the 1937 presidential elections. Traditional export agriculture stagnated at the outbreak of World War II and remained sluggish. \nIn 1940, Finance Minister Federico Pinedo proposed an economic plan to seek closer ties to the United States and encourage industrial exports to replace the slowing agricultural exports as the engine for the nation's growth, but it was never fully implemented due to a lack of political consensus, owing to the illness and resignation of President Ortiz and the political turmoil of those years. Some economic historians lament the lack of follow-through on this plan and the subsequent focus on the internal market instead, as a critical mistake. Nevertheless, industrial exports did see some growth during this period, as non-traditional manufactured goods grew from a share of 2.9% of total exports in 1939, to 19.4% by 1943.\nImport substitution industrialization Era.\nFirst Peronist period: Nationalization.\nAfter the 1943 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat, Juan Per\u00f3n became Minister of Labor. Campaigning among workers with promises of land, higher wages, and social security, he won a decisive victory in the 1946 presidential elections. Under Per\u00f3n, the number of unionized workers expanded as he helped to establish the powerful General Confederation of Labor. Per\u00f3n turned Argentina into a corporatist country in which powerful organized interest groups negotiated for positions and resources. During these years, Argentina developed the largest middle class on the South American continent.\nEarly Peronism was a period of macroeconomic shocks during which a strategy of import substitution industrialization was put into practice. Bilateral trade, exchange control and multiple exchange rates were its most important characteristics. Beginning in 1947, Per\u00f3n took a leftward shift after breaking up with the \"Catholic nationalism\" movement, which led to gradual state control of the economy, reflected in the increase in state-owned property, interventionism (including control of rents and prices) and higher levels of public investment, mainly financed by the inflationary tax. The expansive macroeconomic policy, which aimed at the redistribution of wealth and the increase of spending to finance populist policies, led to inflation.\nWartime reserves enabled the Peronist government to fully pay off the external debt in 1952; by the end of the year, Argentina became a net creditor to the tune of US$5 billion. Between 1946 and 1948, the French and British-owned railways were nationalized, and the existing networks were expanded, with the rail network reaching 120,000 kilometers by 1954. The government also established the IAPI to control the foreign trade in export commodities. Per\u00f3n erected a system of almost complete protection against imports, largely cutting off Argentina from the international market. In 1947, he announced his first Five-Year Plan based on growth of nationalized industries. Protectionism also created a domestically oriented industry with high production costs, incapable of competing in international markets. At the same time, output of beef and grain, the country's main export goods, stagnated. The IAPI began shortchanging growers and, when world grain prices dropped in the late 1940s, it stifled agricultural production, exports and business sentiment, in general. Despite these shortcomings, protectionism and government credits did allow an exponential growth of the internal market: radio sales increased 600% and fridge sales grew 218%, among others.\nDuring the first Five-Year Plan, various public works and programs were executed, with the aim to modernize the country's infrastructure. For example, a total of 22 hydroelectric power plants were erected, increasing electrical output from 45,000 kVA in 1943 to 350,000 kVA in 1952. Between 1947 and 1949, a network of gas pipelines, which linked Comodoro Rivadavia with Buenos Aires, was built. The gas distribution reached 15 million m\u00b3, reducing costs by a third.\nDuring this period Argentina's economy continued to grow, on average, but more slowly than the world as a whole or than its neighbors, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to unusual specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), inhibited economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, redistribution of income from the agrarian to the industrial sector, and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina's GDP per capita accounted fell to less than half of that of the United States.\nPer\u00f3n's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favored increased agricultural output over industrialization, but industrial growth and high wages in previous years had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as the majority of those who worked in agriculture labored on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Per\u00f3n's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country's comparative advantage in agriculture.\nPost-Peron era and the 1960s.\nIn the 1950s and part of the 1960s, the country had a slow rate of growth in line with most Latin American countries, while most of the rest of the world enjoyed a golden era. Stagnation prevailed during this period, and the economy often found itself contracting, mostly the result of union strife.\nWage growth beginning in 1950 pushed prices up. The inflation rate increased faster, and soon real wages fell. High inflation prompted a stabilization plan that included tighter monetary policy, a cut in public expenditures, and increases in taxes and utility prices. Increasing economic wariness as the 1950s progressed became one of the leading causes for Per\u00f3n's downfall in the Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora of 1955, as the working classes saw their quality of life diminished, thus stripping Per\u00f3n from a large part of his popular support.\nArturo Frondizi won the 1958 presidential election in a landslide. In the same year he announced the beginning of the \"oil battle\": a new attempt at import substitution which aimed to achieve self-sufficiency in oil production by signing several contract with foreign companies for the mining and exploitation of oil. In 1960, Argentina joined the Latin American Free Trade Association.\nAnother coup in June 1966, the so-called Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena to head the Economy Ministry. His strategy implied a very active role for the public sector in guiding the process of economic growth, calling for state control over the money supply, wages and prices, and bank credit to the private sector.\nKrieger's tenure witnessed increased concentration and centralization of capital, coupled with privatization of many important sectors of the economy. The international financial community offered strong support for this program, and economic growth continued. GDP expanded at an average annual rate of 5.2% between 1966 and 1970, compared to 3.2% during the 1950s.\nAfter 1966, in a radical departure from past policies, the Ministry of Economy announced a program to reduce rising inflation while promoting competition, efficiency, and foreign investment. The anti-inflation program focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from an annual rate of about 30% in 1965\u201367 to 7.6% in 1969. Unemployment remained low, but real wages fell.\nA gradual reversal in trade policy culminated in the military announcing import substitution as a failed experiment, lifting protectionist barriers and opening the economy to the world market. This new policy boosted some exports, but an overvalued currency meant certain imports were so cheap that local industry declined, and many exports were priced out of the market. The Ministry of Economy put an end to the exchange rate policy of previous governments. The currency underwent a 30% devaluation. In 1970, the \"peso moneda nacional\" (one of the longest-lived currencies in the region) was replaced by the \"peso ley\" [shortened form of \"peso ley 18188\"] (100 to 1).\nIn May 1969, discontent with Krieger's economic policies led to riots in the cities of Corrientes, Rosario and C\u00f3rdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Ongan\u00eda administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, and with it the standard of living. Per\u00f3n's third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in the level of inflation.\nDeindustrialization (1975\u20132002).\nStagnation (1975\u20131990).\nBetween 1975 and 1990, real per capita income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of economic development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The share of manufacturing as a percentage of GDP at the start of the 1990s had receded to similar levels than in the 1940s.\nIn the early 1970s, per capita income in Argentina was twice as high as in Mexico and more than three times as high as in Chile and Brazil. By 1990, the difference in income between Argentina and the other Latin American countries was much smaller. Starting with the Rodrigazo in 1975, inflation accelerated sharply, reaching an average of more than 300% per year from 1975 to 1991, increasing prices 20 billion times.\nWhen the military dictatorship finance minister Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz assumed power, inflation was equivalent to an annual rate of 5000%, and output had declined sharply. In 1976, the era of import substitution was ended, and the government lowered import barriers, liberalized restrictions on foreign borrowing, and supported the peso against foreign currencies. That exposed the fact that domestic firms could not compete with foreign imports because of the overvalued currency and long-term structural problems. A financial reform was implemented that aimed both to liberalize capital markets and to link Argentina more effectively with the world capital market.\nAfter the relatively stable years of 1976 to 1978, fiscal deficits started to climb again, and the external debt tripled in three years. The increased debt burden interrupted industrial development and upward social mobility. From 1978, the rate of exchange depreciation was fixed with a \"tablita\", an active crawling peg that was based on a timetable to announce a gradually-declining rate of depreciation. The announcements were repeated on a rolling basis to create an environment in which economic agents could discern a government commitment to deflation. Inflation gradually fell throughout 1980 to below 100%. In 1978 and 1979, the real exchange rate appreciated because inflation consistently outpaced the rate of depreciation. The overvaluation ultimately led to capital flight and a financial collapse.\nGrowing government spending, large wage raises, and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s, when it briefly exceeded an annual rate of 1000%. Successive regimes tried to control inflation by wage and price controls, cuts in public spending, and restriction of the money supply. Efforts to stem the problems came to naught when in 1982 Argentina came into armed conflict with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands.\nIn August 1982, after Mexico had announced its inability to service its debt, Argentina approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial assistance, as it too was in serious difficulties. While developments looked positive for a while, an IMF staff team visiting Buenos Aires in August 1983 discovered a variety of problems, particularly a loss of control over wages affecting both the budget and external competitiveness, and the program failed. With the peso quickly losing value to inflation, the new Argentine peso argentino was introduced in 1983, with 10,000 old pesos exchanged for each new peso.\nIn December 1983, Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn was elected President of Argentina, bringing an end to the military dictatorship. Under Alfonsin, negotiations started on a new program with the IMF, but they led to nothing. In March 1984, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela lent Argentina $300 million for three months, followed by a similar amount by the United States. That provided some breathing space as it was not before late September 1984 that an agreement was reached between the IMF and Argentina.\nIn 1985, the Argentine austral replaced the discredited peso. In 1986, Argentina failed to pay the debt for several months, and the debt was renegotiated with the creditor banks. In 1986 and 1987, the Austral Plan faded away, as fiscal policy was undermined by large off-budget spending and a loose monetary policy, again falling out of compliance with an IMF program. A new IMF arrangement was reached in July 1987, only to collapse in March 1988.\nThe next move by the authorities was to launch the Primavera Plan in August 1988, a package of economically heterodox measures that foresaw little fiscal adjustment. The IMF refused to resume lending to Argentina. Six months after its introduction, the plan collapsed, leading to hyperinflation and riots.\nConvertibility Plan (1991\u20132002).\nThe Peronist Carlos Menem was elected president in May 1989. He immediately announced a new shock program, this time with more fiscal adjustment in view of a government deficit of 16% of GDP. In November 1989 agreement was reached on yet another standby with the IMF, but again the arrangement was ended prematurely, followed by another bout of hyper-inflation, which reached 12,000% per year.\nAfter the collapse of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatization became strongly popular. Menem privatized almost everything the state owned, except for a couple of banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatization, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatization the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernized farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outflows of employees. In addition, the process of privatization was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatized enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their prices on long-term contracts were indexed to American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.\nIn 1991, economy minister Domingo Cavallo set out to reverse Argentina's decline through free-market reforms such as open trade. On 1 January 1992, a monetary reform replaced the austral with the peso at a rate of 10,000 australs for 1 peso. The cornerstone of the reform process was a currency board, under which the peso was fixed by law at par to the dollar, and the money supply restricted to the level of hard-currency reserves. This was a risky policy which meant at a later stage Argentina could not devalue. After a lag, inflation was tamed. With risk of devaluation apparently removed, capital poured in from abroad. GDP growth increased significantly and total employment rose steadily until mid-1993. During the second half of 1994, the economy slowed down and unemployment increased from 10% to 12.2%.\nAlthough the economy was already in a mild recession at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labor force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, at the beginning of 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.\nExports grew from $12 billion in 1991 to $27 billion in 2001, but many industries could not compete abroad, especially after Brazil's devaluation. The strong, fixed exchange rate turned the trade balance to a cumulative US$22 billion in deficits between 1992 and 1999. Unable to devalue, Argentina could only become more competitive if prices fell. Deflation came from recession, falling wages and rising unemployment. Interest rates remained high, with banks lending dollars at 25%.\nThe share of public spending in GDP increased from 27% in 1995 to 30% in 2000. Some poorer provinces had depended on state enterprises or on inefficient industries, such as sugar, which could not compete when international trade was opened. To quell social unrest, provincial governors padded their payrolls. The government had embarked on an old-age pension reform with costs reaching 3% of GDP in 2000, as it still had to pay pensioners but no longer received contributions.\nEconomic crisis (1998\u20132002).\nArgentina fell into a deep recession in the second half of 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina's sluggish GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.\nIn December 1999, President Fernando de la R\u00faa took office, seeking assistance from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina rapidly lost credit in capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, the de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to the complete loss of market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine sovereign debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.\nIn December 2001, a series of deposit runs began to destabilize the banking system, leading the Argentine authorities to impose a partial withdrawal freeze. With Argentina no longer in compliance with the conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements. At the end of December, in a climate of severe political and social unrest, the country partially defaulted on its international obligations; in January 2002, it formally abandoned the currency convertibility regime.\nThe ensuing economic and political crisis was arguably the worst since the country's independence. By the end of 2002, the economy had contracted by 20% since 1998. Over the course of two years, output fell by more than 15%, the Argentine peso lost three-quarters of its value, and registered unemployment exceeded 25%. Income poverty in Argentina grew from 16.8% in October 1993, to an already high 25.9% in October 1998 (at the beginning of the recession), to 35.4% in October 2001, to a peak of 54.3% in October 2002.\nCritics of the policy of economic liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticized the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.\nKirchnerism and relative growth (2003\u20132015).\nIn January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was appointed president, the fifth in two weeks. Roberto Lavagna, who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002, was credited for the ensuing recovery, having stabilized prices and the exchange rate to head off hyperinflation. After the default in 2001, growth reached over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011. This was in part due to a commodity price boom, and also because the government managed to keep the value of the currency low, boosting industrial exports.\nKirchner administration.\nN\u00e9stor Kirchner became president in May 2003. In the mid-2000s, export of unprocessed soybeans, soybean oil, and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina's export revenue, triple the joint share of the traditional exports of beef and wheat. Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds from soy exports. Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes discouraged foreign investment, while high spending pushed inflation over 20%.\nAn attempt by the Kirchner administration to impose price controls in 2005 failed, as many items went out of stock and the mandatory prices were often ignored. Various sectors of the economy were re-nationalized, including the postal service (2003), the San Mart\u00edn Railway line (2004), the water utility serving the Province of Buenos Aires (2006) and Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas (2009).\nIn December 2005, Kirchner decided to liquidate the Argentine debt to the IMF in a single payment, without refinancing, for a total of $9.8 billion. The payment was partly financed by a US$1.6 billion loan from Venezuela. As of mid-2008 Venezuela holds an estimated US$6 billion in Argentine debt. In 2006, Argentina re-entered international debt markets selling US$500 million of its Bonar V five-year dollar denominated bonds, with a yield of 8.36%, mostly to foreign banks, and Moody's boosted Argentina's debt rating from B\u2212 to B.\nIn early 2007 the administration began interfering with inflation estimates.\nFern\u00e1ndez administration.\nOn December 10, 2007, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner became president. In 2008 the rural sector mobilized against a resolution that would have increased the tax rate on soybean exports from 35% to 44.1%. Ultimately, the new taxation regime was abandoned. Official Argentine statistics are believed to have significantly underreported inflation since 2007, and independent economists publishing their own estimates of Argentine inflation have been threatened with fines and prosecution.\nIn October 2008 President Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner nationalized private pension funds worth almost $30 billion, ostensibly to protect the pensions against falling stock prices around the world, although critics said the government simply wanted to add the money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 1998\u20132002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds' beneficiaries.\nThe late-2000s recession hit the country in 2009 with GDP growth slowing to 0.8%. High GDP growth resumed in 2010, and the economy expanded by 8.5%. In April 2010, Economy Minister Amado Boudou prepared a debt swap package for the holders of over US$18 billion in bonds who did not participate in the 2005 Argentine debt restructuring. In late 2010, the largest new natural gas deposits in 35 years were discovered in Neuqu\u00e9n Province. The unemployment rate in the third quarter of 2011 was 7.3%.\nIn November 2011, the government laid a plan to cut utilities subsidies to higher income households. By mid-2011, credit was outpacing GDP by a wide margin, raising concerns that the economy was overheating. Argentina began a period of fiscal austerity in 2012. In April 2012, the government announced plans to expropriate YPF, despite the opposition of some energy experts, claiming that YPF's Spanish partner and major holder, Repsol, had not done its duty as to provide the financial support for research and land exploitation, as well as being a bad administrator concerned only in sending profits to Spain and forsaking YPF's economic growth.\nRising inflation and capital flight caused a rapid depletion of the country's dollar reserves, prompting the government to severely curtail access to dollars in June 2012. The imposition of capital controls, in turn, led to the emergence of a black market for dollars, known as the \"d\u00f3lar blue\", at higher rates than the official exchange rate.\nBy May 2014, private forecasts estimated annual inflation at 39.9%, one of the highest rates in the world. In July 2014, a ruling from a New York court ordered the country to pay the remaining holders of the bonds defaulted in 2001, which by then were mostly American vulture funds, before it paid any of its exchange bondholders. The Argentine government refused, causing the country to default on its debt again.\nEconomic problems since 2016.\nPresidency of Mauricio Macri.\nOn December 17, 2015, Macri lifted foreign exchange restrictions, leading to a 30% devaluation of the Peso, the largest since 2002. In January 2016 it was devalued to 44 cents. Unemployment reached double digits as, with massive layoffs in the public and private sectors.\nIn April 2016, monthly inflation rose to 6.7%, the highest since 2002, according to the indicator, with annual inflation reaching 41.7%, one of the highest in the world. Another estimate said that inflation reached 37.4%, the fiscal deficit 4.8%, and predicted GDP would fall by 1.9%. In December 2015, the government announced the elimination of export restrictions for wheat, maize and meat, while reducing withholding taxes on soybeans to 30% at a fiscal cost of 23,604 million pesos. This led to large price increases in staple products including oil, which increased by 51%, flour 110%, chicken 90%, noodles 78%, and a 50% increase in the price of meat in two weeks. Because of a 150-180% increase in feed prices, many pig producers were in crisis. It is estimated that in the province of Buenos Aires alone, 40 thousand pork producers would fail.\nOne of Macri's promises during the 2015 campaign was the elimination of Income tax for workers, saying \"During my government workers will not pay tax on profits\". The Minister of the Economy and Public Finances, Alfonso Prat-Gay said that the draft amendments to the income tax would be sent to Congress for treatment on March 1, 2016. As of December 2017[ [update]], it was not in the government's plan to eliminate the income tax.\nAn extremely high inflation rate was strangling the urban and rural working population: decreasing from the astounding 40% of 2016, it was expected to be 17% by 2018. Other vulnerabilities include an unemployment rate close to 9% (expected to be in two digits in the next two years), as well as the sharp rise in the current-account deficit around 3% to 4% of GDP in 2017\u20132018 thanks to an over-valued currency. Forecasts from the IMF show GDP growth in 2018 decelerating to 2.5% from 2.75%, and clearly any halting of the cyclical upswing in the global economy would set the country back.\nPresidency of Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez.\nIn 2019 the inflation was considered the highest in 28 years according to the index, ascending to 53.8%. Because of the quarantine in 2020, in April, 143,000 SMEs will not be able to pay salaries and fixed expenses for the month, even with government assistance, and approximately 35,000 companies consider closing their business. Despite cuts in the payment chain, some project 180 total days and calculate 5% of companies that fell in May. In 2023, the rate of inflation in Argentina surpassed 100% for the first time since the early 1990s.\nPresidency of Javier Milei.\nOn 10 December 2023, Javier Milei, a right-wing libertarian, was sworn in as president. During the electoral campaign, inflation was at over 100 percent. At the time of Milei's inauguration, Argentina\u2019s economy was suffering 143 percent annual inflation, the currency had plunged and four out of 10 Argentines were in poverty.\nIn January 2024, a study by the Catholic University of Argentina estimated that the country's poverty rate had reached 57.4%, the highest since 2004. However, by the third quarter of 2024 the Catholic University of Argentina estimated that the poverty rate had eased to 49.9% of the population, while Torcuato Di Tella University estimated that poverty stood at 36.8% of the population for the second semester of the year.\nIn November 2024, Argentina's monthly inflation rate slowed to 2.4%, the lowest in over four years. Annual inflation was expected to end 2024 closer to 100%. Favourable results and normalization in Argentina's economy are expected to continue in 2025. The annual inflation rate, which was 211% in 2023, is expected to be below 30% in 2025. Economic activity has also begun to recover: the economy is expected to expand by more than 4% in 2025.\nIn October 2025, President Javier Milei's party, La Libertad Avanza, won a landslide victory in midterm elections, making it easier for Milei to push ahead with his programme of radical spending cuts and free-market reforms.\nArgentine paradox.\nThe Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked that there were four types of countries: the developed, the underdeveloped, Japan, and Argentina.\nAccording to Di Tella and Zymelman, the main difference between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the smaller number of landowners each with larger areas of land in Argentina.\nDuncan and Fogarty argued that the key difference lies in the contrast between the stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while D\u00edaz Alejandro suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia's, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labor.\nTaylor pointed out that the relatively high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by the relatively high prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which was caused by the industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favored by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labor productivity.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

It is controlled by the Commander-in-Chief (the President) and a civilian Minister of Defense. In addition to the Army, Navy and Air Force, there are two security forces, controlled by the Ministry of Security, which can be mobilized on occasion of an armed conflict: the National Gendarmerie, a gendarmerie used to guard borders and places of strategic importance; and the Naval Prefecture, a coast guard used to protect internal major rivers and maritime territory.\nTraditionally, Argentina maintains close defense cooperation and military-supply relationships with the United States and to a lesser extent, with Israel, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Belarus, Italy, and Russia.\nAs of 2024, the current Chief of the General Staff is the Air Force Brigadier General Xavier Isaac.\nHistory.\nThe oldest forces of the Argentinian military are the Argentinian Army and the Argentinian Navy, both created in 1810, during the Argentine War of Independence, while the Argentinian Air Force was established in 1945. The Argentine military played a role in the institutional life of the country, during a series of coups d'\u00e9tat that took place in the 20th century.\n1955\u20131963 internal strife.\nAfter the Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora coup that deposed president Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n in 1955, the armed forces split into opposing sectors named \"Azules y colorados\" (\"Blues and Reds\"). The fight would end in 1963 with military clashes and the defeat of the \"reds\" who were opposed to Per\u00f3n.\n1965 Operacion 90.\nIn 1965, the Argentine military conducted a 10-man patrol on Antarctica called Operaci\u00f3n 90 under then-Colonel Jorge E. Leal to perform scientific observations and promote Argentina's claim to a portion of the continent.\n1975 Counter-insurgency.\nIn 1975 the armed forces started a massive operation in the Tucum\u00e1n Province to crush the ERP (\"Ej\u00e9rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo\" or People's Revolutionary Army) Guevarist guerrilla group which attempted to create a \"revolutionary foco in this remote and mountainous province, in the north-west of Argentina.\"\nNational Reorganization Process.\nThe last military dictatorship, the National Reorganization Process, lasted from 1976 to 1983. As Isabel Per\u00f3n was unable to defeat the terrorist organizations of Montoneros and ERP, the military took power during the 1976 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat and exterminated the violent communist guerrillas by random detentions, torture or death. The government of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner that sympathized with Per\u00f3n, antagonized the Armed Forces with the justification of the past junta and limited the powers of the armed forced to avoid state terrorism of the past.\n1982 Falklands War.\nOn 2 April 1982, Argentine forces invaded the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands, followed shortly afterwards by the invasion of South Georgia. Britain sent a task force to recover the islands. Argentina surrendered on 14 June. The political effect of the surrender led to protests against the dictatorship, which hastened its downfall.\n1983 transition to democracy.\nThe democratic government of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn that took office in 1983 prosecuted the 1970s crimes and made the unprecedented (and only Latin American example) Trial of the Juntas and soon the Army was rocked by uprisings and internal infighting. Far-right sectors of the Army rebelled in the Carapintadas (\"painted faces\") movement. To contain the rebellions, Alfons\u00edn promoted the Full stop law and the Law of due obedience. The following president, Carlos Menem, gave the presidential pardon to the military found guilty in the Trial of the Juntas. It would not be until 1990, when the last military uprising in Argentine history was crushed, that the political conflict within the Army finally subsided.\nIn January 1989, during the subversive attack on La Tablada, the Army used white phosphorus in a violation of the Geneva Convention (according to a document presented by the human rights commission of the United Nations on January 12, 2001).\nGulf War and 1990s.\nArgentina was the only Latin American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War sending a destroyer and a corvette in first term and a supply ship and another corvette later to participate on the United Nations blockade and sea control effort of the gulf. The success of \"Operaci\u00f3n Alfil\" (English: \"Operation Bishop\") as it was known, with more than 700 interceptions and sailed on the operations theatre helped to overcome the so-called \"Malvinas syndrome\".\nFrom 1990 to 1992, the Baradero-class patrol boats were deployed under UN mandate ONUCA to the Gulf of Fonseca in Central America. In 1994, the three Drummond-class corvettes participated on Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti.\nAlso, in the 1990s, Argentine Armed Forces began a close defense cooperation and friendship policy with neighbors Brazil and Chile, with emphasis on fulfillment of United Nations mandates.\nThe Argentine military have been reduced both in number and budget, but became more professional, especially after conscription was abolished by president Menem. The British embargo due to the Falklands War () was officially eliminated and Argentina was granted Major Non-NATO ally status by United States President Bill Clinton.\nPresent.\nThe modern Argentine Armed Forces are committed to international peacekeeping under United Nations mandates, humanitarian aid on emergencies relief and support the country's continuous presence at Antarctica.\nDemocratic governments since 1983 streamlined the military budget and did not approve any large scale equipment purchases. Argentina military spending is one of the lowest of South America and as of 2010, its 0.9% of GDP only exceeds Suriname Within the defence budget itself funding for training and even basic maintenance was significantly cut, a factor contributing to the accidental loss of the Argentine submarine San Juan in 2017. The result has been a steady erosion of Argentine military capabilities, with some arguing that Argentina had, by the end of the 2010s, ceased to be a capable military power.\nThe small-scale capability modernization that Argentina has attempted has been actively opposed by the United Kingdom. In 2019 the Argentine Air Force and government selected the Korean KAI FA-50 as its interim fighter to replace its aging Falklands-vintage aircraft. However, the deal was cancelled in early 2020 leaving the Air Force without a fighter replacement. British intervention was apparently a key factor in the cancellation with Britain stopping the export of the aircraft incorporating various British components. In October 2020, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) confirmed that since major components of the aircraft were supplied by the U.K., the aircraft could not be exported to Argentina. Britain similarly blocked the potential sale of Brazilian license-built Saab Gripen aircraft to Argentina given avionics that were of British origin.\nIn 2003, for the first time, the Argentine Navy (classified as a major non-NATO ally) interoperated with a United States Navy battlegroup when destroyer ARA Sarand\u00ed (D-13) joined the USS Enterprise Carrier Strike Group and Destroyer Squadron 18 as a part of Exercise Solid Step during their tour in the Mediterranean Sea.\nOn June 12, 2006, President N\u00e9stor Kirchner brought into force the Defense Law, which had been passed in 1988 as a means to modernize the doctrine of the armed forces and define their role. The law states that the armed forces will only be used against foreign aggression, and reduces the powers of the heads of the armed services, centralizing whole operational and acquisitions decisions under the authority of the Armed Forces Joint General Staff (\" \u2013 EMC\" ) emphasizing Jointness.\nIn 2007, an agreement for cooperation in peace operations was signed with France.\nA combined Argentinian-Chilean force for future United Nations Mandates was created. Named Cruz del Sur (), the new force began assembly in 2008 with its headquarters alternating between the two countries each year.\nIn 2009, UNASUR, the South American countries union, created the CDS ( Spanish: \"Consejo de Defensa Sudamericano\" (South American Defence council) in order to promote cooperation and transparency between their armed forces\nAs of 2011, they perform with Chile the PARACACH (Patrulla de Rescate Ant\u00e1rtica Combinada Argentina-Chile, Argentine Chilean Antarctic combined search and rescue patrol) with support from the German Space Agency which provided satellite imagery\nStructure.\nThe three branches of the Argentine Armed Forces are under the direct authority of the Defense Ministry, while the Argentine National Gendarmerie and the Argentine Naval Prefecture, as security forces, under the direct authority of the Ministry of Security.\nInternational participation.\nArgentina was the only South American country to send warships and cargo planes in 1991 to the Gulf War under UN mandate and has remained involved in peacekeeping efforts in multiple locations like UNPROFOR in Croatia/Bosnia, Gulf of Fonseca, UNFICYP in Cyprus (where among Army and Marines troops the Air Force provided the UN Air contingent since 1994) and MINUSTAH in Haiti.\nUNFICYP was also a precedent in the Latin American military as troops of Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay are embedded in the Argentine contingent\nSince 1999 and as of June 2006, Argentina is the only Latin American country to maintain troops in Kosovo during SFOR (and later EUFOR) operations where combat engineers of the Argentine Armed Forces are embedded in an Italian brigade.\nIn 2007, an Argentine contingent including helicopters, boats and water purification plants was sent to help Bolivia against their worst floods in decades.

{"id": "67345", "revid": "36336112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67345", "title": "Foreign relations of Argentina", "text": "Overview of relations \nThis article deals with the diplomatic affairs, foreign policy and international relations of the Argentine Republic. At the political level, these matters are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also known as the \"Canciller\u00eda\", which answers to the President. The current Minister of Foreign Affairs, since October 2024, is Chancellor (es: \"Canciller\") Gerardo Werthein.\nHistory.\nFrom isolation to nationhood.\nOwing to its geographical remoteness, local authorities in what is today Argentina developed an early sense of autonomy. Based largely on economic needs, during colonial times their pragmatism led to a flourishing unofficial market in smuggled goods, out of the then-small port of Buenos Aires, in blatant contravention of the Spanish mercantilist laws. With the Enlightened despotism of the late-eighteenth-century Bourbon kings and the creation of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1776, trade increased as the political importance of the port-city of Buenos Aires soared. The urgency for a complete liberalization of commerce remained a powerful political cause for Criollos and Mestizos, further stimulated by the politically egalitarian and revolutionary ideals spread by the French and Anglo-American revolutions. Ultimately, the actual experience of successfully defending without Spanish aid the viceroyalty from a foreign invader during the 1806\u20131807 British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata, triggered a decisive quest for even greater autonomy from the colonial metropolis.\nBetween 1808 and 1810, the Napoleonic French Empire openly invaded Spain, after deposing King Ferdinand VII and taking him prisoner. A Spanish resistance formed an emergency government, the Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom in order to govern themselves and the Spanish Empire in the absence of Ferdinand VII. But, when the Supreme Central Junta dissolved itself on 29 January 1810, under extreme pressure from Napoleonic forces, most of the main cities of Spanish America refused to acknowledge its successor, a Regency Council, as the legitimate depositary of sovereignty. They proceed to name their own local juntas, as a means to exercise government in the absence of the prisoner king.\nOn 25 May 1810, a Criollo-led \"cabildo abierto\" formally assumed the authority from Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. However, the ensuing United Provinces of South America (formed on the basis of the former Viceroyalty) declared itself independent on 9 July 1816, after Ferdinand VII was restored in 1815. During the Independence Wars no sovereign state recognized the United Provinces.\nUntil the fall of the Royalist stronghold of Lima in 1821, and the Battle of Ayacucho of 1824, territorial integrity was solely sustained by the military brilliance of Generals Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Manuel Belgrano, the continuous efforts of northern provinces defenders Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes and Juana Azurduy, among many others. However, during this same period, internecine power conflicts among diverse leaders, and ideological and economical struggles developed between Buenos Aires Province and much of the rest of the United Provinces, with many of the Provinces bonding themselves into a Federal League, inspired by \"Federalist\" Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas' leadership. In practice, each side treated the other's grievances as a \"foreign policy\" matter.\nThe \"Unitarian\" Constitution of 1819 was immediately rejected by the provinces, and a state of anarchy ensued following the Battle of Cepeda. The only cause that could regain unity among the hostile factions was the 1825 invasion of what today is Uruguay on the part of Brazilian Empire. Uruguay, then known as the \"Province of the Eastern Bank of the Uruguay River\", was considered a somewhat breakaway Province, since Montevideo served as the seat of the Royalist Viceroy Francisco Javier de El\u00edo during its war on the May Revolution; and that, after the independentists victory, the Province became the main stronghold of the Federal League leader Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, who waged a long and bitter dispute during the 1810s against the Unitarians about the shape the national organization would have.\nThe war crisis led to a new Constitution and a first semblance of a united national government, at the same time it represented the first foreign policy crisis of the young nation (known as \"Rep\u00fablica Argentina\", \"per\" the 1926 Constitution), as it forced the nation into war with Brazil.\nThe common cause the crisis provided did lead to enough institutional stability to have the British Empire recognize Argentina (as President James Monroe had the U.S. State Department done in 1822) and led to the election of the first President of Argentina. The opportunity for unity, however, was wasted largely because the new President, Bernardino Rivadavia, pushed a new Constitution even more biased towards Buenos Aires' agenda than the failed 1819 document. The war with Brazil, moreover, went badly. Land battles were won, early on, and despite some heroic feats on the part on Irish-born Admiral Guillermo Brown, the war dragged on, resulting in bankruptcy. This and the hated new constitution led to the end of the first republic by 1828; it also led, however, to peace with Brazil and the formation of an independent Uruguay.\n26 September 1828 treaty itself became another foreign policy crisis, as it triggered a violent \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" by generals opposed to what they saw as a unilateral surrender. The murder of the man responsible for the treaty, Buenos Aires Governor Manuel Dorrego, itself led to a countercoup that brought with it the promise of a lasting peace; but eventually led to destabilizing consequences.\nThe countercoup brought in a new governor for the Buenos Aires Province, who would in time become the leading figure of a loose confederation of Argentine Provinces (the so-called Argentine Confederation). Juan Manuel de Rosas made it his mission to stabilize Argentina in a confederacy under the tutelage of Buenos Aires Province. This led to repression, massacres of Native Americans in the Pampas and, in 1838, an international embargo over the case of a French journalist tortured to death at Rosas' orders. An unyielding Rosas might have let the impasse continue for a decade or more; but, Admiral Guillermo Brown made his talents amenable once again, forcing the French blockade to be lifted in 1841.\nHaving come to power avenging the murder of a man who had decided to cease interference in Uruguay, Rosas invaded Uruguay upon the 1842 election of a government there antagonistic to his personal commercial interests (mainly centered in the export of cow hides and beef jerky, valuable commodities in those days). Commercially close with the French and British Empires, Uruguay's crisis met with swift reprisals against Rosas and the Argentine Confederacy from the two mighty powers. Slapped with fresh embargoes and a joint blockade, Argentina by 1851 found itself bankrupt and with \"rogue nation\" standing; on 3 February 1852, a surprise military campaign led by the Governor of Entre R\u00edos Province, Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza, put an end to the Rosas regime and, until 1878, at least, serious Argentine foreign policy misadventures.\nConstitution and conflict resolution.\nThe deposition of Rosas led to Argentina's present institutional framework, outlined in the 1853 constitution. The document, drafted by a legal scholar specializing in the interpretation of the United States Constitution put forth national social and economic development as its overriding principle. Where foreign policy was concerned, it specifically put emphasis on the need to encourage immigration and little else, save for the national defense against aggressions. This, of course, was forced into practice by Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez's disastrous 1865 invasion of northern Argentine territory, leading to an alliance between 1820s-era adversaries Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives (particularly Paraguay's own).\nSetbacks notwithstanding, the policy was successful. Domestically, Argentina was quickly transformed by immigration and foreign investment into, arguably, the most educationally and economically advanced nation in Latin America. Whatever else was happening domestically, internationally, Argentine policy earned a reputation for pragmatism and the reliance of conflict resolution as a vehicle to advance national interests. The era's new strongman, Gen. Julio Roca, was the first Argentine leader to treat foreign policy on equal footing with foreign investment and immigration incentives, universal education and repression as instruments of national development. His first administration occupied Patagonia and entered into an 1881 agreement with Chile to that effect and his second one commissioned archaeologist Francisco Moreno to survey an appropriate boundary between the two neighbors, which brought Chile into the historic 1902 pact, settling questions over Patagonian lands east of the Andes. Later that year, endorsed his Foreign Secretary's successful negotiation of a debt dispute between Venezuela, France and Germany. Foreign Secretary Luis Drago's proposal in this, a dispute among third parties, became the Drago Doctrine, part of international law to this day.\nThis success led to a joint effort between Argentina, Brazil and Chile to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the United States' occupation of Veracruz, Mexico in April 1914. That May, the three nations' foreign ministers hosted U.S. officials in Canada, a conference instrumental in the withdrawal of U.S. troops that November. This also resulted in the 1915 ABC pact signed between the three and, like Brazil and Chile, Argentina thereafter pursued a pragmatic foreign policy, focused on preserving favorable trade relationships. This policy was in evidence during the 1933 Roca-Runciman Treaty, which secured Argentine markets among British colonies, and in the Argentine position during the Chaco War. Resulting from the 1928 discovery of petroleum in the area, the dispute developed into war after Bolivia's appeal for Argentine intervention in what it saw as Paraguayan incursions into potentially oil-rich lands were rejected. Bolivia invaded in July 1932 and, despite its legitimate claim to what historically had been its territory, its government's ties to Standard Oil of New Jersey (with whom the Argentine government was in dispute over its alleged pirating of oil in Salta Province) led Buenos Aires to withhold diplomatic efforts until, in June 1935, a cease-fire was signed. The laborious negotiations called in Buenos Aires by Argentine Foreign Minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas yielded him Latin America's first Nobel Peace Prize in 1936 and a formal peace treaty in July 1938.\nWorld War II.\nAs they had during World War I, Argentine governments of different ideological stripes remained consistent in one important foreign policy point: they maintained Argentina neutral, preferring to offer the nation's vast agricultural export capacity to British and U.S. wartime needs; indeed, Argentine trade surpluses totalled US$1\u00a0billion during World War I and US$1.7\u00a0billion during World War II.\nIn early 1945, the United States and 19 Latin American countries met in Mexico at the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace. Argentina was not invited. The conference demanded that Argentina declare war on Germany or else it would be isolated. Argentina did so on 27 March 1945, and kept its status in the Pan-American Union and at the insistence of Latin American delegations was admitted to the new United Nations.\nCold War.\nThe incipient Cold War in evidence following World War II led the new administration of Juan Per\u00f3n to conclude that a third world war might follow. Per\u00f3n restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and, in 1949, articulated a \"third way\" as his foreign policy doctrine, in hopes of avoiding friction with either superpower, while opening the door to grain sales to the perennially shortage-stricken Soviets. Though commercial concerns continued to dominate foreign policy, conflict resolution was again ventured into when President Arturo Frondizi initiated negotiations between U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Cuban representative Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara during a Western Hemisphere summit in Uruguay in August 1961. Frondizi followed these exchanges with private discussions with \"Che\" Guevara in Buenos Aires, a misstep resulting in the Argentine military's opposition to further talks. Ultimately, Cuba was expelled from the Organization of American States in January 1962 and Frondizi was forced by the military to resign that March. The effort, though fruitless, showed audacity on the part of Frondizi, whom President Kennedy called \"a really tough man.\"\nA stray from precedent.\nArgentina's relations with its neighbor Chile, though generally cordial, have been strained by territorial disputes \u2013 mostly along their mountainous shared border \u2013 since the nineteenth century.\nIn 1958 the Argentine Navy shelled a Chilean lighthouse during the Snipe incident.\nOn 6 November 1965 the Argentine Gendarmerie killed Chilean Lieutenant Hern\u00e1n Merino Correa, member of Carabineros de Chile in the Laguna del Desierto incident.\nIn 1978 the bellicose Argentine dictatorship abrogated the binding Beagle Channel Arbitration and started the Operation Soberania in order to invade Chile but aborted it a few hours later due to military and political reasons. The conflict was resolved after the Argentine defeat in the Falklands by Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict of Pope John Paul II and in the form of a Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina (\"Tratado de Paz y Amistad\"), granting the islands to Chile and most of the Exclusive economic zone to Argentina; since then, other border disputes with Chile have been resolved via diplomatic negotiations.\nThe military dictatorship in Argentina invaded and occupied the British-controlled Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982, starting the Falklands War. The war lasted 74 days before an Argentine surrender on 14 June. The war cost the lives of nearly a thousand Argentine and British troops as well as three Falkland Islanders. It dealt the dictatorship a humiliating blow, opening the door for the return of a democratically elected government.\nSince the return of civilian rule to Argentina in 1983, relations with Chile, the United Kingdom and the international community in general improved and Argentine officials have since publicly ruled out interpreting neighboring countries' policies as any potential threat; but Argentina still does not enjoy the full trust of the Chilean political class.\nMichel Morris stated that Argentina has used threats and force to pursue its claims against Chile and Great Britain and that some of the hostile acts or armed incidents appear to have been caused by zealous local commanders.\nMenem Presidency.\nEarly on in the administration of President Carlos Menem (1989\u20131999), Argentina restored diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and developed a strong partnership with the United States. It was at this time that Argentina left the Non-Aligned Movement and adopted a policy of \"automatic alignment\" with the United States. In 1990, Menem's Foreign Minister, Guido di Tella, memorably pronounced the U.S.\u2013Argentine alliance to be a \"carnal relationship.\"\nArgentina was the only Latin American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War and all phases of the Haiti operation. It has contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations worldwide, with Argentine soldiers/engineers and police/Gendarmerie serving in El Salvador\u2013Honduras\u2013Nicaragua (where Navy patrol boats painted white were deployed), Guatemala, Ecuador\u2013Peru, Western Sahara, Angola, Kuwait, Cyprus, Croatia, Kosovo, Bosnia and East Timor.\nIn recognition of its contributions to international security and peacekeeping, U.S. President Bill Clinton designated Argentina as a major non-NATO ally in January 1998. The country is currently of two in Latin America that hold this distinction, the other being Brazil.\nAt the United Nations, Argentina supported United States policies and proposals, among them the condemnations of Cuba on the issue of human rights, and the fight against international terrorism and narcotics trafficking. In November 1998, Argentina hosted the United Nations conference on climate change, and in October 1999 in Berlin, became one of the first nations worldwide to adopt a voluntary greenhouse gas emissions target.\nArgentina also became a leading advocate of non-proliferation efforts worldwide. After trying to develop nuclear weapons during the 1976 military dictatorship, Argentina scrapped the project with the return of democratic rule in 1983, and became a strong advocate of non-proliferation efforts and the peaceful use of nuclear technologies.\nSince the return of democracy, Argentina has also turned into strong proponent of enhanced regional stability in South America, the country revitalized its relationship with Brazil; and during the 1990s (after signing the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina) settled lingering border disputes with Chile; discouraged military takeovers in Ecuador and Paraguay; served with the United States, Brazil and Chile as one of the four guarantors of the Ecuador\u2013Peru peace process. Argentina's reputation as a mediator was damaged, however, when President Menem and some members of his cabinet were accused of approving the illegal sale of weapons to Ecuador and to Croatia.\nIn 1998, President Menem made a state visit to the United Kingdom, and the Prince of Wales reciprocated with a visit to Argentina. In 1999, the two countries agreed to normalize travel to the Falkland Islands () from the mainland and resumed direct flights.\nIn the 1990s, Argentina was an enthusiastic supporter of the Summit of the Americas process, and chaired the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) initiative.\nKirchner Presidency.\nWithin the term of President N\u00e9stor Kirchner, from 2003 onwards, Argentina suspended its policy of automatic alignment with the United States and moved closer to other Latin American countries. Argentina no longer supports the UN Commission on Human Rights resolution criticizing the \"human rights situation in Cuba\" and calling upon the Government of Cuba to \"adhere to international human rights norms\", but has chosen instead to abstain. In the 2006 United Nations Security Council election, Argentina supported, like all Mercosur countries, the candidacy of Venezuela (a Mercosur member) over Guatemala for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council.\nThe Mercosur has become a central part of the Argentine foreign policy, with the goal of forming a Latin American trade bloc. Argentina has chosen to form a bloc with Brazil when it comes to external negotiations, though the economic asymmetries between South America's two largest countries have produced tension at times.\nBetween 4 and 5 November 2005, the city of Mar del Plata hosted the Fourth Summit of the Americas. Although the themes were unemployment and poverty, most of the discussion was focused on the FTAA. The summit was a failure in this regard, but marked a clear split between the countries of the Mercosur, plus Venezuela, and the supporters of the FTAA, led by the United States, Mexico and Canada. FTAA negotiations have effectively stalled until at least the conclusion of the 2006 Doha round global trade talks.\nIn 2005, Argentina assumed again (see history here ) the two-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council.\nAs of 2007, during Kirchner's almost four years in power, Argentina entered into 294 bilateral agreements, including 39 with Venezuela, 37 with Chile, 30 with Bolivia, 21 with Brazil, 12 with China, 10 with Germany, 9 with the United States and Italy, and 7 with Cuba, Paraguay, Spain and Russia.\nMacri Presidency.\nMauricio Macri started his term with a series of foreign policy objectives: (i) re-invigorate bilateral relations with the US and Europe, (ii) revise the foundations of Mercosur, evaluating (together with Brazil) alternatives that imply more free trade and (iii) go back to a single exchange rate, allow for a revival of commodity exports and attract foreign direct investment. However, the realization of these objectives will depend on the evolution of domestic (the fate of Kirchnerism) and regional (the fate of the PT in Brazil) developments.\nIssues.\nSovereignty claims.\nArgentina claims part of Antarctica as Argentine Antarctica, an area within the 25\u00b0 West and 74\u00b0 West meridians and the 60\u00b0 South parallel. This claim overlaps the British and Chilean claims, though all territorial claims in Antarctica are currently suspended under the Antarctic Treaty System. Argentina also claims the British overseas territories of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. In addition a long border with Chile in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field is awaiting demarcation as required under a 1998 treaty.\nOn 22 April 2009, the Argentine government submitted a claim to the United Nations (UN) for of ocean territory to be recognised as Argentina's continental shelf as governed by the Convention on the Continental Shelf and Convention on the Law of the Sea. Argentina claims to have spent 11 years investigating the matter and submitted of documents in support of the claim. If the claim is recognised by the UN then Argentina will gain the rights to the commercial exploitation of the sea bed (which includes mining and oil drilling). The new claim will add to the existing of commercial shelf already managed by Argentina and includes the disputed British overseas territories of the Falklands, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands as well as parts of Antarctica that are also disputed by Chile.\nAs of 2016, the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) decided to expand Argentina maritime territory in the South Atlantic Ocean by 35% thus increasing by its territorial waters, fixing the limit of its territory at from its coast. However, this ruling did not increase Argentina's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) which is calculated differently and over which the CLCS has no authority to make a determination. In fact, the CLCS finding is likely to strengthen the UK\u2019s claim to the contested seabed around the islands because the CLCS finding makes it more likely that the seabed between the islands and the Argentine mainland needs to be shared. The UN CLCS ruling included a caveat referencing the unresolved diplomatic dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands.\nOther incidents.\nArgentina, through its Coast Guard and Navy, has been traditionally greatly involved in fishery protection in the Argentine Sea with the first major incidents tracing back to the 1960s when a destroyer fired and holed a Russian trawler and continued through recent years.\nIn November 2006, an Argentine judge issued an arrest warrant for former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and eight other ex-officials in relation to the 1994 bombing of the Jewish-Argentine Mutual Association (AMIA) community center in Buenos Aires which killed 85 people. Iran refused to carry out the arrest demanded by the warrant claiming it to be a \"Zionist plot\". As a result, President N\u00e9stor Kirchner ordered the security forces to be on the alert for incidents similar to the 1994 bombing.\nArgentina has a dispute with neighboring Uruguay about two pulp mills on the Uruguay side of the shared Uruguay River near the Argentine city of Gualeguaych\u00fa. Residents of Gualeguaych\u00fa, concerned about pollution from the mills, blockaded bridges across the river in 2006. The case was brought before the International Court of Justice. Meanwhile, the denial of preliminary measures in July 2006 allowed the mills to begin functioning. An ICJ decision was released in 2010. It found that Uruguay had broken its 1985 treaty obligation to consultant Argentina before building the mills but that Argentine claims of pollution caused by the new mills were not backed by the evidence.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Argentina maintains diplomatic relations with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nHistorical.\nhttps://doi.org/10.4159/harvard.9780674593640"}

It is one of the three main governmental branches of Armenia and is headed by the Prime Minister of Armenia.\nCurrent government.\nThe incumbent government of Armenia is led by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan who, as leader of Civil Contract (the party which won elections in December 2018), was appointed prime minister on 14 January 2019 by President Armen Sarkissian.\nPowers.\nPowers of Government granted by former revision of Constitution (accepted in 2005).\nResignation of the Government and its formation.\nFollowing the Article 55 of Armenian Constitution, the Republic's president must accept resignation of the government on the day of\nLater on the prime minister must be appointed by the president of the Republic. The elected prime minister should enjoy the confidence of majority Deputies and if this is impossible the confidence of maximum number of the deputies. Ministers must be appointed within 20 days after prime minister is appointed. After these the Government is considered to be formed. All the ministers, including the prime minister, must be citizens of the Republic of Armenia. The structure of the Government must be defined by law in regard to recommendation by the Government. The procedure for the organization of operations of the Government and other public administration bodies under the Government must be defined by the decree of the president upon the submission of prime minister.\nThe role of the Prime Minister is that it should supervise the Government activities, coordinate the work of the Ministers and it should adopt decisions on the organization of Government activities. In addition, decisions passed by the Government must be signed by the Prime Minister. The president has the right to suspend Governmental decisions for one month for checking the compliance of decisions with the constitution. Government decisions about appointment or dissolution of the governors must be approved by the President.\nThe president has a right to invite and head government sittings about issues of defence, foreign policy or national security.\nThe mission of government.\nAccording to article 85 of the Armenian constitution, the government shall develop and implement the domestic policy and it should implement foreign policy of the Republic of Armenia jointly with the President of the Republic of Armenia.\nBy virtue of the constitution, the international treaties, the laws of the Republic of Armenia, or the decrees of the President of the Republic and to ensure the implementation thereof the government shall adopt decisions, which shall be subject to observance in the whole territory of the Republic\"\nResponsibilities of the government.\nAs it is defined in the Article 89 of the Constitution of Armenia the government shall:\n1) submit its program to the National Assembly for approval in accordance with Article 74 of the Constitution;\n2) submit the draft state budget to the National Assembly for approval, ensure the execution of the budget and submit financial reports on the budget execution to the National Assembly;\n3) manage the state property;\n4) implement unified state policies in the areas of finances, economy, taxation, loans and credits;\n4.1) implement the state territorial development policy.\n5) implement state policies in the areas of science, education, culture, health, social security and environmental protection;\n6) ensure the implementation of the defense, national security and foreign policies of the Republic;\n7) ensure maintenance of law and order, take measures to strengthen the legal order and ensure rights and freedoms of the citizens;\n8) perform other functions and powers provided by the Constitution and laws.\nProgram and budget.\nThe Article 74 of the Constitution of Armenia states that the government must within twenty days of its formation present its developed program to the National Assembly of the Republic. Later on the National Assembly should discuss and vote for the approval of the program within five days after its presentation. The President shall dissolve the National Assembly if it does not give an approval to the program of the Government two times in succession within two months.\nRegarding state budget, The Government shall submit the draft of the state budget to the National Assembly at least ninety days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. The Government may put forward a motion of its confidence in conjunction with the adoption of the state budget. If the National Assembly does not express no confidence in the Government then the state budget as well as the amendments approved by the Government shall be considered adopted.\nIf the National Assembly expresses no confidence in the Government in conjunction to the draft of the state budget, the new Government shall submit the draft state budget to the National Assembly within a period of ten days after the approval of its program. This draft shall be debated and voted on by the National Assembly within a period of thirty days in accordance with the procedure defined by this Article.\nRestriction on members.\nAccording to Article 88 of Armenian Constitution \"A member of Government can not be engaged in hold an office in commercial organizations or in state and local self-government bodies not connected with his/her duties, or be involved in entrepreneurial activities, save for pedagogical creative, and academic activities.\"\nPowers on local self-governed communities.\nArticles 109 and 110 of Armenian Constitution state that the Government may remove the Head of Community in cases prescribed by the law on the basis of the conclusion of the Constitutional Court. The communities may, based on the interests of the public, be merged with each other or separated by the law. The appropriate law shall be adopted by the National Assembly upon the recommendation of the Government. Before submitting the legislative initiative the Government shall appoint local referendums in those communities. The outcomes of the local referendums shall be attached to the legislative initiative. The communities may be merged or separated irrespective of the outcomes of the local referendums.\nRegional governors.\nBased on Article 88.1, regional governors are appointed and dismissed by decisions of Government and they are validated by the President. The Regional Governors shall pursue the territorial policy of the Government, coordinate the activities of the territorial services of the executive bodies, save for cases prescribed by the law.\nPowers regarding legislative initiatives.\nThe Government has a right of legislative initiative. It has the right to determine the sequence of the debate for its proposed draft legislation and can demand that they be voted only with amendments acceptable to it.\nThe Government may put forward a motion on confidence in the Government in conjunction with the adoption of a draft law proposed by the Government. If within twenty four hours after the Government has raised the question of the vote of confidence a minimum of one third of the total number of Deputies does not put forward a draft resolution on expressing no confidence in the Government or if no resolution on expressing no confidence in the Government is adopted by the majority of the total number of Deputies the draft law proposed by the Government shall be considered adopted. However, the Government can not put the motion on confidence more than two times in any single session.\nLeaders.\nEach of the three Armenian Republics had an executive branch at the time of their existence, each being led by a prime minister.\nChairman of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nThe governmental structure of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was similar to that of the other Soviet republics. It is mentioned in the article 79 of USSR constitution \"The highest executive and administrative organ of state power of a Union Republic is the Council of People's Commissars of the Union Republic\". The council was formed by Supreme Soviet of the Union Republic, which was the only legislative body in a Union Republic and the highest organ of state power. The council consisted of the following positions:\nThe Council issued orders and decisions and supervised their execution. The Council was responsible and accountable to Supreme Soviet of the Union Republic but between the sessions of the Union Republics Supreme Soviet, the Council was responsible and accountable to the Presidium of the same Supreme Soviet. The Council of People's Commissars controlled those branches of state administration that came within the jurisdiction of Union Republic. It issued within the limits of the jurisdiction of their respective People's Commissariats, orders and instructions. The Council of People's Commissariats of a Union Republic were either Union-Republic or Republican Commissariats. Union-Republican controlled those branches of the state administration that were entrusted to them and were subordinate both to the Council of People's Commissars of the Union Republic and to the appropriate Union-Republic People's Commissars of the U.S.S.R.. The Republican Commissariats again directed branches that were entrusted to them but were subordinate only to Council of People's Commissars of the Union Republic.\nPrime Ministers of the First Armenian Republic.\nOn May 30, 1918, Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) decided that Armenia must be a republic under a provisional coalition government. It was decided that the Republic must have its own constitution and self-governing system. The government of the Republic was headed by prime minister. He was chosen by the National Council of Armenia. Later on the prime minister himself formed his cabinet. Prime minister was accountable for international, domestic and regional issues. The first prime minister became Hovhannes Katchaznouni whose cabinet was made up from five members, all of which were from ARF. In addition, a ministry of interior was created, whose first head was Aram Manukian. The ministry of interior was responsible for domestic problems. Its key responsibilities were to create public school system, railroad system, communication and telegraph systems, also it was responsible for enforcing law and order. All these responsibilities were controlled by a specific department, each of which became a separate ministry later on.\nPrime minister had direct involvement in regional and international issues. Hamazasp Ohanjyan, the third prime minister, and Avetis Aharonian left for Berlin trying to reassure the tense relations between Turkey and Armenia. Unfortunately none of them succeeded to accomplish his goal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prescott (born January 21, 1934) is an American developmental psychologist, whose research focused on the origins of violence, particularly as it relates to a lack of mother-child bonding.\nPrescott was a health scientist administrator at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), one of the Institutes of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 1966 to 1980. He created and directed the Developmental Behavioral Biology Program at the NICHD where he initiated NICHD-supported research programs to study the relationship between mother-child bonding and the development of social abilities in adult life. Inspired by Harry Harlow's famous experiments on rhesus monkeys, which established a link between neurotic behavior and isolation from a care-giving mother, Prescott further proposed that a key component to development comes from the somesthetic processes (body touch) and vestibular-cerebellar processes (body movement) induced by mother-child interactions, and that deprivation of this stimulation causes brain abnormalities. By analogy to the neurotic behavior in monkeys, he suggested that these developmental abnormalities are a major cause of adult violence amongst humans.\nPrescott also served as assistant head of the Psychology Branch of the Office of Naval Research (1963 to 1966) and as president of the Maryland Psychological Association (1970 to 1971). In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\nPrescott's findings about origins of child abuse was innovative, groundbreaking, and controversial. In 1978, Hustler Magazine published an article by Prescott with shocking photos of actual abused children. Dr. Prescott supported this publication of his work in order to reach an audience outside of the scientific community. For this, NICHD fired Prescott, and he protested in front of the U.S. Senate and House Appropriations Committee. Prescott testified that \"we are producing more criminals . . . 'by the manner in which we are raising our children ... than we will be able to house in all the prisons that we can build.'\"\nIn 1996, Prescott became one of the original 24 signers of the Ashley Montagu Resolution, a petition to the United Nations World Court to end the genital modification and mutilation of children including circumcision, female genital mutilation, and subincision\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its rate of population growth has been decreasing since 1990, due to a declining birth rate. By 2050 the population is expected to reach approximately 20.2\u00a0million people, at which point it is projected to either stagnate or begin declining. About 85% of the country's population lives in urban areas, with 40% living in Greater Santiago alone. The largest agglomerations according to the 2002 census are Greater Santiago with 5.6\u00a0million people, Greater Concepci\u00f3n with 861,000 and Greater Valpara\u00edso with 824,000.\nPopulation size and structure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the total population was in , compared to only 6,143,000 in 1950.

Studies on the ethnic makeup of Chile differ significantly from one another.\nAccording to censuses from the colonial period, the white population exceeded 70% of the population of Chile (approximately 79% in 1810). http://\nStudies estimates the white population at between 20%, to over 60% of the Chilean population. According to genetic research by the University of Bras\u00edlia, Chilean genetic admixture consists of 51.6% European, 42.1% Amerindian, and 6.3% African ancestry. According to an autosomal genetic study of 2014 carried out among soldiers in the city of Arica, Northern Chile, the European admixture goes from 56.8% in soldiers born in Magallanes to 41.2% for the ones who were born in Tarapac\u00e1. According to a study from 2013, conducted by the \"Candela Project\" in Northern Chile as well, the genetic admixture of Chile is 52% European, 44% Native American, and 4% African.\nA 2007 public health book from the University of Chile states that 65% of the population are Mestizos with predominantly White admixture, with 30% being of Caucasoid origin and Amerindians comprising the remaining 5%. National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) professor of Latin American studies, Francisco Lizcano, estimates that 52.7% of the Chilean population can be classified as culturally European, with 39.3% being Mestizo and the remaining 8% belonging to Amerindian cultures. Other social studies put the total number of Whites at over 60%. According to a study performed in 2014, 37.9% of Chileans self-identified as white, and subsequent DNA tests showed that the average self identifying white was genetically 54% European.\nAccording to a 2012 estimate by the US Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook, the population consists of 88.9% of \"White and non-Indigenous\", with the remaining percentages being Amerindians, except for a 0.3% \"unspecified\".\nThe 2011 Latinobar\u00f3metro survey asked respondents in Chile to identify their race, with the majority (67%) selecting \"white,\" followed by \"mestizo\" (25%), and \"indigenous\" (8%). In a 2002 national poll, the majority of Chileans reported having \"some\" (43.4%) or \"much\" (8.3%) indigenous ancestry, while 40.3% claimed to have none.\nAs of 2002, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, 89% of Chileans were white or mestizo, and 11% were Indigenous. A 2002 national census classified the population as indigenous and non-indigenous rather than as White or Mestizo.\nIndigenous communities.\nThe 1907 census reported 101,118 Indians, or 3.1% of the total country population. Only those that practiced their native culture or spoke their native language were considered, irrespective of their \"racial purity.\"\nAccording to the 2002 census, only indigenous people that still practiced a native culture or spoke a native language were surveyed, and 4.6% of the population (692,192 people) fit that description. Of that 4.6%, 87.3% declared themselves Mapuche. Most of the indigenous population show varying degrees of mixed ancestry.\nChile is one of the twenty-two countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989. It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169. Chile ratified the convention in 2008. In November 2009, a court decision in Chile, considered to be a landmark ruling in indigenous rights concerns, made use of the ILO convention 169. The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upholds rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals, and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.\nChile administers Easter Island a territory 4,100\u00a0km west of the mainland. The Rapa Nui people are native to the island and are Polynesian in origin. About 3,500 live on the island, but around 10,000 came to the mainland in the 20th century.\nEuropean immigration.\nChile \u2013 located far from Europe and difficult to reach \u2013 was never an attractive place for migrants from Europe, a situation recognized in the census of 1907, the census which recorded the highest percentage of Europeans versus the total population of Chile (2.2%).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The observed increase in 1885 is due in large part to the annexation of three provinces after the Pacific War and the final conquest of the Araucan\u00eda. Given that our country receives almost no foreign immigration, this increase is significant, when compared with that of more advanced countries in this regard. The comparative table that follows demonstrates this:\nExcept for those lucky countries that have seen in the last half century flocking to its beaches a huge influx of immigrants, a situation that unfortunately is not ours, the rate of increase of the population of Chile, figures honorably between the rate of the most prosperous countries on Earth.\nEuropean migration in the 19th century did not result in a remarkable change in the ethnic composition of Chile, except in the region of Magellan and the city of Concepcion in the BIO-BIO Region.\nSpain and France was the largest source of European immigration to Chile during the 17th and 18th centuries, specially from the deep southern parts of Andalusia and Extremadura, which contributed to the Chilean ethnogenesis with thousands of peasants who migrated to the fertile lands of the Chilean Central Valley alongside the Basque merchants who started to arrive in the 18th century in great numbers.\nThe largest contingent of people to have arrived in post-independence Chile came from Spain and from the Basque country, a region divided between northern Spain and southern France. Estimates of the number of Chileans who have one or two surnames of Basque origin range from 10% (1,600,000) to as high as 20% (3,200,000). Note that this phenomenon occurs not only in Chile, but also in every Autonomous Community of Spain, as well as in other Latin American countries \u2013 one can see that a substantial portion of their populations have one or two surnames of Basque or Navarre origin, tending to be more common in the upper classes, and hence becoming more unusual in lower classes.\nChile's various waves of non-Spanish immigrants include Italians, Irish, French, Greeks, Germans, English, Scots, Croats, and Poles.\nIn 1848 an important and substantial German immigration took place, laying the foundation for the German-Chilean community. Sponsored by the Chilean government for the colonization of the southern region, the Germans (including German-speaking Swiss, Silesians, Alsatians and Austrians), strongly influenced the cultural and racial composition of the southern provinces of Chile. It is difficult to count the number of descendants of Germans in Chile, given the great amount of time since 1848. Because many areas of southern Chile were sparsely populated, the traces of German immigration there are quite noticeable. An independent estimate calculates that about 500,000 Chileans could descend from German immigrants.\nOther historically significant immigrant groups included Croats, whose descendants today are estimated at 380,000 persons, or 2.4% of the Chilean population. Some authors claim that close to 4.6% of the Chilean population must have some Croatian ancestry. Over 700,000 Chileans (4.5% of the Chilean population) may have British (English, Scottish or Welsh) and Irish forebears. Chileans of Greek descent are estimated to number between 90,000 and 120,000; most live in or near either Santiago or Antofagasta, and Chile is one of the five countries in the world most populated with descendants of Greeks. The descendants of Swiss immigrants add 90,000, and estimates suggest that about 5% of the Chilean population has some French ancestry. 600,000 Chileans descend from Italian immigrants. Other groups of Europeans exist but are found in smaller numbers, such as the descendants of Austrians and Dutchmen (estimated at about 50,000).\nLatin American immigrants.\nSince the reestablishment of democracy in Chile, the former tendency for emigrants from the country to outnumber immigrants to it has reversed. Chile now is one of the two countries in Latin America with a positive migration rate. Since 1990, with the opening of Chile to the world, through a free market system, and the consequent socioeconomic development of the country, has been noted the attraction of a significant number of immigrants from various Latin American countries, which represented in Census 2017, approximately 1,200,000 people, corresponding to 7% of the population residing in the Chilean territory, without counting their descendants born in Chile, due to the effects of the ius soli. Their main origins, corresponds to: 288,233 Venezuelans, 223,923 Peruvians, 179,338 Haitians, 146,582 Colombians, 107,346 Bolivians, 74,713 Argentines, 36,994 Ecuadorians, 18,185 Brazilians, 17,959 Dominicans, 15,837 Cubans and 8,975 Mexicans.\nThis has prompted a change in the physiognomy of certain communes in the country where its number is concentrated. In communes such as Santiago Centro and Independencia, 1/3 of residents is a Latin American immigrant (28% and 31% of the population of these communes, respectively). Other communes of Greater Santiago with high numbers of immigrants are Estaci\u00f3n Central (17%) and Recoleta (16%). In the northern regions such as Antofagasta region, 17.3% of the population is a Latin American foreigner, with communes such as Ollag\u00fce (31%), Mejillones (16%), Sierra Gorda (16%) and Antofagasta (11%), with high percentages of Latin American immigrants, mainly Bolivians, Colombians and Peruvians.\nOther ethnic groups.\nIt is estimated that about 5% of the population (800,000) is descendant of Asian immigrants, chiefly from the Middle East (i.e. Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese, \"see\" Arab Chileans). Most of these are Christians from the Levant, of whom roughly 500,000 are Palestinian descendants, mostly Christians, are believed to reside in Chile. Additionally, about 18,000\u201325,000 Jews reside in Chile.\nIn recent years, Chile has had a growing East Asian population, mainly from China (see Chinese Chilean), but also from Japan (see Japanese Chilean) and South Korea (see Koreans in Chile). The earliest wave of East Asian immigration took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mainly Chinese and Japanese contract laborers.\nThere is a sizable population of Romani people in Chile. They are widely and easily recognized, and continue to hold on to their traditions and language, and many continue to live semi-nomadic lifestyles traveling from city to city and living in small tented communities\nPopulation genetics.\nGenetics studies fluctuate between 57,8% and 67.9% European; between 32.1% and 44.3% Amerindian; and 2.5%\u20146.3% African ancestry percentages. A genetic study by the University of Chile found that the average Chilean's genetic makeup consists of 64% Caucasian and 35% Amerindian ancestry. In a 2014 study of Chilean soldiers stationed in Arica, researchers found that the average self-identifying white person (37.9%) was genetically only 54% European.\nLanguages.\nThe Spanish spoken in Chile is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighbouring South American countries because final syllables and \"s\" sounds are dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.\nThere are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: Mapudungun, Quechua, Aymara and Rapa Nui. After the Spanish invasion, Spanish took over as the lingua franca and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some now extinct or close to extinction.\nGerman is spoken to a great extent in southern Chile, either in small countryside pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities.\nThrough initiatives such as the English Opens Doors program, the government made English mandatory for students in fifth-grade and above in public schools. Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten. Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech. Since 2010, all students from 3rd grade in secondary school have been tested on listening and reading comprehension in English. The evaluation is compulsory and the instrument is Educational Testing Service's TOEIC Bridge.\nReligion.\nChristianity is the most widely professed religion in Chile, with Catholicism being its largest denomination.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Throughout history, there have been many absolute monarchs: some famous examples are Louis XIV of France and Frederick the Great of Prussia.\nAbsolute monarchies today include Brunei, Eswatini, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Vatican City, and the individual emirates composing the United Arab Emirates, which itself is a federation of such monarchies \u2013 a federal monarchy. Although absolute monarchies are sometimes supported by legal documents (such as the King's Law of Denmark\u2013Norway), they are distinct from constitutional monarchies, in which the authority of the monarch is restricted (e.g. by legislature or unwritten customs) or balanced by that of other officials, such as a prime minister, as in the United Kingdom or the Nordic countries.\nAbsolute monarchies are similar to but should not be confused with hereditary dictatorships such as North Korea and Turkmenistan.\nHistorical examples of absolute monarchies.\nOutside Europe.\nIn the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan wielded absolute power over the state and was considered a Padishah or \"Great King\" by his people. Many sultans wielded absolute power through heavenly mandates reflected in their titles, such as \"Shadow of God on Earth\". In ancient Mesopotamia, many rulers of Assyria, Babylonia and Sumer were absolute monarchs as well.\nThroughout Imperial China, many emperors and one empress, Wu Zetian, wielded absolute power through the Mandate of Heaven. In pre-Columbian America, the Inca Empire was ruled by a Sapa Inca, who was considered the son of Inti, the sun god, and was the absolute ruler over the nation. Korea under the Joseon dynasty and the short-lived empire was also an absolute monarchy.\nEurope.\nThroughout much of European history, the divine right of kings was the theological justification for absolute monarchy. Many European monarchs claimed supreme autocratic power by divine right, so that their subjects had no right to limit their power.\nKingdoms of England and Scotland.\nJames VI and I and his son Charles\u00a0I tried to import the principle of divine right into Scotland and England. Charles\u00a0I's attempt to enforce episcopal polity on the Church of Scotland led to rebellion by the Covenanters and the Bishops' Wars. Fears that Charles\u00a0I was attempting to establish absolutist government along European lines was a major cause of the English Civil War, although he did rule this way for 11\u00a0years starting in 1629, after dissolving the Parliament of England for a time.\nDenmark\u2013Norway.\nAbsolutism was underpinned by a written constitution for the first time in Europe in 1665 of Denmark\u2013Norway, which ordered that the Monarch &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone. This law authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power, most importantly the Council of the Realm in Denmark. Absolute monarchy lasted until 1814 in Norway and 1848 in Denmark.\nHabsburgs.\nThe House of Habsburg has been extinct in its male line since the death of the childless Charles II of Spain in 1700. However, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine still carries the female line of the House of Habsburg.\nThe first member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine to rule over the Holy Roman Empire was Joseph II, a sovereign raised during the Enlightenment. Joseph II extended full legal freedom to serfs in 1781. Franz Joseph I of Austria was Emperor of Austria from 1848 until his death in 1916 and was succeeded by Charles I of Austria. Charles I was the last Emperor of Austria and abdicated on 12 November 1918 after Austria-Hungary lost World War I.\nFrance.\nLouis XIV of France (1638\u20131715) is said to have proclaimed . Although often criticized for his extravagances, such as the Palace of Versailles, he reigned over France for a long period.\nThe king of France concentrated legislative, executive, and judicial powers in his person. As the supreme judicial authority he could condemn people to death without the right of appeal. It was his duty both to punish offenses and to stop them from being committed. From his judicial authority followed his power both to make laws and to annul them.\nPrussia.\nIn Brandenburg-Prussia, the concept of absolute monarchy took a notable turn with its emphasis on the monarch as the \"first servant of the state\", but it nonetheless echoed many of the important characteristics of absolutism. Prussia was ruled by the House of Hohenzollern as a feudal monarchy from 1525 to 1701 and as an absolute monarchy from 1701 to 1848, after which it became a federal semi-constitutional monarchy from 1848 to 1918, when the monarchy was abolished during the German Revolution.\nFrederick I was the first \"King in Prussia\", beginning his reign on 18 January 1701. King Frederick the Great adopted the title \"King of Prussia\" in 1772, the same year he annexed most of Royal Prussia in the First Partition of Poland, and practiced enlightened absolutism until his death in 1786. He introduced a general civil code, abolished torture and established the principle that the Crown would not interfere in matters of justice. He also promoted an advanced secondary education, the forerunner of today's German grammar school system, which prepares the most promising students for university studies. The Prussian education system was emulated in various countries, including the United States.\nRussia.\nUntil 1905, the tsars and emperors of Russia governed as absolute monarchs. Ivan IV (\"the Terrible\") was known for his reign of terror through the \"oprichnina\". Following the Time of Troubles in the early 17th century, the traditional alliance of autocratic monarchy, the church, and the aristocracy was widely seen as the only basis for preserving the social order and Russian statehood, which legitimized the rule of the Romanov dynasty. Peter I (\"the Great\") reduced the power of the Russian nobility and strengthened the central power of the monarch, establishing a bureaucracy. This tradition of absolutism was expanded by Catherine II and her descendants.\nRussia became the last European country (excluding Vatican City) to abolish absolutism, and it was the only one to do so as late as the 20th century (the Ottoman Empire drafted its first constitution in 1876). Russia was one of the four continental empires which collapsed after World War I, along with Germany, Austria\u2013Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1918, the Bolsheviks executed the Romanov family, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.\nContemporary trends.\nThe Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the \"Springtime of the Peoples\" or the \"Springtime of Nations\", were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. \nMany nations formerly with absolute monarchies, such as Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco and Qatar, have \"de jure\" moved towards a constitutional monarchy. However, in these cases, the monarch still retains tremendous powers, even to the extent that by some measures, parliament's influence on political life is viewed as negligible or merely consultative.\nIn Nepal, there were several swings between constitutional rule and direct rule related to the Nepalese Civil War, the Maoist insurgency, and the 2001 Nepalese royal massacre, with the Nepalese monarchy being abolished on 28 May 2008.\nIn Tonga, the king had majority control of the Legislative Assembly until 2010.\nLiechtenstein.\nLiechtenstein has moved towards expanding the power of the monarch\u2014the Prince of Liechtenstein was given vast expanded powers after a referendum to amend the Constitution of Liechtenstein in 2003, which led BBC News to describe the prince as an \"absolute monarch again\". The referendum granted the monarch the powers to dismiss the government, nominate judges and veto legislation, among others. Just prior to the referendum, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe published a comprehensive report analysing the amendments, opining that they were not compatible with the European standards of democracy, effectively making Liechtenstein a \"de facto\" absolute monarchy. Prince Hans-Adam II had also previously threatened to leave the country and move his assets out of Liechtenstein if voters had chosen to restrict his powers.\nVatican City.\nVatican City continues to be an absolute monarchy, but is unique because it is also a microstate, ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and elective monarchy. As of 2023, Vatican City has a population of 764 residents (regardless of citizenship). It is the smallest state in the world both by area and by population. The Pope is the absolute monarch of Vatican City, and is elected by a papal conclave with a two-thirds supermajority.\nAs governed by the Holy See, Vatican City State is an sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the Pope, who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. Unlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on \"jus sanguinis\" or \"jus soli\", citizenship of Vatican City is granted on \"jus officii\", namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.\nSaudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, and according to the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia adopted by Royal Decree in 1992, the King must comply with Sharia (Islamic law) and the Quran. The Quran and the body of the Sunnah (traditions of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad) are declared to be the Kingdom's Constitution, but no written modern constitution has ever been promulgated for Saudi Arabia, which remains the only Arab nation where no national elections have ever taken place since its founding. No political parties or national elections are permitted. The Saudi government is the world's most authoritarian regime in 2023 measured by the electoral democracy score of the V-Dem Democracy indices.\nOman.\nOman is an absolute monarchy, with the Sultan of Oman being both head of state and head of government. The Sultan is hereditary, who appoints a cabinet to assist him. The sultan also serves as the supreme commander of the armed forces and prime minister. Oman bans all political parties.\nCurrent absolute monarchs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Denotes subnational monarchy\nScholarship.\nThere is a considerable variety of opinion by historians on the extent of absolutism among European monarchs. Some, such as Perry Anderson, argue that quite a few monarchs achieved levels of absolutist control over their states, while historians such as Roger Mettam dispute the very concept of absolutism. In general, historians who disagree with the appellation of \"absolutism\" argue that most monarchs labeled as \"absolutist\" exerted no greater power over their subjects than any other \"non-absolutist\" rulers, and these historians tend to emphasize the differences between the absolutist rhetoric of monarchs and the realities of the effective use of power by these absolute monarchs. Renaissance historian William Bouwsma summed up this contradiction:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nothing so clearly indicates the limits of royal power as the fact that governments were perennially in financial trouble, unable to tap the wealth of those ablest to pay, and likely to stir up a costly revolt whenever they attempted to develop an adequate income.\u2014\u200a\nAnthropology, sociology, and ethology as well as various other disciplines such as political science attempt to explain the rise of absolute monarchy ranging from extrapolation generally, to certain Marxist explanations in terms of the class struggle as the underlying dynamic of human historical development generally and absolute monarchy in particular.\nIn the 17th century, French legal theorist Jean Domat defended the concept of absolute monarchy in works such as \"On Social Order and Absolute Monarchy\", citing absolute monarchy as preserving natural order as God intended. Other intellectual figures who supported absolute monarchy include Thomas Hobbes and Charles Maurras.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67367", "revid": "32990417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67367", "title": "Mbox", "text": "Family of email-related file formats\nMbox is a generic term for a family of related file formats used for holding collections of email messages. It was first implemented in Fifth Edition Unix.\nAll messages in an mbox mailbox are concatenated and stored as plain text in a single file. Each message starts with the four characters \"From\" followed by a space (the so-called \"From_ line\") and the sender's email address. RFC 4155 defines that a UTC timestamp follows after another separating space character.\nA format similar to mbox is the MH Message Handling System. Other systems, such as Microsoft Exchange Server and the Cyrus IMAP server, store mailboxes in centralized databases managed by the mail system and not directly accessible by individual users. The maildir mailbox format is often cited as an alternative to the mbox format for networked email storage systems.\nMail storage protocols.\nUnlike the Internet protocols used for the exchange of email, the format used for the storage of email has never been formally defined through the RFC standardization mechanism and has been entirely left to the developer of an email client. However, the POSIX standard defined a loose framework in conjunction with the mailx program. In 2005, the application/mbox media type was standardized as RFC 4155, which hinted that mbox stores mailbox messages in their original Internet Message (RFC 2822) format, except for the used newline character, seven-bit clean data storage, and the requirement that each newly added message is terminated with a completely empty line within the mbox database.\nFile locking.\nBecause more than one messages are stored in a single file, some form of file locking is needed to avoid the corruption that can result from two or more processes modifying the mailbox simultaneously. This could happen if a network email delivery program delivers a new message at the same time as a mail reader is deleting an existing message.\nVarious mutually incompatible mechanisms have been used by different mbox formats to enable message file locking, including codice_1 and codice_2. This does not work well with network mounted file systems, such as the Network File System (NFS), which is why traditionally Unix used additional \"dot lock\" files, which could be created atomically even over NFS.\nMbox files should also be locked while they are being read. Otherwise, the reader may see corrupted message contents if another process is modifying the mbox at the same time, even though no actual file corruption occurs.\nAs a patch format.\nIn open source development, it is common to send patches in the diff format to a mailing list for discussion. The diff format allows for irrelevant \"headers\", such as mbox data, to be added. Version control systems like git have support for generating mbox-formatted patches and for sending them to the list as emails in a thread.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67370", "revid": "36449898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67370", "title": "David O. Selznick", "text": "American film producer (1902\u20131965)\nDavid O. Selznick (born David Selznick; May 10, 1902\u00a0\u2013 June 22, 1965) was an American film producer, screenwriter and film studio executive who produced \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) and \"Rebecca\" (1940), both of which earned him an Academy Award for Best Picture. He also won the Irving Thalberg Award at the 12th Academy Awards, Hollywood's top honor for a producer, in recognition of his shepherding \"Gone with the Wind\" through a long and troubled production and into a record-breaking blockbuster.\nThe son and son-in-law of movie moguls Lewis J. Selznick and Louis B. Mayer, Selznick served as head of production at R.K.O. Radio Pictures and went on to become one of the first independent movie producers. His first wife was Mayer's daughter Irene Selznick, who became a highly successful Broadway producer after their divorce, and his second wife was Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Jones.\nEarly life.\nSelznick was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Florence Anna (n\u00e9e Sachs) and Lewis J. Selznick, a silent film producer and distributor of Jewish origin. His father was born in the Russian Empire in 1870.\nDavid had three siblings, including his brother Myron, also a film producer and later a talent agent. David Selznick added the \"O\" to distinguish himself from an uncle with the same name, and because he thought it had flair. The \"O\" stands for nothing, and he never had his name legally changed to incorporate it.\nHe studied at Columbia University in New York City and started training as an apprentice for his father until the elder's bankruptcy in 1923. In 1926, Selznick moved to Hollywood, and with the help of his father's connections, he gained a job as an assistant story editor at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He left MGM for Paramount Pictures in 1928, where he worked until 1931. While at Paramount he married Irene Gladys Mayer, daughter of MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer.\nStint at RKO.\nDavid Sarnoff, head of RKO, hired Selznick as Head of Production in October 1931. In addition to implementing rigorous cost-control measures, Selznick championed the unit production system, which gave the producers of individual movies much greater independence than they had under the prevailing central producer system. \"Under the factory system of production you rob the director of his individualism\", said Selznick, \"and this being a creative industry that is harmful to the quality of the product made.\" Instituting unit production, he predicted, would also result in cost savings of 30\u201340 percent.\nTo make films under the new system, Selznick recruited prize behind-the-camera personnel, such as director George Cukor and producer/director Merian C. Cooper, and gave producer Pandro S. Berman, aged twenty-six, increasingly important projects. Selznick discovered and signed a young actress who was quickly counted as one of the studio's big stars, Katharine Hepburn. John Barrymore was also enlisted for a few memorable performances.\nSelznick spent a mere fifteen months as RKO production chief, resigning over a dispute with new corporate president Merlin Aylesworth concerning creative control. One of his last acts at RKO was to approve a screen test for a thirty-three-year-old, balding Broadway song-and-dance man named Fred Astaire. In a memo, Selznick wrote, \"I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is ... tremendous\".\nSelznick's tenure was widely considered masterful: In 1931, before he arrived, the studio had produced forty-two features for $16 million in total budgets. In 1932, under Selznick, forty-one features were made for $10.2 million, with clear improvement in quality and popularity. He backed several major successes, including \"A Bill of Divorcement\" (1932), with Cukor directing Hepburn's debut, and the monumental \"King Kong\" (1933)\u2014largely Merian Cooper's brainchild, brought to life by the astonishing special effects work of Willis H. O'Brien.\nReturn to MGM.\nIn 1933, he returned to MGM where his father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer, was studio CEO. Mayer established a second prestige production unit for Selznick, parallel to that of Irving Thalberg, who was in poor health. Selznick's unit output included the all-star cast movie \"Dinner at Eight\" (1933), \"David Copperfield\" (1935), \"Anna Karenina\" (1935), and \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1935).\nGreta Garbo's contract with MGM supposedly provided that only Selznick or Thalberg could produce her pictures for the studio. When Selznick later announced his departure from MGM, Garbo asked him to stay, offering to allow him the exclusive right to produce her films. Selznick declined the offer.\nSelznick International Pictures.\nSelznick longed to be an independent producer with his own studio. In 1935, he realized that goal by leasing RKO's Culver City studios and back lot, forming Selznick International Pictures, and distributing his films through United Artists. His successes continued with classics such as \"The Garden of Allah\" (1936), \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1937), \"A Star Is Born\" (1937), \"Nothing Sacred\" (1937), \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1938), \"The Young in Heart\" (1938), \"Made for Each Other\" (1939), \"Intermezzo\" (1939) and \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), which remains the highest-grossing film of all time (adjusted for inflation). \"Gone with the Wind\" won eight Oscars and two special awards. Selznick also won the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award that same year.\nThe following year, he produced his second-Best Picture Oscar winner, \"Rebecca\" (1940), the first Hollywood production of British director Alfred Hitchcock. Selznick had brought Hitchcock over from England, launching the director's American career. \"Rebecca\" was Hitchcock's only film to win Best Picture.\nLater productions.\nAfter \"Rebecca\", Selznick closed Selznick International Pictures and took some time off. His business activities included the loan of his contracted artists to other studios, including Alfred Hitchcock, Ingrid Bergman, Vivien Leigh and Joan Fontaine. He formed The Selznick Studio and returned to producing pictures with \"Since You Went Away\" (1944), which he also wrote. He followed that with the Hitchcock films \"Spellbound\" (1945) and \"The Paradine Case\" (1947), as well as \"Portrait of Jennie\" (1948) with Jennifer Jones.\nHe also developed film projects and sold the packages to other producers. Among the movies that he developed but then sold was Hitchcock's \"Notorious\" (1946). In 1949, he co-produced the Carol Reed picture \"The Third Man\" with Alexander Korda.\n\"Gone with the Wind\" overshadowed the rest of Selznick's career. Later, he was convinced that he had wasted his life trying to outdo it. A major effort to was \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946), which featured future wife Jennifer Jones in the role of the primary character Pearl. With a huge budget, the film is known for causing moral upheaval because of the then risqu\u00e9 script written by Selznick. And though it was a troublesome shoot with a number of directors, the film would be a major success. The film was the second highest-grossing film of 1947 and was the first movie that Martin Scorsese saw, inspiring Scorsese's own directorial career.\n\"I stopped making films in 1948 because I was tired,\" Selznick later wrote. \"I had been producing, at the time, for twenty years...Additionally it was crystal clear that the motion-picture business was in for a terrible beating from television and other new forms of entertainment, and I thought it a good time to take stock and to study objectively the obviously changing public tastes...Certainly I had no intention of staying away from production for nine years.\" Selznick spent most of the 1950s nurturing the career of his second wife, Jennifer Jones. His last film, the big budget production \"A Farewell to Arms\" (1957) starring Jones and Rock Hudson, was ill-received. But in 1954, he ventured into television, producing a two-hour extravaganza called \"Light's Diamond Jubilee,\" which, in true Selznick fashion, made TV history by being telecast simultaneously on all four TV networks: CBS, NBC, ABC, and DuMont.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1928, Selznick began an on-again off-again affair with Jean Arthur, one of the actresses under contract at Paramount while he was an executive there. Simultaneously he was dating Irene Gladys Mayer, daughter of MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer.\nIn 1930, Selznick married Mayer and after living in a series of rented houses they moved into an estate in Beverly Hills, California. It was purchased for them by Mayer's father and designed by architect Roland Coate in 1933\u20131934. They separated in 1945 and divorced in 1948. They had two sons, Jeffrey Selznick (1932\u20131997) and Daniel Selznick (1936\u20132024). Daniel, who died in August 2024, would serve as an executive at Universal Pictures for four years and also produced the television mini-series \"Blood Feud\" and Hoover vs. The Kennedys, among others, and theatrical productions such \"The Man with the Perfect Wife\".\nIn 1949, he married actress Jennifer Jones, whom he had discovered early in her career and mentored. They had one daughter, Mary Jennifer Selznick (1954\u20131976), who died by suicide by jumping from a 22nd-floor window in Los Angeles on May 11, 1976.\nSelznick was an amphetamine user, and often dictated long, rambling memos to his directors, writers, investors, staff and stars. The documentary \"Shadowing The Third Man\" relates that Selznick introduced \"The Third Man\" director Carol Reed to the use of amphetamines, which allowed Reed to bring the picture in below budget and on schedule by filming nearly 22 hours at a time.\nSelznick was a Republican. On October 18, 1944, the Hollywood Committee, led by Selznick and Cecil B. DeMille, held the Hollywood for Dewey Rally in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket, as well as Governor Earl Warren of California, who was Dewey's running mate in 1948. The gathering drew 93,000, with Lionel Barrymore as the master of ceremonies and short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney.\nAccusations of sexual abuse.\nSelznick International Pictures employee Anita Colby warned Shirley Temple to be careful if she \"found Selznick in stockings\". Temple wrote in her autobiography \"Child Star\" that this gave her \"the impression that casual sex could be a condition of employment\" with Selznick. When she was 17, he locked Temple in his office and unsuccessfully attempted to rape her. About the incident Temple wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Coming around my side of the desk, he reached and took my hand in his. Glancing down, I saw the telltale stocking feet. Pulling free, I turned for the door, but even more quickly he reached back over the edge of his desk and flicked a switch I had learned from Colby was a remote door-locking device. I was trapped. Like the cartoon of wolf and piglet, once again we circled and reversed directions around his furniture. Blessed with the agility of a young dancer and confronted by an amorous but overweight producer, I had little difficulty avoiding passionate clumsiness.\nPortrayals in film and television.\nJonathan Shields, the lead character in the 1952 film \"The Bad and the Beautiful\", was loosely based on Selznick, to the point that Selznick contemplated suing the makers of the film for defamation.\nTony Curtis plays Selznick in the 1980 TV movie \"The Scarlett O'Hara War\".\nRon Berglas appears as Selznick in the TV movie \"RKO 281\" (1999). Toby Leonard Moore plays Selznick in the 2020 film \"Mank\". Both films are dramatizations of the events surrounding the making of \"Citizen Kane\".\nSelznick appears as a character in the second season of the anthology series \"Feud\", \"\". He is portrayed by actor Scott Zimmerman.\nDeath.\nSelznick died on June 22, 1965, at age 63 following several heart attacks, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. There he joined his older brother Myron Selznick (who had died in 1944) in the family crypt.\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, David O. Selznick has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Blvd in front of the historic Hollywood Roosevelt hotel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was written and directed by Jonathan Lynn, who co-wrote the story with John Landis. It features an ensemble cast, including Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, and Lesley Ann Warren.\nThe film has multiple different endings. Each of three possibilities were screened at different theaters, and home media releases include all of them. The film initially received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office, grossing $15 million in the United States against a budget of $15 million, but later developed a cult following.\nPlot.\nIn 1954, six strangers are invited to a secluded New England mansion. Each guest is greeted by the butler Wadsworth and the maid Yvette and receives a pseudonym to maintain confidentiality: \"Colonel Mustard\", \"Mrs. White\", \"Mrs. Peacock\", \"Mr. Green\", \"Professor Plum\", and \"Miss Scarlet\". During dinner, they discover they all hold government influence before being joined by Mr. Boddy, who has been blackmailing everyone for some time. Wadsworth has called the police to arrest Boddy, but Boddy threatens to expose everyone's secrets if they turn him in. He then presents the six guests with weapons\u2014a candlestick, rope, lead pipe, wrench, revolver, and dagger\u2014and suggests someone kill Wadsworth to protect their secrets before turning out the lights. After a gunshot rings out, Boddy is found on the floor, seemingly dead.\nAs the guests investigate Boddy's death, Wadsworth explains how he became indentured to Boddy and summoned the guests, hoping to force a confession from the group and turn one of them over to the police. As the group suspect the cook, only to find she was fatally stabbed with the dagger, someone discovers Boddy is alive before killing him with the candlestick. Wadsworth locks the weapons in a cupboard, but before he can throw away the key, a stranded motorist arrives, and Wadsworth locks him in the lounge before throwing a key out the front door. The group draw lots to pair up before searching the manor. However, someone burns the blackmail evidence, unlocks the cupboard, and kills the motorist with the wrench. Discovering a secret passage, Mustard and Scarlet find themselves locked in the lounge with the motorist's corpse. When they scream for help, Yvette shoots the door open with the revolver. The group deduces that Wadsworth threw out the wrong key and the murderer pickpocketed the cupboard key from him.\nA cop investigating the motorist's abandoned car arrives to use the phone. The mansion receives a call from FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, which Wadsworth takes alone. After successfully distracting the cop and concealing the bodies, the group resumes their search until someone turns off the electricity. In the darkness, Yvette, the cop, and an arriving singing telegram girl are murdered with the rope, pipe, and revolver, respectively. Wadsworth restores the power and gathers the group, having deduced what happened. Recreating the night's events and amidst a brief interruption from an evangelist, he explains how the other five victims were Boddy's informants who are each connected to one of the guests, which dovetails into one of three possible outcomes.\n\"How It Could Have Happened\".\nYvette murdered the cook and Boddy under orders from Scarlet, who then killed Yvette and the other victims. Intending to sell the guests' secrets, Scarlet prepares to use the revolver to kill Wadsworth, who argues there are no bullets left before disarming her just as law enforcement raid the manor and the evangelist is revealed to be the chief of police. Wadsworth further reveals he is an undercover FBI agent before accidentally firing the last bullet in the revolver at a chandelier, which narrowly misses Mustard as it falls.\n\"How About This?\".\nPeacock killed all the victims to prevent her exposure for taking bribes from foreign powers before holding the others at gunpoint to escape. To the others' confused relief, Wadsworth reveals he is an undercover FBI agent. Peacock is arrested outside before law enforcement raid the manor and the evangelist is revealed to be the chief of police.\n\"Here's What Really Happened\".\nApart from Green, everyone committed one murder: Peacock killed the cook, Plum killed Boddy, Mustard killed the motorist, Scarlet killed the cop, White killed Yvette, and Wadsworth killed the singing telegram girl. Holding the guests at gunpoint, Wadsworth reveals he is the real Boddy, Plum killed the real butler, and announces his intent to continue blackmailing them. However, Green draws his own revolver and kills Boddy. He then reveals he is an undercover FBI agent sent to investigate Boddy before letting in law enforcement and the evangelist, who is revealed to be the chief of police, to arrest everyone.\nCast.\nAdditionally, Howard Hesseman makes an uncredited appearance as the Chief of Police who works undercover as an evangelist.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nProducer Debra Hill initially acquired the rights to adapt the game from Parker Brothers and intended to distribute through Universal Pictures. As early as 1981, Hill mentioned plans to adapt the game into a movie, with P. D. James reported to be writing the screenplay with multiple endings.\nScreenplay.\nThe multiple endings were developed by John Landis, who had initially been set to direct, and who claimed in an interview to have invited playwright Tom Stoppard, writer and composer Stephen Sondheim, and actor Anthony Perkins to write the screenplay. The script was ultimately finished by Jonathan Lynn, who was invited to direct as a result.\nA fourth ending was written for the film; according to Lynn, \"It really wasn't very good. I looked at it, and I thought, 'No, no, no, we've got to get rid of that.'\" In it, Wadsworth committed all the murders, and reveals he poisoned the champagne, leaving no witnesses when the six guests soon die. The officers arrive and capture Wadsworth, but he breaks free and steals a police car, though his escape is ultimately thwarted when three police dogs lunge from the back seat.\nCasting.\nCarrie Fisher was originally cast to portray Miss Scarlet, but withdrew to enter treatment for drug and alcohol addiction; she was replaced with Lesley Ann Warren. Jonathan Lynn's first choice for Wadsworth was Leonard Rossiter, but he died before filming commenced. The second choice was Rowan Atkinson, but it was decided that he was not sufficiently well known at the time, so Tim Curry was cast. The entire cast received the same salary and billing, despite their different levels of notability at the time.\nFilming.\n\"Clue\" was filmed on sound stages 17 and 18 at the Paramount Pictures film studios in Hollywood. The set design is credited to Les Gobruegge, Gene Nollmanwas, and William B. Majorand, with set decoration by Thomas L. Roysden. To decorate the interior sets, authentic 18th- and 19th-century furnishings were rented from private collectors, including the estate of Theodore Roosevelt. After completion, the set was bought by the producers of \"Dynasty\", who used it as the fictional hotel The Carlton.\nAll interior scenes were filmed at the Paramount lot, except the ballroom scene. The ballroom and two driveway exteriors were filmed on location at a mansion in South Pasadena, California. This site was destroyed in a fire on October 5, 2005. The driveway and fountain were recreated on the Paramount lot and used for most shots, including the guests' arrivals. Exterior shots of the South Pasadena mansion were enhanced with matte paintings to make the house appear much larger; these were executed by matte artist Syd Dutton in consultation with Albert Whitlock.\nJonathan Lynn screened \"His Girl Friday\" for the cast as inspiration for how to deliver their lines. Madeline Kahn improvised her monologue about \"flames.\"\nRelease.\nThe film was released theatrically on December 13, 1985. Each theater received one of the three endings, and some theaters announced which ending the viewer would see.\nTo mark the film's 40th anniversary, a three-day theatrical exhibition in August 2025 screened a different ending each day.\nNovelizations.\nThe novelization based on the screenplay is by Michael McDowell. Landis, Lynn, and Ann Matthews wrote the youth adaptation \"Clue: The Storybook\". Both adaptations were published in 1985, and feature a fourth ending cut from the film: in a variation on the-butler-did-it trope, Wadsworth explains how he killed Boddy and the other victims, then reveals to the guests that they've all been poisoned, leaving no witnesses to his perfect crime. As Wadsworth proceeds to disable the phones, the police chief (having previously posed as an evangelist) returns with a squad of officers who disarm Wadsworth. He nonetheless manages to escape, and attempts to get away in a police car, only to crash after Dobermanns attack from the back seat.\nHome media.\nThe film was released to home video for both VHS and Betamax videocassette formats in Canada and the United States on August 20, 1986, and to other countries on February 11, 1991. It was released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment on June 17, 2000, and on Blu-ray by Paramount Home Media Distribution on August 7, 2012.\nShout! Factory released a 4K UHD Blu-ray collector's edition of \"Clue\" on December 12, 2023, including new interviews with director Jonathan Lynn and production manager Jeffrey Chernov.\nHome video, television broadcast, and digital streaming releases include all three endings shown sequentially, with two characterized as possible endings and the third being the accurate account. DVD and Blu-ray versions offer viewers the option to watch a single ending (chosen randomly) or the \"home entertainment version\" with all three endings stitched together.\nSoundtrack.\nLa-La Land Records released the John Morris score as a limited-edition CD soundtrack in February 2011. For the film's 30th anniversary in 2015, Mondo issued a limited-edition 180-gram vinyl pressed on six different character-themed color variants. A vinyl reissue from Enjoy The Ride Records followed in 2022.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nThe film initially received mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" panned it, writing that the beginning \"is the only part of the film that is remotely engaging. After that, it begins to drag\". Similarly, Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \"\"Clue\" offers a few big laughs early on followed by a lot of characters running around on a treadmill to nowhere.\" Siskel particularly criticized the decision to release the film to theaters with three separate endings, calling it a \"gimmick\" that would distract audiences from the rest of the film, and concluding, \"\"Clue\" is a movie that needs three different middles rather than three different endings.\"\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that it has a \"promising\" cast but the \"screenplay is so very, very thin that [the actors] spend most of their time looking frustrated, as if they'd just been cut off right before they were about to say something interesting\". On \"Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies\", both agreed that the \"A\" ending was the best while the \"C\" ending was the worst.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A robust ensemble of game actors elevate \"Clue\" above its schematic source material, but this farce's reliance on novelty over organic wit makes its entertainment value a roll of the dice.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\nBox office.\n\"Clue\" has grossed $14.6 million in North America, just short of its $15 million budget.\nRemake.\nPrevious plans for a remake or reboot have languished for years. Initially Gore Verbinski was developing a new \"Clue\" film in 2009, which was dropped by Universal Studios in 2011. Hasbro Studios moved the project to 20th Century Fox by August 2016, envisioned as a \"worldwide mystery\" with action-adventure elements, potentially establishing a franchise with international appeal. Ryan Reynolds optioned a three-year first-look deal in January 2018, planning to star in the remake, with a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Jason Bateman was briefly attached to the film in September 2019, followed by James Bobin attached as director in February 2020, with Oren Uziel hired to rewrite the script in August 2022. Hasbro Entertainment sought new rights arrangements for \"Clue\" in 2024, and established deals with TriStar Pictures and Sony Pictures Television for new screen adaptations of the board game. Screenwriter Shay Hatten has been in talks for the new film script.\nStage adaptations.\nThe screenplay was adapted from film to stage in 2017 by the original screenwriter Jonathan Lynn. \"\" premiered in 2017 at Bucks County Playhouse, adapted by Hunter Foster with additional material by Eric Price. It was directed by Foster and starred Sally Struthers and Erin Dilly. A revised adaptation by Sandy Rustin, incorporating material from Foster and Price, was first performed in 2020. Rustin's adaptation was described as \"a welcome throwback to an era of physical comedy\". The stage adaptations have been performed widely.\nA national tour of the mystery-comedy play launched in 2024, directed by Casey Hushion.\nIn other media.\nThe 2013 \"Psych\" episode \"100 Clues\" features \"Clue\" stars Martin Mull, Christopher Lloyd, and Lesley Ann Warren as suspects in a series of murders at a mansion. The episode, in addition to many jokes and themes in homage to the film, includes multiple endings in which the audience (separately for East and West Coast viewership) decides who is the real killer. The episode was dedicated to the memory of Madeline Kahn.\nWarren guest starred on a 2019 episode of Mull's sitcom \"The Cool Kids\" as a love interest for his character. Her role announcement in November 2018 was initially touted by the press as a \"Clue\" reunion, though only Mull and Warren appear.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over the course of her career that spanned more than five decades, she was nominated for an Academy Award five times, including one win for Best Actress, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.\nA native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Jones worked as a model in her youth before transitioning to acting, appearing in two serial films in 1939. Her third role was a lead part as Bernadette Soubirous in \"The Song of Bernadette\" (1943), which earned her the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Actress. She went on to star in several films that garnered her significant critical acclaim and a further three Academy Award nominations in the mid-1940s, including \"Since You Went Away\" (1944), \"Love Letters\" (1945) and \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946).\nIn 1949, Jones married film producer David O. Selznick and appeared as the eponymous Madame Bovary in Vincente Minnelli's 1949 adaptation. She appeared in several films throughout the 1950s, including \"Ruby Gentry\" (1952), John Huston's adventure comedy \"Beat the Devil\" (1953) and Vittorio De Sica's drama \"Terminal Station\" (1953). Jones earned her fifth Academy Award nomination for her performance as a Eurasian doctor in \"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing\" (1955). After Selznick's death in 1965, Jones married industrialist Norton Simon and entered semi-retirement. She made her final film appearance in \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), a performance which earned her a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture.\nJones suffered from mental-health problems during her life. After her 22 year-old daughter, Mary Jennifer Selznick, took her own life in 1976, Jones became deeply involved in mental health education. In 1980, she founded the Jennifer Jones Simon Foundation for Mental Health and Education. Jones enjoyed a quiet retirement, living the last six years of her life in Malibu, California, where she died of natural causes in 2009 at the age of 90.\nBiography.\n1919\u20131939: Early life.\nJones was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on March 2, 1919, the daughter of Flora Mae (n\u00e9e Suber) and Phillip Ross Isley. Her father was originally from Georgia, and her mother was a native of Sacramento, California. She was an only child, and she was raised Catholic. Her parents, both aspiring stage actors, toured the Midwest in a traveling tent show that they owned and operated. Jones accompanied them, performing on occasion as part of the Isley Stock Company.\nIn 1925, Jones enrolled at Edgemere Public School in Oklahoma City, then attended Monte Cassino, a Catholic girls school and junior college in Tulsa. After graduating, she enrolled as a drama major at Northwestern University in Illinois, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority before transferring to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City in September 1937. It was there that she met and fell in love with fellow acting student Robert Walker, a native of Ogden, Utah, and left school. They married on January 2, 1939.\nJones and Walker returned to Tulsa for a 13-week radio program arranged by her father and then moved to Hollywood. She landed two small roles, first in the 1939 John Wayne Western \"New Frontier\", which she filmed in the summer of 1939 for Republic Pictures. Her second project was the serial titled \"Dick Tracy's G-Men\" (1939), also for Republic. In both films, she was credited as Phylis Isley. After failing a screen test for Paramount Pictures, she became disenchanted with Hollywood and returned to New York City.\n1940\u20131948: Career beginnings.\nShortly after Jones married Walker, she gave birth to two sons: Robert Walker Jr. (1940\u20132019), and Michael Walker (1941\u20132007). While Walker found steady work in radio programs, Jones worked part-time modeling hats for the Powers Agency, and posing for \"Harper's Bazaar\" while looking for acting jobs. When she learned of auditions for the lead role in Rose Franken's hit play \"Claudia\" in the summer of 1941, she presented herself to David O. Selznick's New York office but fled in tears after what she thought was a bad reading. However, Selznick had overheard her audition and was impressed enough to have his secretary call her back. Following an interview, she was signed to a seven-year contract.\nShe was carefully groomed for stardom and given a new name: Jennifer Jones. Director Henry King was impressed by her screen test as Bernadette Soubirous for \"The Song of Bernadette\" (1943), and she won the coveted role over hundreds of applicants. In 1944, on her 25th birthday, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Bernadette, her third screen role.\nSimultaneously to her rise in prominence for \"The Song of Bernadette\", Jones began an affair with producer Selznick. She separated from Walker in November 1943, co-starred with him in \"Since You Went Away\" (1944), and formally divorced him in June 1945. For her performance in \"Since You Went Away\", she was nominated for her second Academy Award, this time for Best Supporting Actress. She earned a third successive Academy Award nomination for her performance with Joseph Cotten in \"Love Letters\" (1945).\nJones's saintly image from her first starring role was starkly contrasted three years later when she was cast as a biracial woman in Selznick's controversial \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946), in which she portrayed a mixed-race indigenous (mestiza) orphan in Texas who falls in love with a white man (Gregory Peck). \nAlso in 1946, she starred as the title character in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic comedy \"Cluny Brown\" as a working-class English woman who falls in love just before World War II. She next appeared in the fantasy film \"Portrait of Jennie\" (1948), again costarring with Cotten. The film was based on the novella of the same name by Robert Nathan. However, it was a commercial failure, grossing only $1.5 million against a $4 million budget.\n1949\u20131964: Marriage to Selznick.\nJones married Selznick at sea on July 13, 1949, en route to Europe after a five-year relationship. Over the following two decades, she appeared in numerous films that he produced, and they established a working relationship. In 1949, Jones starred opposite John Garfield in John Huston's adventure film \"We Were Strangers\". Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" felt that Jones's performance was lacking, noting: \"There is neither understanding nor passion in the stiff, frigid creature she achieves.\" She was subsequently cast as the title character of Vincente Minnelli's \"Madame Bovary\" (1949), a role originally intended for Lana Turner that Turner declined. \"Variety\" deemed the film \"interesting to watch, but hard to feel,\" although it noted that \"Jones answers to every demand of direction and script.\" In 1950, Jones starred in the Powell and Pressburger-directed fantasy \"Gone to Earth\" as a superstitious gypsy woman in the English countryside.\nJones next starred in William Wyler's drama \"Carrie\" (1952) with Laurence Olivier. Crowther criticized her performance, writing: \"Mr. Olivier gives the film its closest contact with the book, while Miss Jones' soft, seraphic portrait of Carrie takes it furthest away.\" Also in 1952, she costarred with Charlton Heston in \"Ruby Gentry\", playing a \"femme fatale\" in rural North Carolina who becomes embroiled in a murder conspiracy after marrying a local man. The role was previously offered to Joan Fontaine, who felt that she was \"unsuited to play backwoods.\" In its review, \"Variety\" deemed the film a \"sordid drama [with] neither Jennifer Jones nor Charlton Heston gaining any sympathy in their characters.\"\nIn 1953, Jones was cast opposite Montgomery Clift in Italian director Vittorio De Sica's \"Terminal Station\" (), a drama set in Rome about a romance between an American woman and an Italian man. The film, produced by Selznick, had a troubled production history, and Selznick and De Sica clashed over the screenplay and tone of the film. Clift sided with De Sica and reportedly called Selznick \"an interfering fuck-face\" on set. Aside from the tensions between cast and crew, Jones was mourning the recent death of her first husband Robert Walker, and also missed her two sons, who were staying in Switzerland during production. \"Terminal Station\" was screened at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival and was released in a heavily truncated form in the United States with the title \"Indiscretion of an American Wife\". Also in 1953, Jones teamed again with director John Huston to star in his film \"Beat the Devil\" (1953), an adventure comedy costarring Humphrey Bogart. The film was a box-office flop and was critically panned upon release, and Bogart distanced himself from it. However, it was reevaluated in later years by critics such as Roger Ebert, who included it in his list of \"Great Movies\" and cited it as the first \"camp\" film. In August 1954, Jones gave birth to her third child, daughter Mary Jennifer Selznick.\nJones was cast as Chinese-born doctor Han Suyin in the drama \"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing\" (1955), a role that brought her fifth Academy Award nomination. Crowther lauded her performance as \"... lovely and intense. Her dark beauty reflects sunshine and sadness.\" Next, she starred as a schoolteacher in \"Good Morning, Miss Dove\" (1955), followed by a lead role in \"The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\", a drama about a World War II veteran.\nIn 1957, she starred as the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the historical drama \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\", based on the 1930 play by Rudolf Besier. She next played the lead role in the Ernest Hemingway adaptation \"A Farewell to Arms\" (1957). The film received mixed reviews, with \"Variety\" noting that \"the relationship between Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones never takes on real dimensions.\" Jones's next project came five years later with the F. Scott Fitzgerald adaptation \"Tender Is the Night\" (1962).\n1965\u20132009: Later life and activities.\nSelznick died at age 63 on June 22, 1965, and after his death, Jones semiretired from acting. Her first role in four years was a lead part in the British drama \"The Idol\" (1966) as the mother of an adult son in Swinging Sixties London who has an affair with his best friend. \nIn 1966, Jones made a rare theatrical appearance in the revival of Clifford Odets' \"The Country Girl\", costarring Rip Torn, at New York's City Center. On November 9, 1967, the same day on which her close friend Charles Bickford died of a blood infection, Jones attempted suicide. Informing her physician of her intention to jump from a cliff overlooking Malibu Beach, she swallowed barbiturates before walking to the base of the cliff, where she was found unconscious amidst the rocky surf. According to biographer Paul Green, it was news of Bickford's death that triggered Jones's suicide attempt. She was hospitalized in a coma from the incident. She returned to film with \"Angel, Angel, Down We Go\" in 1969, about a teenage girl who uses her association with a rock band to manipulate her family.\nOn May 29, 1971, Jones married her third husband Norton Simon, a multimillionaire industrialist, art collector and philanthropist from Portland, Oregon. The wedding took place aboard a tugboat five miles off the English coast and was conducted by Unitarian minister Eirion Phillips. Years before, Simon had attempted to buy the portrait of Jones that was used in the film \"Portrait of Jennie\". Simon later met Jones at a party hosted by fellow industrialist and art collector Walter Annenberg. Jones's last film appearance came in the disaster film \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974). Her performance as a doomed resident in the eponymous skyscraper earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Early scenes in the film showed paintings lent to the production by the art gallery of Jones's husband Simon.\nOn May 11, 1976, Jones's 21-year-old daughter, Mary, a student at Occidental College, died by suicide by jumping from the roof of a 22-floor apartment hotel in downtown Los Angeles. This led to Jones's interest in mental health issues. In 1979, with husband Simon (whose son Robert died by suicide in 1969), she founded the Jennifer Jones Simon Foundation for Mental Health and Education, which she ran until 2003. One of Jones's primary goals with the foundation was to destigmatize mental illness. In 1980, Jones said: \"I cringe when I admit I've been suicidal, had mental problems, but why should I? I hope we can reeducate the world to see there's no more need for stigma in mental illness than there is for cancer.\" She also divulged that she had been a psychotherapy patient since age 24.\nJones spent the remainder of her life outside of the public eye. Four years before the death of her husband Simon in June 1993, he resigned as president of Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California, and Jones was appointed chairman of the board of trustees, president and executive officer. In 1996, she began working with architect Frank Gehry and landscape designer Nancy Goslee Power to renovate the museum and gardens. She remained active as the director of the museum until 2003, when she was awarded emerita status.\nPersonal life.\nJones suffered from shyness for much of her life and avoided discussing her past and personal life with journalists. She was also averse to discussing critical analysis of her work. Public discussion of her working relationship with Selznick often overshadowed her career. Biographer Paul Green contends that, while Selznick helped facilitate her career and sought roles for her, \"Jones excelled because she not only possessed outstanding beauty but she also possessed genuine talent.\"\nDeath.\nJones enjoyed a quiet retirement, living with her eldest child, son Robert Walker Jr., and his family in Malibu for the last six years of her life. Jones's younger son, actor Michael Ross Walker, died from cardiac arrest on December 23, 2007, at age 66, while Robert Jr. died on December 5, 2019, at age 79.\nJones participated in Gregory Peck's AFI Life Achievement Award ceremony in 1989 and appeared at the 70th (1998) and 75th (2003) Academy Awards as part of the shows' tributes to past Oscar winners. In the last six years of her life, she granted no interviews and rarely appeared in public. She died of natural causes on December 17, 2009, at age 90. She was cremated and her ashes were interred with her second husband in the Selznick private room at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\nMinor planet 6249 Jennifer is named in her honor.\nAwards and nominations.\nAcademy Awards\nGolden Globe Awards\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Leo IX is considered to be one of the most historically significant popes of the Middle Ages; he was instrumental in the precipitation of the Great Schism of 1054, considered the turning point in which the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches formally separated.\nLeo IX favoured traditional morality in his reformation of the Catholic Church. One of his first public acts was to hold the Easter synod of 1049; he joined Emperor Henry III in Saxony and accompanied him to Cologne and Aachen. He also summoned a meeting of the higher clergy in Reims, in which several important reforming decrees were passed. At Mainz, he held a council at which the Italian and French as well as the German clergy were represented, and ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor were present. Here too, simony and clerical marriage were the principal matters dealt with. He is regarded as a saint by the Catholic Church; his feast day is celebrated on 19 April.\nEarly life.\nBruno was the youngest son of Count Hugh IV of Nordgau and Hedwig of Dagsburg. He was a native of Egisheim, Upper Alsace (present-day Alsace, France). His father was a first cousin of Conrad II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. At the age of five, Bruno was committed to the care of Berthold, Bishop of Toul, who had a school for the sons of the nobility.\nHagiographic sources state that when Pope Leo IX was born, \"his body [was] marked all over with little red crosses\". Some authors have considered this to be a form of the stigmata.\nIn 1017, Bruno became a canon at St. Stephen's in Toul. When, in 1024, his cousin Conrad succeeded Henry II as emperor, Bruno's relatives sent him to the new king's court \"to serve in his chapel\".\nBruno was a deacon in 1026 when Conrad set out for Italy to make his authority respected in that portion of his dominions, and as Herimann, Bishop of Toul, was too old to lead his contingent into the peninsula, he entrusted the command of it to Bruno. While he was thus in the midst of arms, Bishop Herimann died, and Bruno was at once elected to succeed him. Conrad, who destined him for higher things, was loath to allow him to accept that insignificant see. But Bruno induced the emperor to permit him to take the see. Consecrated in 1027, Bruno administered the Diocese of Toul for over twenty years, during a time of stress and trouble. He had to contend not merely with famine, but also with war, to which, as a frontier town, Toul was much exposed. Bruno rendered important political services to Conrad II, and afterwards to Emperor Henry III. He knew how to make peace, and, if necessary, to wield the sword in self-defence. Sent by Conrad to Robert the Pious, he established so firm a peace between France and the empire that it was not again broken even during the reigns of the sons of both Conrad and Robert. On the other hand, he held his episcopal city against Count Odo II of Blois, a rebel against Conrad, and \"by his wisdom and exertions\" added Burgundy to the empire.\nBruno became widely known as an earnest and reforming ecclesiastic by the zeal he showed in spreading the rule of the order of Cluny. It was whilst he was bishop that he was saddened by the death not merely of his father and mother, but also of two of his brothers. Bruno found some consolation in music, in which he proved himself highly proficient.\nPapacy.\nOn the death of Pope Damasus II in 1048, Bruno was selected as his successor by an assembly at Worms in December. Both the emperor and the Roman delegates concurred. However, Bruno apparently favoured a canonical election and stipulated as a condition of his acceptance that he should first proceed to Rome and be freely elected by the voice of the clergy and people of Rome. Setting out shortly after Christmas, he met with abbot Hugh of Cluny at Besan\u00e7on, where he was joined by the young monk Hildebrand, who afterwards became Pope Gregory VII; arriving in pilgrim garb at Rome in the following February, he was received with much cordiality, and at his consecration assumed the name Leo IX.\nTheology.\nLeo IX favoured celibacy for the clergy in his reformation of the Catholic Church. One of his first public acts was to hold the well-known Easter synod of 1049, at which celibacy of the clergy (down to the rank of subdeacon) was required anew. Also, the Easter synod was where the pope at least succeeded in making clear his own convictions against every kind of simony. The greater part of the year that followed was occupied by one of those progresses through Italy, Germany and France which form a marked feature in Leo IX's pontificate. After presiding over a synod at Pavia, he joined Henry III in Saxony and accompanied him to Cologne and Aachen. He also summoned a meeting of the higher clergy in Reims in which several important reforming decrees were passed. At Mainz, he held a council at which the Italian and French as well as the German clergy were represented, and ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor were present. Here too, simony and the marriage of the clergy were the principal matters dealt with.\nAfter his return to Rome, Leo held another Easter synod on 29 April 1050. It was occupied largely with the controversy about the teachings of Berengar of Tours. In the same year he presided over provincial synods at Salerno, Siponto and Vercelli, and in September revisited his native Germany, returning to Rome in time for a third Easter synod at which the question of the reordination of those who had been ordained by simonists was considered. In 1052, he joined the emperor at Pressburg and vainly sought to secure the submission of the Hungarians. At Regensburg, Bamberg and Worms, the papal presence was celebrated with various ecclesiastical solemnities. In early 1053, Leo arbitrated a dispute between the archbishop of Carthage and the bishop of Gummi over ecclesiastical precedence.\nRelations with Constantinople.\nPatriarch Michael I Cerularius of Constantinople, through Leo of Ohrid, Archbishop of Bulgaria, wrote to the pope denouncing the use of unleavened bread and fasting days in the Latin Church. Leo IX sent a letter to Michael I in 1054, citing a large portion of the Donation of Constantine, believing it was genuine. \nLeo assured Michael that the donation was completely genuine, not a fable, so only the apostolic successor to Peter possessed that primacy and was the rightful head of all the Church. Before his death, Leo IX had sent a legatine mission under Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida to Constantinople to negotiate with Patriarch Michael Cerularius in response to his actions concerning the Church in Constantinople. Humbert quickly disposed of negotiations by delivering a bull excommunicating the Patriarch. This act, although legally invalid due to the pope's death at the time, was answered by the patriarch's own bull of excommunication against Humbert and his associates and is popularly considered the official split between the Eastern and Western Churches. Afterwards, he closed down the Latin churches of Constantinople, stopped remembrance for the pope in the diptychs, and wrote letters to the other patriarchs against the pope. The patriarch of Antioch, Peter III, rejected most of Michael's accusations against Rome and urged him to compromise. Despite this, the break began the Great East\u2013West Schism.\nConflict with the Normans.\nIn constant fear of attack from the Normans in the south of Italy, the Byzantines turned in desperation to the Normans' own spiritual chief, Pope Leo IX, and, according to William of Apulia, begged him \"to liberate Italy that now lacks its freedom and to force that wicked people, who are pressing Apulia under their yoke, to leave\". After a fourth Easter synod in 1053, Leo IX set out against the Norman in the south with an army of Italians and Swabian mercenaries. \"As fervent Christians the Normans were reluctant to fight their spiritual leader and tried to sue for peace but the Swabians mocked them\u2014battle was inevitable.\" Leo IX led the army himself, but his forces suffered total defeat at the Battle of Civitate on 15 June 1053. Nonetheless, on going out from the city to meet the victorious enemy, he was received with every token of submission, pleas for forgiveness and oaths of fidelity and homage. From June 1053 to March 1054, the pope was nevertheless held hostage at Benevento, in honourable captivity, until he acknowledged the Norman conquests in Calabria and Apulia. He did not long survive his return to Rome, where he died on 19 April 1054.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Vi\u1ec7t Minh defeated the French in 1954 at the Battle of, ending the First Indochina War. At the 1954 Geneva Conference, Vietnam was divided into two de facto separate states, with the Vi\u1ec7t Minh in control of North Vietnam, and anti-communists backed by the United States in control of South Vietnam. H\u1ed3 remained president and party leader during the Vietnam War, which began in 1955. He supported the Viet Cong insurgency in the south, overseeing the transport of troops and supplies on the Ho Chi Minh trail until his death in 1969. North Vietnam won in 1975, and the country was re-unified in 1976 as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Saigon \u2013 Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh, South Vietnam's former capital, was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in his honor.\nThe details of 's life before he came to power in Vietnam are uncertain. He is known to have used between 50 and 200 pseudonyms. Information on his birth and early life is ambiguous and subject to academic debate. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, dates, places, and other hard facts while unofficial biographies vary even more widely. Aside from being a politician, was a writer, poet, and journalist. He wrote several books, articles, and poems in Chinese, Vietnamese, and French.\nEarly life.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was born as , also known as , and pronounced locally as , in 1890 in the village of Ho\u00e0ng Tr\u00f9 in Kim Li\u00ean commune, Nam \u0110\u00e0n district, Ngh\u1ec7 An province, in northern Central Vietnam which was then a French protectorate. Although 1890 is generally accepted as his birth year, at various times he used four other birth years: 1891, 1892, 1894 and 1895. He lived in his father Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh S\u1eafc's village of L\u00e0ng Sen in Kim Li\u00ean until 1895 when his father sent him to Hu\u1ebf for study. He had three siblings: his sister B\u1ea1ch Li\u00ean (Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh), a clerk in the French Army; his brother Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Khi\u00eam (Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1t), a geomancer and traditional herbalist; and another brother (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Nhu\u1eadn), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (H\u1ed3) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named V\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u00fac Qu\u00fd. He quickly mastered ch\u1eef H\u00e1n, a prerequisite for any serious study of Confucianism while honing his colloquial Vietnamese writing. In addition to his studies, he was fond of adventure and loved to fly kites and go fishing. Following Confucian tradition, his father gave him a new name when he turned ten: .\nHis father, S\u1eafc, was a Confucian scholar and teacher, and later, in 1909, an imperial magistrate in the remote district of B\u00ecnh Kh\u00ea in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh province. He was demoted for abuse of power after an influential local figure died several days after having received 102 strokes of the cane as punishment for an infraction. S\u1eafc was both a patriot and a collaborator with the French colonial state, supporting the claimedly 'civilizing mission' of the French. Th\u00e0nh received a French education, attending \"Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc\" (\"lyc\u00e9e\" or secondary education) in Hu\u1ebf in Central Vietnam. His disciples, Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng and V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, also attended the school, as did Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, the future President of South Vietnam and political rival.\nHis early life is uncertain but there are some documents indicating activities regarding an early revolutionary spirit during French-occupied Vietnam, but conflicting sources remain. Previously, it was believed that Th\u00e0nh (H\u1ed3) was involved in an anti-slavery (anti-\"corv\u00e9e\") demonstration of poor peasants in Hu\u1ebf in May 1908, which endangered his student status at \"Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc\". However, a document from the Centre des archives d'Outre-mer in France shows that he was admitted to \"Coll\u00e8ge Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ecdc\" on 8 August 1908, which was several months after the anti-\"corv\u00e9e\" demonstration (9\u201313 April 1908).\nOverseas.\nIn France.\nIn Saigon, he applied to work as a kitchen helper on a French merchant steamer, the \"Amiral de Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville\", using the alias V\u0103n Ba. The ship departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in Marseille, France on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for Le Havre and Dunkirk, returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the French Colonial School but did not succeed. He instead decided to begin traveling the world by working on ships and visiting many countries from 1911 to 1917.\nIn the United States.\nWhile working as the cook's helper on a ship in 1912, Th\u00e0nh (H\u1ed3) traveled to the United States. From 1912 to 1913, he may have lived in New York City (Harlem) and Boston, where he claimed to have worked as a baker at the Parker House Hotel. The only evidence that he was in the United States is a single letter to French colonial administrators dated 15 December 1912 and postmarked New York City (he gave his address as the poste restante in Le Havre and his occupation as a sailor) and a postcard to Phan Chu Trinh in Paris where he mentioned working at the Parker House Hotel. Inquiries to the Parker House management revealed no records of him ever having worked there. It is believed that while in the U.S he made contact with Korean nationalists, an experience that developed his political outlook. Sophie Quinn-Judge states that this is \"in the realm of conjecture\". He was also influenced by Pan-Africanist and black nationalist Marcus Garvey during his stay, and said he attended meetings of the Universal Negro Improvement Association.\nIn Britain.\nAt various points from 1913 to 1919, Th\u00e0nh (H\u1ed3) claimed to have lived in West Ealing and later in Crouch End, Hornsey. He reportedly worked as either a chef or dishwasher (reports vary) at the Drayton Court Hotel in West Ealing. Claims that he was trained as a pastry chef under Auguste Escoffier at the Carlton Hotel in Haymarket, Westminster are not supported by documentary evidence. However, the wall of New Zealand House, home of the New Zealand High Commission which now stands on the site of the Carlton Hotel, displays a blue plaque. During 1913, Th\u00e0nh was also employed as a pastry chef on the Newhaven\u2013Dieppe ferry route.\nPolitical activities in France.\nFrom 1919 to 1923, Th\u00e0nh (H\u1ed3) began to show an interest in politics while living in France, being influenced by his friend and French Section of the Workers' International comrade Marcel Cachin. Th\u00e0nh claimed to have arrived in Paris from London in 1917, but the French police had only documents recording his arrival in June 1919. When he arrived, he met a scholar named Phan Ch\u00e2u Trinh as well as his friend Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng.\nIn Paris, he joined the \"Groupe des Patriotes Annamites\" (The Group of Vietnamese Patriots) that included Phan Chu Trinh, Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ebf Truy\u1ec1n and Nguy\u1ec5n An Ninh. They had been publishing newspaper articles advocating for Vietnamese independence under the pseudonym Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c (\"Nguy\u1ec5n the Patriot\") prior to Th\u00e0nh's arrival in Paris. The group petitioned for recognition of the civil rights of the Vietnamese people in French Indochina to the Western powers at the Versailles peace talks, but they were ignored. Citing the principle of self-determination outlined before the peace accords, they requested the allied powers to end French colonial rule of Vietnam and ensure the formation of an independent government.\nBefore the conference, the group sent their letter to allied leaders, including French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and United States President Woodrow Wilson. They were unable to obtain consideration at Versailles, but the episode would later help establish the future H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the symbolic leader of the anti-colonial movement at home in Vietnam. Since Th\u00e0nh was the public face behind the publication of the document (although it was written by Phan V\u0103n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng), he soon became known as Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c, and first used the name in September during an interview with a Chinese newspaper correspondent. Many authors have stated that 1919 was a lost \"Wilsonian moment\", where the future H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh could have adopted a pro-American and less radical position if only President Wilson had received him. However, at the time of the Versailles Conference, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was committed to a socialist program. While the conference was ongoing, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1i Qu\u1ed1c was already delivering speeches on the prospects of Bolshevism in Asia and was attempting to persuade French socialists to join Lenin's Communist International. Upon hearing of the October 1920 death of Irish republican hunger striker (and Lord Mayor of Cork) Terence MacSwiney, Qu\u1ed1c (H\u1ed3) was said to have burst into tears and said \u201ca country with a citizen like this will never surrender\u201d.\nIn December 1920, Qu\u1ed1c (H\u1ed3) became a representative to the Congress of Tours of the French Section of the Workers' International, voted for the Third International, and was a founding member of the French Communist Party. Taking a position in the Colonial Committee of the party, he tried to draw his comrades' attention towards people in French colonies including Indochina, but his efforts were often unsuccessful. While living in Paris, he reportedly had a relationship with a dressmaker named Marie Bri\u00e8re. As a French police document discovered in 2018, Qu\u1ed1c also had relations with the members of Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea like Kim Kyu-sik, Jo So-ang while in Paris. While in there, Ho Chi Minh broadened his political opportunities through contact with Chinese and Korean nationalists, many of whom were linked to Protestant institutions, as well as with French and Vietnamese Protestants. While aware of Protestant discourses on liberty, his commitment lay with proletarian internationalism. From 1919 onward, he embraced Leninist anticolonial positions and eventually aligned with the French Communist Party. Over time, his political stance became more rigid and exclusive.\nDuring this period, he began to write journal articles and short stories as well as run his Vietnamese nationalist group. In May 1922, he wrote an article for a French magazine criticizing the use of English words by French sportswriters. The article implored Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9 to outlaw such Franglais as \"le manager\", \"le round\" and \"le knock-out\". His articles and speeches caught the attention of Dmitry Manuilsky, who would soon sponsor his trip to the Soviet Union and under whose tutelage he would become a high-ranking member of the Soviet Comintern.\nIn the Soviet Union and China.\nIn 1923, Qu\u1ed1c (H\u1ed3) left Paris for Moscow carrying a passport with the name Chen Vang, a Chinese merchant, where he was employed by the Comintern, studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East and in January 1924, attended Lenin's funeral.96 H\u1ed3 participated in the in June 1924. At some point during late 1924 to early 1925, H\u1ed3 was despatched to Canton (Guangzhou) in China. The Comintern assigned him to assist and interpret for Mikhail Borodin, who was the Comintern envoy to the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee there.\nIn Canton, H\u1ed3 organized the Association of Vietnamese Youth.96 He opened a political training school for Vietnamese revolutionaries,96 and in 1925\u20131926, he organized \"Youth Education Classes\" and occasionally gave socialist lectures to Vietnamese revolutionary young people living in Canton at the Whampoa Military Academy. These young people would become the seeds of a new revolutionary, pro-communist movement in Vietnam several years later. According to William Duiker, he lived with a Chinese woman, Zeng Xueming (T\u0103ng Tuy\u1ebft Minh), whom he married on 18 October 1926. When his comrades objected to the match, he told them: \"I will get married despite your disapproval because I need a woman to teach me the language and keep house\". She was 21 and he was 36. They married in the same place where Zhou Enlai had married earlier and then lived in the residence of Borodin.\nHo\u00e0ng V\u0103n Ch\u00ed, a Vietnamese anti-communist writer, argued that in June 1925 he betrayed Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, the famous leader of a rival revolutionary faction and his father's old friend, to French Secret Service agents in Shanghai for 100,000 piastres. A source states that he later claimed he did it because he expected Ch\u00e2u's trial to stir up anti-French sentiment and because he needed the money to establish a communist organization. In \"Ho Chi Minh: A Life\", William Duiker considered this hypothesis, but ultimately rejected it. This hypothesis was also rejected by Sophie Quinn-Judge and Duncan McCargo, who argued that this is likely propaganda invented by anti-communist authors, considering that L\u00e2m \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ee5's reports showed that the French already had all the information they needed from their own spies. Also, according to Quinn-Judge and McCargo, H\u1ed3 was rapidly gaining supporters from the \"best elements\" of the Vietnamese nationalist movement to his ideas, thus having no motivation to eliminate Phan, who considered H\u1ed3 more as a successor than a competitor. Thus, H\u1ed3 had plenty of reasons to support such a respected activist as a figurehead for his movement. Other sources claim that Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Huy\u1ec7n was responsible for Chau's capture. Chau, sentenced to lifetime house arrest, never denounced Qu\u1ed1c.\nAfter Chiang Kai-shek's 1927 anti-communist coup, Qu\u1ed1c (H\u1ed3) left Canton again in April 1927 and returned to Moscow, spending part of the summer of 1927 recuperating from tuberculosis in Crimea before returning to Paris once more in November. He then returned to Asia by way of Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland, and Italy, where he sailed to Bangkok, Thailand, arriving in July 1928. \"Although we have been separated for almost a year, our feelings for each other do not have to be said to be felt\", he reassured Zeng in an intercepted letter.\nQu\u1ed1c (H\u1ed3) remained in Thailand, staying in the Thai village of Nachok until late 1929, when he moved on to India and then Shanghai. In Hong Kong in early 1930, he chaired a meeting with representatives from two Vietnamese communist parties to merge them into a unified organization, the Communist Party of Vietnam. He also founded the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP). In June 1931, H\u1ed3 was arrested by the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) as part of a joint operation between the French authorities in Indochina and the HKPF; scheduled to be extradited from Hong Kong to French Indochina, H\u1ed3 was successfully defended by British solicitor Frank Loseby. Eventually, after appeals to the British Privy Council, H\u1ed3 was reported as dead in 1932 to avoid being extradited to Indochina; it was ruled that, though he would be deported from Hong Kong as an undesirable, it would not be to a destination controlled by France. H\u1ed3 was eventually released and escorted to Shantou.98 He subsequently returned to the Soviet Union and studied and taught at the Lenin Institute in Moscow.\nIn this period H\u1ed3 reportedly lost his positions in the Comintern because of a concern that he had betrayed the organization. However, according to Ton That Thien's research, he was a member of the inner circle of the Comintern, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Dmitry Manuilsky and a member in good standing of the Comintern throughout the Great Purge. H\u1ed3 was removed from control of the Party he had founded. At that time, the Comintern emphasized class struggle more than finding common ground with non-communists to oppose imperialism.98 ICP leadership who replaced criticized H\u1ed3 for what they described as his nationalist tendencies.98 In 1937, Japanese aggression in China and the Nazis' policies prompted the Comintern to emphasize working with anti-fascist groups among non-communists, and H\u1ed3 returned to the party's favor.98\nIn 1938, Qu\u1ed1c (H\u1ed3) returned to China and served as an advisor to the Chinese Communist armed forces. He was also the senior Comintern agent in charge of Asian affairs. He served in the Eighth Route Army branch office in Guilin.98 In 1939, he served under the command of Marshal Ye Jianying.98\nWhen France was defeated by Germany in 1940, H\u1ed3 and his lieutenants, V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p and Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, saw this as an opportunity to advance their own cause. In October 1940, H\u1ed3 and his supporters established the League for Vietnamese Independence (Vi\u1ec7t Minh) in Guilin.98\nViet Minh movement.\nIn 1941, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh returned to Vietnam to lead the Vi\u1ec7t Minh independence movement. H\u1ed3 and ICP founded a communist-led united front to oppose the Japanese.98\nThe Japanese occupation of Indochina that year, the first step toward an invasion of the rest of Southeast Asia, created an opportunity for patriotic Vietnamese. The so-called \"men in black\" were a 10,000-member guerrilla force that operated with the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. He oversaw many successful military actions against the Vichy France and the Japanese occupation of Vietnam during World War II, supported closely yet clandestinely by the United States Office of Strategic Services and later against the French bid to reoccupy the country (1946\u20131954). He was jailed in China by Chiang Kai-shek's local authorities before being rescued by Chinese Communists. Following his release in 1943, he returned to Vietnam. It was during this time that he began regularly using the name H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, a Vietnamese name combining a common Vietnamese surname (H\u1ed3, \u80e1) with a given name meaning \"Bright spirit\" or \"Clear will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese \u5fd7 \u660e: Ch\u00ed meaning \"will\" or \"spirit\" and Minh meaning \"bright\"). His new name was a tribute to General Hou Zhiming (\u4faf\u5fd7\u660e), Chief Commissar of the 4th Military Region of the National Revolutionary Army, who helped release him from a KMT prison in 1943.\nIn April 1945, he met with the OSS agent Archimedes Patti and offered to provide intelligence, asking only for \"a line of communication\" between his Viet Minh and the Allies. The OSS agreed to this and later sent a military team of OSS members to train his men and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh himself was treated for malaria and dysentery by an OSS doctor.\nFollowing the August Revolution organized by the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh became Chairman of the Provisional Government (Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and issued a Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Although he convinced former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i to abdicate, his government was not recognized by any country. He repeatedly petitioned President Harry S. Truman for support for Vietnamese independence, citing the Atlantic Charter, but Truman never responded.\nIn 1946, future Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh became acquainted when they stayed at the same hotel in Paris. He offered Ben-Gurion a Jewish home-in-exile in Vietnam, which Ben-Gurion declined.\nBirth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\nFollowing Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's abdication in August, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh read the Declaration of Independence of Vietnam on 2 September 1945 under the name of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In Saigon, with violence between rival Vietnamese factions and French forces increasing, the British commander, General Sir Douglas Gracey, declared martial law. On 24 September, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh leaders responded with a call for a general strike.\nIn the same month, a force of 200,000 Chinese National Revolutionary Army troops arrived in Hanoi to accept the surrender of the Japanese occupiers in northern Indochina. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh made a compromise with their general, Lu Han, to dissolve the Communist Party and to hold an election that would yield a coalition government. When Chiang forced the French to give the French concessions in Shanghai back to China in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina, he had no choice but to sign an agreement with France on 6 March 1946 in which Vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the French Union. The agreement soon broke down. The purpose of the agreement, for both the French and Vietminh, was for Chiang's army to leave North Vietnam. Fighting broke out in the North soon after the Chinese left.\nHistorian Professor Liam Kelley of the University of Hawaii at Manoa on his \"Le Minh Khai's Asian History Blog\" challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh said he \"would rather smell French shit for five years than eat Chinese shit for a thousand,\" noting that Stanley Karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to him in his 1983 \"Vietnam: A History\" and that the original quote was most likely forged by the Frenchman Paul Mus in his 1952 book \"Vietnam: Sociologie d'une Guerre\". Mus was a supporter of French colonialism in Vietnam and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh believed there was no danger of Chinese troops staying in Vietnam. The Vietnamese at the time were busy spreading anti-French propaganda as evidence of French atrocities in Vietnam emerged, while H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh showed no qualms about accepting Chinese aid after 1949.\nIn 1946, when he traveled outside of the country, his subordinates imprisoned 2,500 non-Communist nationalists and forced 6,000 others to flee. Hundreds of political opponents were jailed or exiled in July 1946, notably, members of the Nationalist Party of Vietnam and the Dai Viet National Party after a failed attempt to raise a coup against the Viet Minh government. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh then collaborated with French colonial forces to massacre supporters of rival Vietnamese nationalist movements in 1945\u20131946, and of the Trotskyists. All rival political parties were hereafter banned and local governments were purged to minimize opposition later on. Trotskyism in Vietnam did not rival the Party outside of the major cities, but particularly in the South, in Saigon-Cochinchina, they had been a challenge. From the outset, they had called for armed resistance to a French restoration and an immediate transfer of industry to workers and land to peasants. The French Socialist leader Daniel Gu\u00e9rin recalls that when in Paris in 1946 he asked H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh about the fate of the Trotskyist leader T\u1ea1 Thu Th\u00e2u, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh had replied, \"with unfeigned emotion,\" that \"'Th\u00e2u was a great patriot and we mourn him', but then a moment later added in a steady voice 'All those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken.'\"\nThe Communists eventually suppressed all non-Communist parties, but they failed to secure a peace deal with France. In the final days of 1946, after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements, such as the Dalat and Fontainebleau conferences, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government found that war was inevitable. The bombardment of Haiphong by the French Navy only strengthened the belief that France had no intention of allowing an autonomous, independent state in Vietnam. The attack reportedly killed more than 6,000 Vietnamese civilians in Haiphong. French forces marched into Hanoi, now the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On 19 December 1946, after the Haiphong incident, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh declared war against the French, marking the beginning of the First Indochina War. The Vietnam National Army, mostly armed with machetes and muskets immediately attacked. They assaulted the French positions, smoking them out with straw bundled with chili pepper, destroying armored vehicles with \"lunge mines\" (a hollow-charge warhead on the end of a pole, detonated by thrusting the charge against the side of a tank; typically a suicide weapon) and Molotov cocktails, holding off attackers by using roadblocks, landmines and gravel. After two months of fighting, the exhausted Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces withdrew after systematically destroying any valuable infrastructure. H\u1ed3 was mistakenly reported to be captured by a group of French soldiers, led by Jean \u00c9tienne Valluy at Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc, during Operation L\u00e9a. The person in question turned out to be a Vi\u1ec7t Minh advisor who was killed trying to escape.\nAccording to journalist Bernard Fall, H\u1ed3 decided to negotiate a truce after fighting the French for several years. When the French negotiators arrived at the meeting site, they found a mud hut with a thatched roof. Inside they found a long table with chairs. In one corner of the room, a silver ice bucket contained ice and a bottle of good champagne, indicating that H\u1ed3 expected the negotiations to succeed. One demand by the French was the return to French custody of several Japanese military officers (who had been helping the Vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of Japanese origin) for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh replied that the Japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray, therefore he walked out to seven more years of war.\nIn February 1950, after the Battle of Route Coloniale 4 successfully broke the French border blockade, he met with Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong in Moscow after the Soviet Union recognized his government. They all agreed that China would be responsible for backing the Vi\u1ec7t Minh. Mao Zedong's emissary to Moscow stated in August that China planned to train 60,000\u201370,000 Viet Minh shortly. The road to the outside world was open for Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces to receive additional supplies which would allow them to escalate the fight against the French regime throughout Indochina. At the outset of the conflict, H\u1ed3 reportedly told a French visitor: \"You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and I will win\". In 1954, the First Indochina War came to an end after the decisive Battle of Dien Bien Phu, where more than 10,000 French soldiers surrendered to the Viet Minh. The subsequent Geneva Accords peace process partitioned North Vietnam at the 17th parallel.\nArthur Dommen estimates that the Vi\u1ec7t Minh killed between 100,000 and 150,000 civilians during the war. Benjamin Valentino estimates that the French were responsible for 60,000\u2013250,000 civilian deaths.\nPresident of North Vietnam.\nThe 1954 Geneva Conference concluded the war between France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, allowing the latter's forces to regroup in the North whilst anti-Communist groups settled in the South. H\u1ed3's Democratic Republic of Vietnam relocated to Hanoi and became the government of North Vietnam, a Communist-led one-party state. Following the Geneva Accords, there was to be a 300-day period in which people could freely move between the two regions of Vietnam, later known as South Vietnam and North Vietnam. During the 300 days, Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m and CIA adviser Colonel Edward Lansdale staged a campaign to convince Northerners, particularly Catholics to move to South Vietnam. The CIA's efforts played a minimal role, as Catholic migrants were driven primarily by their own convictions and circumstances rather than external psychological operations. Between 800,000 and 1 million people migrated to the South. With the withdrawal from the French Union and the dissolution of French Indochina in early 1955, Diem assumed temporary control of South Vietnam.\nAll the parties at Geneva called for reunification elections, but they could not agree on the details. Recently appointed Vi\u1ec7t Minh acting foreign minister Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng proposed elections under the supervision of \"local commissions\". The U.S., with the support of Britain and the Associated States of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, suggested United Nations supervision. This plan was rejected by Soviet representative Vyacheslav Molotov, who argued for a commission composed of an equal number of communist and non-communist members, which could determine \"important\" issues only by unanimous agreement. The negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification. North Vietnam argued that the elections should be held within six months of the ceasefire while the Western allies sought to have no deadline. Molotov proposed June 1955, then later softened this to any time in 1955 and finally July 1956. The Di\u1ec7m government supported reunification elections, but only with effective international supervision, arguing that genuinely free elections were otherwise impossible in the totalitarian North.\nBy the afternoon of 20 July 1954, the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the 17th parallel and the elections for a reunified government should be held in July 1956, two years after the ceasefire. The Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam was only signed by the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh military commands, with no participation or consultation of the State of Vietnam. Based on a proposal by Chinese delegation head Zhou Enlai, an International Control Commission (ICC) was established to supervise the ceasefire under the Geneva Accords. Chaired by India, the commission included Canada and Poland as its other members. Because issues were to be decided unanimously, Poland's presence in the ICC provided the Communists with effective veto power over supervision of the treaty. The unsigned Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference called for reunification elections, which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the ICC. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh never accepted ICC authority over such elections, insisting that the ICC's \"competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities by both parties\". Of the nine nations represented, only the United States and the State of Vietnam refused to accept the declaration. Undersecretary of state Walter Bedell Smith delivered a \"unilateral declaration\" of the United States position, reiterating: \"We shall seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to ensure that they are conducted fairly\".\nBetween 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including rent reduction and land reform, which were accompanied with executions of \"reactionary and evil landlords.\" During the land reform, testimonies by North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution per 160 village residents, which if extrapolated would indicate a nationwide total of nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions was widely accepted by scholars at the time. However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although it was likely greater than 13,500. In 1990, economist Vo Nhan Tri reported uncovering a document in the central party archives which put the number of wrongful executions at 15,000. From discussions with party cadres, Vo Nhan Tri concluded that the overall number of deaths was considerably higher than this figure. In 2007, scholar Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai wrote that documents of Hungarian diplomats living in North Vietnam at the time of the land reform provided a number of the 62,182 \u2018landlords\u2019 identified by the land reform cadres, of whom 1,337 were executed by December 1955, including 1,175 executions during the first stage, which was the rent-reductuon campaign, and 162 executions during the second stage, which was the land reform proper. The third stage in early 1956, likely resulted in more deaths than the previous stages as the repression was more intense.\nIn early 1956, North Vietnam ended the land reform and initiated a \"correction of errors\" to rectify the mistakes and damage done. That year, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh apologised and acknowledged the serious errors the government had made in the land reform. As part of the campaign, as many as 23,748 political prisoners were released by North Vietnam by September 1957. By 1958, the correction campaign had resulted in the return of land to many of those harmed by the land reform.\nVietnam War.\nAs early as June 1956, the idea of overthrowing the Republic of Vietnam government was presented at a Politburo meeting. In 1959, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh began urging the Politburo to send aid to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng in South Vietnam; a \"people's war\" on the South was approved at a session in January 1959, and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. North Vietnam invaded Laos in July 1959, aided by the Pathet Lao, and used 30,000 men to build a network of supply and reinforcement routes running through Laos and Cambodia that became known as the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail. It allowed the North to send manpower and material to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng with much less exposure to South Vietnamese forces, achieving a considerable advantage. To counter the accusation that North Vietnam was violating the Geneva Accord, the independence of the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng was stressed in communist propaganda. North Vietnam created the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in December 1960 as a \"united front\", or political branch of the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng, intended to encourage the participation of non-Communists.\nAt the end of 1959, aware that the planned national elections would never be held and that Di\u1ec7m intended to purge opposing forces (mostly ex-Vi\u1ec7t Minh) from South Vietnamese society, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh informally chose L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n to become the next party leader. This was interpreted by Western analysts as a loss of influence for H\u1ed3, who was said to have preferred the more moderate V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p for the position. From 1959 onward, the elderly H\u1ed3 became increasingly worried about the prospect of his death, and that year he wrote down his will. H\u1ed3 stepped down as General Secretary of the Vietnam Communist party in September 1960 and L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n was officially named party leader, leaving H\u1ed3 to function in a secondary role as head of state and member of the Politburo. He nevertheless maintained considerable influence in the government. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n, T\u1ed1 H\u1eefu, Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh and Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng often shared dinner with H\u1ed3, and all of them remained key figures throughout and after the war. In the early 1960s, the North Vietnamese Politburo was divided into the \"North First\" faction which favored focusing on the economic development of North Vietnam, and the \"South First\" faction, which favored a guerrilla war in South Vietnam to reunite the country within the short term. Between 1961 and 1963, 40,000 Communist soldiers infiltrated South Vietnam from the North.\nIn 1963, H\u1ed3 purportedly corresponded with South Vietnamese President Di\u1ec7m in hopes of achieving a negotiated peace. During the so-called \"Maneli Affair\" of 1963, a French diplomatic initiative was launched to achieve a federation of the two Vietnams, which would be neutral in the Cold War. The four principal diplomats involved in the Maneli affair were Ramchundur Goburdhun, the Indian Chief Commissioner of the ICC; Mieczys\u0142aw Maneli, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC; Roger Lalouette, the French ambassador to South Vietnam; and Giovanni d'Orlandi, the Italian ambassador to South Vietnam. Maneli reported that H\u1ed3 was very interested in the signs of a split between President Di\u1ec7m and President Kennedy and that his attitude was: \"Our real enemies are the Americans. Get rid of them, and we can cope with Di\u1ec7m and Nhu afterward\". H\u1ed3 and Maneli also discussed the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which passed through officially neutral Cambodia and Laos, saying \"Indochina is just one single entity\".\nAt a meeting in Hanoi held in French, H\u1ed3 told Goburdhun that Di\u1ec7m was \"in his way a patriot\", noting that Di\u1ec7m had opposed French rule over Vietnam, and ended the meeting saying that the next time Goburdhun met Di\u1ec7m \"shake hands with him for me\". The North Vietnamese Premier Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, speaking on behalf of H\u1ed3, told Maneli he was interested in the peace plan, saying that just as long as the American advisers left South Vietnam \"we can agree with any Vietnamese\". On 2 September 1963, Maneli met with Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, the younger brother and right-hand man to Di\u1ec7m to discuss the French peace plan. It remains unclear if the Ngo brothers were serious about the French peace plan or were merely using the possibility of accepting it to blackmail the United States into supporting them at a time when the Buddhist crisis had seriously strained relations between Saigon and Washington. Supporting the latter theory is the fact that Nhu promptly leaked his meeting with Maneli to the American columnist Joseph Alsop, who publicized it in a column entitled \"Very Ugly Stuff\". The possibility that the Ngo brothers might accept the peace plan contributed to the Kennedy administration's plan to support a coup against them. On 1 November 1963, a coup overthrew Di\u1ec7m, who was killed the next day together with his brother.\nDi\u1ec7m had followed a policy of \"deconstructing the state\" by creating several overlapping agencies and departments that were encouraged to feud with one another to disorganize the South Vietnamese state to such an extent that he hoped that it would make a coup against him impossible. When Di\u1ec7m was overthrown and killed, without any kind of arbiter between the rival arms of the South Vietnamese state, regime authority in South Vietnam promptly disintegrated. The American Defense Secretary Robert McNamara reported after visiting South Vietnam in December 1963 that \"there is no organized government worthy of the name\" in Saigon. At a meeting of the plenum of the Politburo in December 1963, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n's \"South first\" faction triumphed, with the Politburo passing a resolution calling for North Vietnam to complete the overthrow of the regime in Saigon as soon as possible; while the members of the \"North first\" faction were dismissed. As the South descended into chaos, whatever interest H\u1ed3 might have had in the French peace plan faded, as it became clear the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng could overthrow the Saigon government. A CIA report from 1964 stated that factionalism in South Vietnam had reached \"almost the point of anarchy\" as various South Vietnamese leaders fought one another, making any sort of concerted effort against the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng impossible; leading to much of the South Vietnamese countryside being rapidly taken over by communist guerilla forces.\nAs South Vietnam collapsed into factionalism and in-fighting while the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng continued to win the war, it became increasingly apparent to President Lyndon Johnson that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam. Though Johnson did not wish to commit American forces until he had won the 1964 election, he decided to make his intentions clear to Hanoi. In June 1964, the \"Seaborn Mission\" began as J. Blair Seaborn, the Canadian commissioner to the ICC, arrived in Hanoi with a message from Johnson offering billions of American economic aid and diplomatic recognition in exchange for which North Vietnam would cease trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam. Seaborn also warned that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing, saying that Johnson was seriously considering a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. Little came of the backchannel of the \"Seaborn Mission\" as the North Vietnamese distrusted Seaborn, who pointedly was never allowed to meet H\u1ed3.\nIn late 1964, the People's Army of Vietnam combat troops were sent southwest into officially neutral Laos and Cambodia. By March 1965, American combat troops began arriving in South Vietnam, first to protect the airbases around Chu Lai and Da Nang, later to take on most of the fight as \"[m]ore and more American troops were put in to replace Saigon troops who could not or would not, get involved in the fighting\". As fighting escalated, widespread aerial and artillery bombardment all over North Vietnam by the United States Air Force and Navy began with Operation Rolling Thunder. On 8\u20139 April 1965, H\u1ed3 made a secret visit to Beijing to meet Mao Zedong. It was agreed that no Chinese combat troops would enter North Vietnam unless the United States invaded North Vietnam, but that China would send support troops to North Vietnam to help maintain the infrastructure damaged by American bombing. There was deep distrust and fear of China within the North Vietnamese Politburo and the suggestion that Chinese troops, even support troops, be allowed into North Vietnam caused outrage in the Politburo. H\u1ed3 had to use all his moral authority to obtain Politburo's approval.\nAccording to Chen Jian, during the mid-to-late 1960s, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n permitted 320,000 Chinese volunteers into North Vietnam to help build infrastructure for the country, thereby freeing a similar number of PAVN personnel to go south. There are no sources from Vietnam, the United States, or the Soviet Union that confirm the number of Chinese troops stationed in North Vietnam. However, the Chinese government later admitted to sending 320,000 Chinese soldiers to Vietnam during the 1960s and spent over $20 billion to support Hanoi's regular North Vietnamese Army and Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng guerrilla units.\nTo counter the American bombing, the entire population of North Vietnam was mobilized for the war effort, with vast teams of women being used to repair the damage to roads and bridges done by the aerial bombers, often at a speed that astonished the Americans. The bombing of North Vietnam proved to be the principal obstacle to opening peace talks, as H\u1ed3 repeatedly stated that no peace talks would be possible unless the United States unconditionally ceased bombing North Vietnam. Like many of the other leaders of the newly independent states of Asia and Africa, H\u1ed3 was extremely sensitive about threats, whether perceived or real, to his nation's independence and sovereignty. H\u1ed3 regarded the American bombing as a violation of North Vietnam's sovereignty, and he felt that to negotiate with the Americans reserving the right to bomb North Vietnam should he not behave as they wanted him to do, would diminish North Vietnam's independence.\nIn March 1966, a Canadian diplomat, Chester Ronning, arrived in Hanoi with an offer to use his \"good offices\" to begin peace talks. However, the Ronning mission foundered upon the bombing issue, as the North Vietnamese demanded an unconditional halt to the bombing, an undertaking that Johnson refused to give. In June 1966, Janusz Lewandowski, the Polish Commissioner to the ICC, was able via d'Orlandi to see Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the American ambassador to South Vietnam, with an offer from H\u1ed3. H\u1ed3's offer for a \"political compromise\" as transmitted by Lewandowski included allowing South Vietnam to maintain its alliance with the U.S., instead of becoming neutral; having the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng \"take part\" in negotiations for a coalition government, instead of being allowed to automatically enter a coalition government; and allowing a \"reasonable calendar\" for the withdrawal of American troops instead of an immediate withdrawal. Operation Marigold, as the Lewandowski channel came to be codenamed, almost led to American-North Vietnamese talks in Warsaw in December 1966; but such plans ultimately collapsed over the bombing issue.\nIn January 1967, General Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh, the commander of communist forces in South Vietnam, returned to Hanoi to present a plan that became the genesis of the Tet Offensive a year later. Thanh expressed much concern about the Americans invading Laos to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to preempt this possibility, urged an all-out offensive to win the war with a sudden blow. L\u00ea' Du\u1ea9n supported Thanh's plans, which were stoutly opposed by the Defense Minister, General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, who preferred to continue with guerrilla war, arguing that superior American firepower would ensure the failure of Thanh's proposed offensive. With the Politburo divided, it was agreed to study and debate the issue more.\nIn July 1967, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and most of the Politburo of the Communist Party met in a high-profile conference, where they concluded that the war had fallen into a stalemate. The American military presence forced the PAVN to expend the majority of their resources on maintaining the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail, rather than reinforcing their comrades' ranks in the South. H\u1ed3 seems to have agreed to Thanh's offensive because he wanted to see Vietnam reunified within his lifetime, and the increasingly ailing H\u1ed3 was painfully aware that he did not have much time left. With H\u1ed3's permission, the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng planned a massive offensive that would commence on 31 January 1968, to take much of the South by force and deal a heavy blow to the American military. The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of North Vietnam and the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his government's strategy materialized: Hanoi's terms would eventually be accepted not by engaging in conventional warfare against the might of the United States Army, but by wearing down American resolve through a prolonged guerilla conflict.\nIn early 1969, H\u1ed3 suffered a heart attack and was in increasingly bad health for the rest of the year. In July 1969, Jean Sainteny, a former French official in Vietnam who knew H\u1ed3, secretly relayed a letter written to him from President Richard Nixon. Nixon's letter proposed working together to end this \"tragic war\", but also warned that if North Vietnam made no concessions at the peace talks in Paris by 1 November, Nixon would resort to \"measures of great consequence and force\". H\u1ed3's reply letter, which Nixon received on 30 August 1969, welcomed peace talks with the U.S. to look for a way to end the war but made no concessions, as Nixon's threats made no impression on him.\nPersonal life.\nIn addition to being a politician, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and polyglot. His father was a scholar and teacher who received a high degree in the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty Imperial examination. H\u1ed3 was taught to master Classical Chinese at a young age. Before the August Revolution, he often wrote poetry in Ch\u1eef H\u00e1n, the Vietnamese name for the Chinese writing system. One of those is \"Poems from the Prison Diary\", written when he was imprisoned by the police of the Republic of China. This poetry chronicle is Vietnam National Treasure No. 10 and was translated into many languages. It is used in Vietnamese high schools. After Vietnam gained independence from France, the new government exclusively promoted Ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef (Vietnamese writing system in Latin characters) to eliminate illiteracy. H\u1ed3 started to write additional poetry in modern Vietnamese for dissemination to a wider range of readers. From when he became president until the appearance of serious health problems, a short poem of his was regularly published in the T\u1ebft (Lunar new year) edition of \"Nh\u00e2n D\u00e2n\" newspaper to encourage his people in working, studying or fighting Americans in the new year.\nH\u1ed3 could speak fluent and write several languages, including French, Russian, English, Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as Vietnamese. In addition, he was reported to speak conversational Esperanto. In the 1920s, he was bureau chief/editor of many newspapers which he established to criticize French Colonial Government of Indochina and serving communist propaganda purposes. Examples are \"Le Paria\" (The Pariah) first published in Paris 1922 or \"Thanh Nien\" (Youth) first published on 21 June 1925 (21 June was named by The Socialist Republic of Vietnam Government as \"Vietnam Revolutionary Journalism Day\"). In many state official visits to the Soviet Union and China, he often talked directly to their communist leaders in Russian and Mandarin without interpreters, especially about top-secret information. While being interviewed by Western journalists, he often spoke French, regardless of the language being spoken to him. He spoke Vietnamese with a strong accent from his birthplace in the central province of Ngh\u1ec7 An, but he could still be widely understood throughout the country.\nAs president, he held formal receptions for foreign heads of state and ambassadors at the Presidential Palace, but he did not personally live there. He ordered the building of a stilt house at the back of the palace, which is today known as the Presidential Palace Historical Site. His hobbies (according to his secretary V\u0169 K\u1ef3) included reading, gardening, feeding fish (many of which are still living), and visiting schools and children's homes.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh remained in Hanoi during his final years, demanding the unconditional withdrawal of all non-Vietnamese troops from South Vietnam. By 1969, with negotiations still dragging on, his health began to deteriorate from multiple health problems, including diabetes which prevented him from participating in further active politics. However, he insisted that his forces in the South continue fighting until all of Vietnam was reunited regardless of the length of time that it might take, believing that time was on his side.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh is thought to have married a Chinese midwife named Zeng Xueming in October 1926. Historian Peter Neville claimed that H\u1ed3 (at the time known as Ly Thuy) wanted to engage Zeng in the communist movements but she demonstrated a lack of ability and interest in it. In 1927, the mounting repression of Chiang Kai-shek's KMT against the Chinese Communists compelled H\u1ed3 to leave for Hong Kong, and his relationship with Zeng appeared to have ended at that time. In addition to the marriage with Zeng Xueming, there is a number of published studies indicating that H\u1ed3 had a romantic relationship with Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Minh Khai. As a young and high-spirited female revolutionary, Minh Khai was delegated to Hong Kong to serve as an assistant to Ho Chi Minh in April 1930 and quickly drew H\u1ed3's attention owing to her physical attractiveness. H\u1ed3 even approached the Far Eastern Bureau and requested permission to marry Minh Khai even though the previous marriage with Zeng remained legally valid. However, the marriage was unable to take place since Minh Khai had been detained by the British authorities in April 1931.\nDeath.\nWith the outcome of the Vietnam war still in question, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh died of heart failure at his home in Hanoi at 9:47 on the morning of 2 September 1969; he was 79 years old. His embalmed body is currently on display in the President Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square in Hanoi, despite his will which stated that he wanted to be cremated.\nDue to the sensitivity of 2 September being Independence Day, the North Vietnamese government originally delayed announcing H\u1ed3's death until 3 September. A week of mourning for his death was decreed nationwide in North Vietnam from 4 to 11 September 1969. His funeral was attended by about 250,000 people and 5,000 official guests, which included many international mourners.\nRepresentatives from 40 countries and regions were also presented. During the mourning period, North Vietnam received more than 22,000 condolences letters from 20 organizations and 110 countries across the world, such as France, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia, Cuba, Zambia, China, the Soviet Union and many others, mostly socialist countries.\nHe was not initially replaced as president; instead, a \"collective leadership\" composed of several ministers and military leaders took over, known as the Politburo. During North Vietnam's final campaign in 1975, a famous song written by composer Huy Thuc was often sung by PAVN soldiers: \"\" (\"You are still marching with us, Uncle H\u1ed3\").\nDuring the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, several PAVN tanks displayed a poster with those same words on it. The day after the battle ended, on 1 May, veteran Australian journalist Denis Warner reported that \"When the North Vietnamese marched into Saigon yesterday, they were led by a man who wasn't there\".\nLegacy.\nAlthough H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh wished for his body to be cremated and his ashes spread to North, Central, and South Vietnam, the body instead is embalmed on view in a mausoleum. His image is featured in many public buildings and schoolrooms, and other displays of reverence. There is at least one temple dedicated to him, built in then Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng-controlled V\u0129nh Long shortly after his death in 1970.\nIn \"The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam\" (1982), Duiker suggests that H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's cult of personality is indicative of a larger legacy, one that drew on \"elements traditional to the exercise of control and authority in Vietnamese society.\" Duiker is drawn to an \"irresistible and persuasive\" comparison with China. As in China, leading party cadres were \"most likely to be intellectuals descended [like H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families\" in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more \"Westernised\" coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule Cochinchina) and to be from \"commercial families without a traditional Confucian background\".\nIn Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of Confucianism, condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism, and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism \"as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts\", but its social prestige was \"essentially destroyed.\" In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i) was replaced by the people's republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (\"Gia Truong\"). The socialist conception of social equality destroyed the Confucian views of class.\nDuiker argues many were to find the new ideology \"congenial\" precisely because of its similarities with the teachings of the old Master: \"the belief in one truth, embodied in quasi-sacred texts\"; in \"an anointed elite, trained in an all-embracing doctrine and responsible for leading the broad masses and indoctrinating them in proper thought and behavior\"; in \"the subordination of the individual to the community\"; and in the perfectibility, through corrective action, of human nature. All of this, Duiker suggests, was in some manner present in the aura of the new Master, Chi Minh, \"the bringer of light\", \"Uncle H\u1ed3\" to whom \"all the desirable qualities of Confucian ethics\" are ascribed. Under H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, Vietnamese Marxism developed, in effect, as a kind of \"reformed Confucianism\" revised to meet \"the challenges of the modern era\" and, not least among these, of \"total mobilization in the struggle for national independence and state power.\"\nThis \"congeniality\" with Confucian tradition was remarked on by Nguyen Khac Vien, a leading Hanoi intellectual of the 1960s and 70s. In \"Confucianism and Marxism in Vietnam\" Nguyen Khac Vien, saw definite parallels between Confucian and party discipline, between the traditional scholar gentry and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's party cadres.\nA completely different form of the cult of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (and one tolerated by the government with uneasiness) is his identification in Vietnamese folk religion with the Jade Emperor, who supposedly incarnated again on earth as H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. Today, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums. The first such medium was one Madam Lang in the 1990s, but the cult acquired a significant number of followers through another medium, Madam Xoan. She established on 1 January 2001 the \u0110\u1ea1o Ng\u1ecdc Ph\u1eadt H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (the Way of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Buddha), also known as \u0110\u1ea1o B\u00e1c H\u1ed3 (the Way of Uncle H\u1ed3) at \u0111\u1ec1n H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh (the Peace Temple) in Ch\u00ed Linh-Sao \u0110\u1ecf district of H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng province. She then founded the Peace Society of Heavenly Mediums (\u0110o\u00e0n \u0111\u1ed3ng thi\u00ean H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh). Reportedly, the movement had around 24,000 followers by 2014.\nThe Vietnamese government's attempts to immortalize H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh were also met with significant controversies and opposition. The regime is sensitive to anything that might question the official hagiography. This includes references to H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's personal life that might detract from the image of the dedicated \"father of the revolution\", the \"celibate married only to the cause of revolution\". William Duiker's \"Ho Chi Minh: A Life\" (2000) was candid on the matter of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's liaisons. The government sought cuts in the Vietnamese translation and banned distribution of an issue of the \"Far Eastern Economic Review\", which carried a small item about the controversy.\nMany authors writing on Vietnam argued on the question of whether H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was fundamentally a nationalist or a communist.\nDepictions of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh.\nBusts, statues, and memorial plaques and exhibitions are displayed in destinations on his extensive world journey in exile from 1911 to 1941 including France, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and Thailand.\nMany activists and musicians wrote songs about H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his revolution in different languages during the Vietnam War to demonstrate against the United States. Spanish songs were composed by F\u00e9lix Pita Rodr\u00edguez, Carlos Puebla and Al\u00ed Primera. In addition, the Chilean folk singer V\u00edctor Jara referenced H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh in his anti-war song \"El derecho de vivir en paz\" (\"The Right to Live in Peace\"). Pete Seeger wrote \"Teacher Uncle Ho\". Ewan MacColl produced \"The Ballad of Ho Chi Minh\" in 1954, describing \"a man who is the father of the Indo-Chinese people, And his name [it] is Ho Chi Minh.\" Russian songs about him were written by Vladimir Fere, and German songs about him were written by Kurt Demmler.\nVarious places, boulevards, and squares are named after him around the world, especially in Socialist states and former Communist states. In Russia, there is a H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh square and monument in Moscow, a H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh boulevard in Saint Petersburg, and a H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh square in Ulyanovsk (the birthplace of Vladimir Lenin, a sister city of Vinh, the birthplace of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh). During the Vietnam War, the then-West Bengal government, in the hands of CPI(M), renamed Harrington Street to Ho Chi Minh Sarani, which is also the location of the consulate general of the United States in Kolkata. According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as many as 20 countries across Asia, Europe, America and Africa have erected monuments or statues in remembrance of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh.\nInternational influence.\nH\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh is considered one of the most influential leaders in the world. \"Time\" magazine listed him in the list of (\"Time\" 100) in 1998. His thought and revolution inspired many leaders and people on a global scale in Asia, Africa and Latin America during the decolonization movement which occurred after World War II. As a communist, he was one of the few international figures who were relatively well regarded in the West, and did not face the same extent of international criticism as much as other Communist rulers and factions, even winning praise for his actions.\nIn 1987, UNESCO officially recommended that its member states \"join in the commemoration of the centenary of the birth of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh by organizing various events as a tribute to his memory\", considering \"the important and many-sided contributions of President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh to the fields of culture, education and the arts\" who \"devoted his whole life to the national liberation of the Vietnamese people, contributing to the common struggle of peoples for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress\".\nOne of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's works, \"The Black Race\", much of it originally written in French, highlights his views on the oppression of peoples from colonialism and imperialism in 20 written articles. Other books such as \"Revolution\" which published selected works and articles of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh in English also highlighted H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's interpretation and beliefs in socialism and communism, and in fighting against what he perceived to be evils stemming from capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67378", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67378", "title": "Ulam spiral", "text": "Visualization of the prime numbers formed by arranging the integers into a spiral\nThe Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's \"Mathematical Games\" column in \"Scientific American\" a short time later. It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers.\nUlam and Gardner emphasized the striking appearance in the spiral of prominent diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines containing large numbers of primes. Both Ulam and Gardner noted that the existence of such prominent lines is not unexpected, as lines in the spiral correspond to quadratic polynomials, and certain such polynomials, such as Euler's prime-generating polynomial \"x\"2\u2009\u2212\u2009\"x\"\u2009+\u200941, are believed to produce a high density of prime numbers. Nevertheless, the Ulam spiral is connected with major unsolved problems in number theory such as Landau's problems. In particular, no quadratic polynomial has ever been proved to generate infinitely many primes, much less to have a high asymptotic density of them, although there is a well-supported conjecture as to what that asymptotic density should be.\nIn 1932, 31 years prior to Ulam's discovery, the herpetologist Laurence Klauber constructed a triangular, non-spiral array containing vertical and diagonal lines exhibiting a similar concentration of prime numbers. Like Ulam, Klauber noted the connection with prime-generating polynomials, such as Euler's.\nConstruction.\nThe Ulam spiral is constructed by writing the positive integers in a spiral arrangement on a square lattice:\nand then marking the prime numbers:\nIn the figure, primes appear to concentrate along certain diagonal lines. In the 201\u00d7201 Ulam spiral shown above, diagonal lines are clearly visible, confirming the pattern to that point. Horizontal and vertical lines with a high density of primes, while less prominent, are also evident. Most often, the number spiral is started with the number 1 at the center, but it is possible to start with any number, and the same concentration of primes along diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines is observed. Starting with 41 at the center gives a diagonal containing an unbroken string of 40 primes (starting from 1523 southwest of the origin, decreasing to 41 at the origin, and increasing to 1601 northeast of the origin), the longest example of its kind.\nHistory.\nAccording to Gardner, Ulam discovered the spiral in 1963 while doodling during the presentation of \"a long and very boring paper\" at a scientific meeting. These hand calculations amounted to \"a few hundred points\". Shortly afterwards, Ulam, with collaborators Myron Stein and Mark Wells, used MANIAC II at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory to extend the calculation to about 100,000 points. The group also computed the density of primes among numbers up to 10,000,000 along some of the prime-rich lines as well as along some of the prime-poor lines. Images of the spiral up to 65,000 points were displayed on \"a scope attached to the machine\" and then photographed. The Ulam spiral was described in Martin Gardner's March 1964 \"Mathematical Games\" column in \"Scientific American\" and featured on the front cover of that issue. Some of the photographs of Stein, Ulam, and Wells were reproduced in the column.\nIn an addendum to the \"Scientific American\" column, Gardner mentioned the earlier paper of Klauber.\nKlauber describes his construction as follows, \"The integers are arranged in triangular order with 1 at the apex, the second line containing numbers 2 to 4, the third 5 to 9, and so forth. When the primes have been indicated, it is found that there are concentrations in certain vertical and diagonal lines, and amongst these the so-called Euler sequences with high concentrations of primes are discovered.\"\nExplanation.\nDiagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines in the number spiral correspond to polynomials of the form\n formula_1\nwhere \"b\" and \"c\" are integer constants. When \"b\" is even, the lines are diagonal, and either all numbers are odd, or all are even, depending on the value of \"c\". It is therefore no surprise that all primes other than 2 lie in alternate diagonals of the Ulam spiral. Some polynomials, such as formula_2, while producing only odd values, factorize over the integers formula_3 and are therefore never prime except possibly when one of the factors equals 1. Such examples correspond to diagonals that are devoid of primes or nearly so.\nTo gain insight into why some of the remaining odd diagonals may have a higher concentration of primes than others, consider formula_4 and formula_5. Compute remainders upon division by 3 as \"n\" takes successive values 0, 1, 2, ... For the first of these polynomials, the sequence of remainders is 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, ..., while for the second, it is 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, ... This implies that in the sequence of values taken by the second polynomial, two out of every three are divisible by 3, and hence certainly not prime, while in the sequence of values taken by the first polynomial, none are divisible by 3. Thus it seems plausible that the first polynomial will produce values with a higher density of primes than will the second. At the very least, this observation gives little reason to believe that the corresponding diagonals will be equally dense with primes. One should, of course, consider divisibility by primes other than 3. Examining divisibility by 5 as well, remainders upon division by 15 repeat with pattern 1, 11, 14, 10, 14, 11, 1, 14, 5, 4, 11, 11, 4, 5, 14 for the first polynomial, and with pattern 5, 0, 3, 14, 3, 0, 5, 3, 9, 8, 0, 0, 8, 9, 3 for the second, implying that only three out of 15 values in the second sequence are potentially prime (being divisible by neither 3 nor 5), while 12 out of 15 values in the first sequence are potentially prime (since only three are divisible by 5 and none are divisible by 3).\nWhile rigorously-proved results about primes in quadratic sequences are scarce, considerations like those above give rise to a plausible conjecture on the asymptotic density of primes in such sequences, which is described in the next section.\nHardy and Littlewood's Conjecture F.\nIn their 1923 paper on the Goldbach Conjecture, Hardy and Littlewood stated a series of conjectures, one of which, if true, would explain some of the striking features of the Ulam spiral. This conjecture, which Hardy and Littlewood called \"Conjecture F\", is a special case of the Bateman\u2013Horn conjecture and asserts an asymptotic formula for the number of primes of the form \"ax\"2\u2009+\u2009\"bx\"\u2009+\u2009\"c\". Rays emanating from the central region of the Ulam spiral making angles of 45\u00b0 with the horizontal and vertical correspond to numbers of the form 4\"x\"2\u2009+\u2009\"bx\"\u2009+\u2009\"c\" with \"b\" even; horizontal and vertical rays correspond to numbers of the same form with \"b\" odd. Conjecture F provides a formula that can be used to estimate the density of primes along such rays. It implies that there will be considerable variability in the density along different rays. In particular, the density is highly sensitive to the discriminant of the polynomial, \"b\"2\u2009\u2212\u200916\"c\".\nConjecture F is concerned with polynomials of the form \"ax\"2\u2009+\u2009\"bx\"\u2009+\u2009\"c\" where \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are integers and \"a\" is positive. If the coefficients contain a common factor greater than 1 or if the discriminant \u0394\u2009=\u2009\"b\"2\u2009\u2212\u20094\"ac\" is a perfect square, the polynomial factorizes and therefore produces composite numbers as \"x\" takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... (except possibly for one or two values of \"x\" where one of the factors equals 1). Moreover, if \"a\"\u2009+\u2009\"b\" and \"c\" are both even, the polynomial produces only even values, and is therefore composite except possibly for the value 2. Hardy and Littlewood assert that, apart from these situations, \"ax\"2\u2009+\u2009\"bx\"\u2009+\u2009\"c\" takes prime values infinitely often as \"x\" takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This statement is a special case of an earlier conjecture of Bunyakovsky and remains open. Hardy and Littlewood further assert that, asymptotically, the number \"P\"(\"n\") of primes of the form \"ax\"2\u2009+\u2009\"bx\"\u2009+\u2009\"c\" and less than \"n\" is given by\n formula_6\nwhere \"A\" depends on \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" but not on \"n\". By the prime number theorem, this formula with \"A\" set equal to one is the asymptotic number of primes less than \"n\" expected in a random set of numbers having the same density as the set of numbers of the form \"ax\"2\u2009+\u2009\"bx\"\u2009+\u2009\"c\". But since \"A\" can take values bigger or smaller than 1, some polynomials, according to the conjecture, will be especially rich in primes, and others especially poor. An unusually rich polynomial is 4\"x\"2\u2009\u2212\u20092\"x\"\u2009+\u200941 which forms a visible line in the Ulam spiral. The constant \"A\" for this polynomial is approximately 6.6, meaning that the numbers it generates are almost seven times as likely to be prime as random numbers of comparable size, according to the conjecture. This particular polynomial is related to Euler's prime-generating polynomial \"x\"2\u2009\u2212\u2009\"x\"\u2009+\u200941 by replacing \"x\" with 2\"x\", or equivalently, by restricting \"x\" to the even numbers. The constant \"A\" is given by a product running over all prime numbers,\n formula_7,\nin which formula_8 is number of zeros of the quadratic polynomial modulo \"p\" and therefore takes one of the values 0, 1, or 2. Hardy and Littlewood break the product into three factors as\n formula_9.\nHere the factor \u03b5, corresponding to the prime 2, is 1 if \"a\"\u2009+\u2009\"b\" is odd and 2 if \"a\"\u2009+\u2009\"b\" is even. The first product index \"p\" runs over the finitely-many odd primes dividing both \"a\" and \"b\". For these primes formula_10 since \"p\" then cannot divide \"c\". The second product index formula_11 runs over the infinitely-many odd primes not dividing \"a\". For these primes formula_8 equals 1, 2, or 0 depending on whether the discriminant is 0, a non-zero square, or a non-square modulo \"p\". This is accounted for by the use of the Legendre symbol, formula_13. When a prime \"p\" divides \"a\" but not \"b\" there is one root modulo \"p\". Consequently, such primes do not contribute to the product.\nA quadratic polynomial with \"A\" \u2248 11.3, currently the highest known value, has been discovered by Jacobson and Williams.\nVariants.\nKlauber's 1932 paper describes a triangle in which row \"n\" contains the numbers (\"n\"\u2009\u2009\u2212\u2009\u20091)2\u2009+\u20091 through \"n\"2. As in the Ulam spiral, quadratic polynomials generate numbers that lie in straight lines. Vertical lines correspond to numbers of the form \"k\"2\u2009\u2212\u2009\"k\"\u2009+\u2009\"M\". Vertical and diagonal lines with a high density of prime numbers are evident in the figure.\nRobert Sacks devised a variant of the Ulam spiral in 1994. In the Sacks spiral, the non-negative integers are plotted on an Archimedean spiral rather than the square spiral used by Ulam, and are spaced so that one perfect square occurs in each full rotation. (In the Ulam spiral, two squares occur in each rotation.) Euler's prime-generating polynomial, \"x\"2\u2009\u2212\u2009\"x\"\u2009+\u200941, now appears as a single curve as \"x\" takes the values 0, 1, 2, ... This curve asymptotically approaches a horizontal line in the left half of the figure. (In the Ulam spiral, Euler's polynomial forms two diagonal lines, one in the top half of the figure, corresponding to even values of \"x\" in the sequence, the other in the bottom half of the figure corresponding to odd values of \"x\" in the sequence.)\nAdditional structure may be seen when composite numbers are also included in the Ulam spiral. The number 1 has only a single factor, itself; each prime number has two factors, itself and 1; composite numbers are divisible by at least three different factors. Using the size of the dot representing an integer to indicate the number of factors and coloring prime numbers red and composite numbers blue produces the figure shown.\nSpirals following other tilings of the plane also generate lines rich in prime numbers, for example hexagonal spirals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a diverse body of work spanning more than six decades, he is considered to be one of the most prolific and influential composers of his era, and his piano works continue to be widely performed and recorded.\nLiszt achieved success as a concert pianist from an early age, and received lessons from the esteemed musicians Carl Czerny and Antonio Salieri. He gained further renown for his performances during tours of Europe in the 1830s and 1840s, developing a reputation for technical brilliance as well as physical attractiveness. In a phenomenon dubbed \"Lisztomania\", he rose to a degree of stardom and popularity among the public not experienced by the virtuosos who preceded him.\nDuring this period and into his later life, Liszt was a friend, musical promoter and benefactor to many composers of his time, including Hector Berlioz, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Clara Schumann and Richard Wagner, among others. Liszt coined the terms \"transcription\" and \"paraphrase\", and would perform arrangements of his contemporaries' music to popularise it. Alongside Wagner, Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the New German School, a progressive group of composers involved in the \"War of the Romantics\" who developed ideas of programmatic music and harmonic experimentation.\nLiszt taught piano performance to hundreds of students throughout his life, went on to become notable performers. He left behind an extensive and diverse body of work that influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated 20th-century ideas and trends. Among Liszt's musical contributions were the concept of the symphonic poem, innovations in thematic transformation and Impressionism in music, and the invention of the masterclass as a method of teaching performance. In a radical departure from his earlier compositional styles, many of Liszt's later works also feature experiments in atonality, foreshadowing developments in 20th-century classical music. Today he is best known for his original piano works, such as the Hungarian Rhapsodies, \"Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage\", \"Transcendental \u00c9tudes\", \"La campanella\", and the Piano Sonata in B minor.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nFranz Liszt was born to Anna Liszt (n\u00e9e Maria Anna Lager) and Adam Liszt on 22 October 1811, in the village of Doborj\u00e1n () in Sopron County, in the Kingdom of Hungary, which was part of the Habsburg monarchy. Liszt's father was a land steward in the service of Prince Nikolaus II Esterh\u00e1zy; a keen amateur musician, he played the piano, guitar and flute, and knew Haydn and Hummel personally. A renowned child prodigy, Franz began to improvise at the piano from before the age of five, and his father diligently encouraged his progress. Franz also found exposure to music through attending Mass, as well as travelling Romani bands that toured the Hungarian countryside. His first public concert was in Sopron in 1820 at the age of nine; its success led to further appearances in Pressburg and for Prince Nikolaus' court in Eisenstadt. The publicity led to a group of wealthy sponsors offering to finance Franz's musical education in Vienna.\nThere, Liszt received piano lessons from Carl Czerny, who in his own youth had been a student of Beethoven and Hummel. Czerny, already extremely busy, had only grudgingly agreed to hear Liszt play, and had initially refused to entertain the idea of regular lessons. Being so impressed by the initial audition, however, Czerny taught Liszt regularly, free of charge, for the next eighteen months, at which point he felt he had nothing more to teach. Liszt remained grateful to his former teacher, later dedicating to him the \"Transcendental \u00c9tudes\" on their 1830 republication. Liszt also received lessons in composition from Antonio Salieri, the accomplished music director of the Viennese court who had previously taught Beethoven and Schubert. Like Czerny, Salieri was highly impressed by Liszt's improvisation and sight-reading abilities.\nLiszt's public debut in Vienna on 1 December 1822 was a great success. He was greeted in Austrian and Hungarian aristocratic circles and met Beethoven and Schubert. To build on his son's success, Adam Liszt decided to take the family to Paris, the centre of the artistic world. At Liszt's final Viennese concert on 13 April 1823, Beethoven was reputed to have walked onstage and kissed Liszt on the forehead, to signify a kind of artistic christening. There is debate, however, on the extent to which this story is apocryphal. The family briefly returned to Hungary, and Liszt played a concert in traditional Hungarian dress, in order to emphasise his roots, in May 1823.\nIn 1824 a piece Liszt had written at the age of 11\u00a0\u2013 his Variation on a Waltz by Diabelli (S. 147)\u00a0\u2013 appeared in Part II of \"Vaterl\u00e4ndischer K\u00fcnstlerverein\" as his first published composition. This volume, commissioned by Anton Diabelli, includes 50 variations on his waltz by 50 different composers (Part I being taken up by Beethoven's 33 variations on the same theme, which are now separately better known simply as his \"Diabelli Variations\"). Liszt was the youngest contributor to the project, described in it as \"a boy of eleven years old\"; Czerny was also a participant.\nParis.\nHaving made significant sums from his concerts, Liszt and his family moved to Paris in 1823, with the hope of his attending the Conservatoire de Paris. Even with a letter of recommendation from Chancellor Klemens von Metternich, director Luigi Cherubini refused his entry, however, as the Conservatoire did not accept foreigners. Nevertheless, Liszt studied under Anton Reicha and Ferdinando Paer, and gave a series of highly successful concerts debuting on 8 March 1824. Paer was involved in the Parisian theatrical and operatic scene, and through his connections Liszt staged his only opera, \"Don Sanche\", which premiered shortly before his fourteenth birthday. The premiere was warmly received, but the opera only ran for four performances, and is now obscure. Accompanied by his father, Liszt toured France and England, where he played for King George IV.\nAdam Liszt died suddenly of typhoid fever in the summer of 1827, and for the next eight years Liszt continued to live in Paris with his mother. He gave up touring, and in order to earn money, he gave lessons on piano and composition, often from early morning until late at night. His students were scattered across the city and he had to cover long distances. Because of this, he kept uncertain hours and also took up smoking and drinking, habits he would continue throughout his life. During this period Liszt fell in love with one of his pupils, Caroline de Saint-Cricq, the daughter of Charles X's minister of commerce, Pierre de Saint-Cricq. Her father, however, insisted that the affair be broken off.\nLiszt fell very ill, to the extent that an obituary notice was printed in a Paris newspaper, and he underwent a long period of religious doubts and introspection. He stopped playing the piano and giving lessons, and developed an intense interest in religion, having many conversations with Abb\u00e9 de Lamennais and Chr\u00e9tien Urhan, a German-born violinist who introduced him to the Saint-Simonists. Lamennais dissuaded Liszt from becoming a monk or priest. Urhan was an early champion of Schubert, inspiring Liszt's own lifelong love of Schubert's songs. Much of Urhan's emotive music which moved beyond the Classical paradigm, such as \"Elle et moi, La Salvation ang\u00e9lique\" and \"Les Regrets\", may have helped to develop Liszt's taste and style.\nDuring this period Liszt came into contact with many of the leading authors and artists of his day, including Victor Hugo, Alphonse de Lamartine, George Sand and Alfred de Vigny. He composed practically nothing in the years between his father's death and the July Revolution of 1830, which inspired him to sketch a symphony based on the events of the \"three glorious days\" (this piece was left unfinished, and later reworked as \"H\u00e9ro\u00efde fun\u00e8bre\"). Liszt met Hector Berlioz on 4 December 1830, the day before the premiere of the \"Symphonie fantastique\". Berlioz's music made a strong impression on Liszt, and the two quickly became friends. Liszt also befriended Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin around this time.\nAfter attending a concert featuring Niccol\u00f2 Paganini in April 1832, Liszt resolved to become as great a virtuoso on the piano as Paganini was on the violin. He dramatically increased his practice, sometimes practising for up to fourteen hours a day, and in 1838 published the six \"\u00c9tudes d'ex\u00e9cution transcendante d'apr\u00e8s Paganini\" (later revised as \"Grandes \u00e9tudes de Paganini\"), aiming to represent Paganini's virtuosity on the keyboard. The process of Liszt completely redeveloping his technique is often described as a direct result of attending Paganini's concert, but it is likely that he had already begun this work previously, during the period 1828\u20131832.\nTouring Europe.\nAffair with Countess Marie d'Agoult.\nIn 1833, Liszt began a relationship with the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who was married to a French cavalry officer but living independently. In order to escape scandal they moved to Geneva in 1835; their daughter Blandine was born there on 18 December. Liszt taught at the newly founded Geneva Conservatoire and contributed essays for \"L'Artiste\" and the \"Revue et gazette musicale de Paris\".\nFor the next four years, Liszt and the countess lived together. In 1835 and 1836 they travelled around Switzerland, and from August 1837 until November 1839 they toured Italy. It was these travels that later inspired the composer to write his cycle of piano collections entitled \"Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage\" (\"Years of Pilgrimage\"). Their daughter, Cosima, was born in Como on 24 December 1837, and their son Daniel on 9 May 1839 in Rome.\nThat autumn relations between them became strained. Liszt heard that plans for a Beethoven Monument in Bonn were in danger of collapse for lack of funds and pledged his support, raising funds through concerts. The countess returned to Paris with the children, while Liszt gave six concerts in Vienna, then toured Hungary. Liszt would later spend holidays with Marie and their children on the island of Nonnenwerth on the Rhine in the summers of 1841 and 1843. In May 1844, the couple finally separated.\nThe Ivory Duel.\nSwiss pianist Sigismond Thalberg moved to Paris in 1835 after several successful years of touring. His concerts there were extremely well received, and Liszt, at the time living in Geneva, received news of them from his friends in Paris. In the autumn of 1836 Liszt published an unfavourable review of several of Thalberg's compositions in the \"Gazette musicale\", calling them \"boring\" and \"mediocre\". A published exchange of views ensued between Liszt and Thalberg's supporter, the critic Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis.\nLiszt heard Thalberg perform for the first time at the Paris Conservatoire in February 1837, and to settle the disagreement the two pianists each arranged a performance for the public to compare them the following month. Liszt performed his own \"Grande fantaisie sur des motifs de Niobe\" and Weber's \"Konzertst\u00fcck in F minor\". This was considered to be inconclusive, so the two agreed to perform at the same concert for comparison on 31 March, at the salon of the Princess of Belgiojoso, in aid of Italian refugees. Thalberg opened with his \"Fantasia on Rossini's \"Moses\"\", then Liszt performed his \"Niobe\" fantasy.\nThe result of this \"duel\" is disputed. Critic Jules Janin's report in \"Journal des d\u00e9bats\" asserted that there was no clear winner: \"Two victors and no vanquished; it is fitting to say with the poet '\". Belgiojoso declined to declare a winner, famously concluding that \"Thalberg is the first pianist in the world\u00a0\u2013 Liszt is unique.\" The biographer Alan Walker, however, believes that \"Liszt received the ovation of the evening and all doubts about his supremacy were dispelled. As for Thalberg, his humiliation was complete. He virtually disappeared from the concert platform after this date.\"\nLisztomania.\nAfter his separation from Marie, Liszt continued to tour Europe. His concerts in Berlin in the winter of 1841\u20131842 marked the start of a period of immense public enthusiasm and popularity for his performances, dubbed \"Lisztomania\" by Heinrich Heine in 1844. In a fashion that has been described as similar to \"the mass hysteria associated with revivalist meetings or 20th-century rock stars\", women fought over his cigar stubs and coffee dregs, and his silk handkerchiefs and velvet gloves, which they ripped to shreds as souvenirs. This atmosphere was fuelled in great part by the artist's mesmeric personality and stage presence: he was regarded as handsome, and Heine wrote of his showmanship during concerts: \"How powerful, how shattering was his mere physical appearance\".\nIt is estimated that Liszt appeared in public well over one thousand times during this eight-year period. Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time.\nAdding to his reputation was that Liszt gave away much of the proceeds of his work to charity and humanitarian causes. He donated large sums to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral and St. Stephen's Basilica in Pest, and made private donations to public services such as hospitals and schools, as well as charitable organisations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund. After the Great Fire of Hamburg in May 1842, he gave concerts in aid of those left homeless.\nDuring a tour of Ukraine in 1847, Liszt played in Kiev, where he met the Polish Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. For some time he had been considering retiring from the life of a travelling virtuoso to concentrate on composition, and at this point he made the decision to take up a court position in Weimar. Having known Liszt for only a few weeks, Carolyne resolved to join him there. After a tour of Turkey and Russia that summer, Liszt gave the final paid concert of his career at Elizabetgrad in September, then spent the winter with the princess at her estate in Woroni\u0144ce. By retiring from the concert platform at the age of 35, while still at the height of his powers, Liszt succeeded in keeping the legend of his playing untarnished.\nWeimar.\nIn July 1848 Liszt settled in Weimar, where he had been appointed the honorary title of \"Kapellmeister Extraordinaire\" six years previously. He acted as the official court kapellmeister at the expense of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia until 1859, jointly with Hippolyte Andr\u00e9 Jean Baptiste Ch\u00e9lard until his retirement in 1852. During this period Liszt acted as conductor at court concerts and on special occasions at the theatre, arranged several festivals celebrating the work of Berlioz and Wagner, and produced the premiere of \"Lohengrin\". He gave lessons to a number of pianists, including the great virtuoso Hans von B\u00fclow, who married Liszt's daughter Cosima in 1857 (she would later marry Wagner). Liszt's work during this period made Weimar a nexus for modern music.\nAs kapellmeister Liszt was required to submit every programme to the court Intendant for prior approval. This did not cause large problems until the appointment of Franz von Dingelstedt in 1857, who reduced the number of music productions, rejected Liszt's choices of repertoire, and even organised a demonstration against Liszt's 1858 premiere of . Faced with this opposition, Liszt resigned in 1858.\nAt first, after arriving in Weimar, Princess Carolyne lived apart from Liszt, in order to avoid suspicions of impropriety. She wished eventually to marry Liszt, but since her husband, Russian military officer Prince Nicholas von Sayn-Wittgenstein, was still alive, she had to convince the Roman Catholic authorities that her marriage to him had been invalid. Her appeal to the Archbishop of St Petersburg for an annulment, lodged before leaving Russia, was ultimately unsuccessful, and the couple abandoned pretence and began to live together in the autumn of 1848.\nNicholas was aware that the couple's marriage had effectively ended, and Carolyne and Nicholas reached an agreement to annul in 1850 whereby the prince would receive some of Carolyne's estates. However, this arrangement was struck down in 1851 by the consistory court of Zhytomyr. Throughout the decade the couple would continue to negotiate through the complex situation.\nThe New German School and the War of the Romantics.\nIn 1859 Franz Brendel coined the name \"New German School\" in his publication , to refer to the musicians associated with Liszt while he was in Weimar. The most prominent members other than Liszt were Wagner, though he rejected the label, and Berlioz. The group also included Peter Cornelius, Hans von B\u00fclow and Joachim Raff. The School was a loose confederation of progressive composers, mainly grouped together as a challenge to supposed conservatives such as Mendelssohn and Brahms, and so the term is considered to be of limited use in describing a particular movement or set of unified principles. What commonalities the composers had were around the development of programmatic music, harmonic experimentation, wide-ranging modulation and formal innovations such as the use of leitmotifs and thematic transformation.\nThe disagreements between the two factions is often described as the \"War of the Romantics\". The \"war\" was largely carried out through articles, essays and reviews. Each side claimed Beethoven as its predecessor. A number of festivals were arranged to showcase the music of the New German School, notably in Leipzig in 1859 and Weimar in 1861. The Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein, intrinsically linked to the School, was founded at this time, with Liszt becoming its honorary president in 1873. However, as most of Liszt's work from the 1860s and 1870s received little attention, and Brendel and Berlioz died in the late 1860s, the focus of the progressive movement in music moved to Bayreuth with Wagner in the 1870s, who definitively moved on from the School and the .\nRome.\nAfter a visit to Rome and an audience with Pope Pius IX in 1860, Carolyne finally secured an annulment. It was planned that she and Liszt would marry in Rome, on 22 October 1861, Liszt's 50th birthday. Liszt arrived in Rome on 21 October, but a Vatican official had arrived the previous day in order to stop the marriage. This was a result of the machinations of Cardinal Hohenlohe, who wanted to protect a complex inheritance agreement brokered by Tsar Alexander II. Carolyne subsequently gave up all attempts to marry Liszt, even after her husband's death in 1864; she became a recluse, working for the rest of her life on a long work critical of the Catholic Church.\nThe 1860s were a period of great sadness in Liszt's private life. On 13 December 1859, he lost his 20-year-old son Daniel to an unknown illness. On 11 September 1862 his 26-year-old daughter Blandine also died, having contracted sepsis after surgery on a breast growth which developed shortly after giving birth to a son she named in memory of Daniel. In letters to friends, Liszt announced that he would retreat to a solitary living.\nHe moved to the monastery , just outside Rome, where on 20 June 1863 he took up quarters in a small, spartan apartment. He had a piano in his cell, and he continued to compose. He had already joined the Third Order of Saint Francis previously, on 23 June 1857. On 25 April 1865 he received the tonsure at the hands of Cardinal Hohenlohe, who had previously worked against Carolyne's efforts to secure an annulment; the two men became close friends. On 31 July 1865 Liszt received the four minor orders of porter, lector, exorcist and acolyte. After this ordination he was often called \" Liszt\". On 14 August 1879, he was made an honorary canon of Albano.\nIn 1867 Liszt was commissioned to write a piece for the coronation ceremony of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth of Bavaria, and he travelled to Budapest to conduct it. The \"Hungarian Coronation Mass\" was performed on 8 June 1867, at the coronation ceremony in the Matthias Church by Buda Castle in a six-section form. After the first performance, the Offertory was added and, two years later, the Gradual.\n\"Tripartite existence\".\nGrand Duke Charles Alexander had been attempting to arrange Liszt's return to Weimar ever since he had left, and in January 1869 Liszt agreed to a residency to give masterclasses in piano playing. He was based in the Hofg\u00e4rtnerei (court gardener's house), where he taught for the next seventeen years. From 1872 until the end of his life, Liszt made regular journeys between Rome, Weimar and Budapest, continuing what he called his (\"tripartite existence\"). It is estimated that he travelled at least 4,000 miles a year during this period in his life \u2013 an exceptional figure given his advancing age and the rigors of road and rail in the 1870s.\nLiszt's time in Budapest was the result of efforts from the Hungarian government in attracting him to work there. The plan of the foundation of the Royal Academy of Music was agreed upon by the Hungarian Parliament in 1873, and in March 1875 Liszt was nominated its president. The academy was officially opened on 14 November 1875 with Liszt's colleague Ferenc Erkel as director and Korn\u00e9l \u00c1br\u00e1nyi and Robert Volkmann on the staff. Liszt himself only arrived to deliver lessons in March 1876. From 1881 when in Budapest he would stay in an apartment in the Academy, where he taught pupils in much the same way as he did in Weimar. In 1925, the institution was renamed in honour of Liszt.\nFinal years.\nLiszt fell down a flight of stairs at the Hofg\u00e4rtnerei in July 1881, and remained bedridden for several weeks after this accident. He had been in good health up to that point, but a number of ailments subsequently manifested, such as a cataract in the left eye, dental issues and fatigue. Since around 1877 he had become increasingly plagued by feelings of desolation, despair and preoccupation with death\u2014feelings that he expressed in his works from this period. As he told Lina Ramann, \"I carry a deep sadness of the heart which must now and then break out in sound.\"\nOn 13 January 1886, while Claude Debussy was staying at the Villa Medici in Rome, Liszt met him there with Paul Vidal and Ernest H\u00e9bert, director of the French Academy. Liszt played \"Au bord d'une source\" from \"Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage\", as well as his arrangement of Schubert's \"Ave Maria\" for the musicians. Debussy in later years described Liszt's pedalling as \"like a form of breathing.\"\nLiszt travelled to Bayreuth in the summer of 1886. This was in order to support his daughter Cosima, who was running the festival but struggling to generate sufficient interest. The festival was dedicated to the works of her husband Richard Wagner, and had opened ten years previously; Wagner had died in 1883. Already frail, in his final week of life Liszt's health deteriorated further, as he experienced a fever, cough and delirium.\nHe died during the festival, near midnight on 31 July 1886, at the age of 74\u2014officially as a result of pneumonia, which he had contracted prior to arriving in Bayreuth, although the true cause of death may have been a heart attack. He was buried on 3 August 1886, in the Municipal Cemetery of Bayreuth, according to Cosima's wishes; despite controversy over this as his final resting place, Liszt's body was never moved.\nRelationships with other composers.\nHector Berlioz.\nBerlioz and Liszt first met on 4 December 1830, the day before the premiere of Berlioz's \"Symphonie fantastique\". The two quickly became very close friends, exchanging intimate letters on their respective love lives, which also reveal that Liszt was aware of Berlioz's fixation on suicide. Liszt acted as a witness at Berlioz's wedding to Harriet Smithson in 1833, despite cautioning Berlioz against it, and they worked together at several concerts over the following three years, and again in 1841 and 1844. In Weimar, the two composers revised \"Benvenuto Cellini\", and Liszt organised a \"Berlioz Week.\" It included \"Rom\u00e9o et Juliette\" and part of \"La damnation de Faust\", which was later dedicated to Liszt. In return, Liszt dedicated his \"Faust Symphony\" to Berlioz.\nThe orchestration of Berlioz had an influence on Liszt, especially with regards to his symphonic poems. Berlioz saw orchestration as part of the compositional process, rather than a final task to undertake after the music had already been written. Berlioz joined Liszt and Wagner as a figurehead of the New German School, but an unwilling one, as he was unconvinced by Wagner's ideas about the \"music of the future\".\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin.\nChopin and Liszt first met in the early 1830s, both moving in the same circles of artists residing in Paris. Liszt attended Chopin's first Paris performance at the Salle Pleyel on 26 February 1832, which he admired greatly, and by mid-1833 the two had become close friends. They performed together a number of times, often for charity, and since Chopin only performed in public about 12 times, these events comprise a large proportion of his total appearances.\nTheir relationship cooled in the early 1840s, and several reasons have been suggested for this, including that Marie d'Agoult was infatuated with Chopin, or Liszt with Aurore Dupin, also known by her pen name George Sand, or that Liszt used Chopin's home for a rendezvous with Marie Pleyel, the wife of Chopin's friend Camille. The two musicians had very different personalities, with Liszt being extroverted and outgoing while Chopin was more introverted and reflective, so it is possible that the two never had an extremely close friendship to begin with, and the fact that they did not live physically close together would have been another barrier. On the topic, Liszt commented to Chopin's biographer Frederick Niecks that Marie d'Agoult and Aurore Dupin had frequently disagreed, and the musicians had felt obliged to side with their respective partners. Alex Szilasi suggests that Chopin took offence at an equivocal 1841 review by Liszt, and was perhaps jealous of Liszt's popularity, while Liszt in turn may have been jealous of Chopin's reputation as a serious composer.\nVery shortly after Chopin's death in 1849, Liszt had a monument erected in his memory and began to write a biography. Chopin's relatives and friends found the timing of this insensitive, and many declined to help with Liszt's enquiries.\nScholars disagree on the extent to which Chopin and Liszt influenced each other's compositions. Charles Rosen identifies similarities between Chopin's \u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 9 and the early version of Liszt's Transcendental \u00c9tude No. 10, but Alan Walker argues that no such connection exists. Stylistic similarities between other studies, Chopin's \"Nocturnes\" and Liszt's \"Consolations\", and even an influence on the ornamentation and fingering of Liszt's works, have been proposed.\nRobert and Clara Schumann.\nIn 1837 Liszt wrote a positive review of Robert Schumann's \"Impromptus\" and piano sonatas no. 1 and no. 3. The two began to correspond, and the following year he met Schumann's fianc\u00e9e Clara Wieck, to whom he dedicated the early version of \"Grandes \u00e9tudes de Paganini\". Schumann in turn dedicated \"Fantasie in C\" to Liszt. The two met for the first time in Dresden in 1840.\nSchumann resigned as editor of the music journal \"Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik\" in 1844, ten years after founding it. The journal was taken over the following year by Franz Brendel, who used it to publicise and support Liszt's New German School, to Schumann's chagrin. In 1848 Liszt attended a performance of the Piano Trio No. 1 being held in his honour in the Schumanns' home. Liszt arrived two hours late with Wagner (who had not been invited), derided the piece, and spoke ill of the recently deceased Mendelssohn. This upset the Schumanns, and Robert physically assaulted Liszt.\nThe relationship between Liszt and the couple remained frosty. Liszt dedicated his 1854 piano sonata to Robert, who had by that point been committed to a mental institution in Endenich. Clara asked for Liszt's help that year in finding a performance venue in order to earn an income. Liszt arranged an all-Schumann concert with Clara as the star performer and published an extremely positive review, but Clara did not express any gratitude. In a posthumous edition of Robert's works, Clara changed the dedication of the \"Fantasie\" from Liszt to herself. After Liszt's death, she wrote in her diary \"He was an eminent keyboard virtuoso but a dangerous example for the young... As a composer he was terrible.\"\nRichard Wagner.\nWagner first met Liszt in Paris in 1841, while living in poverty after fleeing Riga to escape creditors. Liszt was at this point a famous pianist, whereas Wagner was unknown; unlike Wagner, Liszt did not remember the meeting. In 1844 Liszt attended a performance of Wagner's first major success, the opera \"Rienzi\", in Dresden. The two met in Berlin at the instigation of Wilhelmine Schr\u00f6der-Devrient, and Wagner later sent Liszt the scores of \"Rienzi\" and \"Tannh\u00e4user\" in an attempt to elicit approval. Liszt settled in Weimar in 1848, and the two grew close, Wagner still being located in Dresden. Wagner wrote to Liszt a number of times soliciting financial help.\nIn 1849 Liszt sheltered Wagner after the latter's involvement in the failed May Uprising in Dresden. Liszt arranged a false passport and lent Wagner money to allow him to escape Germany for Switzerland, and for the next ten years continued to send money and visit, as well as petition officials for a pardon which eventually came in 1860.\nTo publicise Wagner's music, Liszt staged \"Tannh\u00e4user\" in 1849, for the first time outside Dresden, and published two transcriptions from it, writing to Wagner \"Once and for all, number me in future among your most zealous and devoted admirers; near or far, count on me and make use of me.\" In 1850 he arranged the premiere of \"Lohengrin\", which Wagner dedicated to Liszt, and he also mounted performances of \"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\". Liszt had intended to dedicate the 1857 \"Dante Symphony\" to Wagner, but upon being told this Wagner replied that, while a fine piece, he would prefer to receive money. Liszt was offended by this comment, and did not publish the dedication.\nBy 1864 Wagner had begun an affair with Liszt's daughter Cosima, who was married to Liszt's erstwhile pupil Hans von B\u00fclow. Liszt disapproved of the relationship and broke off contact with the couple for a number of years, only learning of their 1870 marriage from the newspapers. Nevertheless, the relationship recovered: Liszt contributed financially to the building of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in 1871, and he began to correspond with Wagner and Cosima again, frequently visiting their home Wahnfried. Liszt died in 1886 while at the latest incarnation of the Bayreuth Festival, dedicated to Wagner's work, Wagner having died three years previously.\nSimilarities have been suggested between Wagner's \"Faust Overture\" and Liszt's \"Faust Symphony\", but Liszt claimed that the likenesses of the themes were coincidental. Scholars also note a similarity between the opening of Liszt's song \"Lorelei\" and the famous \"Tristan chord\" from the opening of Wagner's later opera \"Tristan und Isolde\", although there is no consensus on whether Wagner was influenced by the song. There are similarities in their musical languages, however, and Wagner once even commented to Cosima that he was looking at \"The Bells of the Strasbourg Cathedral\" to ensure he had not overtly plagiarised the work, the opening theme of \"Parsifal\" being very similar to that cantata. Both composers were also prominent members of the New German School.\nPianist.\nAt his performing peak Liszt was considered the greatest pianist of his time, and was perhaps one of the greatest who ever lived. His popularity during the \"Lisztomania\" period of the 1840s was unrivalled, and the critic Peter G. Davis has written that \"Perhaps [Liszt] was not the most transcendent virtuoso who ever lived, but his audiences thought he was, and no pianist since has seriously challenged the legend.\"\nPerforming style.\nLiszt's performance style changed throughout his life, in his interpretive decisions as well as his physicality (the young Liszt was extremely animated at the keyboard, but in old age he was very still). No known recordings of Liszt exist, so to get an impression of his style scholars must go by contemporary writings and the output of his pupils, while allowing for a certain amount of mythologising around his extraordinary talent.\nFrom a young age Liszt had displayed an aptitude for improvisation and sight reading. Czerny observed that Liszt was a natural who played according to feeling\u2014\"one saw that Nature herself had formed a pianist.\" Liszt's fourteen months under Czerny solidified his technical skills as he enthusiastically studied exercises and works. In later life, however, he would express the opinion that despite his work under Czerny his early training had been unfocused, and he had excelled mainly \"by force of personality\". Reviews of his early concerts especially praise the brilliance, strength, and precision in his playing. At least one also mentions his ability to keep absolute tempo.\nOne of the most detailed descriptions of his playing from that time comes from the diary entries of Caroline Boissier-Butini, whose daughter Valerie was a pupil of Liszt's from 1831 to 1832, when he was earning a living primarily as a teacher in Paris:\nBoissier records that Liszt did not keep his hands 'in a rounded position' nor were they 'altogether flat', but rather his fingers were 'so flexible as to possess no fixed position'... Mme Boissier writes that Liszt's 'hand is never unwieldy, for he moves it with grace according to his fancy', then she stresses that 'he does not play with his arms or shoulders'. In a later lesson, Liszt instructed Valerie to play 'without exception, entirely with a wrist action'... without any interference by the arm... Crucially, Liszt emphasised the role of the wrist, not the arm, in producing a full tone for individual notes, and did so not just in relation to octaves or chords.\nDuring his performance career Liszt took unusually bold liberties with the score, changing tempo and adding embellishment at will. In one instance he decided on \"a sudden, drastic slowing down\" while performing the Scherzo movement of Beethoven's Sixth Symphony. In a regretful letter to George Sand from 1837 Liszt admitted that he made such decisions to gain public acclaim:\n[I]n order to wring bravos from the public that is always slow, in its awesome simplicity, to comprehend beautiful things, I had no qualms about changing the tempos of the pieces or the composers' intentions. In my arrogance I even went so far as to add a host of rapid runs and cadenzas, which, by securing ignorant applause for me, sent me off in the wrong direction\u2014one that I fortunately knew enough to abandon quickly... Now I no longer divorce a composition from the era in which it was written, and any claim to embellish or modernize the works of earlier periods seems just as absurd for a musician to make as it would be for an architect, for example, to place a Corinthian capital on the columns of an Egyptian temple.\nDespite his apparent contrition, however, Liszt did continue to make large interpretive changes while performing, although he would be more concerned with fidelity to the score and composer's intentions later in life. He would be more open to pupils revising his own compositions, and he himself often produced different versions of his works over the course of his lifetime. This attitude was in keeping with the shift in audience preferences that began in the 1830s, which started to favour a faithfully rendered memorised performance over the improvisation that Liszt employed in these years.\nCertain information about Liszt's style can be inferred from the writings of his many pupils. Musicologist Kenneth Hamilton identifies several themes which occurred through Liszt's teachings, including avoiding excessive sentimentality, imagining the orchestration of the piece, flexibility of tempo, and the importance of a sense of music. Amy Fay studied under Liszt in his later life, 1869\u20131875, and her writings align with Boissier's four decades earlier. She also notes that Liszt kept his fingers close to the keyboard to achieve a better legato, and that Liszt discouraged unnecessary hand movements, in contrast to his flamboyant gestures during his prime. Notes by his pupil Pauline Fichtener in the 1870s again stress freedom and flexibility of the wrist.\nConcert repertoire.\nUp to 1840, most concerts featuring a solo pianist included other acts, such as an orchestra, singers and ballet. The increasing prominence of the solo piano virtuoso in the 1830s led to other acts on the bill being described as \"assistant artists\", with Liszt declaring his pre-eminence in a letter to a friend dated June 1839: \"Le concert, c'est moi\". Liszt is credited as the first pianist to give solo recitals in the modern sense of the word; the term was first applied to Liszt's concert at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on 9 June 1840.\nDuring his years as a travelling virtuoso Liszt performed an enormous amount of music, usually from memory. He was the first to include the full range of repertoire, from J. S. Bach to Chopin. His concerts included original compositions such as \"Grand galop chromatique\", \"Fantaisie romantique sur deux m\u00e9lodies suisses\" and \"Grande Valse di Bravura\"; and his transcriptions of Schubert's \"Schwanengesang\", \"Symphonie fantastique\" by Berlioz and Beethoven's sixth symphony. Liszt would champion Beethoven's work throughout his life, and his concerts helped popularise the \"Hammerklavier\" sonata and \"Diabelli Variations\".\nInstruments.\nAfter arriving in Paris in 1823, S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard presented Liszt with a grand piano featuring his newly patented double escapement mechanism, a key development in piano technology allowing for faster note repetition. Among the composer's pianos in Weimar were an \u00c9rard, a Bechstein, the Beethovens' Broadwood grand and a Boisselot. It is known that Liszt used Boisselot pianos in his Portugal tour and then later in 1847 in a tour to Kiev and Odessa. Liszt kept the piano at his Villa Altenburg residence in Weimar.\nThe earliest records of Liszt playing the organ date from 1836. He developed an interest in J. S. Bach's organ music in the early 1840s, probably due to Mendelssohn's influence. Later, Liszt commissioned a \"piano-organ\" from the Paris company Alexandre P\u00e8re et Fils. The instrument was made in 1854 under Berlioz's supervision, using an 1853 \u00c9rard piano, and was a combination of piano and harmonium with three manuals and a pedal board. The company called it a \"Liszt piano-harmonium\" and installed it in Villa Altenburg in July 1854; the instrument is now exhibited in the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde collection in Vienna.\nLiszt owned two other organs which were installed later in his Budapest residence. The first was a \"piano-orgue\": this was a smaller version of Weimar's instrument, a combination of a 1864 \u00c9rard piano and a harmonium, with two independent manuals, the upper for the piano and lower for the harmonium, built again by Alexandre P\u00e8re et Fils in 1865. The second was a \"cabinet organ\", a large concert harmonium built by the American company Mason &amp; Hamlin and given to Liszt in 1877.\nWorks.\nLiszt was a prolific composer. He is best known for his piano music, which forms the majority of his oeuvre, but he also wrote for orchestra and for other ensembles. His piano works are often marked by their difficulty. Some of his works are programmatic, based on extra-musical inspirations such as poetry or art. Liszt is credited with the creation of the symphonic poem.\nKeyboard music.\nPiano.\nThe best-known portion of Liszt's music is his original piano work. During the Weimar period he composed the first 15 Hungarian Rhapsodies, themselves revisions of his earlier Magyar Dalok/Rhaps\u00f3di\u00e1k, which were influenced by the Romani bands he heard while visiting Hungary. \"Harmonies po\u00e9tiques et religieuses\", also the result of a long gestation, was published around the same time, and dedicated to Princess Carolyne. Likewise, the six \"Grandes \u00c9tudes de Paganini\" were revised from an earlier 1840 edition and published in 1851; these include the famous piece \"La campanella\". Other notable pieces include the thoroughly revised collections of \"Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage\" (\"Years of Pilgrimage\"), inspired by his travels around Europe; the Piano Sonata in B minor, which has been described as \"one of the most original contributions to sonata form to come out of the 19th century\"; and the \"Transcendental \u00c9tudes\", which are stylistically varied, technically difficult, and have been described as \"Liszt at his most Lisztian\".\nOrgan.\nLiszt wrote his two largest organ works between 1850 and 1855 while he was living in Weimar, a city with a long tradition of organ music, most notably that of J. S. Bach. Humphrey Searle calls these works\u00a0\u2013 the \"Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale \"Ad nos, ad salutarem undam\"\" and the \"Fantasy and Fugue on the Theme B-A-C-H\"\u00a0\u2013 Liszt's \"only important original organ works\"; Derek Watson considered them among the most significant organ works of the nineteenth century, heralding the work of such key organist-musicians as Reger, Franck and Saint-Sa\u00ebns, among others. Liszt also wrote the monumental set of variations on the first section of the second movement chorus from Bach's cantata \"Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12\" (which Bach later reworked as the \"\" in the Mass in B minor), which he composed after the death of his daughter in 1862. He also wrote a Requiem for organ solo, intended to be performed liturgically during the service of the spoken Requiem Mass.\nTranscriptions and paraphrases.\nLiszt coined the terms \"transcription\" and \"paraphrase\", the former being a faithful reproduction of the source material and the latter a more free reinterpretation. He wrote substantial quantities of both over the course of his life, and they form a large proportion of his total output\u2014up to half of his solo piano output from the 1830s and 1840s is transcription and paraphrase, and of his total output only approximately a third is completely original. In the mid-19th century, orchestral performances were much less common than they are today and were not available at all outside major cities; thus, Liszt's transcriptions played a major role in popularising a wide array of music such as Beethoven's symphonies. Liszt's transcriptions of Italian opera, Schubert songs and Beethoven symphonies are also significant indicators of his artistic development, the opera allowing him to improvise in concert and the Schubert and Beethoven influence indicating his compositional development towards the Germanic tradition. He also transcribed his own orchestral and choral music for piano in an attempt to make it better known.\nIn addition to piano transcriptions, Liszt also transcribed about a dozen works for organ, such as Otto Nicolai's \"Ecclesiastical Festival Overture on the chorale \"Ein feste Burg\"\", Orlando di Lasso's motet \"Regina coeli\" and excerpts of Bach's Cantata No. 21 and Wagner's \"Tannh\u00e4user\".\nSongs.\nToday, Liszt's songs are relatively obscure. There are 137 secular vocal pieces, 82 of which were original songs with piano accompaniment, mostly composed in the 1840s. In most cases the lyrics are in German, but there are also some in Italian and French, three in Hungarian and one in each of Russian and English. The influence of Italian opera can be seen in the songs' use of arioso and recitative styles. While in Weimar Liszt coached the Court Opera singers, and several prominent musicians sang his songs, including Rosa and Hans von Milde.\nProgram music.\nLiszt coined the term \"program music\" in an 1855 essay on Berlioz's \"Harold in Italy\", referring to pieces which are \"driven by an overarching poetic image or narrative\" (in the case of \"Harold in Italy\", the piece \"describes\" the scenes witnessed by the character Harold as he travels through Italy). This is presented in opposition to absolute music, which stands for itself and is intended to be appreciated without any particular reference to the outside world. This was not a new idea\u00a0\u2013 such pieces had been written since the early 18th century, and Liszt himself had written works such as the early version of \"Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage\" which invoked his experiences travelling\u00a0\u2013 but he presented the novel argument that program music was artistically superior, counter to the prevailing view that such work was unserious. This developed into the idea that the historical development of music as an art form was destined to move from absolute to representational: Beethoven's symphonies had mostly been non-representational, but his ninth symphony had included some extramusical elements, and Berlioz had taken this further with \"Harold in Italy\" and \"Symphonie fantastique\". Wagner saw these developments as a stepping stone to the all-encompassing , and in this sense Liszt's programmatic works were part of his vision of the \"Music of the Future\".\nLiszt's main contribution to program music was his thirteen symphonic poems, one-movement orchestral works in which some extramusical program or idea provides a narrative or illustrative element. The first twelve of these were written between 1848 and 1858, and the most well-known are \"Les pr\u00e9ludes\" and \"Mazeppa\". The symphonic poems were poorly received by critics, especially in Weimar, where Liszt was residing at the time\u2014they criticised Liszt's compositional style as well as the whole idea of program music as the future of music.\nBelieving in the power of music to transcend people's typical quotidian existence, with his program music Liszt attempted to \"elevate listeners to a higher realm of consciousness\". He argued that its purpose was less to do with depicting a specific scene or experience, and more about allowing the listener to reach a higher state of existence. Such music would act as a more direct method of communication than language, allowing people to share exactly their own experiences. This view was endorsed by Franz Brendel, Wagner and Friedrich Theodor Vischer.\nLate works.\nLiszt's final period is considered to have started from about 1869, during which he wrote a number of short and independent works, such as the collection \"Weihnachtsbaum\" and a piano version of \"Via crucis\", although he did continue to write transcriptions and paraphrases as well as sacred vocal music. Studies of his output from this period typically focus on pieces which display a willingness to push the boundaries of tonality and have an association with death and mourning, such as \"La lugubre gondola\" and \"Unstern!\". The morbid focus on loss may be ascribed to Liszt's mental state in his final decade, when he suffered episodes of depression. Many of these pieces remained unpublished in Liszt's lifetime.\nLiszt's experimentation can be seen in his 1881 piece \"Nuages gris\". Its key signature is G minor, but ends in an ambiguous tonality; its texture is generated by a collection of fragments rather than a distinct melody and harmony; and it uses chromaticism and dissonance such as the tritone. Additional examples include \"Czardas macabre\", which repeatedly uses a single melodic motif and rhythm accompanied dissonantly or with open fifths, and \"Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s obstin\u00e9e\", which makes extensive use of false relations. Some of his sacred vocal music also shows this type of experimentation, such as \"Via crucis\", which contains some movements without key signatures and with ambiguous tonality.\nWritings.\nLiszt published a number of prose works and letters over the course of his life, including his 1863 \"Life of Chopin\". Many scholars have doubted that he was their sole author, suggesting that the writings ascribed to Liszt were written partly or solely by Countess Marie d'Agoult or Princess Carolyne, but there is no consensus on this matter. It is known that the programs for some of his symphonic poems were ghost-written.\nOne of Liszt's notable written works was his biography of Chopin, started less than a month after Chopin's funeral. \"F. Chopin\" was serialised in the journal \"La France musicale\" in 1851 and published in book form the following year, having been edited by Carolyne. The book was poorly received. Liszt had approached Chopin's sister Ludwika and pupil Jane Stirling for information, but they had been uncooperative, finding the timing of his enquiries so soon after Chopin's death to be insensitive. As a result, the work contained several factual inaccuracies. Nevertheless George Sand, who features prominently in one of the chapters, admired the book. English translations garnered attention in the US and UK over the subsequent two decades, leading to a second edition in 1879. Once again Liszt asked Carolyne to help, but her contribution was so extensive that Liszt considered it over-involvement, going so far as to describe the book as having been \"written by Carolyne\".\nOne significant essay by Liszt is (\"On the situation of artists\"), which was serialised in the Parisian \"Gazette musicale\" in 1835. This work calls for the reform of theatres: Liszt perceived the physical buildings to be unsafe and unpleasant, and their managers to be incompetent. He argues that they would book the cheapest variety of acts without concern for artistic merit, leading to subpar concert experiences. Furthermore, owners would blacklist performers who had appeared at a rival venue. Liszt was also concerned about the lack of professionalism of educational institutions, which were run by unqualified teachers and charged high tuition. In his view, their courses lacked rigour, and had an undue preference for older music over that of living composers.\nDuring his Weimar years, Liszt wrote essays for audiences on \"Harold in Italy\", \"Lohengrin\" and \"Alfonso und Estrella\". In addition he wrote the book (translated as \"The Gypsy in Music\") about the Romani and their influence on Hungarian folk music. This work proved controversial in the country, with Hungarians disputing Liszt's assertion that Romani communities were responsible for a large contribution to the native music. The second edition, published in 1881, contains antisemitic passages included by Princess Carolyne.\nLiszt also worked until at least 1885 on a treatise on modern harmony entitled \"Sketches for a Harmony of the Future\". Arthur Friedheim, a pupil of Liszt's at the time, remembered seeing it among Liszt's papers at Weimar. Liszt told Friedheim that the time was not yet ripe to publish the manuscript. This treatise has since been lost.\nLegacy.\nCompositions.\nRomantic music generally fell out of favour during the first half of the 20th century, as composers such as Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Bart\u00f3k took the art form in new directions. Liszt's music seemed \"flamboyant and excessive\" in contrast with their leaner styles, and his work had neither become part of the established canon nor received credit for being avant-garde. His piano music received attention from few pianists during this period, and only a few select popular pieces such as the \"Liebestr\u00e4ume\" and \"Hungarian Rhapsodies\" were published in collections. Two notable champions were Ferruccio Busoni, who delivered all-Liszt recitals in Berlin in 1904\u20131905 and 1911, and Humphrey Searle, who organised concerts of Liszt's chamber and orchestral music in the 1930s and 1940s. Of his orchestral works, only \"Les pr\u00e9ludes\" and the \"Faust Symphony\" were performed regularly.\nDuring the Romantic Revival of the 1950s Liszt's works and writings received greater attention, and scholars now appreciate the wide range and originality of his compositions. In the decades since, recordings of the vast majority of his output have become available, and a complete edition of scores is being published, to modernise the previous such collection published by Breitkopf &amp; H\u00e4rtel in 1907\u20131936. Liszt competitions occur across the world, and Liszt societies promote his work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe great artist's true significance was revealed to me at last. I came to recognize that, for the continued development of musical art, his compositions were more important than either Wagner's or Strauss's.\nB\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k on Liszt\nScholar James Deaville writes that \"few composers of the nineteenth century, except possibly Wagner, had the same influence upon succeeding generations as Liszt did. Indeed, one is hard-pressed to think of an innovative composer of the early twentieth century who was not influenced by Liszt's music, especially in its departures from traditional harmonies and novel approaches to form and formal unity\". Prokofiev admired Liszt's concertos, which influenced his own, and Stravinsky remarked that he had \"admiration for the great Liszt whose immense talent in composition is underrated.\" Liszt's piano music had a strong influence on the Impressionistic music of Debussy and Ravel; one example is Debussy's \"L'isle joyeuse\", which has clear similarities with \"Les jeux d'eaux \u00e0 la villa d'Este\", a piece he heard Liszt perform in 1884. Liszt also had a marked influence on early 20th-century Hungarian composers, especially Kod\u00e1ly with his \"Psalmus Hungaricus\", Dohn\u00e1nyi in his second string quartet, and Bart\u00f3k, who admired Liszt's works greatly. Liszt's method of using Hungarian folk music in his compositions was developed further by these composers and their successors, who integrated such themes more subtly and valued the authenticity of the source material to a greater extent.\nIt is now held that many of Liszt's late compositions, such as \"Nuages gris\", \"Les jeux d'eaux \u00e0 la villa d'Este\" and \"Czardas macabre\", anticipated future developments. Liszt often used symmetrical pitch collections, which equally divide octaves, such as tritones, whole tone and octatonic scales. These collections, as well as the use of parallel fifths, unresolved dissonances, and parallel diminished and augmented triads, predate similar compositional techniques used by Ravel and Bart\u00f3k. Liszt helped develop chromatic tonality in many ways. He pioneered a tonal language of building chords in fourths, which was a technique later used by Schoenberg. But, tonality was not the only area that he experimented with, as he was also creative with forms. For example, he combined sonata and four-movement symphonic forms in his Sonata in B Minor. However, many of Liszt's late works were not available until the publication of Jos\u00e9 Vianna da Motta's final volume of Liszt's solo pieces in 1927, so much of his more radical experimentation cannot have influenced composers before then.\nLiszt's invention of the symphonic poem had an impact across Europe from the last years of his life through to the 1920s. His friend Saint-Sa\u00ebns wrote \"Le Rouet d'Omphale\" in 1869 and \"La jeunesse d'Hercule\" in 1877; Smetana, another friend, wrote \"M\u00e1 vlast\" in the 1870s. Franck, d'Indy, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Debussy all wrote symphonic poems in the 1880s and 1890s. Sibelius was introduced to the music of Liszt through his teacher Martin Wegelius, and the influence of Liszt's symphonic poems is seen in Sibelius' \"Kullervo\" and \"En saga\". Richard Strauss also wrote his notable collection of tone poems around this time, and these are similarly indebted to Liszt.\nLiszt is also credited with several proto-cinematic innovations which anticipate Wagner's more widely recognised status as the 'father of cinema', such as audio-visual performance practices and cinematic listening.\nTeaching.\nFrom 1827 until the last month of his life, Liszt gave lessons in composition and piano playing. He wrote in 1829 that his schedule was \"so full of lessons that each day, from half-past eight in the morning till 10 at night, I have scarcely breathing time\". Estimates of the total number of pupils he taught range as high as over 400, although some of these may only have had one lesson, or perhaps even none at all.\nIn Weimar Liszt pioneered the concept of the masterclass, in which he would instruct each pupil in turn while the others observed. Students from this time included Karl Tausig, Hans von B\u00fclow, Karl Klindworth and Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff. Members of these classes would also accompany Liszt to concerts and other events. In later years some in Weimar would criticise the masterclasses as a vanity club more interested in praising Liszt than in learning pianistic excellence, although Carl Lachmund commented that the success of many of its pupils, such as Arthur Friedheim, Moriz Rosenthal, Frederic Lamond and Alexander Siloti, proved the groups' effectiveness.\nLiszt offered his students little technical advice, expecting them to \"wash their dirty linen at home\", as he phrased it. Instead, he focused on musical interpretation with a combination of anecdote, metaphor, and wit. He advised one student tapping out the opening chords of Beethoven's \"Waldstein\" Sonata, \"Do not chop beefsteak for us.\" To another who blurred the rhythm in Liszt's \"Gnomenreigen\": \"There you go, mixing salad again.\" Liszt also wanted to avoid creating carbon copies of himself, believing instead in preserving his pupils' artistic individuality. This was in contrast to his contemporaries, who focused on drilling students in a uniform approach.\nLiszt did not charge for lessons. He was troubled when German newspapers revealed that pedagogue Theodor Kullak had earned more than one million marks from teaching: \"As an artist, you do not rake in a million marks without performing some sacrifice on the altar of Art\". He wrote an open letter to Kullak's sons, published in the \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\", urging them to create an endowment for needy musicians, as Liszt himself frequently did.\nHungary.\nOn 25 March 2011, Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport officially adopted its name in honour of the Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nScores\nBooks"}

He was the second of the German pontiffs nominated by Emperor Henry III. A native of Bavaria, he was the third German to become pope and had one of the shortest papal reigns.\nUpon the death of Clement II, envoys from Rome were sent to the emperor to ascertain who should be named pope. Henry named the bishop of Brixen, Poppo de' Curagnoni. While the envoys were away, the former pope Benedict IX reasserted himself and with the assistance of the disaffected Margrave Boniface III of Tuscany once again assumed the papacy. Henry ordered Boniface to escort Poppo to Rome, but Boniface declined, pointing out that the Romans had already enthroned Benedict. Enraged, the emperor ordered the margrave to depose Benedict or suffer the consequences. Poppo became pope in mid-July but died less than a month later, in Palestrina.\nEarly life.\nBorn into an ancient Bavarian House of Babonen, Poppo was a younger son of Count Poppo II von Rott. He became the Bishop of Brixen in Tyrol in 1040, upon nomination by King Henry III. He was already consecrated by 16 January 1040. Poppo was also a key advisor to King Henry III of Germany and travelled with him to Italy for his imperial coronation in 1046.\nImperial intervention.\nIn 1046, the city of Rome was in chaos. It had three popes, Benedict IX, Sylvester III, and Gregory VI, one at St. Peter's, one at the Lateran, and a third at S. Maria Maggiore. There was street fighting between inhabitants of the city proper and the inhabitants of the Trastevere region. Pope Gregory VI's archdeacon, Peter, took matters into his own hands, summoned a Roman synod, and sent representatives to the Emperor Henry III, begging for aid to restore order. Henry, who was looking forward to his imperial coronation in Rome, needed one, clear, universally acknowledged pope to perform the ceremony. He left Augsburg, therefore, and was in Verona in the second week of September 1046. There he held a military review. He then moved to Pavia, where he was in residence by 25 October 1046, and where he held both a \"synodale concilium\" and a \"populare iudicium\". One of the bishops present at the synod was Poppo of Brixen. On 25 November, the King was in Lucca, and on 1 December at San Genesio, near San Miniato. Finally he reached Sutri, only 56\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) from Rome. There he summoned a synod on 20 December 1046, which came to be attended by 1046 bishops and by the Roman clergy. The three papal claimants were ordered to appear, and Gregory VI and Sylvester III did so. Gregory was compelled to recite the circumstances of his election, which seemed to many of the bishops to be simoniacal; realizing the depth of his difficulties, Gregory resigned his papal office and claims. Sylvester was deposed, and ordered to a monastery. Benedict had already fled to his relatives in Tusculum. The imperial party then moved on to Rome, where another synod was held on 23 and 24 December. The once deposed, and anathematized, Benedict IX, was again deposed, as were the other two already deposed claimants, and the throne of Peter declared vacant. Henry acknowledged the right of the Romans to elect their own bishop, absent an emperor. but the Roman senators begged the emperor to give them a suitable candidate. Henry first named Bishop Adalbert of Hamburg and Bremen, but he declined. Then the King named Bishop Suidger of Bamberg in Bavaria, who was elected on Christmas Eve as Clement II. Both pope and emperor were crowned next day. Clement died less than ten months later, on 9 October 1047, at the abbey of S. Tommaso near Pesaro.\nImperial nomination of Poppo.\nHenry III in 1046 had displayed his imperial power by intervening against Pope Gregory VI and installing Clement II, The Roman \"plebs\", acknowledging that power, sent an embassy to the emperor, which found Henry, who had been engaged in an indecisive campaign in Frisia, in his palace at P\u00f6hlde in Saxony shortly before Christmas Day of 1047. They notified the emperor of Clement's death and asked him, in his capacity as patricius of the Romans, to appoint a successor. The envoys, following their instructions, suggested as a suitable candidate Halinard, Archbishop of Lyon, who was a fluent speaker of Italian, and was well respected in Rome.\nHenry was unwilling to rush matters, and so asked Wazo of Li\u00e8ge, the most independent bishop within the empire, who ought to be made pope. After careful consideration, Wazo declared that the most appropriate candidate for the vacant papal throne was the man the emperor had removed \u2013 Gregory VI. Wazo's deliberations had taken time, and Henry soon lost patience. Henry instead appointed Poppo, bishop of Brixen in Tyrol, a proud man of distinguished learning who had taken part in the Synod of Sutri. This decision antagonized the Romans, who were still pushing for Halinard to become the new pope. Nevertheless, Henry sent the Roman envoys back to Rome with presents to prepare for the arrival of their new pope.\nArrival in Italy.\nDuring the envoys\u2019 absence, imperial authority in Rome became virtually extinguished as the Tusculan faction reasserted its power. A former pope, Benedict IX, residing at Tusculum, had been watching the situation in Rome intently, and had decided that now was his opportunity to reclaim the papal throne. He approached the Margrave Boniface III of Tuscany for help, and Boniface, who did not like the emperor, was easily convinced to help anyone who would disrupt Henry's authority. After Benedict had used his extensive supply of gold to gain a large number of followers, the margrave's influence enabled him to occupy the papal throne for over eight months, from 8 November 1047 until 17 July 1048.\nIn the meantime, Henry was marching down towards Italy with Poppo, accompanying him at least as far as Ulm, where they were in residence on 25 January 1048. Here it came to light that the papal exchequer was close to bankrupt, and so Poppo was allowed to retain the revenues of his see. In addition, a deed was drawn up on 25 January 1048 that granted Poppo an important forest in the Puster Valley, some 75\u00a0km east of Brixen. Having done this, and unable to leave Germany in case there might be an uprising during his absence, Henry III directed Margrave Boniface of Tuscany to conduct the pope-designate to Rome in person, and in the emperor's name to arrange for the enthroning of the new pope.\nGiven his role in the usurpation by Benedict IX, and his attitude towards Henry III, it is unsurprising that Boniface at first refused, advising Poppo when he entered Tuscany, \"I cannot go to Rome with you. The Romans have again installed Benedict, and he has won over the whole city to his cause. Besides, I am now an old man.\" Having nowhere to turn, and unable to proceed, Poppo had no choice but to turn around and return to Germany, where he informed Henry of what had transpired.\nPapal coronation.\nUpon receiving the news, Henry was furious. Poppo was quickly sent back to Boniface, carrying with him a letter from the emperor which ordered Boniface to arrange the expulsion of Benedict and the enthroning of his successor. Henry was simple and direct. \"Learn, you who have restored a pope who was canonically deposed, and who have been led by love of money to despise my commands; learn that, if you do not amend your ways, I will soon come and make you.\" These threats soon reduced Boniface to obedience. He sent a body of troops into Rome and forcibly expelled Benedict from the city.\nAfter Benedict IX's removal, Poppo entered the city, as the Romans, with demonstrations of joy, welcomed the bishop who would be pope. He was enthroned at the Lateran as Pope Damasus II on 17 July 1048. His pontificate, however, was of short duration. Rumors circulated that he had been poisoned, allegedly by a man named Gerhard Brazutus, a friend of Benedict IX and a follower of Hildebrand. However, the source for this information is suspect. He retired to Palestrina. After a brief reign of twenty-three days, he died on 9 August 1048. A modern conjecture is that he died of malaria.\nPope Damasus II was buried in San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, according to Onuphrio Panvinio, the 16th century \"scriptor\" in the Vatican Library. The sarcophagus in which Damasus' body had been placed, and which was moved at least twice, was large and \"adorned with reliefs representing a vineyard, with cupids as the wine gatherers.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67393", "revid": "51007369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67393", "title": "West Africa", "text": "Westernmost region of Africa\nWest Africa, also known as Western Africa, is the westernmost region of Africa. The United Nations defines Western Africa as the 16 countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo, as well as Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (a United Kingdom Overseas Territory). As of 2021, the population of West Africa is estimated at million, and approximately 382 million in 2017, of which 189.7 million were female and 192.3 million male. The region is one of the fastest growing in Africa, both demographically and economically.\nHistorically, West Africa was home to several powerful states and empires that controlled regional trade routes, including the Mali and Gao Empires. Positioned at a crossroads of trade between North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, the region supplied goods such as gold, ivory, and advanced iron-working. During European exploration, local economies were incorporated into the Atlantic slave trade, which expanded existing systems of slavery. Even after the end of the slave trade in the early 19th century, colonial powers \u2014 especially France and Britain \u2014 continued to exploit the region through colonial relationships. For example, they continued exporting extractive goods like cocoa, coffee, tropical timber, and mineral resources. Since gaining independence, several West African nations, such as the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal \u2014 have taken active roles in regional and global economies.\nWest Africa has a rich ecology, with significant biodiversity across various regions. Its climate is shaped by the dry Sahara to the north and east \u2014 producing the Harmattan winds \u2014 and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west, which brings seasonal monsoons. This climatic mix creates a range of biomes, from tropical forests to drylands, supporting species such as pangolins, rhinoceroses, and elephants. However, West Africa's environment faces major threats due to deforestation, biodiversity loss, overfishing, pollution from mining, plastics, and climate change.\nHistory.\nThe history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods: first, its prehistory, in which the first human settlers arrived, developed agriculture, and made contact with peoples to the north; the second, the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-Africa, and extra-Africa trade, and developed centralized states; third, major polities flourished, which would undergo an extensive history of contact with non-Africans; fourth, the colonial period, in which Great Britain and France controlled nearly the entire region; and fifth, the post-independence era, in which the current nations were formed.\nPrehistory.\nWest African populations were considerably mobile and interacted with one another throughout the population history of West Africa. Acheulean tool-using archaic humans may have dwelled throughout West Africa since at least between 780,000 BP and 126,000 BP (Middle Pleistocene). During the Pleistocene, Middle Stone Age peoples (e.g., Iwo Eleru people, possibly Aterians), who dwelled throughout West Africa between MIS 4 and MIS 2, were gradually replaced by incoming Late Stone Age peoples, who migrated into West Africa as an increase in humid conditions resulted in the subsequent expansion of the West African forest. West African hunter-gatherers occupied western Central Africa (e.g., Shum Laka) earlier than 32,000 BP, dwelled throughout coastal West Africa by 12,000 BP, and migrated northward between 12,000 BP and 8000 BP as far as Mali, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania.\nDuring the Holocene, Niger-Congo speakers independently created pottery in Ounjougou, Mali \u2013 the earliest pottery in Africa \u2013 by at least 9400 BCE, and along with their pottery, as well as wielding independently invented bows and arrows, migrated into the Central Sahara, which became their primary region of residence by 10,000 BP. The emergence and expansion of ceramics in the Sahara may be linked with the origin of Round Head and Kel Essuf rock art, which occupy rockshelters in the same regions (e.g., Djado, Acacus, Tadrart). Hunters in the Central Sahara farmed, stored, and cooked undomesticated central Saharan flora, underwent domestication of antelope, and domesticated and shepherded Barbary sheep. After the Kel Essuf Period and Round Head Period of the Central Sahara, the Pastoral Period followed. Some of the hunter-gatherers who created the Round Head rock art may have adopted pastoral culture, and others may have not. As a result of increasing aridification of the Green Sahara, Central Saharan hunter-gatherers and cattle herders may have used seasonal waterways as the migratory route taken to the Niger River and Chad Basin of West Africa. In 2000 BCE, \"Thiaroye Woman\", also known as the \"Venus of Thiaroye\", may have been the earliest statuette created in Sub-Saharan West Africa; it may have particularly been a fertility statuette, created in the region of Senegambia, and may be associated with the emergence of complexly organized pastoral societies in West Africa between 4000 BCE and 1000 BCE. Though possibly developed as early as 5000 BCE, Nsibidi may have also developed in 2000 BCE, as evidenced by depictions of the West African script on Ikom monoliths at Ikom, in Nigeria. Migration of Saharan peoples south of the Sahelian region resulted in seasonal interaction with and gradual absorption of West African hunter-gatherers, who primarily dwelt in the savannas and forests of West Africa. In West Africa, which may have been a major regional cradle in Africa for the domestication of crops and animals, Niger-Congo speakers domesticated the helmeted guineafowl between 5500 BP and 1300 BP; domestication of field crops occurred throughout various locations in West Africa, such as yams (d. praehensilis) in the Niger River basin between eastern Ghana and western Nigeria (northern Benin), rice (oryza glaberrima) in the Inner Niger Delta region of Mali, pearl millet (cenchrus americanus) in northern Mali and Mauritania, and cowpeas in northern Ghana. After having persisted as late as 1000 BP, or some period of time after 1500 CE, remaining West African hunter-gatherers, many of whom dwelt in the forest-savanna region, were ultimately acculturated and admixed into the larger groups of West African agriculturalists, akin to the migratory Bantu-speaking agriculturalists and their encounters with Central African hunter-gatherers.\nEmpires.\nThe development of the region's economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form, beginning with Dhar Tichitt that began in 1600 B.C. followed by Djenn\u00e9-Djenno beginning in 300 B.C. This was then succeeded by the Ghana Empire that first flourished roughly between the 2nd and 12th centuries C.E., which later gave way to the Mali Empire. In current-day Mauritania, there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C., and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mand\u00e9 peoples. Also, based on the archaeology of the city of Kumbi Saleh in modern-day Mauritania, the Mali empire came to dominate much of the region until its defeat by Almoravid invaders in 1052.\nThree great kingdoms were identified in \"Bilad al-Sudan\" by the ninth century. They included Ghana, Gao and Kanem.\nThe Sosso Empire sought to fill the void but was defeated (c.\u20091240) by the Mandinka forces of Sundiata Keita, founder of the new Mali Empire. The Mali Empire continued to flourish for several centuries, most particularly under Sundiata's grandnephew Musa I, before a succession of weak rulers led to its collapse under Mossi, Tuareg and Songhai invaders. In the 15th century, the Songhai would form a new dominant state based on Gao, in the Songhai Empire, under the leadership of Sonni Ali and Askia Mohammed.\nMeanwhile, south of Sudan, strong city-states arose in Igboland, such as the 10th-century Kingdom of Nri, which helped birth the arts and customs of the Igbo people, Bono State in the 11th century, which gave birth to the numerous Akan States, while Ife rose to prominence around the 12th century. Further east, Oyo arose as the dominant Yoruba state and the Aro Confederacy as a dominant Igbo state in modern-day Nigeria.\nThe Kingdom of Nri was a West African medieval state in present-day southeastern Nigeria and a subgroup of the Igbo people. The Kingdom of Nri was unusual in the history of world government in that its leader exercised no military power over his subjects. The kingdom existed as a sphere of religious and political influence over a third of Igboland and was administered by a priest-king called an Eze Nri. The Eze Nri managed trade and diplomacy on behalf of the Nri people and possessed divine authority in religious matters.\nThe Oyo Empire was a Yoruba empire of what is today Western, North Central Nigeria and Southern Republic of Benin. Established in the 14th century, the Oyo Empire grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose through the outstanding organizational skills of the Yoruba, wealth gained from trade and its powerful cavalry. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in Yorubaland, but also over nearby African states, notably the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey in the modern Republic of Benin to the west.\nThe Efik Kingdom was also a prominent early Kingdon and the associated Ibibio of the present day Nigeria. Calabar, the seat of the Efik Kingdom was the seat of government of the Southern Protectorate of Nigeria before the amalgamention of veious parts of the present day Nigeiria. For this reason, Calabra is often considered as the first capital city of nigeria, followed by Lagos and now Abuja.\nThe Benin Empire was a post-classical empire located in what is now southern Nigeria. Its capital was Edo, now known as Benin City, Edo. It should not be confused with the modern-day country called Benin, formerly called Dahomey. The Benin Empire was \"one of the oldest and most highly developed states in the coastal hinterland of West Africa, dating perhaps to the eleventh century CE\". The Benin Empire was governed by a sovereign Emperor with hundreds of thousands of soldiers and a powerful council rich in resources, wealth, ancient science and technology with cities described as beautiful and large as Haarlem. \"Olfert Dapper, a Dutch writer, describing Benin in his book \"Description of Africa\" (1668) \". Its craft was the most adored and treasured bronze casting in the history of Africa. It was annexed by the British Empire in 1897 during the invasion and scramble of Africa.\nEuropean contact and enslavement.\nPortuguese traders began establishing settlements along the coast in 1445, followed by the French, English, Spanish, Danish and Dutch; the African slave trade began not long after, which over the following centuries would debilitate the region's economy and population. The slave trade also encouraged the formation of states such as the Bono State, Bambara Empire and Dahomey, whose economic activities include but not limited to exchanging slaves for European firearms.\nColonialism.\nIn the early 19th century, a series of Fulani reformist jihads swept across Western Africa. The most notable include Usman dan Fodio's Fulani Empire, which replaced the Hausa city-states, Seku Amadu's Massina Empire, which defeated the Bambara, and El Hadj Umar Tall's Toucouleur Empire, which briefly conquered much of modern-day Mali.\nHowever, the French and British continued to advance in the Scramble for Africa, subjugating kingdom after kingdom. With the fall of Samory Ture's established Wassoulou Empire in 1898 and the Ashanti queen Yaa Asantewaa in 1902, most West African military resistance to colonial rule resulted in failure.\nPart of the West African regions underwent an increase in the numeracy level throughout the 19th century. The reason for such a growth was predetermined by a number of factors. Namely, the peanut production and trade, which was boosted by the demand of the colonial states. Importantly, the rise of numeracy was higher in the regions which were less hierarchical and had less dependence on the slavery trade (e.g. Sine and Salum). Whereas areas with the opposite trends illustrated opposite tendencies (e.g. central and northern Senegal). Those patterns were further even more stimulated by the French colonial campaign.\nBritain controlled the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria throughout the colonial era, while France unified Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, Ivory Coast, and Niger into French West Africa. Portugal founded the colony of Guinea-Bissau, while Germany claimed Togoland, but was forced to divide it between France and Britain following First World War due to the Treaty of Versailles. Only Liberia retained its independence, at the price of major territorial concessions.\nPostcolonial era.\nFollowing World War II, nationalist movements arose across West Africa. In 1957, Ghana, under Kwame Nkrumah, became the first West African colony to achieve its independence, followed the next year by France's colonies (Guinea in 1958 under the leadership of President Ahmed Sekou Tour\u00e9); by 1974, West Africa's nations were entirely autonomous.\nSince independence, many West African nations have been submerged under political instability, with notable civil wars in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast, and a succession of military coups in Ghana and Burkina Faso.\nSince the end of colonialism, the region has been the stage for some brutal conflicts, including:\nGeopolitical division.\nGeopolitically, the United Nations definition of subregion Western Africa includes the preceding states with the addition of Mauritania (which withdrew from ECOWAS in 1999), comprising an area of approximately 6.1 million square km. The UN region also includes the United Kingdom Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha in the south Atlantic Ocean.\nArea.\nIn the United Nations scheme of African regions, the region of Western Africa includes 16 states and the United Kingdom Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha: Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal and the Niger are mostly in the Sahel, a transition zone between the Sahara desert and the Sudanian Savanna; Benin, Ivory Coast, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria compose most of Guinea, the traditional name for the area near the Gulf of Guinea; Mauritania lies in the Maghreb, the northwestern region of Africa that has historically been inhabited by West African groups such as the Fulani, Soninke, Wolof, Serer and Toucouleur people, along with Arab-Berber Maghrebi people such as the Tuareg; Cape Verde is an island country in the Atlantic Ocean; and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha consists of eight main islands located in four different parts of the Atlantic. Due to Mauritania's increasingly close ties to the Arab World and its 1999 withdrawal from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in modern times it is often considered, especially in Africa, as now part of western North Africa.\nCities.\nMajor and principal cities in West Africa include, geographically eastward:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEnvironment.\nNature.\nBefore European colonisation, West African countries such as those from the Senegambia region (Senegal and the Gambia) used to have a diverse wildlife including lions, hippopotamus, elephants, antelopes, leopards etc. However, during colonization, the European colonizers such as the French and British killed most of the wildlife particularly the lions, using their body parts as trophies. By the turn of the 20th century, the Senegambia region had lost most of its lion population and other exotic animals due to poaching. By the 1930s, the Gambian elephant population became extinct. That phenomenon was not only limited to the Senegambia region but affected much of West Africa as the region lost much of its \"natural resources once tied so closely to its cultural identity. Poaching has stolen most of its wildlife.\" The British issued poaching licenses, and although they would later try to reverse the damage that had been done by attempting to preserve what was left of the local wildlife, but by that time, it was too late. During the 1930s, the elephant population in the Gold Coast was about 300, and Sierra Leone between 500 and 600. Although a small number of elephants survived in Nigeria, hunting, agricultural expansion and clearing of forest in that country drastically affected its wildlife population, particularly elephants.\nDespite the historical damage that has been done to the region's wildlife populations, there are still some protected nature reserves within the region. Some of these include:\nWest Africa is also home to several baobab trees and other plant life. Some baobab trees are several centuries old and form part of the local folklore, for example, a mythical baobab tree named \"Ngoye njuli\" in Senegal which is regarded as a sacred site by the Serer. The tree itself is rather majestic and looks like a huge phallus and a deformed animal or thing is protruding from it. It is said to be the dwelling place of a pangool. Ngoye njuli is protected by the Senegalese authorities and attracts visitors. In West Africa, as in other parts of Africa where the baobab tree is found, the leaves are mixed with couscous and eaten, the bark of the tree is used to make ropes, and the fruit and seeds are used for drinks and oils.\nDeforestation.\nWest Africa is greatly affected by deforestation and has one of the worst deforestation rate. Even \"the beloved baobab tree\" which is viewed as sacred by some West African cultures are under threat due to climate change, urbanization and population growth. \"Huge swaths of forest are being razed to clear space for palm oil and cocoa plantations. Mangroves are being killed off by pollution. Even wispy acacias are hacked away for use in cooking fires to feed growing families.\" Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, have lost large areas of their rainforest. In 2005, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ranked Nigeria as the state with the worst deforestation rate in the entire world. Causes include logging, subsistence agriculture, and the collection of fuelwoods.\nAccording to a ThoughtCo publication authored Steve Nix (2018), almost 90 percent of West Africa's original rainforest has been destroyed, and the rest is \"heavily fragmented and in a degraded state, being poorly used.\"\nOverfishing.\nOverfishing is a major issue in West Africa. Besides reducing fish stocks in the region, it also threatens food security and the livelihoods of many coastal communities that largely depend on artisanal fishing. The overfishing generally comes from foreign trawlers operating in the region.\nTo combat the overfishing, Greenpeace has recommended countries reduce the number of registered trawlers operating in African waters, increase the monitoring and control and set up regional fisheries organizations. Some steps have already been taken in the form of WARFP (the World Bank's West Africa Regional Fisheries Program which empowers west-African countries (i.e. Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cape Verde, and Senegal) with information, training and monitoring systems. Furthermore, Liberia enacted a fisheries regulations Act in 2010 and installed a satellite-based monitoring system and Senegal enacted a fisheries code in 2015. In Cape Verde, the fishermen communities of Palmiera and Santa Maria have organized themselves to protect fishing zones. Mozambique finally created a conservation area, including a coastline.\nGeography and climate.\nWest Africa, broadly defined to include the western portion of the Maghreb (Western Sahara, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), occupies an area in excess of 6,140,000\u00a0km2, or approximately one-fifth of Africa. The vast majority of this land is plains lying less than 300 meters above sea level, though isolated high points exist in numerous states along the southern shore of West Africa.\nThe northern section of West Africa (narrowly defined to exclude the western Maghreb) is composed of semi-arid terrain known as Sahel, a transitional zone between the Sahara and the West Sudanian savanna. Forests form a belt between the savannas and the southern coast, ranging from 160\u00a0km to 240\u00a0km in width.\nThe northwest African region of Mauritania periodically suffers country-wide plagues of locusts which consume water, salt and crops on which the human population relies.\nBackground.\nWest Africa is west of an imagined north\u2013south axis lying close to 10\u00b0 east longitude. The Atlantic Ocean forms the western as well as the southern borders of the West African region. The northern border is the Sahara Desert, with the Ranishanu Bend generally considered the northernmost part of the region. The eastern border is less precise, with some placing it at the Benue Trough, and others on a line running from Mount Cameroon to Lake Chad.\nColonial boundaries are reflected in the modern boundaries between contemporary West African states, cutting across ethnic and cultural lines, often dividing single ethnic groups between two or more states.\nIn contrast to most of Central, Southern, and Southeast Africa, West Africa is not populated by Bantu-speaking peoples.\nTransport.\nRail transport.\nA Trans-ECOWAS project, established in 2007, plans to upgrade railways in this zone. One of the goals of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is the development of an integrated railroad network. Aims include the extension of railways in member countries, the interconnection of previously isolated railways and the standardization of gauge, brakes, couplings, and other parameters. The first line would connect the cities and ports of Lagos, Cotonou, Lom\u00e9 and Accra and would allow the largest container ships to focus on a smaller number of large ports, while efficiently serving a larger hinterland. This line connects gauge and systems, which would require four rail dual gauge, which can also provide standard gauge.\nRoad transport.\nThe \"Trans\u2013West African Coastal Highway\" is a transnational highway project to link 12 West African coastal states, from Mauritania in the north-west of the region to Nigeria in the east, with feeder roads already existing to two landlocked countries, Mali and Burkina Faso.\nThe eastern end of the highway terminates at Lagos, Nigeria. Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) consider its western end to be Nouakchott, Mauritania, or to be Dakar, Senegal, giving rise to these alternative names for the road:\nAir transport.\nThe capitals' airports include:\nOf the sixteen, the most important hub and entry point to West Africa are Kotoka International Airport, and Murtala Muhammed International Airport, offering many international connections.\nHealth.\nWest Africa has made considerable improvement in the health outcomes of its populations, despite the challenges posed by pervasive poverty, epidemic diseases, and food insecurity. The traditional communicable diseases of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis are still the major reasons for mortality. Primary health care is the best answer to curing diseases, as it provides the basic preventive strategies and it reduce the rate of child and maternal morbidity and mortality\u2014two of the most preventable outcomes that can prolong life expectancy at birth. Recently, mental health problems are on the rise in West Africa, as they are in many other world regions. However, the subject is largely a taboo, and professional treatment is still rare.\nCulture.\nDespite the wide variety of cultures in West Africa, from Nigeria through to Senegal, there are general similarities in dress, cuisine, music and culture that are not shared extensively with groups outside the geographic region. This long history of cultural exchange predates the colonization era of the region and can be approximately placed at the time of the Ghana Empire (proper: Wagadou Empire), Mali Empire or perhaps before these empires. West Africa varies a series of tribes and cultures that have combined a diverse regional subculture.\nTraditional architecture.\nThe main traditional styles of building (in conjunction with modern styles) are the distinct Sudano-Sahelian style in inland areas, and the coastal forest styles more reminiscent of other sub-Saharan areas. They differ greatly in construction due to the demands made by the variety of climates in the area, from tropical humid forests to arid grasslands and deserts. Despite the architectural differences, buildings perform similar functions, including the compound structure central to West African family life or the strict distinction between the private and public worlds needed to maintain taboos or social etiquette.\nClothing.\nIn contrast to other parts of the continent south of the Sahara Desert, the concepts of hemming and embroidering clothing have been traditionally common to West Africa for centuries, demonstrated by the production of various breeches, shirts, tunics and jackets. As a result, the people of the region's diverse nations wear a wide variety of clothing with underlying similarities. Typical pieces of West African formal attire include the knee-to-ankle-length, flowing boubou robe, dashiki, and Senegalese kaftan (also known as \"agbada\" and \"babariga\"), which has its origins in the clothing of nobility of various West African empires in the 12th century. Traditional half-sleeved, hip-long, woven smocks or tunics (known as \"fugu\" in Gurunsi, \"riga\" in Hausa) \u2013 worn over a pair of baggy trousers\u2014are another popular garment. In the coastal regions stretching from southern Ivory Coast to Benin, a huge rectangular cloth is wrapped under one arm, draped over a shoulder, and held in one of the wearer's hands\u2014coincidentally, reminiscent of Romans' togas. The best-known of these toga-like garments is the Kente (made by the Akan people of Ghana and Ivory Coast), who wear them as a gesture of national pride.\nCuisine.\nScores of foreign visitors to West African nations (e.g., traders, historians, emigrants, colonists, missionaries) have benefited from its citizens' generosity, and even left with a piece of its cultural heritage, via its foods. West African cuisines have had a significant influence on those of Western civilization for centuries; several dishes of West African origin are currently enjoyed in the Caribbean (such as the West Indies and Haiti); Australia; the US (particularly Louisiana, Virginia, North and South Carolina); Italy; and other countries. Although some of these recipes have been altered to suit the sensibilities of their adopters, they retain a distinct West African essence.\nWest African cuisines include fish (especially among the coastal areas), meat, vegetables, and fruits\u2014most of which are grown by the nation's local farmers. In spite of the obvious differences among the various local cuisines in this multinational region, the foods display more similarities than differences. The small difference may be in the ingredients used. Most foods are cooked via boiling or frying. Commonly featured, starchy vegetables include yams, plantains, cassava, and sweet potatoes. Rice is also a staple food, as is the Serer people's sorghum couscous (called \"\"chereh\"\" in Serer) particularly in Senegal and the Gambia. Jollof rice\u2014originally from the Kingdom of Jolof (now part of modern-day Senegal) but has spread to the Wolofs of Gambia\u2014is also enjoyed in many Western nations, as well; Maf\u00e9 (proper: \"\"tigh-dege-na\"\" or \"domodah\") from Mali (via the Bambara and Mandinka)\u2014a peanut-butter stew served with rice; Akara (fried bean balls seasoned with spices served with sauce and bread) from Nigeria is a favorite breakfast for Gambians and Senegalese, as well as a favorite side snack or side dish in Brazil and the Caribbean just as it is in West Africa. It is said that its exact origin may be from Yorubaland in Nigeria. Fufu (from the Twi language, a dough served with a spicy stew or sauce\u2014for example, okra stew) from Ghana is enjoyed throughout the region and beyond even in Central Africa with their own versions of it. Dishes such as taguella and eghajira. are popular among the Tuareg people.\nRecreation and sports.\nThe board game oware is quite popular in many parts of Southern Africa. The word \"Oware\" originates from the Akan people of Ghana. However, virtually all African peoples have a version of this board game. The major multi-sport event of West Africa is the ECOWAS Games which commenced at the 2012 ECOWAS Games.\nFootball is also a pastime enjoyed by many, either spectating or playing. The major national teams of West Africa, the Ghana national football team, the Ivory Coast national football team, and the Nigeria national football team regularly win the Africa Cup of Nations. Major football teams of West Africa are Asante Kotoko SC and Accra Hearts of Oak SC of the Ghana Premier League, Enyimba International of the Nigerian Premier League and ASEC Mimosas of the Ligue 1 (Ivory Coast). The football governing body of West Africa is the West African Football Union (WAFU) and the major tournament is the West African Club Championship and WAFU Nations Cup, along with the annual individual award of West African Footballer of the Year.\nMusic.\nMbalax, Highlife, Fuji, Afrobeat, and Afrobeats are modern musical genres of West Africa and its diaspora.\nTraditional folk music is also well-preserved. Some types of folk music are religious in nature such as the \"Tassou\" tradition used in Serer religion.\nGriot artists.\nGriot artists and praise-singing is an important musical tradition related to the oral history of West African culture. Traditionally, musical and oral history as conveyed over generations by griots are typical of West African culture in Mande, Wolof, Songhay, Serer and, to some extent, Fula areas in the far west. A hereditary caste occupying the fringes of society, the griots were charged with memorizing the histories of local rulers and personages and the caste was further broken down into music-playing griots (similar to bards) and non-music-playing griots. Like Praise-singers, the griot's main profession was musical acquisition and prowess, and patrons were the sole means of financial support. Modern griots enjoy higher status in the patronage of rich individuals in places such as Mali, Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania and Guinea, and to some extent make up the vast majority of musicians in these countries. Examples of modern popular griot artists include Youssou N'Dour, Mamadou Diabate, Sona Jobareteh, and Toumani Diabate.\nIn other areas of West Africa, primarily among the Hausa, Mossi, Dagomba and Yoruba in the area encompassing Burkina Faso, northern Ghana, Nigeria and Niger, the traditional profession of non-hereditary praise-singers, minstrels, bards and poets play a vital role in extending the public show of power, lineage and prestige of traditional rulers through their exclusive patronage. Like the griot tradition, praise singers are charged with knowing the details of specific historical events and royal lineages, but more importantly need to be capable of poetic improvisation and creativity, with knowledge of traditional songs directed towards showing a patron's financial and political or religious power. Competition between Praise-singing ensembles and artists is high, and artists responsible for any extraordinarily skilled prose, musical compositions, and panegyric songs are lavishly rewarded with money, clothing, provisions and other luxuries by patrons who are usually politicians, rulers, Islamic clerics and merchants; these successful praise-singers rise to national stardom. Examples include Mamman Shata, Souley Konko, Fati Niger, Saadou Bori and Dan Maraya. In the case of Niger, numerous praise songs are composed and shown on television in praise of local rulers, Islamic clerics, and politicians.\nFilm industry.\nNollywood of Nigeria, is the main film industry of West Africa. The Nigerian cinema industry is the second largest film industry in terms of number of annual film productions, ahead of the American film industry in Hollywood. Senegal and Ghana also have long traditions of producing films. The late Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne, the Senegalese film director, producer and writer is from the region, as is the Ghanaian Shirley Frimpong-Manso.\nReligion.\nChristianity.\nChristianity is largely practiced in west Africa Christians. Christianity was largely introduced from the late 18th century onward, when missionaries from European countries brought the religion to the region. West African Christians are predominantly Roman Catholic or Anglican; some Evangelical churches have also been established. Christianity is the predominant religion in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin Republic, Liberia to coastal parts of Sierra Leone and the central and southern part of Nigeria. elements of traditional African religion are mixed with Christianity.\nIslam.\nIslam is largely practiced in the West African interior and the far west coast of the continent and was introduced to the region by traders in the 8th century. Islamic rules on livelihood, values, dress and practices had a profound effect on the populations and cultures in their predominant areas, so much so that the concept of tribalism is less observed by Islamized groups like the Wolof, Hausa, Fula, Songhai, Zarma or Soninke, than they are by non-Islamized groups. Ethnic intermarriage and shared cultural icons are established through a superseded commonality of belief or community, known as ummah. Traditional Muslim areas include Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Guinea, Niger; the upper coast of Sierra Leone the western, northern and far-eastern regions of Burkina Faso; and the northern half of Nigeria.\nAfrican traditional.\nTraditional African religions (noting the many different belief systems) are the oldest belief systems among the populations of this region, and include Akan religion, Yoruba religion, Odinani-Igbo, and Serer religion. They are spiritual creeds that also perform other functions such as preserving the historical and cultural heritage of the people, and \"West African tribal groups\" blend social and religious rituals together to the point where there is usually not \"much distinction\" between them. Although traditional beliefs vary from one place to the next, there are more similarities than differences.\nMost traditional religious organizations \"do not have a formal hierarchy of priests.\" Group rituals are usually overseen by tribal elders who, \"within many cultures\", \"serve as the main religious figures and determine the time, nature, and intricacies of rituals\", or shaman priests who can use magic to heal, control fate, and connect to the spirit world.\nDemographics and languages.\nNative West Africans primarily speak Niger\u2013Congo languages, belonging mostly, though not exclusively, to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found in West Africa. The Niger\u2013Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sudan/Sahel, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, most prominently including the Hausa, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of the Sahel bordering Central Africa. In Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, the nomadic Tuareg speak the Tuareg language, a Berber language. The population of West Africa is estimated at million people as of .\nColonial languages also play a pivotal cultural and political role, being adopted as the official languages of most countries in the region, as well as \"linguae franca\" in communication between the region's various ethnic groups. For historical reasons, Western European languages such as French, English and Portuguese predominate in Southern and Coastal subregions, whilst Arabic (in its Maghrebi varieties) spreads inland northwards.\nArchitecture.\n\"Further information in the sections of Architecture of Africa:\"\nScience and technology.\n\"Further information in the sections of History of science and technology in Africa:\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomic and regional organizations.\nWest African Monetary Union.\nThe West African Monetary Union (or UEMOA from its name in French, \"Union \u00e9conomique et mon\u00e9taire ouest-africaine\") is limited to the eight, mostly Francophone countries that employ the CFA franc as their common currency. The Liptako\u2013Gourma Authority of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso seeks to jointly develop the contiguous areas of the three countries.\nWomen's peace movement.\nSince the adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 in 2000, women have been engaged in rebuilding war-torn Africa. Starting with the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace and Women in Peacebuilding Network (WIPNET), the peace movement has grown to include women across West Africa.\nEstablished on 8 May 2006, Women Peace and Security Network \u2013 Africa (WIPSEN-Africa), is a women-focused, women-led Pan-African non-governmental organization based in Ghana. The organization focuses on empowering women to have a role in political and peace governance in Africa. It has a presence in Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Regional leaders of nonviolent resistance include Leymah Gbowee, Comfort Freeman, and Aya Virginie Toure.\n\"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\" is a documentary film about the origin of this peace movement. The film has been used as an advocacy tool in post-conflict zones like Sudan and Zimbabwe, mobilizing African women to petition for peace and security.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, in the English language, the words \"begin\", \"start\", \"commence\", and \"initiate\" are all synonyms of one another: they are \"synonymous\". The standard test for synonymy is substitution: one form can be replaced by another in a sentence without changing its meaning.\nWords may often be synonymous in only one particular sense: for example, \"long\" and \"extended\" in the context \"long time\" or \"extended time\" are synonymous, but \"long\" cannot be used in the phrase \"extended family\".\nSynonyms with exactly the same meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. The former are sometimes called cognitive synonyms and the latter, near-synonyms, plesionyms or poecilonyms.\nLexicography.\nSome lexicographers claim that no synonyms have exactly the same meaning (in all contexts or social levels of language) because etymology, orthography, phonic qualities, connotations, ambiguous meanings, usage, and so on make them unique. Different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: \"feline\" is more formal than \"cat\"; \"long\" and \"extended\" are only synonyms in one usage and not in others (for example, a \"long arm\" is not the same as an \"extended arm\"). Synonyms are also a source of euphemisms.\nMetonymy can sometimes be a form of synonymy: \"the White House\" is used as a synonym of \"the administration\" in referring to the U.S. executive branch under a specific president. Thus, a metonym is a type of synonym, and the word \"metonym\" is a hyponym of the word \"synonym\".\nThe analysis of synonymy, polysemy, hyponymy, and hypernymy is inherent to taxonomy and ontology in the information science senses of those terms. It has applications in pedagogy and machine learning, because they rely on word-sense disambiguation.\nEtymology.\nThe word is borrowed from Latin ', in turn borrowed from Ancient Greek ' (), composed of ' ( 'together, similar, alike') and \"--\" (), a form of ' ( 'name').\nSources.\nSynonyms are often from the different strata making up a language. For example, in English, Norman French superstratum words and Old English substratum words continue to coexist. Thus, today there exist synonyms like the Norman-derived \"people\", \"liberty\" and \"archer\", and the Saxon-derived \"folk\", \"freedom\" and \"bowman\". For more examples, see the list of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English.\nLoanwords are another rich source of synonyms, often from the language of the dominant culture of a region. Thus, most European languages have borrowed from Latin and ancient Greek, especially for technical terms, but the native terms continue to be used in non-technical contexts. In East Asia, borrowings from Chinese in Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese often exist alongside native words. In Islamic cultures, Arabic and Persian are large sources of synonymous borrowings.\nFor example, in Turkish, ' and ' both mean 'black', the former being a native Turkish word, and the latter being a borrowing from Persian. In Ottoman Turkish, there were often three synonyms: water can be ' (Turkish), ' (Persian), or \"\" (Arabic): \"such a triad of synonyms exists in Ottoman for every meaning, without exception\". As always with synonyms, there are nuances and shades of meaning or usage.\nIn English, similarly, there often exist Latin (L) and Greek (Gk) terms synonymous with Germanic ones: \"thought\", \"notion\" (L), \"idea\" (Gk); \"ring\", \"circle\" (L), \"cycle\" (Gk). English often uses the Germanic term only as a noun, but has Latin and Greek adjectives: \"hand\", \"manual\" (L), \"chiral\" (Gk); \"heat\", \"thermal\" (L), \"caloric\" (Gk). Sometimes the Germanic term has become rare, or restricted to special meanings: \"tide\", \"time\"/\"temporal\", \"chronic\".\nMany bound morphemes in English are borrowed from Latin and Greek and are synonyms for native words or morphemes: \"fish\", \"pisci-\" (L), \"ichthy-\" (Gk).\nAnother source of synonyms is coinages, which may be motivated by linguistic purism. Thus, the English word \"foreword\" was coined to replace the Romance \"preface\". In Turkish, \"\" was coined to replace the Arabic-derived \"mektep\" and \"mederese\", but those words continue to be used in some contexts.\nUses.\nSynonyms often express a nuance of meaning or are used in different registers of speech or writing.\nVarious technical domains may employ synonyms to convey precise technical nuances.\nSome writers avoid repeating the same word in close proximity, and prefer to use synonyms: this is called elegant variation. Many modern style guides criticize this.\nExamples.\nSynonyms can be any part of speech, as long as both words belong to the same part of speech. Examples:\nSynonyms are defined with respect to certain senses of words: \"pupil\" as the \"aperture in the iris of the eye\" is not synonymous with \"student\". Similarly, \"he expired\" means the same as \"he died\", yet \"my passport has expired\" cannot be replaced by \"my passport has died\".\nA thesaurus or synonym dictionary lists similar or related words; these are often, but not always, synonyms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; The dictionary definition of \"synonym\" at Wiktionary"}

It has a population of 1.67\u00a0million, and it is the coldest capital city in the world by average yearly temperature. The municipality is located in north central Mongolia at an elevation of about in a valley on the Tuul River. The city was founded in 1639 as a nomadic Buddhist monastic centre, changing location 29 times, and was permanently settled at its modern location in 1778.\nDuring its early years, as \u00d6rg\u00f6\u00f6 (anglicized as Urga), it became Mongolia's preeminent religious centre and seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia. Following the regulation of Qing-Russian trade by the Treaty of Kyakhta in 1727, a caravan route between Beijing and Kyakhta opened up, along which the city was eventually settled. With the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the city was a focal point for independence efforts, leading to the proclamation of the Bogd Khanate in 1911 led by the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, or Bogd Khan, and again during the communist revolution of 1921. With the proclamation of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1924, the city was officially renamed Ulaanbaatar and declared the country's capital.\nModern urban planning began in the 1950s, with most of the old ger districts replaced by Soviet-style flats. In 1990, Ulaanbaatar was the site of large demonstrations that led to Mongolia's transition to democracy and a market economy. Since 1990, an influx of migrants from the rest of the country has led to an explosive growth in its population, a major portion of whom live in ger districts, which has contributed to harmful air pollution in winter. Excessive coal production and consumption in Ulaanbaatar make it one of the world's most polluted cities, causing the incidence of pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses to spike amongst children.\nGoverned as an independent municipality, Ulaanbaatar is surrounded by T\u00f6v Province, whose capital Zuunmod lies south of the city. With a population of just over 1.6\u00a0million as of December 2022[ [update]], it contains almost half of the country's total population. As the country's primate city, it serves as its cultural, industrial and financial heart and the centre of its transport network.\nNames and etymology.\nThe city at its establishment in 1639 was referred to as (). This name was eventually adapted in the West as , being derived from the Russian form. By 1651, it began to be referred to as (), and by 1706 it was referred to as (). The Chinese equivalent, (, ), was rendered into Western languages as \"Kulun\" or \"Kuren\".\nOther names include (), or simply (), itself a term originally referring to an \"enclosure\" or \"settlement\".\nUpon independence in 1911, with both the secular government and the Bogd Khan's palace present, the city's name was changed to ().\nWhen the city became the capital of the new Mongolian People's Republic on 29 October 1924, its name was changed to \"Ulaanbaatar\" (lit.\u2009'Red Hero'), possibly in honor of Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar. At the meeting of the 1st Great People's Khural in 1924, the majority of delegates voted in favor of renaming the capital of Mongolia to Bator-khoto (\"City of the Hero,\" implicitly referring to the figure of Genghis Khan). Nevertheless, at the insistence of the Comintern representative, Soviet-Kazakhstan political figure T. R. Ryskulov, who previously had no connection to Mongolia, the city was named Ulan Bator Khoto (\"City of the Red Hero\"). After the vote, he gave a speech:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Genghis Khan was a national hero, but he was a conqueror. Present-day People's Mongolia has no imperialistic goals; it wants to liberate itself and develop independently, along revolutionary lines. Therefore, the name Ulaanbaatar-Khoto will be a revolutionary name, and it will be understandable to everyone. The prefix Ulan (\"red\") gives this name a revolutionary character, symbolizing the revolutionary steadfastness of the Mongolian people in their struggle for independence.\nIn the Western world, Ulaanbaatar continued to be generally known as Urga or Khuree until 1924, and afterward as Ulan Bator (). Although related to the Russian form, \"Ulan Bator\" was approved by the Mongolian Post Office. This form was defined two decades before the Mongolian name received its current Cyrillic spelling and transliteration (1941\u20131950); however, the name of the city was spelled \"Ulaanbaatar koto\" during the decade in which Mongolia used the Latin alphabet.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n Qing dynasty (1636 \u2013 1911)&lt;br&gt;\n Bogd Khanate of Mongolia (1911 \u2013 1919)&lt;br&gt;\n Republic of China (1919 \u2013 1921)&lt;br&gt; Mongolian People's Republic (1924 \u2013 1992)&lt;br&gt;\n Mongolia (1992 \u2013 present)\nPrehistory.\nHuman habitation at the site of Ulaanbaatar dates from the Lower Paleolithic, with a number of sites on the Bogd Khan, Buyant-Ukhaa and Songinokhairkhan mountains, revealing tools which date from 300,000 years ago to 40,000\u201312,000 years ago. These Upper Paleolithic people hunted mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, the bones of which are found abundantly around Ulaanbaatar.\nBefore 1639.\nA number of Xiongnu-era royal tombs have been discovered around Ulaanbaatar, including the tombs of Belkh Gorge near Dambadarjaalin monastery and tombs of Songinokhairkhan. Located on the banks of the Tuul River, Ulaanbaatar has been well within the sphere of Turco-Mongol nomadic empires throughout history.\nWang Khan, Toghrul of the Keraites, a Nestorian Christian monarch whom Marco Polo identified as the legendary Prester John, is said to have had his palace here (the Black Forest of the Tuul River) and forbade hunting in the holy mountain Bogd Uul. The palace is said to be where Genghis Khan stayed with Yesui Khatun before attacking the Tangut in 1226, though accounts of the Mongol invasion of Tangut are conflicted.\nDuring the Mongol Empire (1206\u20131368) and Northern Yuan dynasty (1368\u20131635) the main, natural route from the capital region of Karakorum to the birthplace and tomb of the Khans in the Khentii mountain region (Ikh Khorig) passed through the area of Ulaanbaatar. The Tuul River naturally leads to the north-side of Bogd Khan Mountain, which stands out as a large island of forest positioned conspicuously at the south-western edge of the Khentii mountains. As the main gate and stopover point on the route to and from the holy Khentii mountains, the Bogd Khan Mountain saw large amounts of traffic going past it and was protected from early times. Even after the Northern Yuan period it served as the location of the annual and triannual Assembly of Nobles (\"Khan Uuliin Chuulgan\").\nMobile monastery.\nFounded in 1639 as a yurt monastery as \u00d6rg\u00f6\u00f6 (lit.\u2009'palace-yurt'), the settlement was first located at Lake Shireet Tsagaan nuur ( directly east of the imperial capital Karakorum) in what is now Burd sum, \u00d6v\u00f6rkhangai, around south-west from the present site of Ulaanbaatar, and was intended by the Mongol nobles to be the seat of Zanabazar, the first Jebtsundamba Khutughtu. Zanabazar returned to Mongolia from Tibet in 1651, and founded seven \"aimags\" (monastic departments) in Urga, later establishing four more.\nAs a mobile monastery-town, \u00d6rg\u00f6\u00f6 was often moved to various places along the Selenge, Orkhon and Tuul rivers, as supply and other needs would demand. During the Dzungar wars of the late 17th century, it was even moved to Inner Mongolia. As the city grew, it moved less and less.\nThe movements of the city can be detailed as follows: Shireet Tsagaan Nuur (1639), Khoshoo Tsaidam (1640), Khentii Mountains (1654), Ogoomor (1688), Inner Mongolia (1690), Tsetserlegiin Erdene Tolgoi (1700), Daagandel (1719), Usan Seer (1720), Ikh Tamir (1722), Jargalant (1723), Eeven Gol (1724), Khujirtbulan (1729), Burgaltai (1730), Sognogor (1732), Terelj (1733), Uliastai River (1734), Khui Mandal (1736), Khuntsal (1740), Udleg (1742), Ogoomor (1743), Selbe (1747), Uliastai River (1756), Selbe (1762), Khui Mandal (1772) and Selbe (1778).\nIn 1778, the city moved from Khui Mandal and settled for good at its current location, near the confluence of the Selbe and Tuul rivers, and beneath Bogd Khan Uul, at that time also on the caravan route from Beijing to Kyakhta.\nOne of the earliest Western mentions of Urga is the account of the Scottish traveller John Bell in 1721:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What they call the Urga is the court, or the place where the prince (Tusheet Khan) and high priest (Bogd Jebtsundamba Khutugtu) reside, who are always encamped at no great distance from one another. They have several thousand tents about them, which are removed from time to time. The Urga is much frequented by merchants from China and Russia, and other places.\nBy Zanabazar's death in 1723, Urga was Mongolia's preeminent monastery in terms of religious authority. A council of seven of the highest-ranking lamas (\"Khamba Nomon Khan\", \"Ded Khamba\" and five \"Tsorj\") made most of the city's religious decisions. It had also become Outer Mongolia's commercial centre. From 1733 to 1778, Urga moved around the vicinity of its present location. In 1754, the Erdene Shanzodba Yam &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ of Urga was given authority to supervise the administrative affairs of the Bogd's subjects. It also served as the city's chief judicial court. In 1758, the Qianlong Emperor appointed the Khalkha Vice General Sanzaidorj as the first Mongol amban of Urga, with full authority to \"oversee the Khuree and administer well all the Khutugtu's subjects\".\nIn 1761, a second amban was appointed for the same purpose, a Manchu one. A quarter-century later, in 1786, a decree issued in Peking gave right to the Urga ambans to decide the administrative affairs of Tusheet Khan and Setsen Khan territories. With this, Urga became the highest civil authority in the country. Based on Urga's Mongol governor Sanzaidorj's petition, the Qianlong Emperor officially recognized an annual ceremony on Bogd Khan Mountain in 1778 and provided the annual imperial donations. The city was the seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktus, two Qing ambans, and a Chinese trade town grew \"four trees\" east of the city centre at the confluence of the Uliastai and Tuul rivers.\nBy 1778, Urga may have had as many as ten thousand monks, who were regulated by a monastic rule, Internal Rule of the Grand Monastery or \"Yeke Kuriyen-u Doto'adu Durem\". For example, in 1797 a decree of the 4th Jebtsundamba forbade \"singing, playing with archery, myagman, chess, usury and smoking\"). Executions were forbidden where the holy temples of the Bogd Jebtsundama could be seen, so capital punishment took place away from the city.\nIn 1839, the 5th Bogd Jebtsundamba moved his residence to Gandan Hill, an elevated position to the west of the Baruun Damnuurchin markets. Part of the city was moved to nearby Tolgoit. In 1855, the part of the camp that moved to Tolgoit was brought back to its 1778 location, and the 7th Bogd Jebtsundamba returned to the Zuun Khuree. The Gandan Monastery flourished as a centre of philosophical studies.\nUrga and the Kyakhta trade.\nFollowing the Treaty of Kyakhta in 1727, Urga (Ulaanbaatar) was a major point of the Kyakhta trade between Russia and China \u2013 mostly Siberian furs for Chinese cloth and later tea. The route ran south to Urga, southeast across the Gobi Desert to Kalgan, and southeast over the mountains to Peking. Urga was also a collection point for goods coming from further west. These were either sent to China or shipped north to Russia via Kyakhta, because of legal restrictions and the lack of good trade routes to the west.\nBy 1908, there was a Russian quarter with a few hundred merchants and a Russian club and informal Russian mayor. East of the main town was the Russian consulate, built in 1863, with an Orthodox church, a post office and 20 Cossack guards. It was fortified in 1900 and briefly occupied by troops during the Boxer Rebellion. There was a telegraph line north to Kyakhta and southeast to Kalgan and weekly postal service along these routes.\nBeyond the Russian consulate was the Chinese trading post called Maimaicheng, and nearby the palace of the Manchu viceroy. With the growth of Western trade at the Chinese ports, the tea trade to Russia declined, some Chinese merchants left, and wool became the main export. Manufactured goods still came from Russia, but most were now brought from Kalgan by caravan. The annual trade was estimated at 25 million rubles, nine-tenths in Chinese hands and one-tenth in Russian.\nThe Moscow trade expedition of the 1910s estimated the population of Urga at 60,000, based on Nikolay Przhevalsky's study in the 1870s.\nThe city's population swelled during the Naadam festival and major religious festivals to more than 100,000. In 1919, the number of monks had reached 20,000, up from 13,000 in 1810.\nIndependence and Niislel Kh\u00fcree.\nIn 1910, the \"amban\" Sando went to quell a major fight between Gandan lamas and Chinese traders started by an incident at the Da Yi Yu shop in the Baruun Damnuurchin market district. He was unable to bring the lamas under control, and was forced to flee back to his quarters. In 1911, with the Qing dynasty in China headed for total collapse, Mongolian leaders in Ikh Kh\u00fcree for Naadam met in secret on Mount Bogd Khan Uul and resolved to end 220 years of Manchu control of their country.\nOn 29 December 1911, the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu was declared ruler of an independent Mongolia and assumed the title Bogd Khan. Kh\u00fcree as the seat of the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu was the logical choice for the capital of the new state. However, following the tripartite Kyakhta agreement of 1915, Mongolia's status was effectively reduced to mere autonomy.\nIn 1919, Mongolian nobles, over the opposition of the Bogd Khan, agreed with the Chinese resident Chen Yi on a settlement of the \"Mongolian question\" along Qing-era lines, but before this settlement could be put into effect, Kh\u00fcree was occupied by the troops of Chinese warlord Xu Shuzheng, who forced the Mongolian nobles and clergy to renounce autonomy completely.\nThe city changed hands twice in 1921. First, on 4 February, a mixed Russian/Mongolian force led by White Russian warlord Roman von Ungern-Sternberg captured the city, freeing the Bogd Khan from Chinese imprisonment and killing a part of the Chinese garrison. Baron Ungern's capture of Urga was followed by the clearing out of Mongolia's small gangs of demoralized Chinese soldiers and, at the same time, looting and murder of foreigners, including a vicious pogrom that killed off the Jewish community.\nOn 22 February 1921, the Bogd Khan was once again elevated to Great Khan of Mongolia in Urga. However, at the same time that Baron Ungern was taking control of Urga, a Soviet-supported Communist Mongolian force led by Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar was forming in Russia, and in March they crossed the border. Ungern and his men rode out in May to meet Red Russian and Red Mongolian troops, but suffered a disastrous defeat in June.\nIn July 1921, the Communist Soviet-Mongolian army became the second conquering force in six months to enter Urga, and Mongolia came under the control of Soviet Russia. On 29 October 1924, the town was renamed \"Ulaanbaatar\". On the session of the 1st Great People's Khuraldaan of Mongolia in 1924, a majority of delegates had expressed their wish to change the capital city's name to \"Baatar Khot\" (lit.\u2009'Hero City'). However, under pressure from Turar Ryskulov, a Kazakh Soviet activist of the Communist International, the city was named \"Ulaanbaatar Khot\" (lit.\u2009'Red-Hero City').\nSocialist era.\nDuring the socialist period, especially following the Second World War, most of the old ger districts were replaced by Soviet-style blocks of flats, often financed by the Soviet Union. Urban planning began in the 1950s, and much of the city core today is a result of construction between 1960 and 1985.\nThe Trans-Mongolian Railway, connecting Ulaanbaatar with Moscow and Beijing, was completed in 1956, and cinemas, theaters, museums and other modern facilities were erected. Most of the temples and monasteries of pre-socialist Kh\u00fcree were destroyed following the anti-religious purges of the late 1930s. The Gandan monastery was reopened in 1944 when the U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace asked to see a monastery during his visit to Mongolia.\nContemporary era.\nUlaanbaatar and chiefly S\u00fckhbaatar Square was a major site of demonstrations that led to Mongolia's transition to democracy and market economy in 1990. Starting on 10 December 1989, protesters outside the Youth Culture Centre called for Mongolia to implement perestroika and glasnost in their full sense. After months of large-scale demonstrations and hunger strikes, the governing Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party resigned on 9 March 1990. The provisional government announced Mongolia's first free elections, which were held in July 1990, paving the way for the new constitution of 1992 and the dissolution of the Mongolian People's Republic.\nSince Mongolia's transition to a market economy in 1990, the city has experienced rapid growth. From a population of 535,000 in 1990, it had grown to 1 million inhabitants by 2007, and 1.5 million by 2021, or about half the entire country's population. Much of this rapid population rise is attributed to migration from rural areas, as herder families abandon their traditional lifestyles in search of opportunities in the city. Much of these new arrivals settle in ger districts without plumbing, sanitation, central heating, and basic services. This rise in population, including the formation of new settlement areas, has not been accompanied with appropriate investment in infrastructure and services, hampering development and causing a myriad of problems.\nUlaanbaatar was the scene of riots in 2008 after supporters of the opposition parties disputed the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's claim of victory after the parliamentary elections. A four-day state of emergency was declared, the capital was placed under a curfew, and alcohol sales banned with no further riots taking place. This was the first deadly riot in modern Ulaanbaatar's history.\nIn April 2013, Ulaanbaatar hosted the 7th Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies, and has also lent its name to the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security.\nChinggis Khaan International Airport in south of Ulaanbaatar was opened to the public on 4 July 2021 as the main airport of the city.\nSince the 2010s Ulaanbaatar has seen a construction boom filling the city with high-rise offices and apartment blocks.\nDemolition of historic buildings.\nSince 2013, a number of landmark buildings and structures have been demolished in Ulaanbaatar, despite considerable public outcry. This includes the White Gate at Nisekh in September 2013, the Memorial Museum of Victims of Political Repression in October 2019, the Natural History Museum in December 2019, Buildings #3 and #6 of the National University of Mongolia, The main building of the University of Finance and Economics in 2023, and Bumbugur.\nThe 2019 Mongolian government budget originally included items for the demolition of a number of historic neoclassical buildings in the heart of Ulaanbaatar, including the Natural History Museum, Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet, Drama Theatre and National Library. The decision was met by a public outcry and criticism from the Union of Mongolian Architects, which demanded that the buildings be preserved and restored. In January 2020, culture minister Yondonperenlein Baatarbileg denied that the government intended to demolish buildings other than the Natural History Museum, and stated that the government planned to renovate them instead.\nGeography.\nUlaanbaatar is located at about above mean sea level, slightly east of the centre of Mongolia, on the Tuul River, a sub-tributary of the Selenge, in a valley at the foot of Bogd Khan Mountain. Bogd Khan Mountain is a broad, heavily forested mountain rising to the south of Ulaanbaatar. It forms the boundary between the steppe zone to the south and the forest-steppe zone to the north. Traditionally, Ulaanbaatar is said to be surrounded by four peaks, clockwise from west: Songino Khairkhan, Chingeltei, Bayanzurkh, and finally Bogd Khan Mountain.\nThe forests of the mountains surrounding Ulaanbaatar are composed of evergreen pines, deciduous larches and birches, while the riverine forest of the Tuul River is composed of broad-leaved, deciduous poplars, elms and willows. Ulaanbaatar lies at roughly the same latitude as Vienna, Munich, Orl\u00e9ans and Seattle. It lies at roughly the same longitude as Chongqing, Hanoi and Jakarta.\nClimate.\nOwing to its high elevation, its relatively high latitude, its location hundreds of kilometres from any coast, and the effects of the Siberian anticyclone, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest national capital in the world, and the coldest city on the planet with more than a million inhabitants, with a monsoon-influenced, cold semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\", Trewartha \"BSbc\", USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 3a). Aside from precipitation and from a thermal standpoint, the city is on the boundary between humid continental (\"Dwb\") and subarctic (\"Dwc\"). This is due to its mean temperature for the month of May.\nThe city features brief, warm summers and long, bitterly cold and dry winters. The coldest January temperatures, usually at the time just before sunrise, are between with no wind, because of temperature inversion. Most of the annual precipitation of falls from May to September. The highest recorded annual precipitation in the city was at the Khureltogoot Astronomical Observatory on Bogd Khan Mountain. Ulaanbaatar has an average annual temperature of , making it the coldest capital in the world. Ulaanbaatar's annual average is brought down by its cold winter temperatures even though it is significantly warm from late April to early October.\nThe city lies in the zone of discontinuous permafrost, which means that building is difficult in sheltered locations that preclude thawing in the summer, but easier on more exposed ones where soils fully thaw. Suburban residents live in traditional yurts that do not protrude into the soil. Extreme temperatures in the city range from in January 1957 to in July 1988.\nCityscape.\nThe city's inner core consists of a central district built in 1940s- and 1950s-style Soviet architecture, surrounded by and mingled with residential concrete towerblocks and large ger districts. Starting after the fall of communism, many of the towerblocks' ground floors were modified and upgraded to small shops, and many new buildings have been erected\u2014some illegally, as some private companies erect buildings without legal licenses/permits. Since the 2010s, a construction boom has been ongoing, leading to many high-rise apartment and office blocks in the inner core as well as new settlement areas.\nS\u00fckhbaatar Square, in the government district, is the centre of Ulaanbaatar and contains in the middle a statue of revolutionary hero Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar on horseback; and in the north side a statue of Chinggis Khan. To the north is the Government Palace, while Peace Avenue (\"Enkh Taivny Urgon Chuloo\"), the main thoroughfare through town, runs along the south side of the square.\nMajor landmarks include the Gandantegchinlen Monastery, the socialist monument complex at Zaisan Memorial with its views over the city, the Bogd Khan's Winter Palace, and the Choijin Lama Temple. As of 2024, Mongolia's tallest building is Tower C, part of the Shangri-La Hotel complex at 120\u00a0m.\nMongolia's tallest building will soon be the Encanto Trade Center, a 150\u00a0m skyscraper currently under construction and expected to be completed in 2026.\nImportant shopping districts include the 3rd Microdistrict Boulevard (simply called \"Khoroolol\" or \"the District\"), Peace Avenue around the State Department Store (simply called \"Ikh Delguur\" or \"Great Store\") and the Narantuul Market area (simply called \"Zakh\" or \"the Market\").\nUlaanbaatar presently has multiple cinemas, one modern ski resort, two large indoor stadiums, several large department stores and one large amusement park. Food, entertainment and recreation venues are steadily increasing in variety.\nParks.\nA number of national parks and protected areas officially belong to the city. Gorkhi-Terelj National Park, a nature preserve with many tourist facilities, is approximately from Ulaanbaatar. Routes 2 and 3 of the long-distance hiking trail Mongol Olle Trail are located within this park. The Genghis Khan Equestrian Statue is east of the city centre.\nBogd Khan Uul, which dominates the south, is a strictly protected area with a length of and width of , covering an area of . Nature conservation dates back to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries when the Tooril Khan of the Mongolian Ancient Keraite Aimag \u2013 who prohibited logging and hunting activities \u2013 claimed the Bogd Khan as a holy mountain. The ruins of Manjusri Monastery are located on the southern flank of Bogd Khan Mountain and is a popular destination for outings.\nThe National Amusement Park is an amusement park located in the downtown section, south of Shangri-La Hotel. It is also a popular place for young people to hang out. This small amusement park features rides, games and paddle boats. Its original Artificial Lake Castle was built in 1969.\nThe National Garden Park, in the southeastern outskirts of the city, opened in 2009 and has become a popular summer destination for residents. It has a total area of 55 hectares, with over 100,000 trees planted. The park is geared towards becoming an educational centre for healthy, responsible living as well as environmental education.\nOther city parks, gardens or forests in the city are Bogd Khaan Memorial Garden, Korea-Mongolia Friendship Forest and Misheel Botanical Garden.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs Mongolia's primate city, Ulaanbaatar has been the focal point for urbanization and migration from rural areas. With a population of 400,000 in 1979, it has experienced rapid growth in the following decades; the city reached 1 million inhabitants around 2007. Population growth in the 2010s averaged 2.7% a year, representing a two-fold fall from the previous decade. In 2020, the city's population was recorded as 1,466,125.\nTwo-thirds of the city's inhabitants live in ger districts, areas with inadequate infrastructure, sanitation, and public services.\n64.6% of the population was reported to have been born in Ulaanbaatar. The foreign-born population was recorded as 17,456 in 2020.\nReligion.\nUlaanbaatar has a long tradition of Buddhism, having been initially founded and settled as a monastic centre. Prominent places of worship in the city include the Gandantegchinlen Monastery and Choijin Lama Temple. In modern times, it has become a multifaith centre, having added multiple Christian churches (such as the Orthodox Holy Trinity Church, as well as the Catholic Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral) and Islamic mosques such as the Ulaanbaatar Central Mosque.\nAccording to the 2020 national census, 46.3% of the population over 15 years of age identified as being irreligious, while 53.7% identified as being religious, a decrease of 7.7 percentage points in religiosity since the 2010 census.\nOf the people identifying as religious, responses included Buddhism (89.1%), Shamanism (5.4%), Christianity (3.3%), and Islam (0.9%). Muslims in Ulaanbaatar are mostly the ethnic Kazakhs minority who reside in Nalaikh.\nGovernance.\nUlaanbaatar is treated as an independent first-level region, separate from the surrounding T\u00f6v Aimag. It is governed by the Ulaanbaatar City Council with 45 members, elected every four years. The Prime Minister of Mongolia appoints the Governor of the Capital City and Mayor of Ulaanbaatar with four-year terms upon the city council's nomination.\nDistricts.\nThe city is divided into nine districts (): Baganuur, Bagakhangai, Bayangol, Bayanz\u00fcrkh, Chingeltei, Khan-Uul, Nalaikh, Songino Khairkhan and S\u00fckhbaatar. Each district is subdivided into khoroos, of which there are 204. Each khoroo is further divided into kheseg (), which is the smallest administrative unit of Ulaanbaatar. Each district also serves as a constituency that elects one or more representatives into the State Great Khural, the national parliament.\nAlthough administratively part of Ulaanbaatar, Nalaikh and Baganuur are separate cities. Bagakhangai and Baganuur are noncontiguous exclaves, the former located within the T\u00f6v Province, the latter on the border between T\u00f6v and Khentii provinces.\nMunicipal symbols.\nThe official emblem of Ulaanbaatar is the , a mythical bird in both Buddhist and Hindu scriptures, referred to as the \"Khangar'd\" (, lit.\u2009'Khan Garuda') by Mongols.\nThe \"garu\u1e0da\" appears on Ulaanbaatar's emblem. In its right hand is a key, a symbol of prosperity and openness, and in its left is a lotus flower, a symbol of peace, equality and purity. In its talons it is holding a snake, a symbol of evil of which it is intolerant. On the 's forehead is the soyombo symbol, which is featured on the flag of Mongolia. The city's flag is sky blue representing the eternal sky and has the in the centre.\nEconomy.\nThe largest corporations and conglomerates of Mongolia are almost all headquartered in Ulaanbaatar. In 2017 Ulaanbaatar had five billionaires and 90 multimillionaires with net worth above 10 million dollars. Major Mongolian companies include https:// Group, Gatsuurt LLC, Genco, MAK, Altai Trading, Tavan Bogd Group, Mobicom Corporation, Bodi, Shunkhlai, Monnis, Suu and Petrovis. While not on the level of multinational corporations, most of these companies are multi-sector conglomerates with far-reaching influence in the country.\nUlaanbaatar (Urga) has been a key location where the economic history and wealth creation of the nation has played out. Unlike the highly mobile dwellings of herders nomadizing between winter and summer pastures, Urga was set up to be a semi-permanent residence of the high lama Zanabazar. It stood in one location (Khoshoo Tsaidam) from 1640 to 1654, an unusually long period of 15 years, before Zanabazar moved it east to the foot of Mount Saridag in the Khentii Mountains. Here he set about building a permanent monastery town with stone buildings. Urga stayed at Mount Saridag for a full 35 years and was indeed assumed to be permanent there when Oirats suddenly invaded the region in 1688 and burnt down the city. With a major part of his life's work destroyed, Zanabazar had to take the mobile portion of Urga and flee to Inner Mongolia.\nMore than half the wealth created in Urga in the period from 1639 to 1688 is thought to have been lost in 1688. Only in 1701 did Urga return to the region and start a second period of expansion, but it had to remain mobile until the end of the 70-year-long Dzungar-Qing Wars in 1757. After settling down in its current location in 1778, Urga saw sustained economic growth, but most of the wealth went to the Buddhist clergy, nobles as well as the temporary Shanxi merchants based in the eastern and western China-towns of Urga. There were numerous companies called \"puus\" () and temple treasuries called \"jas\" (), which functioned as businesses, but none of these survived the Communist period. During the Mongolian People's Republic, private property was only marginally tolerated, while most assets were state-owned. The oldest companies still operating in Ulaanbaatar date to the early MPR. Only the Gandantegchinlen Monastery has been operating non-stop for 205 years (with a 6-year gap during World War II), but whether it can be seen as a business is still debated.\nAs Mongolia's main industrial centre, Ulaanbaatar produces a variety of consumer goods, and it is responsible for about two-thirds of Mongolia's total gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe transition to a market economy in 1990 has so far correlated with an increase in GDP, leading to a shift towards service industries (which now make up 43% of the city's GDP) along with rapid urbanization and population growth.\nMining is the second-largest contributor to Ulaanbaatar's GDP, at 25%. North of the city are several gold mines, including the Boroo Gold Mine, and foreign investment in the sector has allowed for growth and development. However, in light of a noticeable drop in GDP during the 2008 financial crisis, as demand for mining exports dropped, there has been movement towards diversifying the economy.\nCulture.\nArts.\nUlaanbaatar features a mix of traditional and western-style theatres, offering world-class performances. Many of the traditional folklore bands play regularly around the world, including in New York, London and Tokyo. The Ulaanbaatar Opera House, situated in the centre of the city, hosts concerts and musical performances as well as opera and ballet performances, some in collaboration with world ballet houses such as the Boston Theatre.\nThe Mongolian State Grand National Orchestra was established in 1945. It has the largest orchestra of traditional instruments in the country, with a repertoire going beyond national music, encompassing dozens of international musical pieces.\nThe Tumen Ekh Ensemble comprises artists who perform all types of Mongolian song, music and dance. They play traditional instruments, including the morin khuur (horsehead fiddle), and perform Mongolian long song, epic and eulogy songs, a shaman ritual dance, an ancient palace dance and a Tsam mask dance.\nThe Morin Khuur Ensemble of Mongolia is part of the Mongolian State Philharmonic, based at Central Cultural Palace. It is a popular ensemble featuring the national string instrument, the morin khuur, and performs various domestic and international works.\nMonasteries.\nAmong the notable older monasteries is the Choijin Lama Monastery, a Buddhist monastery that was completed in 1908. It escaped the destruction of Mongolian monasteries when it was turned into a museum in 1942.\nAnother is the Gandan Monastery, which dates to the 19th century. Its most famous attraction is a 26.5-meter-high golden statue of Migjid Janraisig. These monasteries are among the very few in Mongolia to escape the wholesale destruction of Mongolian monasteries under Khorloogiin Choibalsan.\nMuseums.\nUlaanbaatar has several museums dedicated to Mongolian history and culture. The Mongolian Natural History Museum features many dinosaur fossils and meteorites found in Mongolia.\nThe National Museum of Mongolia includes exhibits from prehistoric times through the Mongol Empire to the present. The Zanabazar Museum of Fine Arts has a large collection of Mongolian art, including works of the 17th-century sculptor/artist Zanabazar, as well as Mongolia's most famous painting, \"One Day In Mongolia\" by Baldugiin \"Marzan\" Sharav.\nThe Mongolian Theatre Museum presents the history of the performing arts in Mongolia.\nPre-1778 artifacts that have never left the city since its founding include the Vajradhara statue made by Zanabazar himself in 1683 (the city's main deity, kept at the Vajradhara temple); an ornate throne presented to Zanabazar by the Kangxi Emperor (before 1723); a sandalwood hat presented to Zanabazar by the Dalai Lama (c.\u00a01663); Zanabazar's large fur coat, also presented by the Kangxi Emperor; and a great number of original statues made by Zanabazar (e.g., the Green Tara).\nThe Mongolian Military Museum features two permanent exhibition halls, commemorating the war history of the country from prehistoric times to the modern era. In the first hall, one can see various tools and weapons from the Paleolithic age to the times of the Manchu empire. The second hall showcases the modern history of the Mongolian military, from the Bogd Khan period (1911\u20131924) up until Mongolia's recent military involvement in peacekeeping operations.\nThe Ulaanbaatar City Museum offers a view of Ulaanbaatar's history through old maps and photos. Among the permanent items is a huge painting of the capital as it looked in 1912, showing major landmarks such as Gandan Monastery and the Green Palace. Part of the museum is dedicated to special photo exhibits that change frequently. The Mongolian Railway History Museum is an open-air museum that displays six types of locomotives used during a 65-year period of Mongolian rail history.\nThe International Intellectual Museum displays a comprehensive collection of complex wooden toys that visitors can assemble.\nThe Memorial Museum of Victims of Political Repression \u2013 dedicated to those fallen under the Communist purge that took the lives of over 32,000 statesmen, herders, scholars, politicians and lamas in the 1930s \u2013 told about one of the most tragic periods in Mongolia's 20th-century history. The small building had fallen into serious disrepair and was demolished on 7 October 2019, despite public outcry in favor of renovation.\nEducation.\nUlaanbaatar is home to most of Mongolia's major universities, among them the National University of Mongolia, Mongolian University of Science and Technology, Mongolian University of Life Sciences, Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences, Mongolian National University of Education, Mongolian State University of Arts and Culture and the University of Finance and Economics.\nThe American School of Ulaanbaatar and the International School of Ulaanbaatar are examples of Western-style K-12 education in English for Mongolian nationals and foreign residents.\nLibraries.\nThe National Library of Mongolia is located in Ulaanbaatar and includes an extensive historical collection, items in non-Mongolian languages and a special children's collection.\nThe Metropolitan Central Library of Ulaanbaatar, sometimes also referred to as the Ulaanbaatar Public Library, is a public library with a collection of about 500,000 items. It has 232,097 annual users and a total of 497,298 loans per year. It does charge users a registration fee of 3800 to 4250 tugrik, or about US$1.06 to $1.18. The fees may be the result of operating on a budget under $176,000 per year. They also host websites on classical and modern Mongolian literature and food, in addition to providing free internet access.\nIn 1986, the Ulaanbaatar government created a centralized system for all public libraries in the city, known as the Metropolitan Library System of Ulaanbaatar (MLSU). This system coordinates management, acquisitions, finances and policy among public libraries in the capital, in addition to providing support to school and children's libraries. Other than the Metropolitan Central Library, the MLSU has four branch libraries. They are in Chingeltei District (established in 1946), Khan-Uul District (established in 1948), Bayanzurkh District (established in 1968) and iSongino-Khairkhan District (established in 1991). There is also a Children's Central Library, which was established in 1979.\nDigital libraries.\nThe Press Institute in Ulaanbaatar oversees the Digital Archive of Mongolian Newspapers. It is a collection of 45 newspaper titles with a particular focus on the years after the fall of communism in Mongolia. The project was supported by the British Library's Endangered Archives Programme. The Metropolitan Central Library in Ulaanbaatar maintains a digital monthly news archive.\nSpecial libraries.\nIn 2023, the National University of Mongolia launched a library with audiobooks for their students with disabilities. The library is reserved exclusively for those people.\nThe American Center for Mongolian Studies (ACMS) operates a research library with 1,500 volumes related to Mongolia in numerous languages. It also hosts an online library that includes special reference resources and access to digital databases, including a digital book collection.\nThere is a Speaking Library at School #116 for the visually impaired, funded by the Zorig Foundation, and the collection is largely based on materials donated by Mongolian National Radio.\nThe Mongolia-Japan Center for Human Resources Development maintains a library in Ulaanbaatar consisting of about 7,800 items, with a strong focus on both aiding Mongolians studying Japanese and books in Japanese about Mongolia.\nSport.\nThe National Sports Stadium is the main sporting venue, notable as the host of the yearly Naadam festival. Other venues include the multi-purpose Buyant Ukhaa Sport Palace, AIC Steppe Arena for indoor skating, and B\u00f6khiin \u00d6rg\u00f6\u00f6 for Mongolian wrestling. Sky Resort is a popular destination for skiing and features a golf course.\nUlaanbaatar has hosted the 2019 FIBA 3x3 U18 World Cup the 2023 East Asian Youth Games, and the FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup.\nAll Mongolian Premier League football teams play at the MFF Football Centre in Ulaanbataar, even those that don't represent Ulaanbataar.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nUlaanbaatar serves as the country's primary road, air, and rail hub. Transport within Ulaanbaatar is conducted through private cars, public transport (buses, trolleybuses, and taxis), as well as informal taxis and minivans. As of 2021, the total number of registered vehicles in the city was 662,644.\nPublic transport.\nBuses are the main form of public transport in Ulaanbaatar. As of 2021, 950 buses from 19 companies served 105 routes and 1169 bus stops. Daily ridership is 480,000\u2013500,000. The bus fleet consists of 18 articulated buses, 1129 high-capacity buses, 42 trolleybuses, 46 medium-capacity buses, and 46 small-capacity buses.\nIn 2021, public transport usage totaled 147 million passengers, with 61% of the population using public transport.\nIn July 2015, a smart card system was rolled out for bus fare payments (U Money); previously the bus network had conductors from which tickets would be bought using cash. As of 2025, fares are 200\u20ae for children and 1,000\u20ae for adults.\nEight companies operate 372 official taxis within the city as of 2021, down from 566 official taxis in 2019. Usage of unofficial taxis and ride-sharing apps (UBCab) is common.\nRoad.\nAs of 2024, the city had 1253\u00a0km of paved roads, and its periphery (ger districts) are disproportionally underserved by paved roads. 720,000 vehicles were registered in the city as of 2023.\nThe city's traffic is concentrated around its main thoroughfares \u2014 Peace Avenue (), Ikh Toiruu, Narnii Zam, and Chinggis Avenue (\"Chinggisiin \u00f6rg\u00f6n ch\u00f6l\u00f6\u00f6\").\nCongestion is a major problem in Ulaanbaatar, with average peak hour driving speeds in the city being 8.9\u00a0km/h in 2021. In the same year, city residents spent an average of 2.5 hours a day stuck in traffic. Recent studies predict rush hour speeds plummeting to just 5\u00a0km/h by 2025. Another major problem is flooding, with only 16% of paved roads having a drainage system.\nRail.\nThe Trans-Mongolian Railway crosses the city centre in a roughly east-to-west direction, with the main railway hub being Ulaanbaatar railway station.\nAir.\nUlaanbaatar is served by Chinggis Khaan International Airport, located south of the city in Sergelen, T\u00f6v, which functions as the country's main air hub. It replaced the former Buyant-Ukhaa International Airport in 2021 and features flights to destinations in Europe, Asia, and domestic aimag centres. The airport is accessible from Ulaanbaatar via highway and Yarmag Bridge with taxis and shuttles operating along the route.\nThere are 6 helipads in the city.\nFuture proposals.\nDue to worsening congestion and growth, a number of proposals have been made to improve the city's transport infrastructure, such as the short-lived Ulaanbaatar Railbus, and the proposed subway system and tram. On 4 April 2024, the construction of the Ulaanbaatar Cable Car from Yaarma to the Kharkhorin bus station began.\nEnergy.\nUlaanbaatar's electricity is mainly supplied through its four thermal power plants utilizing coal, the largest being Thermal Power Plant No. 4. Aside from generating electricity, they also supply hot water throughout the city and heat buildings during the winter months from September to April. Ger districts surrounding the city are not connected to the central heating system, therefore having to rely on burning coal and other materials for heat.\nIn 2019, the government banned the burning of raw coal within Ulaanbaatar, instead distributing coke briquettes, claiming fuel efficiency and less smoke pollution. Results have been inconclusive since the switch to briquettes, though as of 2023 smoke is still a major concern in winter.\nWater.\nUlaanbaatar relies entirely on groundwater recharged directly from the Tuul River. Water provisioning is managed by the Water Supply and Sewage Authority, a municipal agency.\nPollution.\nAir pollution is a serious problem in Ulaanbaatar, especially in winter. Concentrations of certain types of particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) regularly exceed World Health Organization recommended maximum levels by more than a dozen times. They also exceed the concentrations measured in northern Chinese industrial cities. During the winter months, smoke regularly obscures vision, and even led to problems with air traffic at the former airport.\nSources of the pollution are mainly the simple stoves used for heating and cooking in the city's ger districts, but also the local coal-fueled power plants. The problem is compounded by Ulaanbaatar's location in a valley between relatively high mountains, which shield the city from the winter winds and thus obstruct air circulation.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nUlaanbaatar is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67401", "revid": "50873153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67401", "title": "Grapefruit", "text": "Citrus fruit\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe grapefruit (Citrus\" \u00d7 \"paradisi) is a subtropical citrus tree known for its relatively large, sour to semi-sweet, somewhat bitter fruit. The flesh of the fruit is segmented and varies in color from pale yellow to dark red.\nGrapefruits originated in Barbados in the 18th century. They are a citrus hybrid that was created through an accidental cross between the sweet orange (\"C.\" \u00d7 \"sinensis\") and the pomelo (\"C. maxima\"), both of which were introduced to the Caribbean from Asia in the 17th century. It has also been called the 'forbidden fruit'. In the past it was called the \"pomelo\", but that term is now mostly used as the common name for \"Citrus maxima\".\nGrapefruit\u2013drug interactions are common, as the juice contains furanocoumarins that interfere with the metabolism of many drugs. This can prolong and intensify the effects of those drugs, leading to multiple side-effects such as abnormal heart rhythms, bleeding inside the stomach, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.\nDescription.\nThe evergreen grapefruit trees usually grow to around tall, although they may reach . The leaves are up to long, thin, glossy, and dark green. They produce white flowers with four or five petals. The fruit is yellow-orange skinned and generally an oblate spheroid in shape; it ranges in diameter from . Its flesh is segmented and acidic, varying in color depending on the cultivars, which include white, pink, and red pulps of varying sweetness (generally, the redder varieties are the sweetest).\nVarieties.\nWhite grapefruit varieties include Camulos, Cecily, Duncan, Frost Marsh, Genetic Dwarf Marsh, Hall, Jochimsen, Marsh seedy, Nicholson navel, Perlis, Reed Marsh, Tetraploid, Warren Marsh, and Whitney Marsh. \nRed or pink grapefruit varieties include Flame, Foster Pink, Henderson Ruby, Hudson Foster, Marsh Pink, Ray Ruby, Redblush, Rio Red, Shambar, and Star Ruby.\nThe 1929 'Ruby Red' (or 'Redblush') patent was associated with real commercial success, which came after the discovery of a red grapefruit growing on a pink variety. The Texas Legislature designated this variety the official \"State Fruit of Texas\" in 1993.\nUsing radiation to trigger mutations, new varieties were developed to retain the red tones that typically faded to pink. The 'Rio Red' variety is a 1984 registered Texas grapefruit with registered trademarks \"Rio Star\" and \"Ruby-Sweet\", also sometimes promoted as \"Reddest\" and \"Texas Choice\". The 'Rio Red' is a mutation-bred variety that was developed by treatment of bud sticks with thermal neutrons. Its improved attributes of mutant variety are fruit and juice color, deeper red, and wide adaptation.\nThe 'Star Ruby' is the darkest of the red varieties. Developed from an irradiated 'Hudson' grapefruit ('Hudson' being a limb sport of 'Foster', itself a limb sport of the 'Walters'), it has found limited commercial success because it is more difficult to grow than other varieties.\nAs food.\nNutrition.\nRaw white grapefruit is 90% water, 8% carbohydrates and 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw grapefruit provides of food energy and is a rich source of vitamin C (37% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table).\nCulinary.\nLike other citrus fruits, grapefruits are sour because of their citric acid content; grapefruit juice contains about half the citric acid content of lemon juice, and nearly 50% more than orange juice. In Costa Rica, especially in Atenas, grapefruit are often cooked with sugar to balance their sourness, rendering them as sweets; or they are stuffed with \"dulce de leche\" as a dessert. In Haiti, grapefruit is used primarily for its juice (), but also is used to make jam ().\nGrapefruit varieties are differentiated by the flesh color of fruit they produce. Common varieties are yellow and pink pulp colors. Flavors range from highly acidic and somewhat sour to sweet and tart, resulting from composition of sugars (mainly sucrose), organic acids (mainly citric acid), and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes providing aromas. Grapefruit mercaptan, a sulfur-containing terpene, is one of the aroma compounds influencing the taste and odor of grapefruit, compared with other citrus fruits.\nDrug interactions.\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice interact with many drugs, resulting in numerous adverse effects including bone marrow suppression, nephrotoxicity, abnormal heart rhythm, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, dizziness, and respiratory depression, according to the drug involved.\nOne interaction occurs from grapefruit furanocoumarins, such as bergamottin and 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, which occur in both flesh and peel. Furanocoumarins inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme (among others from the cytochrome P450 enzyme family responsible for metabolizing 90% of drugs). The action of the CYP3A4 enzyme itself is to metabolize many medications. If a drug's breakdown for removal is lessened, then the level of that drug in the blood may become and remain high, leading to adverse effects. On the other hand, some drugs must be metabolized to become active, and inhibiting CYP3A4 may lead to reduced drug effects.\nAnother effect is that grapefruit compounds may inhibit the absorption of drugs in the intestine. If a drug is not absorbed, then not enough of it is in the blood to have a therapeutic effect. Each affected drug has either a specific increase of effect or decrease.\nOne whole grapefruit or a glass of of grapefruit juice is enough to cause drug overdose toxicity. Typically, drugs that are incompatible with grapefruit are marked as such on the container or package insert.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2023, world production of grapefruits (combined with pomelos) was 9.93 million tonnes, led by China with 52% of the total and Vietnam as a secondary producer (table).\nPests and diseases.\nGrapefruits are hosts for fruit flies (family Tephritidae) such as \"A. suspensa\", which lay their eggs in overripe or spoiled grapefruits, sometimes causing serious damage in plantations in the Americas. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Citrus swallowtail, \"Papilio demodocus\", is a minor pest of \"Citrus\" plantations. Grapefruits are subject to several diseases of \"Citrus\" trees, including citrus tristeza virus, citrus canker (caused by a bacterium, \"Xanthomonas\"), and the vector-transmitted citrus greening disease, where the vector is a psyllid bug, and the pathogen is a bacterium, \"Liberibacter\".\nHistory.\nGrapefruit originated as a natural hybrid. One ancestor of the grapefruit was the Jamaican sweet orange (\"Citrus sinensis\"), itself an ancient hybrid of Asian origin; the other was the Indonesian pomelo (\"C. maxima\"). The pomelo was the female ancestor; the sweet orange, itself a hybrid, was the male. Both \"C. sinensis\" and \"C. maxima\" were present in the West Indies by 1692. One story of the fruit's origin is that a 17th-century trader named 'Captain Shaddock' brought pomelo seeds to Jamaica and bred the first fruit, which were then called \"shaddocks\". The grapefruit then probably originated as a naturally occurring hybrid between the two plants some time after they had been introduced there.\nA hybrid fruit, called \"forbidden fruit\", was first documented in 1750 (along with 14 other citrus fruits including the guiney orange) by a Welshman, the Rev. Griffith Hughes, in his \"The Natural History of Barbados\". However, Hughes's forbidden fruit may have been a plant distinct from grapefruit although still closely related to it.\nIn 1814, the British naturalist and plantation owner John Lunan published the term \"grapefruit\" to describe a similar Jamaican citrus plant. Lunan reported that the name was due to its similarity in taste to the grape (\"Vitis vinifera\"). An alternative explanation is that this name may allude to clusters of the fruit on the tree, which often appear similar to bunches of grapes.\nIn 1830, the Jamaican version of the plant was given the botanical name \"Citrus paradisi\" by the Scottish physician and botanist James Macfadyen. Macfadyen identified two varieties \u2013 one called \"forbidden fruit\", the other \"Barbadoes Grape Fruit\". Macfadyen distinguished between the two plants by fruit shape with the Barbados grapefruit being piriform (pear shaped) while the forbidden fruit was \"maliformis\". Macfadyen's and Hughes's descriptions differ, so it is not clear that the two reports are describing the same plant. It has been suggested that Hughes's golden orange may actually have been a grapefruit, while his forbidden fruit was a different variety that may since have been lost. A citrus called \"forbidden fruit\" or \"shaddette\" has been discovered in Saint Lucia; it may be the plant described by Hughes and Macfadyen.\nThe name \"grape-fruit\" was used during the 19th century to refer to pomelos. It was brought to Florida by the French businessman Count Odet Philippe in 1823, in what is now known as Safety Harbor. Further crosses have produced the tangelo (1905), the Minneola tangelo (1931), and the oroblanco (1984). Its true origins were not determined until the 1940s, at which point its official name was altered to \"Citrus\" \u00d7 \"paradisi\", the \u00d7 identifying it as a hybrid. An early pioneer in the American citrus industry was Kimball C. Atwood, a wealthy entrepreneur who founded the Atwood Grapefruit Company in the late 19th century. The Atwood Grove became the largest grapefruit grove in the world, with a yearly output of 80,000 boxes of fruit. There, pink grapefruit was discovered in 1906.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A 7th-dan black belt and \"shihan\" in Aikikai aikido, he began his adult life as a martial arts instructor in Japan where he became the first non-Japanese and American to operate an aikido dojo. He later moved to Los Angeles where he continued teaching aikido. In 1988, Seagal made his acting debut in \"Above the Law\", which is regarded as the first American film to feature aikido in fight sequences. \nBy 1991, he had starred in three commercially successful films, and would go on to achieve greater fame in \"Under Siege\" (1992), where he played Navy SEALs counter-terrorist expert Casey Ryback, a role he reprised in the sequel ' (1995). In 1994, he starred in his directorial debut film \"On Deadly Ground\". During the latter half of the 1990s, Seagal starred in three more feature films and the direct-to-video film \"The Patriot\". Subsequently, his career shifted to mostly direct-to-video productions. He has since appeared in films and reality shows, most notably as the main villain in Robert Rodriguez's \"Machete\" (2010), and ', which depicted Seagal performing duties as a reserve deputy sheriff.\nSeagal is a guitarist and has released two studio albums, \"Songs from the Crystal Cave\" and \"Mojo Priest\", and performed on the scores of several of his films. He has worked with Stevie Wonder and Tony Rebel, who both performed on his debut album. He has been involved in a line of \"therapeutic oil\" products and energy drinks. Seagal is an environmentalist, animal rights activist, and supporter of 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso. In 2004, he was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame.\nSeagal has been the subject of controversy during his career. Since 1991, multiple women have accused Seagal of sexual harassment or assault. A supporter of Vladimir Putin, he backed the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He was granted both Russian and Serbian citizenship in 2016. In 2018, he was appointed Russia's special envoy to the U.S.\nEarly life.\nSeagal was born on April 10, 1952, in Lansing, Michigan, the son of Patricia Anne Fisher, a medical technician, and Samuel Seagal, a mathematics teacher. His mother was of Irish descent, while his father was Jewish. His paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. During an interview for the Russian talk show \"Let Them Talk\", Seagal stated that he has paternal ancestors from the Siberian city of Vladivostok, as well as Belarus and Saint Petersburg. He claims that genetic testing determined that he has Yakut and Buryat ancestry as well. When he was 5, Seagal moved with his parents to Fullerton, California. His mother later told \"People\" magazine that prior to the move Seagal was frail and suffered from asthma: \"He was a puny kid back then. But he really thrived after the move [from Michigan].\"\nSeagal attended Buena Park High School in Buena Park, California, and Fullerton College between 1970 and 1971. Seagal has been described as a \u201cpathological liar\u201d due to his propensity of making greatly exaggerated or outright fabricated statements about his personal life and achievements. For instance, Seagal has claimed that he was a student of the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, despite the fact that Ueshiba died in 1969 when Seagal was 17 and five years before Seagal moved to Japan at age 22 \u2014 when he moved there to allegedly avoid the draft for the Vietnam War by marrying a Japanese national.\nMartial arts and Japan.\nAccording to Seagal's first wife, Miyako Fujitani: \"I met Steven in California in the fall of 1974. He followed me back to Japan in October. We got married in December 1974.\" Fujitani was a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido. After they married, they had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako. Seagal taught at the school owned by Miyako's family and earned his aikido black belt in 1978. Interviewed in 1993, Fujitani stated that: \"The only reason Steven was awarded the black belt was because the judge, who was famous for his laziness, fell asleep during Steven's presentation. The judge just gave him the black belt.\"\nSeagal has claimed that he helped train CIA agents in Japan: \"They saw my abilities, both with martial arts and with the language. You could say that I became an advisor to several CIA agents in the field, and through my friends in the CIA, I met many powerful people and did special works and favors.\" Fujitani has refuted these allegations and has also dismissed Seagal's claims that he had combatted yakuza. There is no evidence that Seagal has ever worked with the Central Intelligence Agency. In the early-1980s, Seagal had aspirations to return to America and become a movie star. Fujitani then \"scrimped and saved for years, even denying herself and her children necessities, to help pay his way home.\" According to Fujitani, \"he then availed himself of her savings and hied off.\"\nSeagal returned to Taos, New Mexico, with his student (and later film stuntman) Craig Dunn, where they opened a dojo, although Seagal spent much of his time pursuing other ventures. After another period in Japan, Seagal returned to the United States in 1983 with senior student Haruo Matsuoka. They opened an aikido dojo, initially in North Hollywood, but later moved it to the city of West Hollywood. Seagal left Matsuoka in charge of the dojo, which the latter ran until the two parted ways in 1997. In the early 1980s, Seagal had his first experiences in the film industry by working as a fight coordinator on \"The Challenge\" (1982), which was shot in Japan, and \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983).\nLater in his career, Seagal helped train Brazilian mixed martial artist Lyoto Machida, who credited Seagal for helping him perfect the front kick that he used to knock out Randy Couture at \"UFC 129\" in May 2011.\nCareer.\n1987\u20131993: Hollywood action star.\nIn 1987, Seagal began work on his first film as an actor, \"Above the Law\" (titled \"Nico\" in Europe), with director Andrew Davis. Seagal was asked to make the film by agent Michael Ovitz, who reportedly became convinced that Seagal had movie star potential after taking aikido classes with him. Ovitz financed Seagal's successful screen test, which led Seagal to be offered a contract by Warner Bros. Ovitz' role in starting Seagal's acting career led to a long-standing, unfounded rumor that the agent had made a bet that he could turn anyone into a movie star and decided to bank on his martial arts teacher to win his wager. \"Above the Law\" was a success, grossing $18,869,631 in the U.S. and Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" stated \"It contains 50 percent more plot than it needs, but that allows it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers.\" Following its success, Seagal's subsequent movies were \"Hard to Kill\", \"Marked for Death\", and \"Out for Justice\"; all were box office hits and made Seagal an action hero. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Mr. Seagal is effective for both his novelty value and his ability to be both literally and figuratively disarming.\"\nSeagal achieved mainstream success in 1992 with the release of \"Under Siege\", which reunited him with director Andrew Davis for what critics described as \"\"Die Hard\" on a battleship\". Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 83% based on reviews from 30 critics. The site's consensus states: \"A well-directed action thriller that makes the most of its confined setting, \"Under Siege\" marks a high point for early '90s action\u2014and its star's spotty filmography.\" Reviewers praised Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey's performances as the film's villains, and it is often considered Seagal's best film to date.\nOn April 20, 1991, Seagal hosted Season 16, Episode 18 of \"Saturday Night Live\". The series' long-time executive producer Lorne Michaels and cast-members David Spade and Tim Meadows called Seagal the show's \"worst host ever\". Spade and Meadows cited Seagal's humorlessness, his ill-treatment of the cast and writers, and his refusal to do a \"Hans and Franz\" sketch because the skit's title characters had previously said that they could \"beat up Steven Seagal\". Seagal has never been invited back to the show. Meadows commented, \"He didn't realize that you can't tell somebody they're stupid on Wednesday and expect them to continue writing for you on Saturday.\"\nSNL cast member Julia Sweeney later recalled that Seagal \"had this idea that he's a therapist and he wanted Victoria Jackson to be his patient who's just been raped. And the therapist says, 'You're going to have to come to me twice a week for like three years,\" because, he said, 'That's how therapists freaking are. They're just trying to get your money.' And then he says that the psychiatrist tries to have sex with her.\" The cast and crew's difficulties with Seagal were later echoed on-air by Michaels during guest host Nicolas Cage's monologue in the September 26, 1992, Season 18 premiere. When Cage worried that he would do so poorly that the audience would regard him as \"the biggest jerk who's ever been on the show\", Michaels replied: \"No, no. That would be Steven Seagal.\"\n1994\u20132002: Career fluctuations.\nSeagal directed and starred in \"On Deadly Ground\" (1994), featuring Michael Caine, R. Lee Ermey, and Billy Bob Thornton in minor supporting roles. The film emphasized environmental and spiritual themes, signaling a break with his previous persona as a genre-ready inner-city cop. \"On Deadly Ground\" was poorly received by critics, especially denouncing Seagal's long environmental speech in the film. Regardless, Seagal considers it one of the most important and relevant moments in his career. Seagal followed this with a sequel to one of his most successful films, \"Under Siege\", titled \"\" (1995). According to co-star Morris Chestnut, Seagal rewrote many of the scenes he was in. \"The only time they really stuck to the script or had ad libs was the stuff when he really wasn't there. It was a lot of stuff, because at that time I think he was flying a helicopter, he was doing something... He would come to set, \"Okay, you're gonna say this. I'm gonna say this and this is gonna happen and then you do that.\" That's how we did a lot of that movie.\"\nIn 1996, Seagal had a role in the Kurt Russell film \"Executive Decision\", portraying a special ops soldier who appears in only the film's first 45 minutes. Former Warner Bros Vice President Bill Daly later stated Seagal agreed to the role in exchange for the studio forgiving him losing his director's salary due to going over-budget with \"On Deadly Ground\". The same year, he filmed a police drama, \"The Glimmer Man\" (1996). In another environmentally conscious and commercially unsuccessful film, \"Fire Down Below\" (1997), he played an EPA Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance agent fighting industrialists dumping toxic waste in the Kentucky hills.\nIn 1998, Seagal made \"The Patriot\", another environmental thriller which was his first direct-to-video release in the United States (though it was released theatrically in most of the world). Seagal produced this film with his own money, and the film was shot on-location on and near his farm in Montana. After producing \"Prince of Central Park\", Seagal returned to cinema screens with the release of \"Exit Wounds\" in March 2001. The film had fewer martial arts scenes than Seagal's previous films, but it was a commercial success, taking almost $80 million worldwide. It was considered at the time to be a \"comeback\" for Seagal. However, Seagal was unable to capitalize on this success and his next two projects were both critical and commercial failures. The movie \"Ticker\", co-starring Tom Sizemore and Dennis Hopper, was filmed in San Francisco before \"Exit Wounds\", and went straight to DVD. \"Half Past Dead\", starring hip hop star Ja Rule, made less than $20 million worldwide. It was ranked in a \"Rotten Tomatoes\" editorial on the 100 worst movies of all time. Seagal was also nominated for Worst Actor at the 2002 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards and the 23rd Golden Raspberry Awards.\n2003\u2013present: Direct-to-video films and television.\nOther than his role as a villain in Robert Rodriguez's \"Machete\" (2010), almost all the films Seagal has made since the latter half of 2001 have been released direct-to-video (DTV) in North America, with some theatrical releases to other countries around the world. Seagal is credited as a producer and sometimes a writer on many of these DTV movies, which include \"Black Dawn\", \"Belly of the Beast\", \"Out of Reach\", \"Submerged\", \"Kill Switch\", \"Urban Justice\", \"Pistol Whipped\", \"Against the Dark\", \"Driven to Kill\", \"A Dangerous Man\", \"Born to Raise Hell\", and \"The Keeper\". \"Beyond the Law\" (2019) is one of Seagal's few movies to have had a theatrical release in North America since \"Machete\".\nIn 2009, A&amp;E Network premiered the reality television series \"\", focusing on Seagal as a deputy in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. In the 2010s, Seagal's direct-to-video films increasingly started to become ensemble pieces, with Seagal playing minor or supporting roles, despite the fact that he often received top billing. \"Maximum Conviction\", \"Force of Execution\", \"Gutshot Straight\", \"Code of Honor\", \"Sniper Special Ops\", \"The Asian Connection\", \"The Perfect Weapon\", \"Cartels\", and \"China Salesman\" all exemplify this trend. This has led some commentators to criticize Seagal for his low-effort participation in movies which heavily promote his involvement.\nIn 2011, Seagal produced and starred in an American television action series entitled \"True Justice\". The series first aired on Nitro, a TV station in Spain, on May 12, 2011. It premiered in the UK on 5 USA, with the first episode broadcast July 20, 2011. The series was renewed for a second season airing on ReelzChannel. In the UK, \"True Justice\" was repackaged as a series of DVD movies, with each disc editing together two episodes.\nInfluence and artistry.\nAt the height of his career, Seagal was one of the biggest action movie stars in the world, and one of the most successful martial arts actors of the 1980s and 1990s, alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. Credited with popularising aikido in film, Seagal is considered an important figure in the development and popularization of East Asian martial arts in the West. \nMany of Seagal's films share unique elements which have become characteristic of his body of work. His characters often have an elite past affiliation with the CIA, Special Forces, or Black Ops (for example, Casey Ryback in \"Under Siege\", a former Navy SEAL, Jack Cole in \"The Glimmer Man\", an ex-CIA police detective, or Jonathan Cold in \"The Foreigner\" and \"Black Dawn\", an ex-CIA Black Ops freelancer). His characters differ from those of other action movie icons by virtue of their near-invulnerability; they rarely face any significant physical threat, easily overpowering any opposition and seldom facing bodily harm or even temporary defeat. Two notable exceptions are \"Executive Decision\" (1996), in which Seagal's character is introduced as a false protagonist only to be killed halfway through and \"Machete\" (2010), which features Seagal in a rare villainous role.\nSeagal's films also frequently reflect aspects of his personal life. His music appears in several of his films (for example, \"Into the Sun\" and \"Ticker\", where he appears as part of a bar band), as does his fluency in other languages (he speaks Japanese in \"Into the Sun\") and religion (Buddhism features prominently in \"The Glimmer Man\" and \"Belly of the Beast\"). His past as an aikido teacher is also incorporated into several films, for example \"Above the Law\" (which opens with a montage of real-life photos from Seagal's own past) or \"Shadow Man\", where he is seen giving an aikido demonstration. Several of his films also feature prominent political messages, most notably the environmentalism evident in \"On Deadly Ground\".\nWhile Seagal's acting in \"Above the Law\" gained praise from the likes of Roger Ebert, Seagal has repeatedly faced criticism from both critics and fans who accuse him of playing the same character in many of his movies, as well as displaying a lack of emotional range. In fact, his typecasting has been informally referred to as \"Seagalism\" and has become the subject of much parody. In 2008, author and critic Vern published \"Seagalogy\", a work which examines Seagal's filmography using the framework of auteur theory. Vern describes themes of government corruption (particularly involving the CIA), environmentalism, and adoption of foreign cultures as being examples of recurrent motifs in Seagal's films, among a variety of others. The first edition breaks Seagal's career into four chronological \"eras\", marked by specific differences in style and content. The 2012 updated edition adds a fifth era.\nThese chronological \"eras\" describe different phases of Seagal's career, and include the \"Golden Era\" (1988\u20131991), the period of Seagal's first successes, the \"Silver Era\" (1992\u20131997), during which Seagal saw the peak of his fame and made high-profile blockbusters, a \"Transitional Period\" (1998\u20132002) during which he made lower-profile or ensemble films, a lengthy \"direct-to-video\" period (his most prolific to date, 2003\u20132008) and, in the 2012 updated addition, a \"Chief Seagal\" period (2009\u2013present) during which Seagal moved into television and began reflecting elements of his \"Steven Seagal: Lawman\" persona in his films.\nOther ventures.\nMusic.\nSeagal plays the guitar and among his extensive collection are guitars previously owned by \"the Kings\"; Albert, BB, and Freddie, as well as Bo Diddley, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Jimi Hendrix. In 2004, he released his first album, \"Songs from the Crystal Cave\", which has a mix of pop, world, country, and blues music. It features duets with Tony Rebel, Lt. Stichie, Lady Saw, and Stevie Wonder. The soundtrack to Seagal's 2005 film \"Into the Sun\" features several songs from the album. One of his album tracks, \"Girl It's Alright\", was also released as a single in several countries alongside an accompanying music video. Seagal's second album, titled \"Mojo Priest\", was released in April 2006; Seagal used the material to embark on a concert tour. Thom Jurek of AllMusic panned the album, rating it 1.5 stars out of 5 and stating that Seagal's guitar playing \"rarely rises above bar band pedigree\" and that \"all of this music takes itself so seriously that it borders on delusional excess.\"\nLaw enforcement work.\nSeagal has been a Reserve Deputy Chief in the Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Sheriff's Office. In the late 1980s, after teaching the deputies martial arts, unarmed combat, and marksmanship, then-sheriff Harry Lee (1932\u20132007) asked Seagal to join the force. Seagal's rank in Louisiana was ceremonial. \"\", a series which follows his work in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, premiered on A&amp;E on December 2, 2009. Seagal stated that \"I've decided to work with A&amp;E on this series now because I believe it's important to show the nation all the positive work being accomplished here in Louisiana\u2014to see the passion and commitment that comes from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office in this post-Katrina environment.\" The series premiere drew 3.6 million viewers, ranking as best season opener for any original A&amp;E series ever.\nOn April 14, 2010, the series was suspended by Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand due to a sexual trafficking lawsuit filed against Seagal. The suit was later dropped. A&amp;E resumed the show for the second season, which began on October 6, 2010. Production on Season 3 started in February 2011, with a change of location from Louisiana to Maricopa County, Arizona. Two episodes were scheduled to be aired, beginning on January 4, 2012. Shortly before the episodes were to be aired, Season 3 was suspended, with no explanations given. Season 3 premiered on January 2, 2014, but the show was not renewed for a fourth season. In October 2011, Seagal was sworn in as the Sheriff department's deputy sheriff of Hudspeth County, Texas, a law department responsible for patrolling a 98-mile stretch of the Texas-Mexico border.\nBusiness ventures.\nIn 1997, Seagal was to be featured in an action video game for the Nintendo 64 and the original PlayStation called \"Deadly Honor\", but it was cancelled for undisclosed reasons in its beta phase of development. In 2005, Seagal Enterprises began to market an energy drink known as \"Steven Seagal's Lightning Bolt\", but it has since been discontinued. Seagal has also marketed an aftershave called \"Scent of Action\", and a range of knives and weapons. In 2013, Seagal joined newly formed Russian firearms manufacturer ORSIS, representing the company in both a promotional capacity as well as lobbying for the easement of US import restrictions on Russian sporting firearms.\nPersonal life.\nSeagal has an extensive sword collection, and at one time had a custom gun made for him once a month. Seagal owns a home in the Mandeville Canyon section of Los Angeles, and a home in Louisiana. He formerly lived on Staten Island in New York. Seagal is a Buddhist and in February 1997, Lama Penor Rinpoche from Palyul monastery announced that Seagal was a tulku, and specifically the reincarnation of Chungdrag Dorje, a 17th-century terton (treasure revealer) of the Nyingma, the oldest sect of Tibetan Buddhism.\nSeagal holds citizenships in three countries: the United States, Serbia, and Russia. Born in the United States, he possesses \"jus soli\" U.S. citizenship. He was granted Serbian citizenship on January 11, 2016, following several visits to the country, and has been asked to teach aikido to the Serbian Special Forces.\nSeagal was granted Russian citizenship on November 3, 2016; according to government spokesman Dmitry Peskov, \"He was asking quite insistently and over a lengthy period to be granted citizenship.\" Various media outlets have cited Seagal and President Vladimir Putin as friends and Seagal stated that he \"would like to consider [Putin] as a brother\". Putin bestowed the Russian award of Order of Friendship medal upon Seagal in 2023; Peskov has said of Putin: \"he's definitely seen some of his movies.\"\nWhile in Japan, Seagal married his first wife, Miyako Fujitani, the daughter of an aikido instructor. With Fujitani, he had a son, actor and model Kentaro Seagal, and a daughter, writer and actress Ayako Fujitani. Seagal left Miyako to move back to the United States. During this time, he met actress and model Kelly LeBrock, with whom he began an affair that led to Fujitani granting him a divorce. Seagal was briefly married to actress Adrienne La Russa in 1984, but that marriage was annulled the same year over concerns that his divorce had not yet been finalized. LeBrock gave birth to Seagal's daughter Annaliza in early 1987. Seagal and LeBrock married in September 1987 and their son Dominic was born in June 1990. Their daughter Arissa was born in 1993. The following year, LeBrock filed for divorce citing \"irreconcilable differences\".\nSeagal is married to Mongolian Erdenetuya Batsukh (), better known as \"Elle\". They have one son together, Kunzang. From an early age, Elle trained as a dancer at the Children's Palace in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. After her graduation from high school and the Children's Palace, she pursued a career as a professional dancer. She won a number of dancing contests and was considered the top female dancer in Mongolia, excelling at ballroom dancing in particular. Elle first met Seagal in 2001, when she worked as his interpreter during his visit to Mongolia. Seagal has seven children from four relationships, two grandchildren by his eldest son, Kentaro and two granddaughters by his daughter Ayako Fujitani. In addition to his biological offspring, Seagal is the guardian of Yabshi Pan Rinzinwangmo, the only child of the 10th Panchen Lama of Tibet. When she studied in the United States, Seagal was her minder and bodyguard.\nIn 2017, former two time World boxing heavyweight champion George Foreman publicly challenged Seagal to an official ten-round MMA match in Las Vegas.\nControversies.\nAllegations and lawsuits.\nIn May 1991 (during the filming of \"Out for Justice\"), Warner Bros. employees Raenne Malone, Nicole Selinger, and Christine Keeve accused Seagal of sexual harassment. In return for remaining silent, Malone and another woman received around $50,000 each in an out-of-court settlement. Around the same time, at least four actresses said that Seagal had made sexual advances, typically during late-night \"casting sessions\". In another incident, Jenny McCarthy said that Seagal asked her to undress during an audition for \"\".\nIn 1995, Seagal was charged with employment discrimination, sexual harassment, and breach of contract. Cheryl Shuman filed a case against Seagal, accusing him of threatening and beating her during the filming of \"On Deadly Ground\". In August 1995, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki dismissed the case, calling the claims \"repetitive and unintelligible\".\nOn April 12, 2010, 23-year-old Kayden Nguyen filed a lawsuit against Seagal in a Los Angeles County Superior Court, requesting more than one million dollars in damages. In her suit, Nguyen alleged Seagal engaged in sexual harassment, the illegal trafficking of females for sex, failure to prevent sexual harassment, and wrongful termination. Seagal denied the allegations, but his reality show \"\" was suspended while his attorneys resolved the case. On July 14, 2010, three months after Nguyen filed her suit, she withdrew her claim without explanation.\nOn August 30, 2011, Jesus Sanchez Llovera filed a lawsuit against Seagal over his part in a Maricopa county police raid with heavy weapons (notably including an army surplus tank) of Llovera's residence for suspicion of cockfighting. The incident was taped for Seagal's A&amp;E reality show \"Steven Seagal: Lawman\". Llovera was seeking $100,000 for damages caused during the raid and a letter of apology from Seagal to Llovera's children for the death of their family pet. Llovera claimed that his 11-month-old puppy was shot and killed during the raid. Llovera failed to file court-ordered paperwork after his attorney withdrew from the case and the lawsuit was dismissed in January 2013.\nIn 2017, actress Portia de Rossi accused Seagal of sexually harassing her during a movie audition. De Rossi alleged that during an audition in Seagal's office, he told her \"how important it was to have chemistry off-screen\" before unzipping his pants. On an April 18 appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", Katherine Heigl alleged on the final day of shooting for \"Under Siege 2\" that Seagal told her that he had girlfriends the same age as the 16-year-old Heigl. Kimmel responded by displaying a photo from the film's promotional tour showing Seagal's hand on Heigl's chest while they posed for a photo. \nOn November 9, 2017, Dutch model Faviola Dadis posted a statement on her Instagram account stating that she also had been sexually assaulted by Seagal years earlier.\nOn January 15, 2018, actress Rachel Grant publicly accused Seagal of sexually assaulting her in 2002, during pre-production on his direct-to-video film, \"Out for a Kill\" (2003), stating that she lost her job on the film after the incident. In February 2018, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office acknowledged that it was reviewing a potential sex-abuse case involving Seagal.\nIn March 2018, Regina Simons publicly claimed that in 1993, when she was 18, Seagal raped her at his home when she arrived for what she thought was a wrap party for the movie \"On Deadly Ground.\" In September 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors refused to charge the actor based on Regina Simons accusations, due to California's statute of limitations. Two months later, the case involving the actress Rachel Grant was dismissed for the same reasons.\nVictim of attempted extortion.\nSeagal became embroiled in a legal case involving film producer Julius R. Nasso after Nasso attempted to extort Seagal. Nasso produced seven of Seagal's films beginning with \"Marked for Death\" in 1990. The two \"became best friends\", according to Seagal, and formed Seagal/Nasso Productions together. Their relationship became strained, however, and their partnership ended in 2000. Believing that Seagal owed him $3 million in compensation for backing out of a four-film deal, Nasso enlisted members of the Gambino crime family to threaten Seagal in an attempt to recoup money Nasso allegedly lost.\nGambino family captain Anthony Ciccone first visited Seagal in Toronto during the filming of \"Exit Wounds\" in October 2000. In January 2001, Primo Cassarino and other gangsters picked up Seagal by car to bring him to a meeting with Ciccone at a Brooklyn restaurant. At the meeting, Ciccone reportedly told Seagal that he had a choice of making four promised movies with Nasso or paying Nasso a penalty of $150,000 per movie, and that if Seagal refused, Ciccone would kill him.\nSeagal, who later claimed that he brought a handgun to the meeting, was able to stall Ciccone and escape the meeting unharmed. In the spring of 2001, Seagal sought out another mobster, Genovese crime family captain Angelo Prisco, to act as a \"peacemaker\". He visited Prisco in prison at Rahway, New Jersey and paid Prisco's lawyer $10,000.\nOn March 17, 2003, Cassarino, Ciccone and others were convicted of labor racketeering, extortion, and 63 other counts under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Seagal testified for the prosecution about the mobsters' extortion attempt. Nasso pleaded guilty to the charge of extortion conspiracy in August 2003. In February 2004, he was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, fined $75,000 and ordered to take mental health counselling on release from jail. In January 2008, Nasso agreed to drop a $60 million lawsuit against Seagal for an alleged breach of contract when the two settled out of court.\nConflicts with stuntmen.\nSeagal has been accused by former stunt performers who have worked with him, including Kane Hodder, Stephen Quadros, and Gene LeBell, of intentionally hitting stuntmen during scenes. Additionally, while serving as stunt coordinator for \"Out for Justice\", LeBell allegedly got into an on-set altercation with Seagal over his mistreatment of some of the film's stunt performers. After the actor claimed that, due to his aikido training, he was \"immune\" to being choked unconscious, LeBell supposedly offered Seagal the opportunity to prove it. With Seagal's permission, LeBell then successfully choked him unconscious, with Seagal losing bowel control. Although LeBell has not directly confirmed the rumor, he implied that it was true in a 2012 interview. Seagal's bodyguard and stuntman Steven Lambert stated that a confrontation did happen, during which Seagal elbowed LeBell before he could lock the hold, after which LeBell flipped Seagal. Seagal has directly denied that a confrontation took place, calling LeBell a \"sick, pathological scumbag liar\".\nRobart Wall included LeBell in his \"Dirty Dozen\", a list of martial artists willing to answer to a public challenge made by Seagal. LeBell however declined to participate, as the feud with Seagal was hurting him professionally. He did however criticize Seagal for his treatment of stuntmen, and left open the possibility of a professional fight if Seagal wanted.\nAllegations of mistreatment towards stuntmen have continued throughout Seagal's later career, with both stuntman Peter Harris Kent (Arnold Schwarzenegger's stunt double) and Mike Leeder publicly criticizing his on-set antics. Actor John Leguizamo also claimed that during rehearsals on \"Executive Decision\", in retaliation for laughing at him, Seagal caught him off guard and knocked him into a brick wall. Michael Jai White, who acted with him in a number of movies, stated that he routinely hit stunt men, and that he was known for it. He said they just accepted it. However, he stated that Seagal never hit him.\nPolitical views and activism.\nSeagal lent his voice as a narrator for an activist film project, \"Medicine Lake Video\". The project seeks to protect sacred tribal ground near Seagal's ranch in Siskiyou County. He also wrote an open letter to the leadership of Thailand in 2003, urging them to enact a law to prevent the torture of baby elephants. In 1999, Seagal was awarded a PETA Humanitarian Award.\nIn a March 2014 interview with \"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\", Seagal described Vladimir Putin as \"one of the great living world leaders\". He expressed support for the annexation of Crimea by Russia. In July 2014, following calls for a boycott, Seagal was dropped from the lineup of the August Blues Festival in Haapsalu, Estonia. Estonian musician T\u00f5nis M\u00e4gi, minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Paet, and Parliament's Foreign Affairs chairman Marko Mihkelson had all condemned inviting Seagal into the country, with Paet saying, \"Steven Seagal has tried to actively participate in politics during the past few months and has done it in a way which is unacceptable to the majority of the world that respects democracy and the rule of law.\"\nIn August 2014, Seagal appeared at a Night Wolves-organized show in Sevastopol, Crimea, supporting the Crimean annexation and depicting Ukraine as a country controlled by fascists. On November 3, Seagal was granted Russian citizenship by Putin. His views on Ukraine and Russian citizenship caused Ukraine to ban him from entering the country because he \"committed socially dangerous actions\". Seagal visited the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2015 and met with the country's long-time president, Ilham Aliyev. Seagal has expressed support for Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and dispute with neighboring Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\nSeagal spoke out against the protests during the United States national anthem by professional athletes, stating, \"I believe in free speech, I believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but I don't agree that they should hold the United States of America or the world hostage by taking a venue where people are tuning in to watch a football game and imposing their political views.\" He also expressed skepticism of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.\nIn 2017, Seagal collaborated with a former chair of the Arizona Republican Party, Tom Morrissey, in writing a self-published conspiracy thriller novel, \"The Way of the Shadow Wolves: The Deep State And The Hijacking Of America,\" which featured a Tohono Shadow Wolf tracker working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to foil a plot by Mexican drug cartels and the \"deep state\" to smuggle in Islamist terrorists to the United States through the U.S.\u2013Mexico border.\nIn October 2017, Seagal met with Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte while scouting locations in Manila for a possible film. During the visit, Seagal flashed Duterte's signature fist. In 2021, Seagal gave a katana to Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry special envoy while visiting Canaima National Park. Maduro referred to Seagal as \"my brother.\" On May 30, 2021, the pro-Kremlin systemic opposition party A Just Russia \u2014 Patriots \u2014 For Truth announced that Seagal had received an official membership card to the party.\nIn March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Seagal visited Moscow where he organized his birthday party, attended by many people connected to Vladimir Putin, including some affected by international sanctions. This has been criticized as a dissenting action that came amidst the growing international boycott of Russia. In August 2022, he visited Olenivka in Donetsk Oblast, the site of the Olenivka prison massacre, with Donetsk People's Republic leader Denis Pushilin, who claimed that Seagal was filming a documentary about the war in Donbas. Seagal also met with Leonid Slutsky. On February 27, 2023, he received the Russian Order of Friendship from Vladimir Putin for his \"major contribution to the development of international cultural and humanitarian cooperation\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67405", "revid": "50537970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67405", "title": "Great Red Spot", "text": "Persistent storm in Jupiter's atmosphere\nThe Great Red Spot is a persistent high-pressure region in the atmosphere of Jupiter, producing an anticyclonic storm that is the largest in the Solar System. It is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter, owing to its red-orange color whose origin is still unknown. Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind-speeds up to . It was first observed in September 1831, with 60 recorded observations between then and 1878, when continuous observations began. A similar spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; if this is the same storm, it has existed for at least 360 years, but a study from 2024 suggests this is not the case.\nObservation history.\nFirst observations.\nThe Great Red Spot may have existed before 1664, but it could be that the present spot was first seen only in 1830, and was well studied only after a prominent appearance in 1879. The storm that was seen in the 17th century may have been different from the storm that exists today. A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from the 17th century discovery. It is unknown whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded away, or whether observers simply failed to study and record it.\nThe first sighting of the Great Red Spot is often credited to Robert Hooke, who described a spot on the planet in May 1664. However, it is likely that Hooke's spot was not only in another belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, as opposed to the current Great Red Spot in the South Equatorial Belt), but also that it was in the shadow of a transiting moon, most likely Callisto. In the following year, Giovanni Cassini describes a \"a permanent [spot] which was often seen to return in the same place with the same size and shape\", calculating its rotation period to be 9 h 56 min. With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713, but the 48-year observational gap makes the identity of the two spots inconclusive. Because of the older spot's shorter observational history and slower motion than the modern spot, it is difficult to conclude that they are the same.\nA minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted in a 1711 canvas by Donato Creti, which is exhibited in the Vatican. Part of a series of panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, and all overseen by the astronomer Eustachio Manfredi for accuracy, Creti's painting is the first known depiction of a large spot on Jupiter as red (albeit raised to the Jovian northern hemisphere due to an optical inversion inherent to the era's telescopes). No Jovian feature was explicitly described in writing as red before the late 19th century.\nThe Great Red Spot has been frequently observed since 5 September 1831, with over 60 observations recorded by 1879, when it came into popular prominence. Since then, it has been under continuous observation.\nA 2024 study of historical observations suggests that the \"permanent spot\" observed from 1665 to 1713 may not be the same as the modern Great Red Spot observed since 1831. It is suggested that the original spot disappeared, and later another spot formed, which is the one seen today.\nLate 20th and 21st centuries.\nOn 25 February 1979, when the \"Voyager 1\" spacecraft was from Jupiter, it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot. Cloud details as small as across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the left (west) of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion.\nIn the 21st century, the major diameter of the Great Red Spot has been observed to be shrinking. In 2004 its length was about half that of a century earlier, when it reached a size of , about three times the diameter of Earth. At the present rate of reduction, it will become circular by 2040. \nIt is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of periodic fluctuations. In 2019, the spot began \"flaking\" at its edge, with fragments of the storm spinning off and dissipating. The shrinking and \"flaking\" fueled speculation from some astronomers that the spot could dissipate within decades. However, other astronomers believe the apparent size of the spot reflects its cloud coverage and not the size of the underlying vortex, and also that the flaking events can be explained by interactions with other cyclones or anticyclones, including incomplete absorptions of smaller systems; this might mean that the Great Red Spot is not in danger of dissipating.\nA smaller spot, designated Oval BA, which formed in March 2000 from the merging of three white ovals, has turned reddish in color. Astronomers have named it the \"Little Red Spot\" or \"Red Jr\". As of 5 June 2006, the Great Red Spot and Oval BA appeared to be approaching convergence. The storms pass each other about every two years, but the passings of 2002 and 2004 were of little significance. Amy Simon-Miller, of the Goddard Space Flight Center, predicted the storms would have their closest passing on 4 July 2006. She worked with Imke de Pater and Phil Marcus of UC Berkeley as well as a team of professional astronomers beginning in April 2006 to study the storms using the Hubble Space Telescope; on 20 July 2006, the two storms were photographed passing each other by the Gemini Observatory without converging. In May 2008, a third storm turned red.\nThe \"Juno\" spacecraft, which entered into a polar orbit around Jupiter in 2016, flew over the Great Red Spot upon its close approach to Jupiter on 11 July 2017, taking several images of the storm from a distance of about above the surface. Over the duration of the \"Juno\" mission, the spacecraft continued to study the composition and evolution of Jupiter's atmosphere, especially its Great Red Spot.\nThe Great Red Spot should not be confused with the Great Dark Spot, a feature observed near the northern pole of Jupiter in 2000 with the \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" spacecraft. There is also a feature in the atmosphere of Neptune called the Great Dark Spot. The latter feature was imaged by \"Voyager 2\" in 1989 and may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm. It disappeared by 1994, although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north.\nMechanical dynamics.\nJupiter's Great Red Spot rotates counterclockwise, with a period of about 4.5 Earth days, or 11 Jovian days, as of 2008. Measuring in width as of 3 April 2017, the Great Red Spot is 1.3 times the diameter of Earth. It has been shrinking for about a century, making it now slightly smaller than Earth. The cloud-tops of this storm are about above the surrounding cloud-tops. The storm has continued for centuries because there is no planetary surface (only a mantle of hydrogen) to cause friction; circulating atmospheric eddies persist because there is nothing to oppose their angular momentum.\nInfrared data has long indicated that the Great Red Spot is colder (and thus higher in altitude) than most of the other clouds on the planet. The upper atmosphere above the storm, however, has substantially higher temperatures than the rest of the planet. Acoustic waves rising from the turbulence of the storm below have been proposed as an explanation for the heating of this region. The acoustic waves travel vertically up to a height of above the storm where they break in the upper atmosphere, converting wave energy into heat. This creates a region of upper atmosphere that is \u2014several hundred kelvins warmer than the rest of the planet at this altitude. The effect is described as like \"crashing [...] ocean waves on a beach\".\nCareful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the Great Red Spot's counterclockwise circulation as far back as 1966, observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the \"Voyager\" fly-bys. The spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its north. Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at about , currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow. The rotation of the spot has slowed with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.\nThe Great Red Spot's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its longitude, however, is subject to constant variation, including a 90-day longitudinal oscillation with an amplitude of ~1\u00b0. Because Jupiter's gaseous body does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined three different systems for defining longitude. System II is used for latitudes of more than 10 degrees and was originally based on the average rotational period of the Great Red Spot (9 h 55 min 42 s). Despite this, however, the spot has \"lapped\" the planet in System II at least 10 times since the early 19th century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.\nInternal depth and structure.\nJupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) is an elliptical-shaped anticyclone, occurring at 22 degrees below the equator, in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. The largest anticyclonic storm (~16,000 km) in the Solar System, little is known about its internal depth and structure. Visible imaging and cloud-tracking from in-situ observation determined the velocity and vorticity of the GRS, which is located in a thin anticyclonic ring at 70\u201385% of the radius and is located along Jupiter's fastest westward moving jet stream. During NASA's 2016 \"Juno\" mission, gravity signature and thermal infrared data were obtained that offered insight into the structural dynamics and depth of the GRS. During July 2017, the \"Juno\" spacecraft conducted a second pass of the GRS to collect Microwave Radiometer (MWR) scans of the GRS to determine how far the GRS extended toward the surface of the condensed H2O layer. These MWR scans suggested that the GRS vertical depth extended to about 240 km below cloud level, with an estimated drop in atmospheric pressure to 100 bar. Two methods of analysis that constrain the data collected were the mascon approach, which found a depth of ~290 km, and the Slepian approach showing wind extending to ~310 km. These methods, along with gravity signature MWR data, suggest that the GRS zonal winds still increase at a rate of 50% of the velocity of the viable cloud level, before the wind decay starts at lower levels. This rate of wind decay and gravity data suggest the depth of the GRS is between 200 and 500 km.\nGalileo and Cassini's thermal infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the GRS were conducted during 1995\u20132008, in order to find evidence of thermal inhomogeneities within the internal structure vortex of the GRS. Previous thermal infrared temperature maps from the Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini missions suggested the GRS is a structure of an anticyclonic vortex with a cold core within a upwelling warmer annulus; this data shows a gradient in the temperature of the GRS. Better understanding of Jupiter's atmospheric temperature, aerosol particle opacity, and ammonia gas composition was provided by thermal-IR imaging: a direct correlation of the visible cloud layers reactions, thermal gradient and compositional mapping to observational data were collected over decades. During December 2000, high spatial resolution images from Galileo, of an atmospheric turbulent area to the northwest of the GRS, showed a thermal contrast between the warmest region of the anticyclone and regions to the east and west of the GRS.\nThe vertical temperature of the structure of the GRS is constrained to be between 100 and 600 mbar, with the vertical temperature of the GRS core at approximately 400 mbar of pressure being 1.0\u20131.5 K, much warmer than regions of the GRS to the east\u2013west, and 3.0\u20133.5 K warmer than regions to the north\u2013south of the structure's edge.[] This structure is consistent with the data collected by the VISIR (VLT Mid-Infrared Imager Spectrometer on the ESO Very Large Telescope) imaging obtained in 2006; this revealed that the GRS was physically present at a wide range of altitudes that occur within the atmospheric pressure range of 80\u2013600 mbar, and confirms the thermal infrared mapping result. To develop a model of the internal structure of the GRS, the Cassini instrument Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) and ground based spatial imaging mapped the composition of the phosphine and ammonia aerosols (PH3, NH3) and para-hydroxybenzoic acid within the anticyclonic circulation of the GRS. The images that were collected from the CIRS and ground-based imaging trace the vertical motion in the Jovian atmosphere by PH3 and NH3 spectra.\nThe highest concentrations of PH3 and NH3 were found to the north of the GRS peripheral rotation. They aided in determining the southward jet movement and showed evidence of an increase in altitude of the column of aerosols with pressures ranging from 200\u2013500 mbar. However, the NH3 composition data shows that there is a major depletion of NH3 below the visible cloud layer at the southern peripheral ring of the GRS; this lower opacity is relative to a narrow band of atmospheric subsidence. The low mid-IR aerosol opacity, along with the temperature gradients, the altitude difference, and the vertical movement of the zonal winds, are involved with the development and sustainability of the vorticity. The stronger atmospheric subsidence and compositional asymmetries of the GRS suggest that the structure exhibits a degree of tilt from the northern edge to the southern edge of the structure. The GRS depth and internal structure has been constantly changing over decades; however there is still no logical reason that it is 200\u2013500 km in depth, but the jet streams that supply the force that powers the GRS vortex are well below the structure base.\nColor and composition.\nIt is not known what causes the Great Red Spot's reddish color. Hypotheses supported by laboratory experiments suppose that it may be caused by chemical products created by the solar ultraviolet irradiation of ammonium hydrosulfide and the organic compound acetylene, which produces a reddish material\u2014likely complex organic compounds called tholins. The high altitude of the compounds may also contribute to the coloring.\nThe Great Red Spot varies greatly in hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon or even white. The spot occasionally disappears, becoming evident only through the Red Spot Hollow, which is its location in the South Equatorial Belt (SEB). Its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB: when the belt is bright white, the spot tends to be dark, and when it is dark, the spot is usually light. These periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals: between 1947 and 1997, the spot was darkest in the periods 1961\u20131966, 1968\u20131975, 1989\u20131990, and 1992\u20131993.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The music was composed by the German immigrant Fredrik Pacius, with original Swedish lyrics by Johan Ludvig Runeberg. It was first performed on 13 May 1848. Originally, it was written for the 500th anniversary of Porvoo, and for that occasion it was Runeberg himself who wrote the music.\nThe melody of \"Maamme\" is also used for two other anthems: the Estonian anthem \"Mu isamaa, mu \u00f5nn ja r\u00f5\u00f5m\" (\"My Fatherland, My Happiness and Joy\") and the Livonian anthem \"Min iz\u0101m\u014d\" (\"My Fatherland\").\nHistory.\nThe original poem, written in 1846 but not printed until 1848, had 11 stanzas and formed the prologue to the verse cycle \"The Tales of Ensign St\u00e5l\" (\"F\u00e4nrik St\u00e5hls s\u00e4gner\"), a classic example of Romantic nationalism. The current Finnish language text is usually attributed to the 1889 translation of \"Ensign St\u00e5l\" by Paavo Cajander, but in fact, originates from the 1867 translation by Julius Krohn.\nIn the 1880s and the 1920s, there were more attempts to replace it with a Finnish language version but these ceased by the 1930s. Some Finns have proposed that the Finnish national anthem be set as \"Finlandia\" by Jean Sibelius, with lyrics by V.A. Koskenniemi (Finnish) and Joel Rundt (Swedish).\nIt is said that Pacius composed the tune in four days. It was popular throughout the 19th century but established its current position only after Pacius' death.\nStatus and usage.\nThere is no law regarding an official national anthem in Finland, in the way the coat of arms and flag of Finland are legally defined. Instead, its position has been established gradually by convention over the years. In 2018, \"Maamme\" was described by the Government of Finland as the \"Finnish national anthem\".\nEven though \"Maamme\" has become established as the \"de facto\" anthem, its status has still been debated from time to time. It has been suggested that the status of \"Maamme\" as the national anthem should be legalised. For example, opposing legislative initiatives were made in 2003 by the Finnish Parliament to make \"Maamme\" and the Finlandia Hymn the official national anthem. In 2014, there was a citizens' initiative about choosing the Finlandia Hymn as the national anthem, and in 2016 members of the National Coalition Party began campaigning to stop using \"Maamme\" in favour of the Finlandia Hymn, however, opinions were not unanimous in the party, and the campaign fell short of its goal.\nDespite the lack of official status, in usage, \"Maamme\" fills the function of a national anthem in the same way as in many other countries. For example, it is played during state visits, and used to represent Finland at international sporting fixtures.\nLyrics.\nThe original lyrics consist of eleven verses, but it is customary to only sing the first verse and the last verse unless the people gathered are mixed Finnish- and Swedish-speaking. In the latter case, three verses are sung: the first in Finnish, the first in Swedish and the last in Finnish.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its larger fuselage cross-section allowed six-abreast economy seating, retained in the later 720, 727, 737, and 757 models.\nAlthough it was not the first commercial jetliner in service, the 707 was the first to be widespread, and is often credited with beginning the Jet Age. It dominated passenger air-transport in the 1960s, and remained common through the 1970s, on domestic, transcontinental, and transatlantic flights, as well as cargo and military applications. It established Boeing as a dominant airliner manufacturer with its 7x7 series.\nThe initial, 707-120 was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engines.\nThe shortened, long-range 707-138 and the more powerful 707-220 entered service in 1959.\nThe longer-range, heavier 707-300/400 series has larger wings and is stretched slightly by .\nPowered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A turbojets, the 707-320 entered service in 1959, and the 707-420 with Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans in 1960.\nThe 720, a lighter short-range variant, was also introduced in 1960. Powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D turbofans, the 707-120B debuted in 1961 and the 707-320B in 1962. The 707-120B typically flew 137 passengers in two classes over , and could accommodate 174 in one class. With 141 passengers in two classes, the 707-320/420 could fly and the 707-320B up to . The 707-320C convertible passenger-freighter model entered service in 1963, and passenger 707s have been converted to freighter configurations. Military derivatives include the E-3 Sentry airborne reconnaissance aircraft and the C-137 Stratoliner VIP transport. In total, 865 Boeing 707s were produced and delivered, not including 154 Boeing 720s.\nDevelopment.\nModel 367-80 origins.\nDuring and after World War II, Boeing was known for its military aircraft. The company had produced innovative and important bombers, from the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-29 Superfortress to the jet-powered B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress, but its commercial aircraft were not as successful as those from Douglas Aircraft and other competitors. As Douglas and Lockheed dominated the postwar air transport boom, the demand for Boeing's offering, the 377 Stratocruiser, quickly faded with only 56 examples sold and no new orders as the 1940s drew to a close. That venture had netted the company a $15 million loss. During 1949 and 1950, Boeing embarked on studies for a new jet transport and saw advantages with a design aimed at both military and civilian markets. Aerial refueling was becoming a standard technique for military aircraft, with over 800 KC-97 Stratofreighters on order. The KC-97 was not ideally suited for operations with the USAF's new fleets of jet-powered fighters and bombers; this was where Boeing's new design would win military orders.\nAs the first of a new generation of American passenger jets, Boeing wanted the aircraft's model number to emphasize the difference from its previous propeller-driven aircraft, which bore 300-series numbers. The 400-, 500- and 600-series were already used by their missiles and other products, so Boeing decided that the jets would bear 700-series numbers, and the first would be the 707. The marketing personnel at Boeing chose 707 because they thought it was more appealing than 700.\nThe project was enabled by the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engine, the civilian version of the J57 that yielded much more power than the previous generation of jet engines and was proving itself with the B-52. Freed from the design constraints imposed by limitations of late-1940s jet engines, developing a robust, safe, and high-capacity jet aircraft was within reach for Boeing. Boeing studied numerous wing and engine layouts for its new transport/tanker, some of which were based on the B-47 and C-97, before settling on the 367-80 \"Dash 80\" quadjet prototype aircraft. Less than two years elapsed from project launch in 1952 to rollout on May 14, 1954, with the first Dash 80 flying on July 15, 1954. The prototype was a proof-of-concept aircraft for both military and civilian use. The United States Air Force was the first customer, using it as the basis for the KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling and cargo aircraft.\nWhether the passenger 707 would be profitable was far from certain. At the time, nearly all of Boeing's revenue came from military contracts. In a demonstration flight over Lake Washington outside Seattle, on August 7, 1955, test pilot Tex Johnston performed a barrel roll in the 367-80 prototype. Although he justified his unauthorized action to Bill Allen, then president of Boeing, as selling the airplane with a 1 'g' maneuver he was told not to do it again.\nThe wide fuselage of the Dash 80 was large enough for four-abreast (two-plus-two) seating like the Stratocruiser. Answering customers' demands and under Douglas competition, Boeing soon realized this would not provide a viable payload, so it widened the fuselage to to allow five-abreast seating and use of the KC-135's tooling. Douglas Aircraft had launched its DC-8 with a fuselage width of . The airlines liked the extra space and six-abreast seating, so Boeing increased the 707's width again to compete, this time to .\nProduction and testing.\nThe first flight of the first-production 707-120 took place on December 20, 1957, and FAA certification followed on September 18, 1958. Both test pilots Joseph John \"Tym\" Tymczyszyn and James R. Gannett were awarded the first Iven C. Kincheloe Award for the test flights that led to certification. A number of changes were incorporated into the production models from the prototype. A Krueger flap was installed along the leading edge between the inner and outer engines on early 707-120 and -320 models. This was in response to de Havilland Comet overrun accidents which occurred after over-rotating on take-off. Wing stall would also occur on the 707 with over-rotation so the leading-edge flaps were added to prevent stalling even with the tail dragging on the runway.\nFurther developments.\nThe initial standard model was the 707-120 with JT3C turbojet engines. Qantas ordered a shorter-bodied version called the 707-138, which was a -120 with six fuselage frames removed, three in front of the wings, and three aft. The frames in the 707 were set apart, so this resulted in a shortening of to a length of . With the maximum takeoff weight the same as that of the -120 (), the -138 was able to fly the longer routes that Qantas needed. Braniff International Airways ordered the higher-thrust version with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A engines, the 707-220. The final major derivative was the 707-320, which featured an extended-span wing and JT4A engines, while the 707-420 was the same as the -320, but with Conway turbofan engines.\nThough initially fitted with turbojet engines, the dominant engine for the Boeing 707 family was the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D, a turbofan variant of the JT3C with lower fuel consumption and higher thrust. JT3D-engined 707s and 720s were denoted with a \"B\" suffix. While many 707-120Bs and -720Bs were conversions of existing JT3C-powered machines, 707-320Bs were available only as newly built aircraft, as they had a stronger structure to support a maximum takeoff weight increased by , along with modifications to the wing. The 707-320B series enabled nonstop westbound flights from Europe to the West Coast of the United States and from the US to Japan.\nThe final 707 variant was the 707-320C, (C for \"Convertible\"), which had a large fuselage door for cargo. It had a revised wing with three-sectioned leading-edge flaps, improving takeoff and landing performance and allowing the ventral fin to be removed (although the taller fin was retained). The 707-320Bs built after 1963 used the same wing as the -320C and were known as 707-320B Advanced aircraft.\nIn total, 1,010 707s were built for civilian use between 1958 and 1978, though many of these found their way to military service. The 707 production line remained open for purpose-built military variants until 1991, with the last new-build 707 airframes built as E-3 and E-6 aircraft.\nTraces of the 707 are still found in the 737, which uses a modified version of the 707's fuselage, as well as the same external nose and cockpit configurations as those of the 707. These were also used on the previous 727, while the 757 also used the 707 fuselage cross-section.\nDesign.\nWings.\nThe 707's wings are swept back at 35\u00b0, and like all swept-wing aircraft, display an undesirable \"Dutch roll\" flying characteristic that manifests itself as an alternating combined yawing and rolling motion. Boeing already had considerable experience with this on the B-47 and B-52, and had developed the yaw damper system on the B-47 that would be applied to later swept-wing configurations like the 707. However, many pilots new to the 707 had no experience with this instability as they were mostly accustomed to flying straight-wing propeller-driven aircraft such as the Douglas DC-7 and Lockheed Constellation.\nOn one customer-acceptance flight, where the yaw damper was turned off to familiarize the new pilots with flying techniques, a trainee pilot's actions violently exacerbated the Dutch roll motion and caused three of the four engines to be torn from the wings. The plane, a brand new 707-227, \"N7071\", destined for Braniff, crash-landed on a river bed north of Seattle at Arlington, Washington, killing four of the eight occupants.\nIn his autobiography, test pilot Tex Johnston describes a Dutch roll incident he experienced as a passenger on an early commercial 707 flight. As the aircraft's movements did not cease and most of the passengers became ill, he suspected a misrigging of the directional autopilot (yaw damper). He went to the cockpit and found the crew unable to understand and resolve the situation. He introduced himself and relieved the ashen-faced captain who immediately left the cockpit feeling ill. Johnston disconnected the faulty autopilot and manually stabilized the plane \"with two slight control movements\".\nJohnston recommended Boeing increase the height of the tail fin, add a boosted rudder as well as add a ventral fin. These modifications were aimed at mitigating Dutch roll by providing more directional stability in yaw.\nEngines.\nThe initial 707-120 was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engines.\nThe JT3D-3B engines are readily identifiable by the large gray secondary-air inlet doors in the nose cowl. These doors are fully open (sucked in at the rear) during takeoff to provide additional air. The doors automatically close with increasing airspeed.\nThe 707 was the first commercial jet aircraft to be fitted with clamshell-type thrust reversers.\nTurbocompressors.\nThe 707 uses engine-driven turbocompressors to supply compressed air for cabin pressurization. On many commercial 707s, the outer port (number 1) engine mount is distinctly different from the other three, as this engine is not fitted with a turbocompressor. Later-model 707s typically had this configuration, although American Airlines had turbocompressors on engines 2 and 3 only. Early 707 models often had turbocompressor fairings on all four engines, but with only two or three compressors installed.\nUpgraded engines.\nPratt &amp; Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS) and Omega Air, selected the JT8D-219 low-bypass turbofan as a replacement powerplant for Boeing 707-based aircraft, calling their modified configuration a 707RE. Northrop Grumman selected the -219 to re-engine the US Air Force's fleet of 19 E-8 Joint STARS aircraft, which would allow the J-STARS more time on station due to the engine's greater fuel efficiency. NATO also planned to re-engine their fleet of E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The -219 is publicized as being half the cost of the competing powerplant, the CFM International CFM56, and is 40\u00a0dB quieter than the original JT3D engines.\nOperational history.\nThe first commercial orders for the 707 came on October 13, 1955, when leading global carrier Pan Am committed to 20 Boeing 707s, and 25 Douglas DC-8s, dramatically increasing their passenger capacity (in available revenue passenger seat-miles per hour/per day) over its existing fleet of propeller aircraft. The competition between the 707 and DC-8 was fierce. Pan Am ordered these planes when and as they did so that they would be the operators of the \"first-off\" production line for each aircraft type. Once the initial batch of the aircraft had been delivered to them and put into operation, Pan Am would have the distinction of being not only the \"Launch Customer\" for both transcontinental American jets, but the exclusive operator of American intercontinental jet transports for at least a year.\nThe only rival in intercontinental jet aircraft production at the time was the British de Havilland Comet. However, the Comet series had been the subject of fatal accidents (due to design flaws) early in its introduction and withdrawn from service; virtually redesigned from scratch, it was still smaller and slower than the 707 when reintroduced as version -4. In addition, airlines and their passengers at the time preferred the more established Douglas Aircraft as a maker of passenger aircraft, and several major carriers committed only to the Douglas DC-8, delayed by Douglas' decision to wait for the larger and more fuel efficient (Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A) turbojet to design a larger and longer range aircraft around. Anticipating this advantage, Boeing made a late and costly decision to redesign and enlarge the initial 707's wing to help increase range and payload, giving birth to the 707-320.\nPan Am inaugurated 707 service with a christening at National Airport on October 17, 1958, attended by President Eisenhower, followed by a transatlantic flight for VIPs (personal guests of founder Juan Trippe) from Baltimore's Friendship International Airport to Paris. The aircraft's first commercial flight was from Idlewild Airport, New York, to Le Bourget, Paris, on October 26, 1958, with a fuel stop in Gander, Newfoundland. In December, National Airlines operated the first US domestic jet airline flights between New York/Idlewild and Miami, using 707s leased from Pan Am.\nIn February 1956, rival global giant Trans World Airlines' then-President Howard Hughes ordered eight new Boeing 707-120, dubbing the new jet service \"StarStream\", launching its first jet service, between New York-Idlewild International Airport and San Francisco International Airport, on January 25, 1959.&lt;ref name=\"northeastnews/twa-star-stream\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"airlineratings/twa-starstream-707\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAmerican Airlines was the first domestic airline to fly its own jets, on January 25, 1959. TWA started domestic 707-131 flights in March and Continental Airlines started 707-124 flights in June; airlines that had ordered only the DC-8, such as United, Delta, and Eastern, were left without jets until September and lost market share on transcontinental flights. Qantas was the first non-US airline to use the 707s, starting in 1959.\nThe 707 quickly became the most popular jetliner of its time. Its success led to rapid developments in airport terminals, runways, airline catering, baggage handling, reservations systems, and other air transport infrastructure. The advent of the 707 also led to the upgrading of air traffic control systems to prevent interference with military jet operations.\nAs the 1960s drew to a close, the exponential growth in air travel led to the 707 being a victim of its own success. The 707 had become too small to handle the increased numbers of passengers on the routes for which it had been designed. Stretching the fuselage again was not a viable option because the installation of larger, more powerful engines would need a larger undercarriage, which was not feasible given the design's limited ground clearance at takeoff. Rather than stretch the fuselage, which would have also required pilot retraining, Boeing's answer to the problem was the first wide-body airliner\u2014the Boeing 747. The 707's first-generation engine technology was also rapidly becoming obsolete in the areas of noise and fuel economy, especially after the 1973 oil crisis. \nOperations of the 707 were threatened by the enactment of international noise regulations in 1985. Shannon Engineering of Seattle developed a hush kit with funding from Tracor, Inc, of Austin, Texas. By the late 1980s, 172 Boeing 707s had been equipped with the Quiet 707 package. Boeing acknowledged that more 707s were in service than before the hush kit was available.\nTrans World Airlines flew the last scheduled 707 flight for passengers by a US carrier on October 30, 1983, although 707s remained in scheduled service by airlines from other nations for much longer. Middle East Airlines of Lebanon flew 707s and 720s in front-line passenger service until the end of the 1990s. Since LADE of Argentina removed its 707-320Bs from regular service in 2007, Saha Airlines of Iran was the last commercial operator of the Boeing 707. After suspending its scheduled passenger service in April 2013, Saha continued to operate a small fleet of 707s on behalf of the Iranian Air Force.\nAs of 2019, only a handful of 707s remain in operation, acting as military aircraft for aerial refueling, transport, and AWACS missions.\nVariants.\nAlthough certified as Series 100s, 200s, 300s, etc., the different 707 variants are more commonly known as Series 120s, 220s, 320s, and so on, where the \"20\" part of the designation is Boeing's \"customer number\" for its development aircraft.\n707-020.\nAnnounced in July 1957 as a derivative for shorter flights from shorter runways, the 707-020 first flew on November 23, 1959. Its type certificate was issued on June 30, 1960, and it entered service with United Airlines on July 5, 1960. As a derivative, the 720 had low development costs, allowing profitability despite few sales.\nCompared to the 707-120, it has a length reduced by 9 feet (2.7 m), a modified wing and a lightened airframe for a lower maximum takeoff weight. Powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojets, the initial 720 could cover a range with 131 passengers in two classes.\nPowered by JT3D turbofans, the 720B first flew on October 6, 1960, and entered service in March 1961. It could seat 156 passengers in one class over a range. A total of 154 Boeing 720s and 720Bs were built until 1967. Some 720s were later converted to the 720B specification. The 720 was succeeded by the Boeing 727 trijet.\n707-120.\nThe 707-120 was the first production 707 variant, with a longer, wider fuselage, and greater wingspan than the Dash 80. The cabin had a full set of rectangular windows and could seat up to 189 passengers. It was designed for transcontinental routes, and often required a refueling stop when flying across the North Atlantic. It had four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C-6 turbojets, civilian versions of the military J57, initially producing with water injection. Maximum takeoff weight was and first flight was on December 20, 1957. Major orders were the launch order for 20 707-121 aircraft by Pan Am and an American Airlines order for 30 707-123 aircraft. The first revenue flight was on October 26, 1958; 56 were built, plus seven short-bodied -138s; the last -120 was delivered to Western in May 1960.\n707-138.\nThe 707-138 featured a -120 fuselage, from which (three frames) were removed both ahead of and behind the wing, increasing range. The maximum takeoff weight remained the same as the standard version, at . The variant was produced for Qantas and included their customer number, 38, in its designation. To allow for full-load takeoffs at the midflight refueling stop in Fiji, the wing's leading-edge slats were modified for increased lift, and the allowable temperature range for use of full takeoff power was increased by 10\u00a0\u00b0F (5.5\u00a0\u00b0C). Seven -138s were delivered to Qantas between June and September 1959, and they first carried passengers in July of that year.\n707-120B.\nThe 707-120B had Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-1 turbofan engines, which were quieter, more powerful, and more fuel-efficient, rated at , with the later JT3D-3 version giving . (This thrust did not require water injection, eliminating both the system and 5000\u20136000\u00a0lb of water.) The -120B had the wing modifications introduced on the 720 and a longer tailplane; a total of 72 were built, 31 for American and 41 for TWA, plus six short-bodied -138Bs for Qantas. American had its 23 surviving -123s converted to -123Bs, but TWA did not convert its 15 -131s. The only other conversions were Pan Am's five surviving -121s and one surviving -139, the three aircraft delivered to the USAF as -153s and the seven short-bodied Qantas -138s (making 13 total 707s delivered to Qantas between 1959 and 1964). The first flight of the -120B was on June 22, 1960, and American carried the first passengers in March 1961; the last delivery was to American in April 1969. Maximum weight was for both the long- and short-bodied versions.\n707-220.\nThe 707-220 was designed for hot and high operations with more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A-3 turbojets. Five of these were produced, but only four were ultimately delivered, with one being lost during a test flight. All were for Braniff International Airways and carried the model number 707-227; the first entered service in December 1959. This version was made obsolete by the arrival of the turbofan-powered 707-120B.\n707-320 Intercontinental.\nThe 707-320 Intercontinental is a stretched version of the turbojet-powered 707-120, initially powered by JT4A-3 or JT4A-5 turbojets producing each (most eventually got JT4A-11s). The interior allowed up to 189 passengers, the same as the -120 and -220 series, but improved two-class capacity due to an 80-in fuselage stretch ahead of the wing (from to ), with extensions to the fin and horizontal stabilizer extending the aircraft's length further. The longer wing carried more fuel, increasing range by and allowing the aircraft to operate as true transoceanic aircraft. The wing modifications included outboard and inboard inserts, as well as a kink in the trailing edge to add area inboard. Takeoff weight was increased to initially and to with the higher-rated JT4As and center section tanks. Its first flight was on January 11, 1958; 69 turbojet 707-320s were delivered through January 1963, the first passengers being carried (by Pan Am) in August 1959.\n707-420.\nThe 707-420 was identical to the -320, but fitted with Rolls-Royce Conway 508 (RCo.12) turbofans (or by-pass turbojets as Rolls-Royce called them) of thrust each. The first announced customer was Lufthansa. BOAC's controversial order was announced six months later, but the British carrier got the first service-ready aircraft off the production line. The British Air Registration Board refused to give the aircraft a certificate of airworthiness, citing insufficient yaw control, excessive rudder forces, and the ability to over-rotate on takeoff, stalling the wing on the ground (a fault of the de Havilland Comet 1). Boeing responded by adding to the vertical stabilizer, applying full instead of partial rudder boost, and fitting an underfin to prevent over-rotation. These modifications except to the fin under the tail became standard on all 707 variants and were retrofitted to all earlier 707s. The 37 -420s were delivered to BOAC, Lufthansa, Air-India, El Al, and Varig through November 1963; Lufthansa was the first to carry passengers, in March 1960.\n707-320B.\nThe 707-320B had the application of the JT3D turbofan to the Intercontinental, but with aerodynamic refinements. The wing was modified from the -320 by adding a second inboard kink, a dog-toothed leading edge, and curved low-drag wingtips instead of the earlier blunt ones. These wingtips increased overall wingspan by 3.0\u00a0ft (0.9 m). Takeoff gross weight was increased to . The 175 707-320B aircraft were all new-build; no original -320 models were converted to fan engines in civilian use. First service was June 1962, with Pan Am.\nThe 707-320B Advanced is an improved version of the -320B, adding the three-section leading-edge flaps already seen on the -320C. These reduced takeoff and landing speeds and altered the lift distribution of the wing, allowing the ventral fin found on earlier 707s to be removed. From 1965, -320Bs had the uprated -320C undercarriage allowing the same MTOW. These were often identified as 707-320BA-H.\n707-320C.\nThe 707-320C has a convertible passenger\u2013freight configuration, which became the most widely produced variant of the 707. The 707-320C added a strengthened floor and a new cargo door to the -320B model. The wing was fitted with three-section leading-edge flaps which allowed the removal of the underfin. A total of 335 of this variant were built, including some with JT3D-7 engines ( takeoff thrust) and a takeoff weight of . Most -320Cs were delivered as passenger aircraft with airlines hoping the cargo door would increase second-hand values. The addition of two new emergency exits, one on each side aft of the wing, raised the maximum passenger limit to 219. Only a few aircraft were delivered as pure freighters. One of the final orders was by the Iranian Government for 14 707-3J9C aircraft capable of VIP transportation, communication, and in-flight refueling tasks.\n707-700.\nThe 707-700 was a test aircraft used to study the feasibility of using CFM International CFM56 engines on a 707 airframe and possibly retrofitting existing aircraft with the engine. After testing in 1979, \"N707QT\", the last commercial 707 airframe, was restored to 707-320C configuration and delivered to the Moroccan Air Force as a tanker aircraft via a \"civilian\" order. Boeing abandoned the retrofit program, since they felt it would be a threat to the 757 and 767 programs. The information gathered from testing led to the eventual retrofitting of CFM56 engines to the USAF C-135/KC-135R models, and some military versions of the 707 also used the CFM56. The Douglas DC-8 \"Super 70\" series with CFM56 engines was developed and extended the DC-8's life in a stricter noise regulatory environment. As a result, significantly more DC-8s remained in service into the 21st century than 707s.\nUndeveloped variants.\nThe 707-620 was a proposed domestic range-stretched variant of the 707-320B. The 707-620 was to carry around 200 passengers while retaining several aspects of the 707-320B. It would have been delivered around 1968 and would have also been Boeing's answer to the stretched Douglas DC-8 Series 60. Had the 707-620 been built, it would have cost around US$8,000,000. However, engineers discovered that a longer fuselage and wing meant a painstaking redesign of the wing and landing-gear structures. Rather than spend money on upgrading the 707, engineer Joe Sutter stated the company \"decided spending money on the 707 wasn't worth it\". The project was cancelled in 1966 in favor of the newer Boeing 747.\nThe 707-820 was a proposed intercontinental stretched variant of the 707-320B. This variant was to be powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-15 turbofan engines, and it would have had a nearly extension in wingspan, to . Two variations were proposed, the 707-820(505) model and the 707-820(506) model. The 505 model would have had a fuselage longer than the 707-320B, for a total length of . This model would have carried 209 passengers in mixed-class configuration and 260 passengers in all-economy configuration. The 506 model would have had a fuselage longer than the 707-320B, to in length. This second model would have carried 225 passengers in mixed-class configuration and 279 passengers in all-economy configuration. Like the 707-620, the 707-820 was also set to compete with the stretched DC-8-60 Super Series models. The design was being pitched to American, TWA, BOAC, and Pan Am at the time of its proposal in early 1965. The 707-820 would have cost US$10,000,000. Like the 707-620, the 707-820 would have required a massive structural redesign to the wing and gear structures. The 707-820 was also cancelled in 1966 in favor of the 747.\nMilitary versions.\nThe militaries of the US and other countries have used the civilian 707 aircraft in a variety of roles, and under different designations. (The 707 and US Air Force's KC-135 were developed in parallel from the Boeing 367\u201380 prototype.)\nThe Boeing E-3 Sentry is a US military airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft based on the Boeing 707 that provides all-weather surveillance, command, control, and communications.\nThe Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS is an aircraft modified from the Boeing 707-300 series commercial airliner. The E-8 carries specialized radar, communications, operations and control subsystems. The most prominent external feature is the 40\u00a0ft (12 m) canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage that houses the 24\u00a0ft (7.3 m) APY-7 active electronically scanned array side looking airborne radar antenna.\nThe VC-137 variant of the Stratoliner was a special-purpose design meant to serve as Air Force One, the secure transport for the President of the United States. These models were in operational use from 1962 to 1990. The first presidential jet aircraft, a VC-137B designated SAM 970, is on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. Two VC-137C aircraft are on display with SAM 26000 at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio and SAM 27000 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\nThe Canadian Forces also operated the Boeing 707 with the designation CC-137 Husky (707-347C) from 1971 to 1997.\nBoeing 717 was the company designation for the C-135 Stratolifter and KC-135 Stratotanker derivatives of the 367-80. (The 717 designation was later reused in renaming the McDonnell Douglas MD-95 to Boeing 717 after the company merged with Boeing.)\nComparison of variants.\nBelow is a list of major differences between the 707 variants.&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOperators.\nBoeing's customer codes used to identify specific options and livery specified by customers was started with the 707, and has been maintained through all Boeing's models. In essence the same system as used on the earlier Boeing 377, the code consisted of two digits affixed to the model number to identify the specific aircraft version. For example, Pan Am was assigned code \"21\". Thus, a 707-320B sold to Pan Am had the model number 707-321B. The number remained constant as further aircraft were purchased; thus, when Pan Am purchased the 747-100, it had the model number 747-121.\nIn the 1980s, the USAF acquired around 250 used 707s to provide replacement turbofan engines for the KC-135E Stratotanker program.\nThe 707 is no longer operated by commercial airlines. American actor John Travolta owned an ex-Qantas 707-138B, with the registration \"N707JT.\" In May 2017, he donated the plane to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society near Wollongong, Australia. The plane is planned to be flown to Shellharbour Airport, where HARS is based, once repairs to ensure safe flying condition have been completed. The repairs were delayed several times since the 2017 announcement.\nAccidents and incidents.\nAs of January 2019, the 707 has been in 261 aviation occurrences and 174 hull-loss accidents with a total of 3,039 fatalities. The deadliest incident involving the 707 was the Agadir air disaster which took place on August 3, 1975, with 188 fatalities.\nOn January 14, 2019, EP-CPP, a Saha Airlines cargo flight crashed, killing 15 people and seriously injuring one more person. It was the last civil 707 in operation.\nSpecifications (Boeing 707-320C with JT3D-7).\n\"Data from\" General characteristics* Crew: 3* Capacity: 194 passengers (all passenger configuration) or 13 cargo pallets (all cargo configuration)\nPerformance* Maximum speed: Mach 0.887*Takeoff distance: \nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nPrint.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOnline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It marked the film debut of Steven Seagal, who also produced the film and co-authored the story alongside Davis, and stars Seagal alongside Pam Grier, Sharon Stone, Ron Dean and Henry Silva. Seagal plays Nico Toscani, an ex-CIA agent, an Aikido specialist and a Chicago policeman who discovers a conspiracy upon investigating a mysterious shipment of military explosives seized from a narcotics dealer.\nThe film originated after a successful screen test financed by Michael Ovitz, leading to Seagal being offered a contract by Warner Bros. It was set and filmed on location in Chicago, Davis\u2019 hometown. The film premiered in the United States on April 8, 1988, becoming a commercial success despite mixed reviews, and launching Seagal's acting career. \"Above the Law\" is regarded as the first American film to feature Aikido in fight sequences.\nPlot.\nNicolo \u201cNico\u201d Toscani is an expert martial artist, who is recruited by the CIA during the Vietnam War. While serving in covert operations on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border, he became disgusted with agent Kurt Zagon, who tortures prisoners. A stand-off occurred when Toscani tries to stop him, and he leaves the CIA.\nYears later, Toscani is now married and a detective in the Chicago Police Department\u2019s vice squad. Toscani and his new partner Delores \"Jacks\" Jackson are investigating a drug ring, and after busting two of the dealers, including Salvadorian kingpin Tony Salvano, Toscani finds C-4 explosives. Shortly afterward, the men that Toscani and Jackson arrested are released at the request of federal officials, and Toscani is ordered to stand down. Later, the priest of Toscani's parish is killed in an explosion during Mass. Toscani's old CIA handler Nelson Fox contacts him and tells him to move his family to a safer location, saying that he is in danger. Under pressure from the feds, Toscani is asked to turn in his badge. He eventually discovers that the dealers he busted are linked to Kurt Zagon, who is still with the CIA, and who is being accused of human rights violations by a Central American priest who was being sheltered by Toscani's priest. While Zagon is torturing the priest, Toscani bursts in and a gun battle ensues. Detectives Jackson and Lukich are wounded during the shootout, and Toscani has to flee.\nU.S. Senator Ernest Harrison is investigating Zagon's group to reveal their ties to drug trafficking. When Toscani finds out that Zagon killed the priest and is planning to kill Harrison, he goes after him. Fox confronts Toscani while the latter is doing surveillance on a rooftop, but they are later interrupted by Zagon's men. Fox is killed and Toscani is captured. He is held in the kitchen of a hotel during a Harrison campaign rally. Before Zagon can kill Harrison, Toscani breaks free and kills Zagon and all of his remaining men. Afterwards, Toscani meets Harrison, who has been informed of everything. Harrison promises justice and Toscani says he is now willing to testify about his experiences with Zagon and covert operations in the CIA.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nIt has been reported that Steven Seagal was asked to make the film by his former aikido pupil, agent Michael Ovitz, who believed that he could make anyone a movie star. Seagal had previously worked as a film stunt performer and fight choreographer, as well as a celebrity bodyguard, but \"Above the Law\" was his acting debut. In addition to starring in the film, Seagal functioned as a producer, a co-screenwriter, and fight choreographer.\nSeagal has claimed that portions of the film are autobiographical, and that he was employed by the CIA during the 1970s, initially as a martial arts instructor. His wife at the time, Miyako Fujitani, has denied these claims, and there is no evidence Seagal has ever worked with the Central Intelligence Agency.\nFilming.\nShooting took place in Chicago, Illinois, over 60 days from April 27 to June 26, 1987. The opening Vietnam War sequence was shot on a soundstage at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank.\nDuring the filming of the final fight scene, Henry Silva accidentally broke Seagal's nose.\nJohn C. Reilly made his film debut, appearing (uncredited) as one of the thugs in the bar brawl.\nRelease.\nHome media.\nWarner Home Video released the Region 1 DVD in the United States on January 28, 1998. The Region 2 DVD was released in the United Kingdom on April 26, 1999. The Region-free Blu-ray Disc was released on April 7, 2009.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film grossed $18,869,631 in the U.S.\nCritical response.\n\"Above the Law\" received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 50%, based on reviews from 20 critics, with an average rating of 5.2/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" stated \"It contains 50 percent more plot than it needs, but that allows it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers.\" In a negative review, Hal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\" criticized it as \"woefully short on originality.\" In another negative review, film historian Leonard Maltin described the picture as a \"...slick but stupid action-fest; Seagal's thesping makes Chuck Norris seem like Laurence Olivier.\"\nPotential sequel.\nSeagal tweeted plans for \"Above the Law 2\" on August 1, 2016, but as of 2025 the project remains unproduced.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67412", "revid": "1302311571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67412", "title": "Jonathan Coe", "text": "English novelist\nJonathan Coe (; born 19 August 1961) is an English novelist and writer. His work has an underlying preoccupation with political issues, although this serious engagement is often expressed comically in the form of satire. For example, \"What a Carve Up!\" (1994) reworks the plot of an old 1960s spoof horror film of the same name. It is set within the \"carve up\" of the UK's resources that was carried out by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative governments of the 1980s.\nEarly life.\nCoe was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, on 19 August 1961 to Roger and Janet (n\u00e9e Kay) Coe. He studied at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He taught at the University of Warwick, where he completed an MA and PhD in English Literature.\nCareer.\nCoe has long been interested in both music and literature. In the mid-1980s he played with a band (The Peer Group) and tried to get a recording of his music. He also wrote songs and played keyboards for a short-lived feminist cabaret group, Wanda and the Willy Warmers.\nHe published his first novel, \"The Accidental Woman\", in 1987. In 1994 his fourth novel \"What a Carve Up!\" won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, and the Prix du Meilleur Livre \u00c9tranger in France. It was followed by \"The House of Sleep\", which won the Writers' Guild of Great Britain Best Novel award and, in France, the Prix M\u00e9dicis. As of 2022, Coe has published fourteen novels.\nBesides novels, Coe has written a biography of the experimental British novelist B. S. Johnson, \"Like a Fiery Elephant\", which D. J. Taylor described in \"Literary Review\" as \"a deeply unconventional biography,\" won the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2005. Also in 2005 Penguin published his \"collected shorter prose\", a volume consisting of only 55 pages, under the title \"9th &amp; 13th\". The same collection was published in France in 2012 under the title \"D\u00e9saccords imparfaits\".\nHe has written a short children's adaptation of \"Gulliver's Travels\" by Jonathan Swift, and a children's story called \"The Broken Mirror\". Both titles are published in Italy only, as \"La storia di Gulliver\" (2011) and \"Lo specchio dei desideri\" (2012).\nA handwritten manuscript page from \"The Rotters' Club\" was displayed as part of the \"Writing Britain: Wastelands to Wonderlands\" exhibition that ran at the British Library during 2012.\nCoe was a judge for the Booker Prize in 1996 and has been a jury member at the Venice Film Festival (in 1999, under the chairmanship of Emir Kusturica) and the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2007.\nIn 2012 Coe was invited by Javier Mar\u00edas to become a duke of the kingdom of Redonda. He chose as his title \"Duke of Prunes\", after a favourite piece of music by Frank Zappa.\nCoe read an excerpt of \"The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim\" to crowds at the Latitude Festival in July 2009. The central character was to be \"a product of the social media boom\", and \"the sort of person with hundreds of Facebook friends but no one to talk to when his marriage breaks up.\"\nCoe's 2019 book \"Middle England\" won the European Book Prize and also won the Costa Book Award in the Novel category.\nFilm and TV adaptations.\nBoth \"What a Carve Up!\" (1994) and \"The Rotters' Club\" (2001) have been adapted as drama serials for BBC Radio 4. \"What a Carve Up!\" was adapted by David Nobbs. \"The Rotters' Club\" was adapted for television by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and broadcast on BBC Two in January\u2013February 2005. \"The Dwarves of Death\" (1990) was filmed as \"Five Seconds to Spare\" in 1999, for which Coe himself co-wrote the screenplay.\n\"The Very Private Life of Mister Sim\", a French film based on \"The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim\", directed by Michel Leclerc and produced by Delante Cinema and Kare Productions, was released on 16 December 2015.\nMusical collaborations.\nMusic is a constant thread in Coe's work. He played music for years and tried to find a record label as a performer before becoming a published novelist. He had to wait until 2001 to make his first appearance on a record with \"9th &amp; 13th\" (Tricatel, 2001), a collection of readings of his work, set to music by jazz pianist/double bass player Danny Manners and indiepop artist Louis Philippe.\nCoe is a lifelong fan of Canterbury progressive rock. His novel \"The Rotters' Club\" is named after an album by Hatfield and the North. He has contributed to the liner notes for that band's archival release \"Hatwise Choice\". He once said: \"I'd love to find a pianist to collaborate with \u2013 maybe Alex Maguire, who is now playing with the reformed line-up of Hatfield and the North\". In fact, this collaboration did come to fruition, at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in 2009, where Maguire performed a suite of piano pieces to accompany readings from the novel \"The Rain Before It Falls\". Coe has also performed live with flautist Theo Travis.\nCoe wrote the sleevenotes \"Reflections on The High Llamas\" for the 2003 compilation of The High Llamas \"Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals\". He has also written lyrics for songs on the albums \"My Favourite Part of You\" and \"The Wonder of It All\" by Louis Philippe, and \"Earth to Ether\" by Theo Travis, for which the vocalist was Richard Sinclair.\nIn 2008 Coe wrote \"Say Hi to the Rivers and the Mountains\", a 60-minute piece of what he calls \"spoken musical theatre\", with dialogue to be delivered continuously by three actors over a sequence of songs and instrumentals by The High Llamas. The work was premiered at the Analog Festival in Dublin that summer, and subsequently performed at various venues in the UK and Spain. The most recent performance was as part of the \"Notes and Letters\" Festival at Kings Place in London in September 2011, with Henry Goodman in the leading role of Bobby. The piece is inspired by the proposed demolition of Robin Hood Gardens, an East London council estate designed by Alison and Peter Smithson.\nIn March 2011, at the City Winery in New York, Coe took the keyboard solos on a live version of \"Nigel Blows A Tune\" from the Caravan album \"In the Land of Grey and Pink\", along with the musician/novelist Wesley Stace and his band The English UK.\nPersonal life.\nCoe married Janine McKeown in 1989, and they have two daughters born in 1997 and 2000.\nIn 2009, Coe took part in Oxfam's first annual book festival, \"Bookfest\". Along with William Sutcliffe, Coe volunteered for the Oxfam Bloomsbury Bookshop in London on Thursday 9 July. Coe and Sutcliffe were each asked to choose a theme, and to find books from the stockroom to set up in the shop's window. Coe chose satire as the theme for his display. He chose books by or about Michael Moore, Bill Hicks, Peter Cook and Steve Bell. He also unearthed a script of Terry Gilliam\u2019s film \"Brazil\".\nCoe donated a story to Oxfam's \"Ox-Tales\" project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Coe's story was published in the \"Earth\" collection.\nHe is a trustee of the charity Cleared Ground Demining, and in spring 2007 visited Guinea-Bissau to write an article about their operations there.\nIn a 2001 newspaper interview, Coe described himself as an atheist.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Little\nMarked for Death is a 1990 American action film directed by Dwight H. Little. The film stars Steven Seagal as John Hatcher, a former DEA troubleshooter who returns to his Illinois hometown to find it taken over by a posse of vicious Jamaican drug dealers led by Screwface. Using a combination of fear and Obeah, a Jamaican syncretic religion of West African and Caribbean origin similar to Haitian vodou and Santer\u00eda, Screwface attempts to control the drug trade in Lincoln Heights.\nPlot.\nDEA Agents John Hatcher and his partner Chico, pursue a drug dealer called Hector on foot, who later it is revealed, has blown John's cover. John and Chico manage to fight their way out of an ambush set up by Hector, but during their escape, Chico is shot and mortally wounded by a woman. In response, Hatcher shoots several rounds through the wall where she is hiding, hitting and killing her. As they flee, Chico dies of his injuries. John retires from the DEA and returns home to Chicago, where he is reunited with his former US Army colleague Max Keller, now a football coach for the local school, who is disturbed by the presence of Jamaican drug dealers, known as Posse. Later at a bar, a gunfight breaks out between the same dealers and local gangsters. John manages to assist in arresting one of the Jamaicans and a responding FBI agent asks him to join the case, but he refuses. At the scene, a detective finds a symbol which an expert named Leslie Davalos reveals to be a religious icon to mark the crimes of a man called Screwface.\nScrewface sends some men to do a drive-by at John's sister's house (where he is staying) and they wound his niece Tracey. John interrogates a gangster he saw in the club shootout called Jimmy Fingers, but he refuses to help and John is forced to kill him. One of Screwface's men, Nesta, who is Jimmy's accomplice, arrives and gives a small clue about Screwface before throwing himself out of a window. Upon returning to his sister's house, John finds the same symbol on a rug, along with a cow tongue and black cross nailed to the door. Leslie informs him that such symbols mark the person for death and John demands that the FBI provide protection for his family.\nDuring a call with his sister, she is attacked again by Screwface's men in an attempt to ritually sacrifice her. John rushes round and arrives just in time to save her, as Screwface flees. Having now realised what he is up against, John enlists Max's help and they trail some members of the Posse to a park and a chase ensues, ending in a high-end store. John and Max kill several gang members but don't learn anything about Screwface. However, Screwface ambushes John that night, trapping his car between two construction vehicles and setting fire to it with a molotov cocktail, with John just managing to escape.\nCharles Marks, a Jamaican detective working with the FBI, reaches out to John and Max and offers his help.

According to Little, Seagal had the option in his contract with Warner to do one film with another studio. Seagal chose to exercise that option and make his third film at 20th Century Fox, where he demanded that they hire Little for \"Marked for Death\". \"I got that job only because Steven insisted,\" said Little. During production, the studio was pushing for more humor in the film, but Little and Seagal had made a pact to resist these attempts. Their template for the film was \"The French Connection\".\nOn the third day of shooting \"Marked for Death\", \"Hard to Kill\" came out in theaters. Dwight Little: \"It opened huge, and it stayed on top for a while. No one, including Steven, thought that was going to be success. But it was. Frankly, just based on his charisma and a couple of good action scenes. I was downtown shooting a scene for \"Marked for Death\" when suddenly I see all these limos and towncars coming to the set. They were all CAA-agents and producers, coming out of the woodwork to see the next big action guy. They all wanted to talk to him.\"\nOf Seagal's martial arts, Little said: \"Steven is the only guy who does what he does in the movies, where you let your opponent's energy go past you. In that respect, he's totally unique. But it's not a forward, high kicking, punching thing. That's why I felt I needed action movie stuff, like car chases, gun fights, explosions and some old fashioned cop stuff. Because if we tried to string together a bunch of Steven's fights, they will quickly start to feel the same.\"\nMusic.\nA soundtrack containing hip hop, reggae, and R&amp;B music was released on September 27, 1990, by Delicious Vinyl.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Marked for Death\" opened at number one at the U.S. box office with an opening weekend gross of $11,790,047, making it Seagal's second straight film to open #1. It remained at #1 for three weekends. It earned a little more than $46 million domestically and $58 million worldwide.\nCritical response.\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 27% of 11 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Both \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" gave it a thumbs up, writing that it was another solid Seagal action film. In a less than favorable response from \"Entertainment Weekly\", they wrote that the film is partially \"undone by murky cinematography\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" was very critical of the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Seagal's second film after \"Above the Law\", he portrays Mason Storm, a detective who falls into a coma after being shot during a home invasion that killed his wife. Reawakening seven years later, Storm embarks on a journey to avenge the death of his wife, and expose the corruption of Senator Vernon Trent, the man who ordered the murder of his family. The film was released by Warner Bros. on February 9, 1990, and grossed $75 million worldwide.\nPlot.\nIn 1983, LAPD internal affairs detective Mason Storm investigates a mob meeting that takes place by a pier. He records a shadowy figure who assures the mob they can rely on his political support. Mason is spotted, but escapes. Unaware that he is monitored by corrupt cops, Mason informs his partner, Becker, and his friend Lt. O'Malley that he has evidence of corruption.\nMason hides the videotape in his house. When he goes upstairs, a hit squad composed of corrupt policemen, including Jack Axel and Max Quentero, break in, murder Mason's wife, and shoot him. Mason's young son, Sonny, escapes out of a window. The corrupt policemen frame Mason, making it look like a murder-suicide. At the same time, assassins kill Mason's partner. Later at the hospital, Mason is first pronounced dead, but is then discovered to be alive, although in a coma. To prevent the assassins from finishing the job, Lieutenant O'Malley tells the medics to keep Mason's status a secret.\nSeven years later, Mason wakes from his coma. Andy Stewart, one of his nurses, makes a phone call, which is intercepted by corrupt police officers. They send Axel to finish the job and kill the nurses to whom Mason might have talked. Mason realizes that he is still in danger, but his muscles have atrophied to where he can barely move. He manages to get to an elevator, and when Andy sees her co-workers killed, she helps Mason escape.\nNeeding time to recuperate, Andy takes Mason to a friend's house, where Mason uses his knowledge of acupuncture, moxibustion and other meditation techniques to recover his strength. While training, Mason hears a commercial for Senator Vernon Trent and recognizes the voice from the pier. Mason contacts O'Malley, who supplies him with weapons and tells him that his son is still alive. O'Malley adopted Sonny and sent him to a private school so that he would be out of danger. He arranges to meet O'Malley and his now-teenage son at a train station later. After O'Malley leaves, Senator Trent's men find the house and attempt to kill Andy and Mason, but they both manage to escape.\nPosing as a real estate agent, Mason recovers the hidden videotape from his old house. O'Malley and Sonny arrive at the train station, but are confronted by some of the Senator's men. Sonny flees with the tape, but O'Malley is killed. When Mason arrives, he sees Sonny running away from Quentero and Nolan. Mason catches up with the men and subdues Nolan by breaking his leg and throwing him in a trash bin. He then beats up Quentero and recognizes him as one of the men who took part in the assault on Mason's home. Mason snaps Quentero's neck, killing him. After a brief reunion with his son, Mason goes after Senator Trent.\nMason sneaks into the Senator's mansion and manages to eliminate his men one by one. Mason fights with Axel in the billiard room and avenges his wife by jamming a broken pool cue into Axel's neck, killing him. Next, Mason leaves a death taunt to Capt. Hulland, another corrupt cop who betrayed Mason to Trent, and stalks Hulland through the house before cornering the corrupt captain near the fireplace. Mason then strangles Hulland with his necktie and breaks his neck, killing him as well. Mason finally confronts Senator Trent and holds him at gunpoint when the police storm the mansion. However, they reveal that they had already seen the film and knew that Mason was set up. Trent is arrested, and Mason is reunited with Andy and his son as the footage from the videotape is played on the news, showing that Trent making a deal with the underworld mob and coming out of the shadows.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Steven Seagal as Detective Mason Storm\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Hard to Kill\" debuted at number 1 at the U.S. box office with an opening weekend gross of $9.2 million, the biggest 3-day February opening at the time.

It is one of the academic and spiritual centers of Conservative Judaism as well as a hub for academic scholarship in Jewish studies. The Jewish Theological Seminary Library is one of the most significant collections of Judaica in the world.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nPossible antecedents: Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau.\nZecharias Frankel (1801\u20131875) was a rabbi and leading figure in mid-19th-century German Jewry. Known for both his traditionalist views and the esteem he held for scientific study of Judaism, Frankel was at first considered a moderate figure within the nascent Reform movement. He severely criticized the 1844 first Reform rabbinic conference of Braunschweig, yet eventually agreed to participate in the next despite warnings from conservative friends such as Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport. He withdrew from the assembly, held in Frankfurt in 1845, making a final break with the Reform camp after coming to regard their positions as excessively radical. In 1854, he became the director of a new rabbinical school, the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. \nBernard Drachman, a key Frankel student and one of the founders of the American JTS, was himself Orthodox, and claimed that the Breslau seminary was completely Orthodox. Others disagree, citing the published viewpoint of Frankel. In his magnum opus \"Darkhei HaMishnah\" (\"Ways of the Mishnah\"), Frankel amassed scholarly support which showed that Jewish law was not static, but rather had always developed in response to changing conditions. He called his approach towards Judaism \"Positive-Historical\", which meant accepting halakha and tradition as normative while remaining open to changing these as they have always changed over time.\nSeminary's founding: Morais era (1886\u20131897).\nThe Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) was founded in 1886 through the efforts of two distinguished rabbis, Sabato Morais and Henry Pereira Mendes, along with a group of prominent lay leaders from Sephardic congregations in Philadelphia and New York. Its mission was to preserve the knowledge and practice of historical Judaism. In 1887, JTS held its first class of ten students in the vestry of the Spanish-Portuguese Synagogue, New York City's oldest congregation. \nAbout this time in North America, the Reform movement was growing at a rapid pace, alarming more traditional (halakhic) Jews. Sabato Morais, rabbi of Philadelphia's Congregation Mikveh Israel championed the reaction to American Reform. At one time, Morais had been a voice for moderation and bridge-building among the Reformers. He opposed the more radical changes but was open to moderate changes that would not significantly depart from tradition. After the Reform movement published the Pittsburgh Platform in late 1885, Morais recognized the futility of his efforts and began to work with like-minded rabbis to strengthen the Orthodox institutions.\nOne of the tools his group used was creating a new rabbinical school in New York City. The \"Jewish Theological Seminary Association\" was founded with Morais as its President in 1886 as an Orthodox institution to combat the hegemony of the Reform movement. The school was hosted by Henry Pereira Mendes' Congregation Shearith Israel, a sister synagogue to Mikveh Israel.\nMorais and Mendes were soon joined by Alexander Kohut and Bernard Drachman, both of whom had received semikhah, rabbinic ordination, at Rabbi Frankel's Breslau seminary. They shaped the curriculum and philosophy of the new school after Rabbi Frankel's seminary. The first graduate to be ordained, in 1894, was Joseph Hertz, who would go on to become the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth.\nMorais was president of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America until he died in 1897.\nSchechter era (1902\u20131915).\nAfter Morais's death, Mendes led the school, but the association's financial position became precarious, and Mendes lacked the resources to turn it around. In October 1901, a new organization was projected entitled the \"Jewish Theological Seminary of America\", with which the association was invited to incorporate. This arrangement was carried into effect April 14, 1902. The new organization was endowed with a fund of over $500,000 and was presented with a suitable building on University Heights, Bronx by Jacob H. Schiff. It obtained a charter from the state of New York (approved Feb. 20, 1902), \"for the perpetuation of the tenets of the Jewish religion, the cultivation of Hebrew literature, the pursuit of Biblical and archeological research, the advancement of Jewish scholarship, the establishment of a library, and the education and training of Jewish rabbis and teachers. It is empowered to grant and confer the degrees of Rabbi, \u1e24azan, Master and Doctor of Hebrew Literature, and Doctor of Divinity, and also to award certificates of proficiency to persons qualified to teach in Hebrew schools.\" The reorganized seminary was opened on Sept. 15, 1902, in the old building of the Theological Seminary Association at 736 Lexington Avenue. A search was executed for a new president.\nSolomon Schechter was recruited from Great Britain. His religious approach seemed compatible with JTS's, and he assumed the presidency, as well as serving as Professor of Jewish theology. In a series of papers, he articulated an ideology for the nascent movement of Conservative Judaism. Many of the Orthodox rabbis associated with JTS vehemently disagreed with him, and left the institution. About 100 days after Schechter's appointment, the Union of Orthodox Rabbis formed, principally in protest, and declared that they would not accept any new ordinations from JTS, though previous recipients were still welcome. The more moderate Orthodox Union (OU), however, maintained some ties to JTS, and some of its rabbis, including Drachman, continued to teach there.\nIn 1913, Schechter directed the creation of the United Synagogue of America, as a formal group for member synagogues who subscribed to his philosophy. The group has been strongly aligned with JTS from its inception to the present day.\nAlong with Schechter and Bernard Drachman, professors at the seminary at the time included: Louis Ginzberg, professor of Talmud; Alexander Marx, professor of history and rabbinic literature and librarian; Israel Friedl\u00e4nder, professor of Bible; Joseph Mayor Asher, professor of homiletics; and Joshua A. Joffe, instructor in Talmud. In 1905, Israel Davidson joined the faculty, teaching Hebrew and Rabbinics. According to David Ellenson and Lee Bycel, \"each of these men was a distinguished scholar, and the academic reputation of the Seminary soared with the addition of these men to the faculty. ... Schechter was determined to carve out the highest academic reputation for the Seminary.\"\nThe rabbinical school had very high academic standards. The curriculum focused mainly on Talmud, legal codes, and classical rabbinic literature, but aside from a little time for a homiletics class, very little time was spent on practical training for serving in a rabbinical position.\nAs of 1904, there were 37 students in the theological department, and 120 students took a set of courses designed for teachers. This set of courses later evolved into the Teachers Institute.\nMordechai Kaplan joined the faculty during this period, becoming professor of homiletics following Joseph Mayor Asher's death. Kaplan became the first principal of the Teachers Institute (TI), which opened in 1909. A majority of TI students were women, partly because teaching was perceived as a women's profession and partly because the Teachers Institute was one of the few institutions where women could pursue advanced education in Jewish studies. The Teachers Institute offered both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The undergraduate division is now the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies, and the graduate division is the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education.\nAdler era (1915\u20131940).\nIn 1915, Schechter was succeeded by Cyrus Adler, the President of Dropsie College. A member of the board with impressive academic qualifications, he was initially seen as an interim replacement for Schechter. Adler went on to serve as President until 1940.\nDuring the 1920s, Adler explored the possibility of a merger with Yeshiva University, but the Orthodox leaders of Yeshiva University viewed JTS as insufficiently Orthodox.\nNew faculty appointed during the early part of Adler's tenure included the Biblical scholar Jacob Hoschander. In the 1920s, Boaz Cohen and Louis Finkelstein, both of whom were ordained at JTS and completed their doctoral degrees at Columbia University, joined the Talmud faculty. In the 1930s, Adler appointed H.L. Ginsberg, Robert Gordis, and Alexander Sperber as professors of Bible. He also gave appointments to Israel Efros, Simon Greenberg, Milton Steinberg, and Ismar Elbogen.\nDuring his tenure, Adler groomed Louis Finkelstein as his chosen successor. In 1931, he appointed Finkelstein to a full professorship. Finkelstein became the Solomon Schechter Professor of Theology. In 1937 Adler appointed Finkelstein as Provost.\nIn 1930 the organization commissioned a new headquarters for 122nd Street and Broadway in a neo-colonial style, with a tower at the corner. The architects were Gehron, Ross and Alley.\nIn 1931, the Seminary College of Jewish Studies was established for students who wanted college-level courses in Jewish studies but who were not preparing for teaching careers. This branch is now part of the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies.\nFinkelstein era (1940\u201372).\nLouis Finkelstein became chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1940. During his chancellorship, JTS made significant efforts to engage the American public. One of its signature programs was a radio and television show called \"The Eternal Light\". The show aired on Sunday afternoons, featuring well-known Jewish personalities like Chaim Potok and Elie Wiesel. Broadcasts did not involve preaching or prayer, but drew on history, literature and social issues to explore Judaism and Jewish holidays in a manner that was accessible to persons of any faith. The show continued to run until 1985.\nDuring the 1940s, the Jewish Theological Seminary established Camp Ramah as a tool for furthering Jewish education. The founders envisioned an informal camp setting where Jewish youth would reconnect with the synagogue and Jewish tradition, and a new cadre of American-born Jewish leadership could be cultivated. The first camp opened in Conover, Wisconsin in 1947. The program was drawn up by Moshe Davis and Sylvia Ettenberg of the JTS Teachers' Institute.\nIn 1945, JTS established a new institution, the Leadership Training Fellowship, designed to educate young people within Conservative synagogues and guide them into Jewish public service.\nIn 1952, the Jewish Theological Seminary opened a new school known as the Cantors Institute. (The school was later renamed the H. L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music.) This was at roughly the same time that the other established American Jewish seminaries, Hebrew Union College and Yeshiva University, opened cantorial schools. Prior to this time, American cantors were often trained in Europe.\nIn 1950, Finkelstein created the Universal Brotherhood program, which \"brought together laymen interested in interpreting the ethical dimensions of Judaism to the wider society.\" JTS expanded its public outreach in the 1950s with Finkelstein's development of JTS's Institute for Religious Studies and the establishment of its Herbert H. Lehman Institute of Ethics.\nDuring the Finkelstein era, the Institute for Religious and Social Studies brought together Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish scholars for theological discussions. (In 1986, the name of the institute was changed to the Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies in Finkelstein's honor.)\nIn 1957, JTS announced plans to build a satellite campus in Jerusalem for JTS rabbinical students studying in Israel. A building was completed in 1962. (The campus eventually evolved into the home of the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies.) In 1962, the seminary also acquired the Schocken Institute for Jewish Research and its library in Jerusalem.\nIn 1968, JTS received a charter from the State of New York to create an Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, which conferred bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. The Institute was designed as a non-sectarian academic institute which would train future college and university professors. Its first students enrolled in 1970. The Institute later evolved into the Graduate School of the Jewish Theological Seminary.\nFaculty during the Finkelstein era.\nWhen Finkelstein took office, prominent faculty members included Louis Ginzberg, Alexander Marx, Mordecai Kaplan, H.L. Ginsberg, Robert Gordis, and Boaz Cohen.\nIn 1940, Finkelstein made his most significant academic appointment, hiring the prominent Talmud scholar Saul Lieberman as Professor of Palestinian Literature and Institutions. In 1948, Lieberman became dean of the Rabbinical School. In 1958, he was named rector of the Seminary.\nIn 1945, Finkelstein hired the theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel, who had been teaching for a brief period at Hebrew Union College. During the course of his chancellorship, Finkelstein also gave academic appointments to other prominent scholars including Moshe Davis (1942), Shalom Spiegel (1943), Yochanan Muffs (1954), Max Kadushin (1960), Gerson Cohen, David Weiss Halivni, Judah Goldin, Chaim Dimitrovsky, and Seymour Siegel.\nFinkelstein appointed Max Arzt to serve as Vice-Chancellor of JTS in 1951, and he appointed Arzt as Israel Goldstein Professor of Practical Theology in 1962.\nThe Jewish Theological Seminary, JTS, is the primary educational and religious center of Conservative Judaism. The single largest physical addition to JTS came in the form of seventeen-foot wrought iron gates. The beautifully constructed gates led to the main entrance through a large vaulted passageway to the entire group of buildings. In a 1930s guidebook, it is written about the Seminary, \"Be sure to notice the main gate to the seminary as you go in. It is hand-wrought iron and the whole design is symbolic.\" These gates were presented on September 26, 1934, by Mrs. Frieda and Mr. Felix M. Warburg in memory of her parents, Jacob H. and Therese Schiff.\nLibrary fire.\nIn April 1966 JTS's library caught fire. 70,000 books were destroyed, and many others were damaged.\nThe Cohen era (1972\u20131986).\nGerson D. Cohen became Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1972.\nProminent faculty during Cohen's chancellorship included David Weiss Halivni of the Talmud Department and Jos\u00e9 Faur. Both of these scholars resigned when the JTS faculty voted to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors in 1983.\nYochanan Muffs, who had joined the JTS faculty in 1954, was a prominent professor of Bible. Max Kadushin, who had joined the JTS faculty in 1960, taught ethics and rabbinic thought until his death in 1980.\nIn 1972, Cohen appointed Avraham Holtz as the dean of academic development. Neil Gillman served as Dean of the JTS Rabbinical School for much of the Cohen chancellorship. Morton Leifman served as Dean of the Cantors Institute.\nCohen oversaw the appointment of Judith Hauptman as the first female professor of Talmud at JTS. Hauptman began teaching at JTS in 1973.\nJoel Roth, who had begun teaching at JTS in 1968, was appointed Associate Professor of Talmud upon completing his Ph.D. at JTS in 1973. Roth went on to serve as the dean of the Rabbinical School from 1981 to 1984. He was succeeded by Gordon Tucker, who became dean of the Rabbinical School in 1984.\nIn June 1973, the Seminary's Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities was granted permission to grant Ph.D. degrees in Jewish History, Bible, Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and Hebrew. In 1975, the Seminary replaced the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities with the Graduate School of the Jewish Theological Seminary, which brought together JTS's non-theological academic training programs. Cohen appointed historian Ismar Schorsch as the first dean of the Graduate School.\nAdmission of female students.\nBeginning in the 1970s, the topic of women's ordination was regularly discussed at JTS. Women who unsuccessfully sought admission to the rabbinical school during the 1970s included Susannah Heschel, daughter of JTS faculty member Abraham Joshua Heschel. There was a special commission appointed by the chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Gerson D. Cohen) to study the issue of ordaining women as rabbis, which met between 1977 and 1978, and consisted of 11 men and three women. The women were Marian Siner Gordon, an attorney; Rivkah Harris, an Assyriologist; and Francine Klagsbrun, a writer. After years of discussion, the JTS faculty voted to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors in 1983.\nThe first female rabbi to graduate from the school, and the first female Conservative Jewish rabbi in the world, was Amy Eilberg, who graduated and was ordained as a rabbi in 1985. The first class of female rabbis that was admitted to JTS in 1984 included Naomi Levy, who later became a best-selling author and Nina Beth Cardin, who became an author and environmental activist. Erica Lippitz and Marla Rosenfeld Barugel were the first women ordained as cantors by JTS and the first female Conservative Jewish cantors in the world. They were both ordained in 1987.\nSchorsch era (1986\u20132006).\nIsmar Schorsch became Chancellor of JTS in 1986.\nAmong his accomplishments was creating the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education, which was established through an endowment by William Davidson of Detroit in 1994.\nMichael Greenbaum served as Vice Chancellor of The Jewish Theological Seminary.\nProminent faculty in the Talmud and Rabbinics department during Schorsch's chancellorship included Joel Roth, Mayer Rabinowitz, David C. Kraemer and Judith Hauptman. Hauptman was the first woman appointed to teach Talmud at JTS. The Bible department included David Marcus and Stephen A. Geller. The Jewish literature Department included David G. Roskies. The Jewish history department included Jack Wertheimer and Shuly Rubin Schwartz. The Jewish Philosophy department included Neil Gillman and Shaul Magid. In 2004, Alan Mittleman joined the Jewish Philosophy department and became head of JTS's Louis Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies.\nThe number of advanced programs in the Graduate School grew over the course of Schorsch's tenure. The Graduate School came to describe itself as being \"the most extensive academic program in advanced Judaica in North America.\"\nGordon Tucker's tenure as dean of the Rabbinical School ended in 1992. His predecessor, Joel Roth, again became dean, serving in 1992\u20131993. Roth was succeeded by William Lebeau, who served as dean from 1993\u20131999. Lebeau was succeeded by Alan Kensky, and then Lebeau became dean of the Rabbinical School again in June 2002.\nIn 1998, Henry Rosenblum was appointed Dean of the H.L. Miller Cantorial School and College of Jewish Music at the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1998, becoming the first Hazzan to hold that position. Rosenblum remained in this position until 2010.\nEisen era (2007\u20132020).\nArnold Eisen, Koshland Professor of Jewish Culture and Religion and Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at Stanford University, took office as Chancellor-elect on July 1, 2006, the day after Schorsch stepped down. Eisen assumed the position full-time on July 1, 2007.\nEisen is the second non-rabbi, after Cyrus Adler, to hold this post. He is also the first person with a social science background to serve as Chancellor; previous chancellors had backgrounds in Jewish history or Talmud.\nIn January 2007, at the start of Eisen's chancellorship, Daniel S. Nevins was named the Dean of the Rabbinical School of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, succeeding William H. Lebeau. Biblical scholar Alan Cooper was named Provost. In 2010, Henry Rosenblum left the H.L. Miller Cantorial School as part of JTS's restructuring efforts, and Nevins also became responsible for oversight of the H.L. Miller Cantorial School.\nIn June 2009, Goldman Sachs executive Abby Joseph Cohen was named Chairman of the Board of JTS, the first woman to hold the position.\nAlso in 2009, with funding from the Charles H. Revson Foundation and the Booth Ferris Foundation, JTS established The Center for Pastoral Education with the goal of teaching the art of pastoral care to seminary students and ordained clergy of all faiths. The Center was developed by Mychal Springer, formerly an Associate Dean of the Rabbinical School. Springer became the Center's first director.\nIn 2010, the Tikvah Fund endowed a new institute at JTS, the Tikvah Institute for Jewish Thought, which is \"devoted to the intellectual encounter between the best sources of Jewish and broader Western reflection on the deepest problems of human life.\" According to the Seminary, \"JTS was selected by the Tikvah Fund based on its academic excellence and its mission to advance Jewish life in the modern world.\" Alan Mittleman, Chair of the Department of Jewish Thought, was appointed as its director.\nBurton L. Visotzky was appointed to replace Mittleman as director of the Louis Finkelstein Institute for Religious and Social Studies. His early work as director of the Finkelstein Institute focused on Muslim-Jewish dialogue. In October 2010, a group of prominent Muslim and Jewish scholars and leaders, joined by the heads of several Christian seminaries, met at JTS for two days to discuss and compare the situations of Islam and Judaism in America.\nIn May 2011, Eisen launched \"https://,\" an interactive website featuring original essays on Conservative Judaism, with responses from Movement and Lay leaders and scholars.\nAdmission of LGBT students.\nSince March 2007, JTS has accepted openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual students into their rabbinical and cantorial programs (the seminary's other three schools upheld such non-discrimination policies before this date). A survey conducted before the decision indicated that 58% of the rabbinical student body supported this change. The school issued a press release announcing the new admission policy, without taking a stance on same-sex unions. JTS marked the first anniversary of the change with a special program. Some students who opposed the change in admission policy said they felt excluded from the day's program because it did not sufficiently acknowledge the diversity within the student body. In April 2011, JTS held a Yom Iyyun, or day of learning, about LGBTQ issues, and their intersection with Judaism. Joy Ladin, a transgender woman who taught English at Yeshiva University, gave a talk about her life. Other programs included creating welcoming communities and inclusive prayer, among others. It was sponsored in part by Keshet, a Jewish social action group for LGBTQ people.\nJTS and the Conservative movement.\nJTS was the founding institution of Conservative Judaism in America. The United Synagogue of America, the organization of Conservative synagogues, was founded by Solomon Schechter while he served as President of JTS. In the context of the pre-Finkelstein era, Orthodox Rabbi Nosson Scherman stated that \"in its early years the JTS was what today might be called Modern Orthodox.\"\nDuring the chancellorship of Louis Finkelstein, however, there were many tensions between JTS and the Conservative Judaism movement which it led. JTS was often more traditional in matters of religious practice than the denomination as a whole. When Jacob Neusner applied to JTS during the Finkelstein era, in 1954, he like other applicants \"had to sign a pledge saying they would abide by traditional Jewish law.\" Finkelstein was also perceived as focusing on American and world Jewry as a whole while paying little attention to the Conservative movement.\nAccording to scholar Michael Panitz, the situation changed under Finkelstein's successors. Under Chancellor Gerson Cohen (chancellor from 1972\u201386), JTS \"decisively embraced its identity as a Conservative Jewish institution, it thereby abandoned its earlier hopes to provide a non-denominational unifier for traditional and moderate American Jews.\" The next chancellor, Ismar Schorsch (1986\u20132006), \"emerged as an outspoken advocate for Conservative Judaism.\" With the new mission statement introduced by Chancellor Arnold Eisen (2007-), the school has positioned itself as serving both \"Conservative Judaism\" and \"the vital religious center.\"\nAs of 2010, JTS's website describes JTS as \"the academic and spiritual center of Conservative Judaism worldwide.\" Others describe it as \"the academic and spiritual centre of Conservative Judaism in the United States.\" A second important center for Conservative Judaism in the United States is the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies in California, founded by graduates of JTS in 1996.\nCurrent educational programs.\nRabbinical School.\nThe Rabbinical School describes itself as offering \"an intensive program of study, personal growth, and spiritual development that leads to rabbinic ordination and a career of service to the Jewish community.\"\nAs of 2010, the rabbinical school requires five or six years of study. Its curriculum requires extensive study of Talmud, midrash, Bible, Jewish history, Hebrew language, and various professional skills. Students are required to spend the second year of the program at the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem.\nStudents must choose a field of concentration during their studies. Concentrations include:\nCantorial school.\nThe cantorial school describes itself as training \"select advanced students as hazzanim (cantors) for congregational service or as teachers of Jewish music, choral directors, composers, or research scholars.\"\nThe school is technically divided into two parts: the entity formally known as the \"H. L. Miller Cantorial School\" invests students as hazzanim, while the entity known as the \"College of Jewish Music\" awards the master's degree in Sacred Music. All students in the Cantorial School are enrolled in both programs simultaneously.\nAt present, the first year of cantorial school at JTS is generally spent in Israel. The curriculum during the five years focuses on three main areas: general music, Jewish music and Jewish text study.\nGraduate school.\nThe graduate school of the Jewish Theological Seminary offers academic programs in advanced Jewish studies. It describes itself as offering \"the most extensive academic program in advanced Judaic Studies in North America\". The school grants MA, DHL, and PhD degrees in the areas of:\nWilliam Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education.\nIn 1994, William Davidson of Detroit, Michigan established a $15 million endowment at JTS to fund the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education, which trains educators who can serve in Jewish institutions and elsewhere, in both formal and informal settings. The Davidson School offers both master's and doctoral degrees.\nList College.\nAlbert A. List College of Jewish Studies (List College) is the undergraduate school of JTSA. It is closely affiliated with Columbia University; almost all List College students are enrolled in dual-degree programs with either Columbia University\u2019s School of General Studies or Barnard College.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

F. Lawton. It stars Steven Seagal (who also produced the film), Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey, and Erika Eleniak. Seagal plays Casey Ryback, a former Navy SEAL, who must fend off a group of mercenaries after they commandeer the U.S. Navy battleship .\nReleased on October 9, 1992, \"Under Siege\" was both a critical and commercial success, receiving two Academy Award nominations for sound production and grossing over $156.6 million at the global box office. It is often considered Steven Seagal's best film to date. It was followed in 1995 by a sequel, \"\", which was not as well received.\n\"Under Siege\" was the final film of actor Patrick O'Neal, before his death in 1994.\nPlot.\nThe battleship arrives at Pearl Harbor, where President George H. W. Bush announces that the ship will be decommissioned in California. Casey Ryback, a chief petty officer and a culinary specialist, is preparing meals to celebrate commanding officer Captain Adams' birthday, against the orders of executive officer Commander Krill, who has arranged for food and entertainment to be brought by helicopter. Krill provokes a tussle with Ryback. Unable to imprison Ryback in the brig without the captain's approval, Krill detains him in the walk-in fridge, placing Marine Private Nash on guard. The helicopter arrives with a musical band and caterers, accompanied by \" Playboy\" Playmate Jordan Tate.\nThe band and caterers are mercenaries employed by disillusioned former CIA operative William Strannix, who takes over the ship, killing several officers. The takeover is aided by Krill, who murders Captain Adams. The surviving crew are imprisoned in the forecastle. Ryback hears the gunshots and persuades Nash to call the bridge. Strannix sends two mercenaries to eliminate Ryback and Nash. Nash is killed, but Ryback kills both mercenaries. He encounters Tate and reluctantly allows her to tag along.\nStrannix and his mercenaries seize the ship's weapon systems, shooting down a jet sent to investigate; they plan to cover their escape with missiles to obliterate tracking systems in Pearl Harbor. Strannix's mission is to hijack the ship's Tomahawks and load them onto a hijacked North Korean submarine. The Tomahawks would then be sold on the black market to an anti-American nation, likely instigating the Third World War as part of a master plan; Strannix's revenge for an attempted CIA assassination and to make Krill so rich he could \"buy the presidency\".\nStrannix contacts Admiral Bates at the Pentagon to make demands but learns Ryback has escaped. Krill discovers Ryback is a former Navy SEAL with extensive training in counterterrorism tactics; Captain Adams had taken Ryback aboard as his cook after Ryback was demoted because he attacked a superior officer who provided inadequate intel for a failed mission in Panama. Strannix appears to recognize Ryback's name. Ryback contacts Bates, who says a Navy SEAL team is underway to retake the ship. Ryback, helped by Tate, moves throughout the ship, eliminating mercenaries one by one. Krill activates the fire suppression system to murder the prisoners with water and to draw out Ryback through ambush, who will likely attempt rescue.\nRyback and Tate release five imprisoned sailors, along with visiting WW2 veteran gunner's mate Calaway. They overcome the ambush and shut off the water flooding the forecastle. Ryback shuts down \"Missouri\"'s weapon systems to allow incoming Navy SEALs to land, but the submarine crew shoots down the helicopter carrying the team. The Pentagon orders an air strike that will sink the \"Missouri\". Strannix regains control of the ship's weapon systems and loads the Tomahawks onto the submarine. Aided by Calaway, Ryback attacks the submarine using the battleship's 16-inch guns, killing the pirates and Krill.\nHis main plan foiled, Strannix launches two retaliatory nuclear-tipped Tomahawks towards Honolulu. As the sailors retake the ship, Ryback enters the control room and encounters Strannix, who it is revealed previously served over Ryback as the latter recognizes him. Ryback kills Strannix in a knife fight and then uses the launch code disk to destroy the Tomahawk missiles. A jet obliterates one missile, and the other is deactivated; the Navy calls off its airstrike.\nThe remaining crew are released as the ship sails to San Francisco harbor. A funeral ceremony for Captain Adams is held aboard the \"Missouri\", with Tate amongst the crew. Ryback salutes the captain's casket in his formal dress uniform with full decorations.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Steven Seagal as Chief Petty Officer Casey Ryback, a former Navy SEAL who serves as ship's cook on \"Missouri\".\nProduction.\nDevelopment and pre-production.\nThe film was based on an original spec script by J. F. Lawton called \"Dreadnought\" which sold for $1 million. Warners wanted Seagal to star in the film but he turned it down at first. Seagal later said he had problems with the role of a character \"who is at first a bimbo jumping out of a cake and gets paired up with me.\" But he said that in revisions of the script, the role became a character \"who gradually reveals her intelligence.\"\nLawton said \"We are trying to make him [Seagal] more mainstream...getting him out of the pure action genre and into an acting role.\" The writer added \"I'm trying to bring the budget within a reasonable range. The original script was almost irresponsible, with things like battleships getting blown up...the way it was, \"Dreadnought\" would have cost $100 million-plus to make. Now we're looking at the $30 million range... It was Steven's idea to fit the Pearl Harbor Memorial into the film, because all these incredible ships would be there\u2014a spectacular sight.\"\nDirector Andrew Davis had previously made \"Above the Law\" with Steven Seagal. Davis later said \"Terry Semel wanted us to get back together again saying that Seagal was only in the movie 41 minutes. Tommy Lee is in the movie longer than Steven. It was fine, it was fine. It worked out well. We had a nice time down in Mobile and had a lot of fun making the movie, and that was the movie that got me \"The Fugitive\" so it was worth it.\"\nIn a 2018 interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Pamela Anderson claimed that she was a contender for the role of Jordan Tate, but was dropped after refusing to sleep with Seagal. Busey claimed in later interviews that Seagal sexually harassed Eleniak on set, but she has denied that Seagal ever acted inappropriately with her during casting or filming.\nFilming.\n (serving as a museum in Mobile) stood in for many of the \"Missouri\" sequences, and (museum ship) portrayed the North Korean submarine. The film also featured footage of the real \"Missouri\" sailing in Pearl Harbor, the Pacific Ocean, and San Francisco Bay. The war room sequences were filmed inside of a set constructed in a local high school gymnasium.\nThe film makes extensive use of the Introvision process, a variation of front projection that allows realistic three-dimensional interaction of foreground characters with projected backgrounds without the heavy cost of traditional bluescreen effects. The technique was also used in the films \"Outland\", \"Megaforce\", \"Army of Darkness\" and Andrew Davis' later film, \"The Fugitive\".\n\"Most people are surprised that the film is as sophisticated as it is,\" Davis said. \"It appeals to people who have a point of view about nuclear weapons and the story thrusts you into an incredible situation that is not far-fetched.\" When the original title \"Dreadnought\" did not test well with audiences, the marketing department wanted to give the film a three-word title like other Seagal films. They came up with \"Last to Surrender\", which Lawton and Seagal hated. Seagal fought to have it changed, and the film ended up being called \"Under Siege\".\nRobert Booth Nichols, a self-described former espionage artist, alleged mob associate, and con artist, was employed by Seagal as a technical advisor. He also appears in the film in a small speaking role.\nReception.\nBox office.\nOn its opening weekend, \"Under Siege\" made $15,760,003 from 2,042 theaters, with a $7,717 average. From there, it went on to make $83,563,139. Worldwide, it made $156,563,139. At the time, it was the most successful film that had not been screened for any critics prior to its release.\nCritical response.\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale. Reviewers praised Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey's performances as the film's villains. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 83% based on reviews from 30 critics. The site's consensus states: \"A well-directed action thriller that makes the most of its confined setting, \"Under Siege\" marks a high point for early '90s action\u2014and its star's spotty filmography.\" This is one of the few Steven Seagal films to receive a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, along with \"Executive Decision\" and \"Machete\", being called \"\"Die Hard\" on a battleship\" by film critics. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nIt was also the only Seagal movie to receive an Academy Award nomination, earning two nominations for Best Sound Effects Editing (John Leveque and Bruce Stambler) and for Best Sound (Donald O. Mitchell, Frank A. Monta\u00f1o, Rick Hart and Scott D. Smith). It did not win in either category, losing to \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" and \"The Last of the Mohicans\". Harrison Ford saw a rough cut of the film and approved director Andrew Davis for \"The Fugitive\" (1993).\nFranchise.\nSequel.\nA sequel, \"Under Siege 2: Dark Territory\", was released on July 14, 1995, with Seagal, Romano, Mancuso and Dye reprising their roles. The film failed to replicate the success of its predecessor.\nReboot.\nIn November 2021, a reboot of the original was in development for HBO Max, with Timo Tjahjanto and Umair Aleem attached to direct and write the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Seagal plays Gino Felino, a veteran New York City police detective who sets out to avenge his partner Bobby's murder by killing the trigger-happy, drug-addicted mafioso culprit (played by William Forsythe). The film also features Jerry Orbach, Jo Champa and Gina Gershon.\nThe film was released theatrically by Warner Bros. on April 12, 1991. It received mixed-to-negative reviews, but was a commercial success.\nPlot.\nGino Felino is an NYPD detective from Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, who has strong ties within his neighborhood. Gino and his partner Bobby Lupo wait to bust up a multimillion-dollar drug deal, but Gino sees a pimp violently assaulting one of his girls and intervenes. Shortly afterward, Richie Madano murders Bobby, shooting him multiple times in broad daylight in front of his wife, Laurie, and his two children.\nRichie is a crack addict who grew up with Gino and Bobby. He has become psychotic and homicidal due to rage and drug use, and seems not to care about the consequences of his actions. Richie then kills a woman at random, shooting her in the head at a traffic stop when she abruptly tells him to move his car. He heads off into Brooklyn alongside his goons, who are horrified by what he does, but continue to work alongside him.\nGino knows that Richie is not going to leave the neighborhood. Ronnie Donziger, his captain, gives him the clearance for a manhunt and provides him with a shotgun and an unmarked car. Gino visits his mob connection Frankie and his boss Don Vittorio, and he tells them he will not get out of the way of their own plans to take out Richie, whom they view as a loose cannon. While driving, Gino sees a fellow driver discard something moving from his car. Upon investigating, Gino rescues an abandoned German Shepherd puppy.\nGino starts the hunt for Richie at a bar run by Richie's brother Vinnie Madano. Vinnie and his friends all refuse to provide information, so Gino beats up a number of them. He still does not find out where Richie is, but his concern about getting an attitude problem has been taken care of. Gino attempts to get Richie out of hiding by arresting his sister Pattie and by talking to his estranged, elderly father.\nAfterwards, Gino and his wife, Vicky, who are in the middle of a divorce, decide not to get one and reconcile, but they, along with their son, Tony, are attacked by Richie's men when they storm into their apartment. Gino kills them all and saves his wife and son. Richie later comes back to the bar and beats up Vinnie for not killing Gino when the situation was one cop against a bar full of armed men. He also has information leaked to the mob that he is at the bar, then emerges from hiding and ambushes the mob's hitmen in a shoot-out.\nAfter visiting a number of local hangouts and establishments trying to find information, Gino discovers Richie killed Bobby because Bobby was having an affair with two women \u2013 Richie's girlfriend, Roxanne Ford, and a waitress named Terry Malloy. When Gino goes to Roxanne's home, he finds she is dead. Gino believes that Richie killed Roxanne before he killed Bobby. Gino goes to Laurie's house and tells the widow what is going on. In Laurie's purse, Gino finds the picture that Richie dropped on Bobby's body after killing him. Bobby turns out to have been a corrupt cop who had wanted a money-making lifestyle like Richie's, and Laurie knew Bobby was corrupt. Laurie had found a picture of Bobby and Roxanne having sex. She had given Richie the picture out of jealousy, never expecting Richie to kill Bobby for sleeping with Roxanne. Laurie took the picture away from where Richie dropped it on Bobby because she wanted to protect her husband's reputation.\nFollowing a tip from his local snitch Picolino, Gino eventually finds Richie in a house in the old neighborhood having a party. Gino kills all of Richie's men. Gino then finds Richie and fights him hand-to-hand. After beating Richie senseless, Gino finally kills him by stabbing him in the forehead with a corkscrew. The mobsters arrive soon after, also intent on killing Richie. Gino uses the lead mobster's gun to shoot the already-dead Richie several times, then tells him to return to his boss and take credit for Richie's death.\nGino and his wife adopt the puppy as a family pet, naming him Coraggio (Italian for courage or bravery). Whilst visiting Coney Island, they encounter the same man who abandoned the puppy earlier, and Gino confronts him. When the man attacks him, Gino defends himself, knocking the man down. Gino and his wife laugh as the puppy urinates on the man's head.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThis was the film debut of Julianna Margulies.\nProduction.\nJohn Flynn later claimed the original title was \"The Price of Our Blood\", \"meaning Mafia blood. That was the title that Steven and I wanted, but Warner Bros. said no. It had to be a three-word title like the other Steven Seagal films (\"Above the Law\", \"Hard to Kill\", and \"Marked for Death\").\" During filming, the working title was \"The Night\". Seagal claimed to have completely rewritten the original script, though only R. Lance Hill (under his pen name David Lee Henry) was credited on the final film.\nThe character Richie Madano was inspired by Costabile \u201cGus\u201d Farace, a Bonanno family associate who was the subject of a manhunt by both law enforcement and his former mob associates after killing an undercover DEA agent. Farace was eventually caught and killed by a mob hitman.\nFilming took place on-location in the Brooklyn borough New York City, and in Los Angeles.\nRe-editing.\nThe movie was originally much longer and included more plot and characters. Seagal reportedly cut some of William Forsythe's scenes because he felt that Forsythe was upstaging him. Also, Warner Bros. brought in editor Michael Eliot to re-edit the original cut of the movie so that it would be shorter and more profitable at the box office. Eliot did the same job on a few other Warner Bros. movies - Wes Craven's sci-fi horror \"Deadly Friend\" (1986) and Mark L. Lester's action movie \"Showdown in Little Tokyo\" (1991). Some scenes were deleted, and some others were cut for pacing, so two montage scenes with no dialogue are in the movie. Re-editing also caused some minor continuity mistakes. The theatrical trailer shows two deleted scenes: Richie shooting inside a clothing store from which he took a new shirt (in his first few scenes, he is wearing one shirt, then all of a sudden, he is wearing another shirt for the rest of the movie), and a scene where the police captain tells Gino that body count is going up. Some TV versions of the movie included two deleted scenes: Richie stealing the new shirt from store because he got blood on it (also seen in trailer), and Richie and his guys breaking into the house where Gino's wife is and trying to find her, but leaving when some neighbors show up.\nFlynn later recalled:\nI really liked working with Bill Forsythe and Jerry Orbach and all those guys in the car who played the killers. But I didn't get along with Steven. He was always about an hour late for work and caused a lot of delays. We shot until October 31, 1990, because an IATSE strike was threatened. (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts - Ed.) Warner Bros. told us we had to be on a plane by November 1. So we shot for about a month in Brooklyn. The rest of \"Out for Justice\" was shot in and around south Los Angeles. We filmed those scenes on Lacy Street, in a slummy area of old wooden buildings that could pass for Brooklyn.Further cuts were made after the film received an NC-17 rating for violence.\nGene LeBell incident.\nDuring filming, there was an alleged physical altercation between Seagal and stunt coordinator Gene LeBell. While on the production set, Seagal allegedly claimed that due to his aikido training, he was \"immune\" to being choked unconscious. At some point, LeBell, a 10th degree red belt in judo and experienced catch wrestler, heard about the claim and gave Seagal the opportunity to prove it. He supposedly placed his arms around Seagal's neck, and once Seagal said \"go\", choked him into unconsciousness, urination and defecation. The popularity of this incident led LeBell to be counted in 1992 as a potential additional member of Robert Wall's controversial \"Dirty Dozen,\" a group of martial artists willing to answer to a public challenge made by Seagal. \nSeagal has denied the incident ever took place, calling LeBell a \"sick, pathological scumbag liar\" and offered the name of a witness who could discredit the other account. After refusing to comment for many years, LeBell circumspectly referred to the story in 2012 in an Ariel Helwani when questioned on the matter in an interview; some outlets chose to consider this confirmation of the story, despite LeBell refusing to directly comment. He was quoted as saying: \"When we had a little altercation or difference of opinion, there were thirty stuntmen and cameramen that were watching. Sometimes Steven has a tendency to cheese off the wrong people, and you can get hurt doing that.\" After being asked whether he was not going to directly confirm it, LeBell said: \"Well, if thirty people are watching, let them talk about it.\"\nStuntman Steven Lambert, who was also Seagal's part-time bodyguard, stated he was present and said that a confrontation did happen. According to Lambert, Seagal explained to LeBell that he did not believe his choke hold was effective, and that he could escape from it. LeBell demonstrated the choke hold by putting it on Seagal. Without locking the hold, Seagal side stepped and swung his forearm backwards into his crotch. LeBell came off the floor by a few feet. As soon as he landed, LeBell used a foot sweep to sweep Seagal off the floor, with Seagal landing on his back. LeBell helped Seagal up.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Out for Justice\" debuted at number one for the U.S. box office, the third straight Seagal movie to do so. It eventually grossed $40 million, about a third less than his prior movie, \"Marked for Death\".\nCritical response.\nThe movie received generally negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23% based on reviews from 22 critics. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nCensorship.\nAdditional cuts for violence were made for the film's release overseas. In the United Kingdom in particular, several of the gruesome action scenes were trimmed for the video release, cutting the duration by 54 seconds. It was later released uncut for DVD.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It garnered negative reviews from critics and grossed $78.1 million worldwide on a $50 million production budget.\nPlot.\nAegis Oil owns various oil refineries and rigs in Alaska, where the company faces great opposition from the public due to the increasing environmental damage done by its operations. Aegis had purchased the oil production rights from the local tribal council 20 years prior; however, the rights will revert to the natives if Aegis 1, the company's newest oil platform and biggest refinery, is not online within a certain deadline. In order to make the deadline in the face of multiple delays, CEO Michael Jennings forces his workers to use substandard parts.\nForeman Hugh Palmer's rig suffers a blowout due to the faulty parts. Trained firefighter Forrest Taft extinguishes the blaze. However, they have become suspicious of their company's consistently poor safety record. Taft manages to hack into the company's computer files and learn about the faulty parts. After being informed of Palmer's efforts to alert the Environmental Protection Agency and of Taft's access to restricted files, Jennings arranges for both of them to be eliminated by his Chief Security Officer, MacGruder and his assistant Otto. The two ransack Palmer's cabin and brutally torture and murder him when he refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, Taft is ordered by Jennings to head over to another accident site, but realizes too late that the damaged building has been rigged as a booby trap. Taft narrowly survives the ensuing explosion and is rescued by Masu, the daughter of Yupik tribe chief Silook.\nAt the behest of Silook, Taft undergoes a vision quest in which he sees the full truth and vows to make amends for his part in Aegis's crimes. Meanwhile, the Aegis security team tracks Taft to Silook's village and when the tribe turns them down, a confrontation ensues, ending with MacGruder fatally shooting Silook. Taft returns in time to have one last talk with Silook before he succumbs to his wounds, vowing to avenge him and bring down Aegis.\nTaft and Masu make their way to Palmer's cabin. While gathering supplies, they find his incriminating disk containing proof of Aegis's crimes. Otto and three Aegis security guards track the pair back to the cabin. Taft ambushes the party, quickly killing all of them. Jennings then deploys a squad of mercenaries led by an older man code-named \"Stone\", but Taft manages to evade the group by killing several of the members with booby traps and blowing up a shack which obliterates a helicopter, effectively finishing their pursuit.\nTaft and Masu collect weapons and explosives and proceed to sneak into the refinery complex. Taft sabotages Aegis 1 by killing the main power and forcing a reboot, then releasing hydrochloric acid gas inside the refinery. He then plants a series of C-4 explosive charges onto several oil tanks and in the control room and sets them to a timer.\nJennings has already arrived at the refinery to check on it when he gets word of Taft's infiltration and orders his henchmen to find and kill him. Taft fights and eventually eliminates every opposing mercenary (including MacGruder and Stone) using firearms, a steel pipe, and even burning gasoline. He then confronts and corners Jennings, condemning him for his greed and corruption. As Jennings attempts to escape, Taft lassos one of his legs with a cable, puts it on a hook and shoots the cable, sending Jennings to his death into a pool of oil sludge below. He and Masu then escape the rig just as the hidden C-4 charges detonate, causing a chain of explosions that ravages the entire plant. They flee the exploding refinery in an Aegis truck, escaping as Aegis 1 is torn down by the fire.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nAt the time of its release, Gene Siskel included the film in his \"Worst of\" list for 1994, singling out the melancholy tone of the film and the quality of Seagal's dialogue. On their syndicated TV show \"Siskel &amp; Ebert\", Siskel called the film's pyrotechnics \"low rent\" and stated that he \"didn't think the fight sequences were anything special.\" He noted that Seagal's speech at the end was \"more interesting than the actual fighting.\"\nRoger Ebert, for his part, stated the movie was \"limited to two basic qualities: it's violent and it's sanctimonious\", and opined that while \"it doesn't pay to devote close attention to the plot\", \"if you like to see lots of stuff blowed up real good, then this'll be a movie for you.\" His opinion on the ending speech was that it was \"absurd\", stating, \"at the end after Seagal kills about 30 people and blowing up the largest oil refinery in the world, what happens? He's invited to the Alaska State Legislature to give a talk about ecology. I'm not sure, but blowing up oil refineries does not make you that popular in Alaska.\"\n\"Variety\" film critic Leonard Klady referred to the film as \"a vanity production parading as a social statement\" and commented that the film seemingly borrowed heavily from the earlier film \"Billy Jack\", but opined that Seagal lacked \"acting technique and the ability behind the camera to keep the story simple and direct\" that \"Billy Jack\" star Tom Laughlin exhibited. Like Siskel, Klady also singled out the speech by Seagal's character at the end of the film.\nIn the 1996 movie guide \"Seen That, Now What?\", the film was given the rating of \"C\u2212\", stating \"This combination action/environmental rights movie is an interesting hybrid in concept, but a filmic mess in execution, including embarrassing Eskimo shaman scenes and well-meaning lecture-finale on endangered species.\"\n\"Seagalogy\" author Vern considers \"On Deadly Ground\" to be one of Seagal's defining works, writing, \"It's the corniest, most unintentionally hilarious movie of his career... But it's also Seagal's most sincere and his most ballsy,\" going on to claim, \"You can't understand Seagal if you haven't seen \"On Deadly Ground\".\" He points out that many of the most important themes and motifs that define Seagal's work are present in the film, and more overtly so than in any of his other films.\nCaine's American accent in the film, which \"The Daily Telegraph\" described as that of a \"Texan that had been brought up in the mean streets of London,\" has made several \"worst movie accent\" lists.\nBox office.\nThe film grossed $38.6 million in the United States and Canada and $78.1 million worldwide against its reported $50 million budget.\nAccolades.\nThe film received six Golden Raspberry Awards nominations and won in the Worst Director category. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Kurt Russell, Steven Seagal, Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt, Joe Morton, David Suchet and B.D. Wong. It depicts the rescue of an airliner hijacked by terrorists, by a small team placed on the plane in mid-flight. The film was released in the United States on March 15, 1996, by Warner Bros. It grossed $122 million against a $55 million budget.\nPlot.\nIn May 1995, Lieutenant Colonel Austin Travis leads an unsuccessful Special Forces black ops raid on a Chechen mafia safe house in Trieste, Italy, to recover a stolen Soviet nerve agent, DZ-5. Three months later, Oceanic Airlines Flight 343, a Boeing 747-200, leaves Athens bound for Washington, D.C., with more than 400 passengers aboard including Nagi Hassan, lieutenant of the imprisoned terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa. Hassan and his men hijack the flight, demanding Jaffa's release. Meanwhile, just moments before the hijacking, a suicide bomber working for Jaffa destroys a London Marriott hotel restaurant.\nDr. David Grant, the U.S. Army intelligence consultant behind the botched raid, is summoned to a meeting at the Pentagon to plan an operation to retake the plane. Grant doubts Hassan's demands, suspecting he engineered Jaffa's capture, and intends to use the 747 to detonate a bomb loaded with the DZ-5 in U.S. airspace. The Pentagon authorizes a mid-air insertion of Travis' special operations team onto the hijacked airliner using the experimental \"Remora F117x\" aircraft. Grant and DARPA engineer Dennis Cahill reluctantly join the mission.\nThe Remora intercepts and docks with the airliner. Grant, Cahill, and team members Cappy, Baker, Louie and Rat successfully board but Cappy is injured after a fall. Severe turbulence strains the docking tunnel. Travis sacrifices himself by closing the 747's hatch before it decompresses. The Remora is destroyed along with two other team members still on board as well as their communications equipment, leaving the Pentagon unaware of their survival. They conduct a covert search for the bomb, hoping to neutralize it and storm the cabin. Grant accidentally reveals his presence to flight attendant Jean, but successfully recruits her to assist their search, despite Hassan's suspicions.\nThe team locates the bomb and Cappy, despite his injuries, guides Cahill in disarming it until they discover its arming device has an additional, remote-controlled trigger. Jaffa, released by U.S. officials in an attempt to resolve the situation, calls Hassan from a private jet to tell him he is on his way to Algeria, but Hassan abruptly ends the call. Grant and the others realize Hassan's men are unaware of the bomb and Hassan's true intentions, after he kills one of them for rebuking him. He also inadvertently reveals that one of the passengers is a sleeper agent and the trigger-man for the bomb.\nThe Pentagon dispatches U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcats to shoot down the 747, prompting Hassan to execute passenger U.S. Senator Jason Mavros as a warning. Baker uses Morse code via the 747's taillights to signal the fighters that the team made it aboard, requesting an extra ten minutes to neutralize the bomb and retake the 747, despite already crossing into U.S. airspace. Jean spots a man with an electronic device and informs Grant, who enters the passenger cabin to take the suspected individual by surprise, only to find he is merely a diamond thief. Grant spots the real sleeper, Demou, and fights him for the detonator. Hassan attempts to shoot Grant, but is himself shot by an on-board air marshal.\nThe commandos storm the cabin as a firefight ensues. Grant struggles to wrestle the detonator from Demou's grip while Baker and Rat gun down several terrorists. Louie assists Grant by fatally shooting Demou and eliminating the remaining terrorists. Demou, however, manages to arm the bomb before dying, and stray bullets from a terrorist's weapon pierce a window causing explosive decompression. The bomb is disarmed just in time by Cappy and Cahill as the 747 stabilizes. Hassan kills the pilots and damages the controls, before being shot and killed by Rat.\nDespite his limited flying experience and poor flying technique, Grant takes control of the 747 and attempts a landing but misses the approach to Dulles International Airport. Now flying north over Maryland, Grant recognizes the area surrounding his training airfield, Frederick Field, and opts to attempt to land the 747 there. With Jean's assistance, Grant successfully lands the airliner and the passengers are safely evacuated. Grant is saluted by Baker, Louie, Rat and Cappy for his leadership before being summoned to the Pentagon.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Kurt Russell as Dr. David Grant, a consultant for US Army Intelligence\nProduction.\nStuart Baird, an editor who was twice nominated for the Academy Awards, made his directorial debut with \"Executive Decision\". Kurt Russell was paid $7.5 million and Halle Berry was paid $1 million to star in the film. David Suchet learned Arabic for his role.\nSteven Seagal says that he was enticed to accept the unusual role of Austin Travis by a hefty salary, which amounted to around a million dollars per day spent on the shoot. He also found some satisfaction in knowing that his character's unexpected fate would shock the audience, and therefore did not regret taking the role.\nExterior shots of the Boeing 747 were done using models and two real aircraft. Grant McCune Design constructed two models for actual shooting, one model to test the rig, one complete lower half for closeups of the landing gear extension sequence, and one 1/12 scale nose section for the stealth docking sequence. Two models of the Remora were also made at 1/6 scale, one for the docking sequence with a motion controlled snorkel and articulated hatch and another for post dock sequences. An ex-Kuwait Airways 747-269BM belonging to Kalitta Air (registration N707CK) was featured in most of the in-flight shots, while a Corsair 747-121 (externally identical to the 747-200) formerly owned by Pan Am was used for closeups of the aircraft in the aftermath of the crash landing at the end. The latter aircraft was stored in the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, after filming wrapped up and was subsequently scrapped in 1998. The F-14s featured in the film came from the VF-84 \"Jolly Rogers\" squadron. This would be VF-84's last Hollywood appearance before disestablishment.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 62% based on reviews from 42 critics, with an average rating of 6.30/10. The site's consensus states: \"\"Executive Decision\" adheres entertainingly to classic action thriller formula, proving a genre outing doesn't need to win points for originality to be solidly effective.\" On Metacritic, the film has an approval rating of 62 out of 100, based on reviews from 20 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.\nLeonard Maltin called it \"a tense, inventive thriller\" which needed more editing. Leonard Klady of \"Variety\" wrote, \"The picture's logic may be a bit fast and loose, but its action-and-excitement quotient is top-notch.\" Roger Ebert rated it 3 out of 4 stars, calling it \"a gloriously goofy mess of a movie\" with several plot holes (e.g. smuggling a toxin into the country would probably be easier and just as effective as hijacking) that nonetheless managed to be entertaining. Ebert praised the first-act plot twist of killing off the character played by Seagal, then a major Hollywood star: \"I perked right up\". On their TV show, Ebert's colleague Gene Siskel praised rookie director Stuart Baird for going \"full tilt,\" pushing past several \"natural endings\" to deliver more action, saying that the excitement made the film's logical flaws easy to overlook. He gave the film a \"thumbs up.\"\nDoug Hamilton, writing for \"The Atlanta Constitution\", called the film a \"crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, \"Die Hard\" and \"Airport\"\" in his three star review. Seagal's early death was praised by Marc Horton, writing for \"Edmonton Journal\", but he criticized the rest of the film as predictable in his review that gave the film two out of five stars. It was called \"a preposterous but riveting new entry into Hollywood's neverending lineup of cliched, action packed techno-thrillers\" by Michael Reid in his four out of five stars review for the \"Times Colonist\".\nAccolades.\nBerry earned a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actress \u2013 Adventure/Drama for her performance in the film in 1997. Steven Seagal earned a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor for his performance in the film but lost to Marlon Brando for \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\".\nOther versions.\nThe European theatrical version of the film was edited by the studio in order to remove reference to Islam. The original US version was the source of the DVD, while the European version was used worldwide as the source for the Blu-ray HD master.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67424", "revid": "18872885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67424", "title": "Steyr-Puch Haflinger", "text": "Austrian light utility vehicle\nThe Haflinger is a small, lightweight, four wheel drive, high mobility cab over vehicle about 2.8\u00a0m long (3.15\u00a0m for the long wheelbase version) and 1.3\u00a0m wide, powered by a 643\u00a0cc horizontally opposed flat twin, rear mounted air-cooled engine. Weighing around 635\u00a0kg (1400\u00a0lb), the Haflinger can be lifted by four strong people and yet can carry a load of 515\u00a0kg (1135.3\u00a0lb). This truck falls into the category of the light utility vehicle. It was produced between 1959 and 1974 by the Austrian manufacturer Steyr-Daimler-Puch.\nHistory.\nAfter WWII, the newly organized Austrian Army was equipped with the surplus US Army Willys MB and Ford GPW Jeep. A decade after hostilities ended, the Austrian Army was considering the retirement of the aging Jeeps in favor of something more contemporary as well as locally designed and produced. The design genius of Erich Ledwinka (son of legendary Tatra designer and father of the Volkswagen Beetle Hans Ledwinka) was utilized by the Austrian firm Steyr-Daimler-Puch to produce and field test prototypes. Its extensive similarities with the larger Tatra all wheel drive trucks are obvious, it has even been referred to as \"A little Tatra\". Once the production model design was finalized, the trucks were manufactured between 1959 and 1974 and were exported all over the world. The manufacturer designated the trucks as \"Type Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle\". A total of 16,647 were made. (See Military Use below.) \nThe majority of the Haflinger trucks entered directly into the hands of private owners around the world with a small number also being placed into municipal, ambulance and fire brigade services. Like its predecessor, the US Army Jeep, Haflinger trucks are at home both off and on road. They have been licensed for on-road use throughout Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Australia. During their 16-year production run they were sold in Austria and exported to 35 other countries. The first trucks to see use in the United States arrived in 1960. In 1983 one was driven from Vermont to California, while Austrian travel journalist Ernst Wiese in his book \"10,000 Miles Through Arabia\" described his four-month return journey from Vienna to the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Its multi-functional capabilities meant it was described as a car, a truck and the \"Austrian Jeep\".\nMilitary use.\nApproximately 7,000 Haflingers were recruited into military service by the Swiss, Austrian and Australian armies and the Royal Navy. Small numbers were also in use in Katanga and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1960s.\nThe Haflinger was adopted by the Australian Army as the \"Truck, Utility, 1/4 Ton, GS, Lightweight\". 46 of the vehicles were procured by the Army in 1966 and were registered sequentially from 101-816 to 101-861. A bespoke, matching trailer, \"Trailer, Cargo, 1/4 Ton\", was provisioned for each vehicle, and were registered sequentially from 101-862 to 101-907. Haflingers were often allocated to RAEME units where typically an individual craftsman, like artillery artificers, would use the vehicle to carry tools and other equipment around the field attending to technical servicing of weapons platforms and fighting vehicles.\nHaflinger, Steyr Puch, is not listed in the table of Australian Army vehicles in Vietnam within the M Cecil book \"Mud &amp; Dust\", but a popular misconception may have occurred because of the US M274 Mechanical Mule which has a similar size and mechanical arrangement and was used to carry munitions and other equipment.\nFeatures.\nParticular features that add to the off-road capability include:\nHaflinger fans.\nMost enthusiasts are found in Germany and Austria, where there are thriving clubs. There are also many owners/enthusiasts in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, and Asia. One of the more important club meetings is held every year at the village of Hafling (Avelengo) in Italy.\nVintage Haflingers in good conditions are sought after by collectors and car enthusiasts and command high prices on the used car market.\nTrivia.\nHaflingers feature in the 1971 Doctor Who story Colony in Space, the location filming for which took place in a clay pit in Cornwall.\nSteyr subsequently designed and produced a much larger vehicle of very similar layout to the Haflinger, called the Pinzgauer, which is available in both 4x4 and 6x6 versions.\nThe name originates from a horse breed of the same name.\nSteyr Puch stood alone and had no input from the Daimler-Benz, i.e. Mercedes-Benz, until well after the production of Haflinger ceased.\nSteyr Puch was an important light motorcycle manufacturer.\nTheir expertise in 4WD attracted Mercedes-Benz and they built the first G Wagens (Gel\u00e4ndewagen) that were intended as an alternative to the military specification Land Rover. When Mercedes invested in Steyr Puch they started building both Puch and Mercedes badged vehicles.\nG Wagens serve in the French Army albeit with Peugeot engines. Under Australian Department of Defence project Land 121 Mercedes-Benz G-Class have been introduced into Australian Army service to replace the ageing Land Rover Perentie\nNote: The term 'G-Wagen' is only used in English-speaking parts of the world. It is originally called 'G-Klasse' ('G-Class'), similar to the C-, E-, M-, R-, and S-Klasse in MB's nomenclature.\nAlso the links with Fiat were maintained as Steyr Puch made all the 4WD kit for the Panda and may still do to this day.\nVariants.\nThe Haflinger changed very little during its years of production, but there are some notable changes and variants along the way:\nAustralian assembly.\nApproximately 800 Haflingers were assembled and sold in Australia from 1966.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67425", "revid": "50552848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67425", "title": "Battles of Saratoga", "text": "Part of the American Revolutionary War\nThe Battles of Saratoga, were fought September 19 and October 7, 1777 over the same ground by the American Continental Army and the British Army near Saratoga, New York during the American Revolutionary War. The ended with a decisive American victory, and the surrender of the British army there. The outcome greatly affected the course of the war, persuading France to enter the war as an American ally. In both battles, General John Burgoyne commanded the British forces, while General Horatio Gates oversaw the American force. Historian Edmund Morgan described Saratoga as \"a great turning point of the war\", because it won for Americans the foreign assistance from France, which was the last element needed for victory.\" \nThe British Army's campaign in New York was aimed at dividing New England from the middle and southern colonies. Burgoyne led an invasion army of 7,200 to 8,000 men southward from Canada through the Champlain Valley. Hoping to meet British forces marching northward from New York City and eastward from Lake Ontario, Burgoyne's goal was to take Albany, New York. The strategy began promisingly, but stalled due to logistical issues. British General William Howe never moved his forces north, and Brigadier General Barry St. Leger turned back his forces meant to arrive from the west, leaving Burgoyne surrounded by the Americans in upstate New York, short of his goal. Burgoyne fought two battles, which took place 18 days apart, on the same ground south of Saratoga, New York.\nIn the first battle, at on September 19, Burgoyne won a tactical victory over the Continental Army at the cost of heavy casualties. The battle began with Burgoyne's attempt to flank the entrenched American position on Bemis Heights with some of his troops. American Major General Benedict Arnold anticipated the maneuver and placed significant forces in his way. Still, Burgoyne was able to gain the field. Skirmishes continued in the following days while Burgoyne waited in the hope that reinforcements would arrive from New York City.\nMeanwhile, patriot militia forces continued to arrive, swelling the American ranks. Within the American camp, disputes led Gates to strip Arnold of his command. Once it became apparent that the British would not receive aid in time, Burgoyne attacked again in the on October 7 but lost both the battle and his earlier gains. Culminating in heavy fighting, this battle was marked by Arnold's spirited rallying of the American troops. Burgoyne's forces were thrown back to the positions they held before the action of September 19, and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.\nFollowing this loss, Burgoyne was compelled to retreat to Saratoga (now Schuylerville). Finding himself surrounded by a much larger force, he surrendered his entire army to General Gates on October 17. Although British General Sir Henry Clinton moved up from New York City, attempting to divert American attention by capturing Forts Clinton and Montgomery in the Hudson River highlands on October 6, and Kingston on October 13, these efforts were too late to save Burgoyne. News of the surrender at Saratoga was instrumental in formally creating the Franco-American Alliance, although France had already been clandestinely providing supplies, ammunition, and guns, notably the Valli\u00e8re cannon which played an important role in Saratoga.\nBackground.\nThe American Revolutionary War was approaching the two-year point, and the British changed their plans. They decided to split the Thirteen Colonies and isolate New England from what they believed to be the more Loyalist middle and southern colonies. The British command devised a plan to divide the colonies with a three-way pincer movement in 1777. The western pincer under the command of Barry St. Leger was to progress from Ontario through western New York, following the Mohawk River, and the southern pincer was to progress up the Hudson River valley from New York City. The northern pincer was to proceed southward from Montreal, and the three forces were to meet in the vicinity of Albany, New York, severing New England from the other colonies.\nBritish situation.\nBritish Lieutenant General John Burgoyne moved south from the province of Quebec in June 1777 to gain control of the upper Hudson River valley. His campaign had become bogged down in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga. Elements of the army had reached the upper Hudson as early as the end of July, but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward. One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger's expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.\nGeneral William Howe had taken his army from New York City by sea on a campaign to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne. Most of Burgoyne's Indian support had fled following the loss at Bennington, and his situation was becoming difficult. He needed to reach defensible winter quarters, requiring either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, and he decided to advance. He then deliberately cut communications to the north so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga, and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position. He ordered Baron Riedesel, who commanded the rear of the army, to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south, and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15.\nAmerican situation.\nThe Continental Army had been in a slow retreat since Burgoyne's capture of Ticonderoga early in July, under the command of Major General Philip Schuyler, and was encamped south of Stillwater, New York. On August 19, Major General Horatio Gates assumed command from Schuyler, whose political fortunes had fallen over the loss of Ticonderoga and the ensuing retreat. Gates and Schuyler were from very different backgrounds and did not get along with each other. They had previously argued over command issues in the army's Northern Department. The army was growing in size because of increased militia turnout following calls by state governors, the success at Bennington, and widespread outrage over the slaying of Jane McCrea, the fianc\u00e9e of a Loyalist in Burgoyne's army by Indians under Burgoyne's command. This massive outpouring of militia continued as the battle progressed (and Burgoyne had no way of obtaining reinforcements). This sealed Burgoyne's fate. By the end of the battle, Burgoyne's army totaled 5,791, and the effective colonial force was about 12,000 men.\nGeneral George Washington's strategic decisions also improved the situation for Gates' army. Washington was most concerned about the movements of General Howe. He was aware that Burgoyne was also moving, and he took some risks in July. He sent aid north in the form of Major General Benedict Arnold, his most aggressive field commander, and Major General Benjamin Lincoln, a Massachusetts man noted for his influence with the New England militia. He ordered 750 men from Israel Putnam's forces defending the New York highlands to join Gates' army in August, before he was certain that Howe had indeed sailed south. He also sent some of the best forces from his own army: Colonel Daniel Morgan and the newly formed Provisional Rifle Corps, which comprised about 500 specially selected riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, chosen for their sharpshooting ability. This unit came to be known as Morgan's Riflemen.\nOn September 7, Gates ordered his army to march north. A site was selected for its defensive potential that was known as Bemis Heights, just north of Stillwater and about south of Saratoga; the army spent about a week constructing defensive works designed by Polish engineer Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko. The heights had a clear view of the area and commanded the only road to Albany, where it passed through a defile between the heights and the Hudson River. To the west of the heights lay more heavily forested bluffs that would present a significant challenge to any heavily equipped army.\nFirst Saratoga: Battle of Freeman's Farm (September 19).\nPrelude.\nMoving very cautiously, since the departure of his Native American support had deprived him of reliable reports on the American position, Burgoyne advanced to the south after crossing the Hudson. On September 18, the vanguard of his army had finally reached a position just north of Saratoga, about from the American defensive line, and skirmishes occurred between American scouting parties and the leading elements of his army.\nThe American camp had become a bed of rising intrigue ever since Arnold's return from Fort Stanwix. While he and Gates had previously been on reasonably good terms in spite of their prickly egos, Arnold managed to turn Gates against him by taking on officers friendly to Schuyler as staff, dragging him into the ongoing feud between the two. These conditions had not yet reached a boil on September 19, but the day's events contributed to the situation. Gates had assigned the left wing of the defenses to Arnold, and assumed command himself of the right, which was nominally assigned to General Lincoln, whom Gates had detached in August with some troops to harass the British positions behind Burgoyne's army.\nBoth Burgoyne and Arnold understood the importance of the American left, and the need to control the heights there. After the morning fog lifted around 10 am, Burgoyne ordered the army to advance in three columns. Baron Riedesel led the left column, consisting of the German troops and the 47th Foot, on the river road, bringing the main artillery and guarding supplies and the boats on the river. General James Inglis Hamilton commanded the center column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd regiments, which would attack the heights, and General Simon Fraser led the right wing with the 24th Regiment and the light infantry and grenadier companies, to turn the American left flank by negotiating the heavily wooded high ground north and west of Bemis Heights.\nArnold also realized such a flanking maneuver was likely, and petitioned Gates for permission to move his forces from the heights to meet potential movements, where the American skill at woodlands combat would be at an advantage. Gates, whose preferred strategy was to sit and wait for the expected frontal assault, grudgingly permitted a reconnaissance in force consisting of Daniel Morgan's men and Henry Dearborn's light infantry. When Morgan's men reached an open field northwest of Bemis Heights belonging to Loyalist John Freeman, they spotted British advance troops in the field. Fraser's column was slightly delayed and had not yet reached the field, while Hamilton's column had also made its way across a ravine and was approaching the field from the east through dense forest and difficult terrain. Riedesel's force, while it was on the road, was delayed by obstacles thrown down by the Americans. The sound of gunfire to the west prompted Riedesel to send some of his artillery down a track in that direction. The troops Morgan's men saw were an advance company from Hamilton's column.\nBattle.\nMorgan placed marksmen at strategic positions, who then picked off virtually every officer in the advance company. Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that they were headed directly for Burgoyne's main army. While they succeeded in driving back the advance company, Fraser's leading edge arrived just in time to attack Morgan's left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who had ridden forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements. As the British company fell back toward the main column, the leading edge of that column opened fire, killing a number of their own men.\nThere was then a lull in the fighting around 1:00 pm as Hamilton's men began to form up on the north side of the field, and American reinforcements began to arrive from the south. Learning that Morgan was in trouble, Gates ordered out two more regiments (1st and 3rd New Hampshire) to support him, with additional regiments (2nd New York, 4th New York, the 1st Canadian, and Connecticut militia) from the brigade of Enoch Poor to follow. Burgoyne arrayed Hamilton's men with the 21st on the right, the 20th on the left, and the 62nd in the center, with the 9th held in reserve.\nThe battle then went through phases alternating between intense fighting and breaks in the action. Morgan's men had regrouped in the woods, and picked off officers and artillerymen. They were so effective at reducing the latter that the Americans several times gained brief control of British field pieces, only to lose them in the next British charge. At one point it was believed that Burgoyne himself had been taken down by a sharpshooter; it was instead one of Burgoyne's aides, riding a richly dressed horse, who was the victim. The center of the British line was very nearly broken at one point, and only the intervention of General Phillips, leading the 20th, made it possible for the 62nd to reform. In the memoir of Roger Lamb, a British soldier present at the battle, he wrote &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"In this battle an unusual number of officers fell, as our army abounded with young men of respectability at this time, who after several years of general peace anterior to the American revolution, were attracted to the profession of arms. Three subalterns of the 20th regiment on this occasion, the oldest of whom did not exceed the age of seventeen years, were buried together\"\nThe final stroke of the battle belonged to the British. Around 3 pm, Riedesel sent a messenger to Burgoyne for instructions. He returned two hours later with orders to guard the baggage train, but also to send as many men as he could spare toward the American right flank. In a calculated risk, Riedesel left 500 men to guard the vital supply train and marched off toward the action with the rest of his column. Two of his companies advanced on the double and opened vicious fire on the American right, and Fraser's force threatened to turn the American left flank. In response to the latter threat, Arnold requested more forces, and Gates allowed him to dispatch Ebenezer Learned's brigade (2nd, 8th and 9th Massachusetts). (If Arnold had been on the field, these forces might have instead faced the larger danger posed by Riedesel's force.) Fortunately for the American right, darkness set in, bringing an end to the battle. The Americans retreated back to their defenses, leaving the British on the field.\nBurgoyne had gained the field of battle, but suffered nearly 600 casualties. Most of these were to Hamilton's center column, where the 62nd was reduced to the size of a single company, and three quarters of the artillerymen were killed or wounded. American losses were nearly 300 killed and seriously wounded.\nIt has been widely recounted in histories of this battle that General Arnold was on the field, directing some of the action. However, John Luzader, a former park historian at the Saratoga National Historical Park, carefully documents the evolution of this story and believes it is without foundation in contemporary materials, and that Arnold remained at Gates' headquarters, receiving news and dispatching orders through messengers. Arnold biographer James Kirby Martin, however, disagrees with Luzader, arguing that Arnold played a more active role at Freeman's Farm by directing patriot troops into position and possibly leading some charges before being ordered back to headquarters by Gates.\nInterlude.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2026 an attack or even menace of an attack on Fort Montgomery must be of great use ...\nBurgoyne's council discussed whether to attack the next day, and a decision was reached to delay further action at least one day, to September 21. The army moved to consolidate the position closer to the American line while some men collected their dead. The attack on the 21st was called off when Burgoyne received a letter dated September 12 from Henry Clinton, who was commanding the British garrison in New York City. Clinton suggested that he could \"make a push at [Fort] Montgomery in about ten days.\" (Fort Montgomery was an American post on the Hudson River, in the New York Highlands south of West Point). If Clinton left New York on September 22, \"about ten days\" after he wrote the letter, he still could not hope to arrive in the vicinity of Saratoga before the end of the month. Burgoyne, running low on men and food, was still in a very difficult position, but he decided to wait in the hope that Clinton would arrive to save his army. Burgoyne wrote to Clinton on September 23, requesting some sort of assistance or diversion to draw Gates' army away. Clinton sailed from New York on October 3, and captured Forts Montgomery and Clinton on October 6. The furthest north any of his troops reached was Clermont, where they raided the estate of the prominent Patriot Livingston family on October 16.\nUnknown to either side at Saratoga, General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged an attack against the British position at Fort Ticonderoga. Lincoln had collected 2,000 men at Bennington by early September. Brown and a detachment of 500 men captured poorly defended positions between Ticonderoga and Lake George, and then spent several days ineffectually bombarding the fort. These men, and some of the prisoners they freed along the way, were back in the American camp by September 29.\nIn the American camp, the mutual resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally exploded into open hostility. Gates quickly reported the action of September 19 to the Congress and Governor George Clinton of New York, but he failed to mention Arnold at all. The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success. Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold's command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates sat in his tent. Arnold protested, and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command and giving it to Benjamin Lincoln. Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington's command, which Gates granted, but instead of leaving he remained in his tent. There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed by line officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp.\nDuring this period there were almost daily clashes between pickets and patrols of the two armies. Morgan's sharpshooters, familiar with the strategy and tactics of woodland warfare, constantly harassed British patrols on the western flank.\nAs September passed into October it became clear that Clinton was not coming to help Burgoyne, who put the army on short rations on October 3. The next day, Burgoyne called a war council in which several options were discussed, but no conclusive decisions were made. When the council resumed the next day, Riedesel proposed retreat, in which he was supported by Fraser. Burgoyne refused to consider it, insisting that retreat would be disgraceful. They finally agreed to conduct an assault on the American left flank with two thousand men, more than one-third of the army, on October 7. The army he was attacking, however, had grown in the interval. In addition to the return of Lincoln's detachment, militiamen and supplies continued to pour into the American camp, including critical increases in ammunition, which had been severely depleted in the first battle. The army Burgoyne faced on October 7 was more than 12,000 men strong and was led by a man who knew how much trouble Burgoyne was in. Gates had received consistent intelligence from the stream of deserters leaving the British lines and had also intercepted Clinton's response to Burgoyne's plea for help.\nSecond Saratoga: Battle of Bemis Heights (October 7).\nBritish foray.\nWhile Burgoyne's troop strength was nominally higher, he likely had only about 5,000 effective, battle-ready troops on October 7, as losses from the earlier battles in the campaign and desertions following the September 19 battle had reduced his forces. General Riedesel advised that the army retreat. Burgoyne decided to reconnoiter the American left flank to see if an attack was possible. As an escort, the generals took Fraser's Advanced Corps, with light troops and the 24th Foot on the right and the combined British grenadiers on the left, and a force drawn from all the German regiments in the army in the center. There were eight British cannon under Major Williams and two Hesse-Hanau cannon under Captain Pausch. Leaving their camp between 10 and 11 am, they advanced about three-quarters of a mile (1\u00a0km) to Barber's wheat field on a rise above Mill Brook, where they stopped to observe the American position. While the field afforded some room for artillery to work, the flanks were dangerously close to the surrounding woods.\nGates, following the removal of Arnold from the field command, assumed command of the American left and gave the right to General Lincoln. When American scouts brought news of Burgoyne's movement to Gates, he ordered Morgan's riflemen out to the far left, with Poor's men (1st, 2nd, and 3rd New Hampshire) on the left; the 2nd and 4th New York Regiments on the right, and Learned's 1st New York, 1st Canadian, 2nd, 8th and 9th Massachusetts Regiments, plus militia companies, in the center. A force of 1,200 New York militia under Brigadier General Abraham Ten Broeck was held in reserve behind Learned's line. In all, more than 8,000 Americans took the field that day, including about 1,400 men from Lincoln's command that were deployed when the action became particularly fierce.\nThe opening fire came between 2 and 2:30 pm from the British grenadiers. Poor's men held their fire, and the terrain made the British shooting largely ineffective. When Major Acland led the British grenadiers in a bayonet charge, the Americans finally began shooting at close range. Acland fell, shot in both legs, and many of the grenadiers also went down. Their column was a total rout, and Poor's men advanced to take Acland and Williams prisoner and capture their artillery. On the American left, things were also not going well for the British. Morgan's men swept aside the Canadians and Native Americans to engage Fraser's regulars. Although slightly outnumbered, Morgan managed to break up several British attempts to move west. While General Fraser was mortally wounded in this phase of the battle, according to Luzader a frequently told story claiming it to be the work of Timothy Murphy, one of Morgan's men, could be a 19th-century fabrication. The fall of Fraser and the arrival of Ten Broeck's large militia brigade (which roughly equaled the entire British reconnaissance force in size), broke the British will, and they began a disorganized retreat toward their entrenchments. Burgoyne was also very nearly killed by one of Morgan's marksmen; three shots hit his horse, hat, and waistcoat.\nThe first phase of the battle lasted about one hour and cost Burgoyne nearly 400 men, including the capture of most of the grenadiers' command, and six of the ten field pieces brought to the action.\nAmerican attack.\nAt this point, the Americans were joined by an unexpected participant. General Arnold, who was \"betraying great agitation and wrath\" in the American camp, and may have been drinking, rode out to join the action. Gates immediately sent Major Armstrong after him with orders to return; Armstrong did not catch up with Arnold until the action was effectively over. (A letter, written by a witness to proceedings in the camp, suggests that Arnold did in fact have authorization from Gates to engage in this action.)\nThe defenses on the right side of the British camp were anchored by two redoubts. The outermost one was defended by about 300 men under the command of the Hessian Heinrich von Breymann, while the other was under the command of Lord Balcarres. A small contingent of Canadians occupied the ground between these two fortifications. Most of the retreating force headed for Balcarres' position, as Breymann's was slightly north and further away from the early action.\nArnold led the American chase, and then led Poor's men in an attack on the Balcarres redoubt. Balcarres had set up his defenses well, and the redoubt was held, in action so fierce that Burgoyne afterwards wrote, \"A more determined perseverance than they showed \u2026 is not in any officer's experience\". Seeing that the advance was checked, and that Learned was preparing to attack the Breymann redoubt, Arnold moved toward that action, recklessly riding between the lines and remarkably emerging unhurt. He led the charge of Learned's men through the gap between the redoubts, which exposed the rear of Breymann's position, where Morgan's men had circled around from the far side. In furious battle, the redoubt was taken and Breymann was killed. Arnold's horse was hit in one of the final volleys, and Arnold's leg was broken by both shot and the falling horse. Major Armstrong finally caught up with Arnold to officially order him back to headquarters; he was carried back in a litter. Arnold wished that he was shot in the heart, knowing that if he died in the battle, he would have kept the fame as a heroic martyr.\nThe capture of Breymann's redoubt exposed the British camp, but darkness was setting in. An attempt by some Germans to retake the redoubt ended in capture as darkness fell and an unreliable guide led them to the American line.\nSurrender.\nBurgoyne had lost over 1,000 men in the two battles, leaving him outnumbered by roughly 3 to 1. American losses came to about 330 killed and wounded. Burgoyne had also lost several of his most effective leaders, his attempts to capture the American position had failed, and his forward line was now breached. After the second battle, Burgoyne lit fires at his remaining forward positions and withdrew under the cover of darkness. He withdrew his men 10\u201315 miles north, near present-day Schuylerville, New York. By the morning of October 8, he was back in the fortified positions he had held on September 16.\nOn October 13, with his army surrounded, Burgoyne held a council of war to propose terms of surrender. Riedesel suggested that they be paroled and allowed to march back to Canada without their weapons. Burgoyne felt that Gates would not even consider such terms, asking instead to be conveyed to Boston, where they would sail back to Europe. After several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the capitulation.\nOn October 17, Burgoyne surrendered his army to Gates. The British and German troops were accorded the traditional honors of war as they marched out to surrender. The troops formed the Convention Army, named after the convention that granted them safe passage back to Europe. However, the Continental Congress revoked the convention, and the Convention Army was kept in captivity until the end of the war.\nAftermath.\nBurgoyne's failed campaign marked a major turning point in the war. General Burgoyne returned to England and was never given another commanding position in the British Army. The British learned that the Americans would fight bravely and effectively. One British officer said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The courage and obstinacy with which the Americans fought were the astonishment of everyone, and we now became fully convinced that they are not that contemptible enemy we had hitherto imagined them, incapable of standing a regular engagement and that they would only fight behind strong and powerful works.\nIn recognition of his contribution to the battles at Saratoga, General Arnold had his seniority restored (he had lost it after being passed over for promotion earlier in 1777). However, Arnold's leg wound kept him in bed five months. Later, while still unfit for field service but serving as military governor of Philadelphia, Arnold entered into treasonous correspondence with the British. He received command of the fort at West Point and plotted to hand it over to the British, only to flee into the British lines when the capture of his contact John Andr\u00e9 led to the exposure of the plot. Arnold went on to serve under William Phillips, the commander of Burgoyne's right wing, in a 1781 expedition into Virginia.\nAlthough he left the direction of the battle to subordinates, General Gates received a great deal of credit as the commanding general for the greatest American victory of the war to date. He may have conspired with others to replace George Washington as the commander-in-chief. Instead, he received the command of the main American army in the South. He led it to a disastrous defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden, where he was at the forefront of a panicked retreat. Gates never commanded troops in the field thereafter.\nIn response to Burgoyne's surrender, Congress declared December 18, 1777, as a national day \"for solemn Thanksgiving and praise\"; it was the nation's first official observance of a holiday with that name.\nFrench aid.\nOnce news of Burgoyne's surrender reached France, King Louis XVI decided to enter into negotiations with the Americans that resulted in a formal Franco-American alliance and French entry into the war. This moved the conflict onto a global stage. As a consequence, Britain was forced to divert resources used to fight the war in North America to theaters in the West Indies and Europe, and rely on what turned out to be the chimera of Loyalist support in its North American operations. Having been defeated by the British in the French and Indian War more than a decade earlier, France found an opportunity to undercut British power and ultimately of revenge by aiding the colonists throughout the Revolutionary War. Prior to the Battle of Saratoga, France did not fully aid the colonists. However, after the Battles of Saratoga were conclusively won by the colonists, France realized that the Americans had the hope of winning the war, and began fully aiding the colonists by sending soldiers, donations, loans, military arms, and supplies.\nLegacy.\nThe battlefield and the site of Burgoyne's surrender have been preserved, and are now administered by the National Park Service as the Saratoga National Historical Park, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The park preserves a number of the buildings in the area and contains a variety of monuments. The Saratoga Monument obelisk has four niches, three of which hold statues of American commanders: Gates and Schuyler and of Colonel Daniel Morgan. The fourth niche, where Arnold's statue would go, is empty. A more dramatic memorial to Arnold's heroism, that does not name him, is the Boot Monument. Donated by Civil War General John Watts de Peyster, it shows a boot with spurs and the stars of a major general. It stands at the spot where Arnold was shot on October 7 charging Breymann's redoubt and is dedicated to \"the most brilliant soldier of the Continental Army\".\nFrom 1972 to 1977, at the request of the National Park Service, archeologist Dean R. Snow conducted field investigations and excavations in and around the battlefield site, and recovered various artifacts and two human skeletons. As of mid-2023, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 26 acres of the battlefield next to the national park.\nSix Army National Guard units (101st Eng Bn, 102nd Inf, 125th QM Co, 181st Inf, 182nd Inf and 192nd MP Bn) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Saratoga. There are now only thirty-two units in the U.S. Army with lineages that go back to the colonial era.\nThere are a number of ships named after the battles including USS \"Saratoga\" (1842), USS \"Saratoga\" (CV-3), and USS \"Saratoga\" (CV-60)\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nasso. Seagal and Keenen Ivory Wayans star as newly partnered Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detectives Jack Cole and Jim Campbell, whose first case together \u2013 the pursuit of a serial killer who murders entire families \u2013 reveals connections to Cole's mysterious past. Bob Gunton, Brian Cox, and Michelle Johnson also star.\nThe film was released in the United States on October 4, 1996, by Warner Bros. It received mostly negative reviews from film critics and grossed $41.8 million against a budget of $45 million.\nPlot.\nJack Cole was once a CIA operative known as \"the Glimmer Man\", because he could move so quickly and quietly through the jungle that his victims would only see a glimmer before they died. Having retired from the CIA, Cole \u2013 versed in Buddhism and unaccustomed to working with others \u2013 has become a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department.\nCole is partnered with Detective Jim Campbell, who has little patience for Cole's New Age philosophies and \"outsider\" attitude. Cole and Campbell must set aside their differences when they are assigned to track down a serial killer known as \"the Family Man\", named for his habit of killing entire households.\nThe Family Man's latest victims turn out to be Cole's ex-wife Ellen and her current husband Andrew Dunleavy. When Cole's fingerprints are found on Ellen's body, Campbell and he suspect that Smith \u2013 Jack's former superior in the CIA \u2013 may be connected with the killings. Cole contacts Smith, who (unbeknownst to Campbell and him) has been working with local crime boss Frank Deverell.\nCole and Campbell receive a tip that leads them to Christopher Maynard, who insists that the Family Man murders were actually committed by more than one killer. Only the slayings that occurred before Jack arrived in Los Angeles were Maynard's work; more recently, a second party has been massacring households and blaming it on Maynard, whom Cole is forced to shoot in self-defense.\nSeeking a lead on the \"other\" Family Man, Cole goes to the home of Sonya Roslov, Deverell's Russian translator and a recent victim of the serial killer. Jack finds out that the Roslovs had tickets to Russia, paid for by Deverell's company. The Family Man makes an unsuccessful attempt on the lives of both Cole and Campbell, blowing up the latter's apartment. The Family Man is revealed to work for both Deverell and Smith, who have murder contracts out on both of the detectives and also on Johnny, Deverell's own stepson.\nCole and Campbell question Johnny's girlfriend, Millie, who tells them where to find Johnny. The detectives trick and kill a hitman sent by Johnny's stepfather. Johnny informs Campbell and Cole that Donald Cunningham, Deverell's private security chief, is the other Family Man, whose killings were confused with Maynard's. Johnny also reveals Smith's partnership with Deverell.\nThe detectives confront Smith, who reveals that Deverell has been smuggling chemical weapons into the US from Russia and selling said arms to the Serbian underworld. Smith is arranging contacts for the deal, which is being cut by the Russian Liberation Fighters (the\" Organizatsiya\"). The sale has been scheduled to take place at a welfare hotel in downtown Los Angeles.\nWhen Cole and Campbell storm the hotel to disrupt the weapons deal, Cunningham kills Deverell (because Deverell set up Cunningham for the LAPD, to clear himself of the arms-running charges) and wounds Campbell. Cole fights Cunningham, finally throwing him through a window to be impaled on a wrought iron fence.\nCampbell jokes that Cole has brought him nothing but bad luck ever since they became partners. Cole says he will keep that in mind, as Campbell is driven off to the hospital.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally envisioned as a much larger action picture, the film was similar in scope to \"The Last Boy Scout\" (1991), which starred Wayans' brother Damon Wayans. Several action scenes were removed to cut down the budget, including the bombing of a boat owned by Campbell (who lived on a houseboat instead of an apartment), an encounter between Cole and a SWAT team, who have raided his house, and the final confrontation/gunfight at a museum.\nRoland Joff\u00e9 was originally considered to direct the picture.\nBrian Cox's character Mr. Smith was originally intended for Steven Seagal's \"Under Siege\" co-star Tommy Lee Jones, and he was attached to the film before leaving shortly before filming began. Cox replaced him on very short notice.\nFilming and post-production.\nThe film was shot on location in and around Los Angeles. After the filming was completed, Warner Bros. conducted additional editing to make it faster and appear more like previous Steven Seagal movies. Cut scenes included several comedic and dramatic exchanges between Campbell and Cole, as well as several scenes of Cole's wife Jessica, played by Michelle Johnson.\nAccording to Stephen Tobolowsky, Seagal wanted to change the scene in which Cole kills Maynard. Due to his spiritual beliefs, Seagal did not want to kill villains in his movies anymore. Tobolowsky convinced Seagal that Maynard was a deeply unhappy person and killing him would allow for reincarnation and redemption. Seagal agreed and the scene was filmed as written. Months later, however, Seagal wanted to change the scene to show that Maynard survived the shooting. Tobolowsky was brought in to overdub lines to indicate that Maynard was still alive, though this was not used in the final cut.\nMusic.\nSeagal wrote two original songs for the film, \"Bulletproof\" and \"Snake\", performed by the Jeff Healey Band and Taj Mahal, respectively. Guitarist Trevor Rabin, formerly of Yes, composed the score, his first as a film music composer.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film debuted at number two at the box office behind \"The First Wives Club\", but despite this, the film was an overall box-office flop, grossing only $20,351,264 in the United States and Canada and $41.8 million worldwide, against an estimated production budget of $45 million.\nCritical response.\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from film critics. Lawrence Van Gelder, writing for \"The New York Times\", did not like the film. He wrote, Short on suspense, routine in its action, and monotonous in its performances, this movie opened yesterday without [the] benefit of press screenings, usually a sign that the distributors have detected cinematic \"rigor mortis\" before audiences formally withdraw such life-support systems as tickets, popcorn, and the glucose drip of spilled Coke.\nLeonard Klady of \"Variety\" gave the film a negative review, commenting, \"For a rock'em, sock'em action thriller, \"The Glimmer Man\" is a hopelessly slow-moving, slow-witted, shaggy-dog tale that delivers the jolts, but lacks the juice necessary for high-voltage entertainment.\"\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 11% based on 27 reviews with the consensus: \"A grimy, humorless glimpse of Steven Seagal's direct-to-video future, \"The Glimmer Man\" fails to shine.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 33% based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67428", "revid": "37005538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67428", "title": "Titan (rocket family)", "text": "Family of launch vehicles used in U.S. Air Force and space programs (1959\u20132005)\nTitan was a family of American intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and medium- and heavy-lift expendable launch vehicles used between 1959 and 2005. The Titan I and Titan II served as part of the United States Air Force's ICBM arsenal until 1987, while later variants were adapted for space launch purposes. Titan launch vehicles were used for 368 missions in total, including all Project Gemini crewed flights in the mid-1960s, as well as numerous U.S. military, civilian, and scientific payloads\u2014ranging from reconnaissance satellites to space probes sent throughout the Solar System.\nTitan I missile.\nThe HGM-25A Titan I, built by the Martin Company, was the first version of the Titan family of rockets. It began as a backup ICBM project in case the SM-65 Atlas was delayed. It was a two-stage rocket operational from early 1962 to mid-1965 whose LR-87 booster engine was powered by RP-1 (kerosene) and liquid oxygen (LOX). The ground guidance for the Titan was the UNIVAC ATHENA computer, designed by Seymour Cray, based in a hardened underground bunker. Using radar data, it made course corrections during the burn phase.\nUnlike decommissioned Thor, Atlas, and Titan II missiles, the Titan I inventory was scrapped and never reused for space launches or RV tests, as all support infrastructure for the missile had been converted to the Titan II/III family by 1965.\nTitan II.\nThe Titan II family consists of the Titan II ICBM and two later versions adapted for space launches, the Titan II GLV and the Titan 23G.\nTitan II missile.\nMost of the Titan rockets were the Titan II ICBM and their civilian derivatives for NASA. The Titan II used the LR-87-5 engine, a modified version of the LR-87, that used a hypergolic propellant combination of nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) for its oxidizer and Aerozine 50 (a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) instead of the liquid oxygen and RP-1 propellant of the Titan I.\nThe first Titan II guidance system was built by AC Spark Plug. It used an inertial measurement unit made by AC Spark Plug derived from original designs from the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT. The missile guidance computer (MGC) was the IBM ASC-15. When spares for this system became hard to obtain, it was replaced by a more modern guidance system, the Delco Electronics Universal Space Guidance System (USGS). The USGS used a Carousel IV IMU and a Magic 352 computer. The USGS was already in use on the Titan III space launcher when work began in March 1978 to replace the Titan II guidance system. The main reason was to reduce the cost of maintenance by $72 million per year; the conversions were completed in 1981.\nHypergolic propellants.\nLiquid oxygen is dangerous to use in an enclosed space, such as a missile silo, and cannot be stored for long periods in the booster oxidizer tank. Several Atlas and Titan I rockets exploded and destroyed their silos, although without loss of life. The Martin Company was able to improve the design with the Titan II. The RP-1/LOX combination was replaced by a room-temperature fuel whose oxidizer did not require cryogenic storage. The same first-stage rocket engine was used with some modifications. The diameter of the second stage was increased to match the first stage. The Titan II's hypergolic fuel and oxidizer ignited on contact, but they were highly toxic and corrosive liquids. The fuel was Aerozine 50, a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and UDMH, and the oxidizer was NTO.\nAccidents at silos.\nThere were several accidents in Titan II silos resulting in loss of life and/or serious injuries.\nIn August 1965, 53 construction workers were killed in fire in a missile silo northwest of Searcy, Arkansas. The fire started when hydraulic fluid used in the Titan II was ignited by a welding torch.\nThe liquid fuel missiles were prone to developing leaks of their toxic propellants. At a silo outside Rock, Kansas, an oxidizer transfer line carrying NTO ruptured on August 24, 1978. An ensuing orange vapor cloud forced 200 rural residents to evacuate the area. A staff sergeant of the maintenance crew was killed while attempting a rescue and a total of twenty were hospitalized.\nAnother site at Potwin, Kansas leaked NTO oxidizer in April 1980 with no fatalities, and was later closed.\nIn September 1980, at Titan II silo 374-7 near Damascus, Arkansas, a technician dropped an socket that fell , bounced off a thrust mount, and broke the skin of the missile's first stage, over eight hours prior to an eventual explosion. The puncture occurred about 6:30\u00a0p.m. and when a leak was detected shortly after, the silo was flooded with water and civilian authorities were advised to evacuate the area. As the problem was being attended to at around 3 a.m., leaking rocket fuel ignited and blew the nuclear warhead out of the silo. It landed harmlessly several hundred feet away. There was one fatality and 21 were injured, all from the emergency response team from Little Rock AFB. The explosion blew the 740-ton launch tube cover into the air and left a crater in diameter.\nMissile retirement.\nThe 54 Titan IIs in Arizona, Arkansas, and Kansas were replaced by 50 MX \"Peacekeeper\" solid-fuel rocket missiles in the mid-1980s; the last Titan II silo was deactivated in May 1987. The 54 Titan IIs had been fielded along with a thousand Minuteman missiles from the mid-1960s through the mid-1980s.\nA number of Titan I and Titan II missiles have been distributed as museum displays across the United States.\nTitan II launch vehicle.\nThe most famous use of the civilian Titan II was in the NASA Gemini program of crewed space capsules in the mid-1960s. Twelve Titan II GLVs were used for Project Gemini. Two flights were uncrewed and the remaining ten carried two-person crews. All of the launches were successful.\nTitan 23G.\nStarting in the late 1980s, some of the deactivated Titan IIs were converted into space launch vehicles to be used for launching U.S. Government payloads. \nTitan 23G rockets consisted of two stages burning liquid propellant. The first stage was powered by one Aerojet LR87 engine with two combustion chambers and nozzles, and the second stage was propelled by an LR91. On some flights, the spacecraft included a kick motor, usually the Star-37XFP-ISS; however, the Star-37S was also used.\nThirteen were launched from Space Launch Complex 4W (SLC-4W) at Vandenberg Air Force Base starting in 1988. The final such vehicle launched a Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) weather satellite on 18 October 2003.\nTitan III.\nThe Titan III was a modified Titan II with optional solid rocket boosters. It was developed on behalf of the United States Air Force (USAF) as a heavy-lift satellite launcher to be used mainly to launch American military payloads and civilian intelligence agency satellites such as the Vela Hotel nuclear-test-ban monitoring satellites, observation and reconnaissance satellites (for intelligence-gathering), and various series of defense communications satellites. As USAF project, Titan III was more formally known as Program 624A (SSLS), Standard Space Launch System, Standardized Space Launch System, Standardized Space Launching System or Standard Space Launching System (all abbreviated SSLS).\nThe Titan III core was similar to the Titan II, but had a few differences. These included:\nThe Titan III family used the same basic LR-87 engines as Titan II (with performance enhancements over the years), however SRB-equipped variants had a heat shield over them as protection from the SRB exhaust and the engines were modified for air-starting.\nAvionics.\nThe first guidance system for the Titan III used the AC Spark Plug company IMU (inertial measurement unit) and an IBM ASC-15 guidance computer from the Titan II. For the Titan III, the ASC-15 drum memory of the computer was lengthened to add 20 more usable tracks, which increased its memory capacity by 35%.\nThe more-advanced Titan IIIC used a Delco Carousel VB IMU and MAGIC 352 Missile Guidance Computer (MGC).\nTitan IIIA.\nThe Titan IIIA was a prototype rocket booster and consisted of a standard Titan II rocket with a Transtage upper stage.\nTitan IIIB.\nThe Titan IIIB with its different versions (23B, 24B, 33B, and 34B) had the Titan III core booster with an Agena D upper stage. This combination was used to launch the KH-8 GAMBIT series of intelligence-gathering satellites. They were all launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, due south over the Pacific into polar orbits. Their maximum payload mass was about 7,500\u00a0lb (3,000\u00a0kg).\nTitan IIIC.\nThe powerful Titan IIIC used a Titan III core rocket with two large strap-on solid-fuel boosters to increase its launch thrust and maximum payload mass. The solid-fuel boosters that were developed for the Titan IIIC represented a significant engineering advance over previous solid-fueled rockets, due to their large size and thrust, and their advanced thrust-vector control systems.\nTitan IIID.\nThe Titan IIID was the Vandenberg Air Force Base version of the Titan IIIC, without a Transtage, that was used to place members of the Key Hole series of reconnaissance satellites into polar low Earth orbits.\nTitan IIIE.\nThe Titan IIIE, with a high-specific-impulse Centaur upper stage, was used to launch several scientific spacecraft, including both of NASA's two Voyager space probes to Jupiter, Saturn and beyond, and both of the two Viking missions to place two orbiters around Mars and two instrumented landers on its surface.\nTitan 34D.\nThe Titan 34D featured Stage 1 and Stage 2 stretched with more powerful UA1206 solid motors. A variety of upper stages were available, including the Inertial Upper Stage, the Transfer Orbit Stage, and the Transtage. The Titan 34D made its maiden flight on 30 October 1982 with two DSCS defense communications satellites for the United States Department of Defense (DOD).\nCommercial Titan III.\nDerived from the Titan 34D and originally proposed as a medium-lift expendable launch system for the US Air Force, who selected the Delta II instead. Development was continued as a commercial launch system, and the first rocket flew in 1990. The Commercial Titan III differed from the Titan 34D in that it had a stretched second stage, and a larger payload fairing to accommodate dual satellite payloads.\nTitan IIIM.\nThe Titan IIIM was intended to launch the Manned Orbiting Laboratory and other payloads. Development was cancelled in 1969. The projected UA1207 solid booster rockets were eventually used on the Titan IV, while the extended core was used in the 3B and 34B variants of the Titan IIIB.\nTitan IV.\nThe Titan IV was an extended length Titan III with solid rocket boosters on its sides. The Titan IV could be launched with a Centaur upper stage, the USAF Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), or no upper stage at all. This rocket was used almost exclusively to launch US military or Central Intelligence Agency payloads. However, it was also used for a purely scientific purpose to launch the NASA\u2013ESA Cassini / Huygens space probe to Saturn in 1997. The primary intelligence agency that needed the Titan IV's launch capabilities was the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).\nWhen it was being produced, the Titan IV was the most powerful uncrewed rocket available to the United States, with proportionally high manufacturing and operations expenses. By the time the Titan IV became operational, the requirements of the Department of Defense and the NRO for launching satellites had tapered off due to improvements in the longevity of reconnaissance satellites and the declining demand for reconnaissance that followed the internal disintegration of the Soviet Union. As a result of these events and improvements in technology, the unit cost of a Titan IV launch was very high. Additional expenses were generated by the ground operations and facilities for the Titan IV at Vandenberg Air Force Base for launching satellites into polar orbits. Titan IVs were also launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, a location often used for launch into non-polar orbits.\nTitan V concept.\nThe Titan V was a proposed development of the Titan IV, that saw several designs being suggested. One Titan V proposal was for an enlarged Titan IV, capable of lifting up to of payload. Another used a cryogenic first stage with LOX/LH2 propellants; however the Atlas V EELV was selected for production instead.\nLaunch vehicle retirement.\nMost of the decommissioned Titan II ICBMs were refurbished and used for Air Force space launch vehicles, with a perfect launch success record.\nFor orbital launches, there were strong advantages to using higher-performance liquid hydrogen or RP-1 fueled vehicles with liquid oxygen; the high cost of using hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, along with the special care that was needed due to their toxicity, were a further consideration. Lockheed Martin decided to extend its Atlas family of rockets instead of its more expensive Titans, along with participating in joint-ventures to sell launches on the Russian Proton rocket and the new Boeing-built Delta IV class of medium and heavy-lift launch vehicles. The Titan IVB was the last Titan rocket to remain in service, making its penultimate launch from Cape Canaveral on 30 April 2005, followed by its final launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 19 October 2005, carrying the USA-186 optical imaging satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67430", "revid": "51044009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67430", "title": "Nymphaeaceae", "text": "Family of plants\nNymphaeaceae () is a family of flowering plants, commonly called water lilies. They live as rhizomatous aquatic herbs in temperate and tropical climates around the world. The family contains five genera with about 70 known species. Water lilies are rooted in soil in bodies of water, with leaves and flowers floating on or rising from the surface. Leaves are oval and heart-shaped in \"Barclaya\". Leaves are round, with a radial notch in \"Nymphaea\" and \"Nuphar\", but fully circular in \"Victoria\" and \"Euryale\".\nWater lilies are a well-studied family of plants because their large flowers with multiple unspecialized parts were initially considered to represent the floral pattern of the earliest flowering plants. Later genetic studies confirmed their evolutionary position as basal angiosperms. Analyses of floral morphology and molecular characteristics and comparisons with a sister taxon, the family Cabombaceae, indicate, however, that the flowers of extant water lilies with the most floral parts are more derived than the genera with fewer floral parts. Genera with more floral parts, \"Nuphar\", \"Nymphaea\", \"Victoria\", have a beetle pollination syndrome, while genera with fewer parts are pollinated by flies or bees, or are self- or wind-pollinated. Thus, the large number of relatively unspecialized floral organs in the Nymphaeaceae is not an ancestral condition for the clade.\nDescription.\nVegetative characteristics.\nThe Nymphaeaceae are annual or perennial, aquatic, rhizomatous herbs. The family is further characterized by scattered vascular bundles in the stems, and frequent presence of latex, usually with distinct, stellate-branched sclereids projecting into the air canals. Hairs are simple, usually producing mucilage (slime).\nLeaves are alternate and spiral, opposite or occasionally whorled, simple, peltate or nearly so, entire to toothed or dissected, short to long petiolate, with blade submerged, floating or emergent, with palmate to pinnate venation. Stipules are either present or absent.\nGenerative characteristics.\nFlowers are solitary, bisexual, radial, with a long pedicel and usually floating or raised above the surface of the water, with girdling vascular bundles in receptacle. Some species are protogynous and primarily cross-pollinated, but because male and female stages overlap during the second day of flowering, and because it is self-compatible, self-fertilization is possible. Female and male parts of the flower are usually active at different times, to facilitate cross-pollination, although this is just one of several reproductive strategies used by these plants.\nThere are 4\u201312 sepals, which are distinct to connate, imbricate, and often petallike. Petals lacking or 8 to numerous, inconspicuous to showy, often intergrading with stamens. Stamens are 3 to numerous, the innermost sometimes represented by staminodes. Filaments are distinct, free or adnate to petaloid staminodes, slender and well differentiated from anthers to laminar and poorly differentiated from anthers; pollen grains usually monosulcate or lacking apertures. Carpels are 3 to numerous, distinct or connate.\nThe fruit is an aggregate of nuts, a berry, or an irregularly dehiscent fleshy spongy capsule. Seeds are often arillate, more or less lacking endosperm.\nTaxonomy.\nNymphaeaceae has been investigated systematically for decades because botanists considered their floral morphology to represent one of the earliest groups of angiosperms. Modern genetic analyses by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group researchers has confirmed its basal position among flowering plants. In addition, the Nymphaeaceae are more genetically diverse and geographically dispersed than other basal angiosperms. Nymphaeaceae is placed in the order Nymphaeales, which is the second diverging group of angiosperms after \"Amborella\" in the most widely accepted flowering plant classification system, APG IV system.\nNymphaeaceae is a small family of three to six genera: \"Barclaya\", \"Euryale\", \"Nuphar\", \"Nymphaea\", \"Ondinea\", and \"Victoria\". The genus \"Barclaya\" is sometimes given rank as its own family, Barclayaceae, on the basis of an extended perianth tube (combined sepals and petals) arising from the top of the ovary and by stamens that are joined in the base. However, molecular phylogenetic work includes it in Nymphaeaceae. The genus \"Ondinea\" has recently been shown to be a morphologically aberrant species of \"Nymphaea\", and is now included in this genus. The genera \"Euryale\", of far east Asia, and \"Victoria\", from South America, are closely related despite their geographic distance, but their relationship toward \"Nymphaea\" need further studies.\nThe sacred lotus was once thought to be a water lily, but is now recognized to be a highly modified eudicot in its own family Nelumbonaceae of the order Proteales.\nFossils.\nSeveral fossil species are known, including Cretaceous representatives of \"Nymphaea\", as well as fossil genera such as \"Jaguariba\" from the Cretaceous of Brazil, \"Allenbya\" from the Ypresian of British Columbia, \"Notonuphar\" from the Eocene of Antarctica, \"Nuphaea\" from the Eocene of Germany, \"Susiea\" from the Late Paleocene Almont Flora of North Dakota, USA, and \"Barclayopsis\" from the Maastrichtian of Eisleben, Germany.\nInvasiveness.\nThe beautiful nature of water lilies has led to their widespread use as ornamental plants. The Mexican waterlily, native to the Gulf Coast of North America, is planted throughout the continent. It has escaped from cultivation and become invasive in some areas, such as California's San Joaquin Valley. It can infest slow-moving bodies of water and is difficult to eradicate. Populations can be controlled by cutting top growth. Herbicides can also be used to control populations using glyphosate and fluridone.\nCulture.\nThe water lily is the national flower of Bangladesh, Iran, and Sri Lanka. The Emblem of Bangladesh contains a lily floating on water. It is also the birth flower for the month of July.\nThe Nymphaeaceae, which is also called (Nilufar Abi in Persian), can be seen in many reliefs of the Achaemenid period (552 BC) such as the statue of Anahita in the Persepolis. Lotus flower was included in Kaveh the blacksmith's Derafsh and later as the flag of the Sasanian Empire Derafsh Kaviani. Today, it is known as the symbol of Iranians Solar Hijri Calendar.\nLily pads, also known as \"Seebl\u00e4tter\", are a charge in Northern European heraldry, often coloured red (gules), and appear on the flag of Friesland and the coat of arms of Denmark (in the latter case often replaced by red hearts).\nThe water lily has a special place in Sangam literature and Tamil poetics, where it is considered symbolic of the grief of separation; it is considered to evoke imagery of the sunset, the seashore, and the shark.\nIn visual arts.\nWater lilies were depicted by the French artist Claude Monet (1840\u20131926) in a series of paintings.\nThe Maya.\nThe main job of the Maya rulers during pre-Columbian Mesoamerica was to obtain clean and drinkable water for their citizens during both the wet and dry seasons. Their success in accomplishing this is what allowed them to grow their polity by attracting dry-season laborers. They did this by constructing water systems such as reservoirs, wetland reclamation, and dams and channels to capture and store rainwater. With their knowledge of the wetland biosphere, they transformed artificial reservoirs into wetland biospheres. One way that they tested whether the water systems were working properly was if the Nymphaeaceae were thriving. Water lilies became a visual sign of water cleanliness, so the Maya elite began to associate themselves with the flowers. \nThe Maya began to use water lily iconography depicted on stelae, monumental architecture, murals, and in hieroglyphic writing. Even in Maya settlements like Palenque, where the main water supplies were springs and flowing streams (places where water lilies cannot grow), the flowers were prevalent in their iconographic records. Aristocrats and religious figures wore masks and/or headdresses during celebratory events that had water lilies and/or water lily symbols to appear like gods. There is also evidence that water lilies were used as cultural entheogenic. Some interpretations of ritual scenes drawn out by the Maya have been blood being extracted from perforated body parts. However, more close examinations show that this is instead a liquid flowing directly from water lily flowers that were on the heads of certain gods. It is likely that the Maya ingested these plants to create a non-ordinary state of consciousness, which makes sense because there is a class of opiate alkaloids in Nymphaeaceae. Overall, these examples show just how important this specific form of water symbolism was throughout the Maya region.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars Steven Seagal (who also co-produced the film) as Jack Taggert, an EPA agent who investigates a Kentucky mine and helps locals stand up for their rights, and also includes cameos by country music performers Randy Travis, Mark Collie, Ed Bruce, Marty Stuart and Travis Tritt as well as country-rocker and the Band member Levon Helm, along with Kris Kristofferson appearing in a supporting role. The film was released in the United States on September 5, 1997, to critical and commercial failure.\nPlot.\nIn the peaceful Appalachian hills of eastern Kentucky, toxins are being dumped into abandoned mines, causing environmental havoc, but the locals, mindful of their jobs and the power of the mine owners, can do nothing. EPA CID agent Jack Taggert is sent to investigate, after a fellow agent, revealed to be Jack's friend and partner, Frank Elkins, is found dead, probably not by accident. The EPA has received an anonymous letter from Jackson, Kentucky, and Taggert goes undercover to continue his colleague's investigations.\nHanner Coal Company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr., is found to be getting paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft, so Jack is assigned to go to the small town of Jackson, where his cover is that of assistant and volunteer carpenter to a local church. He stays in a room in the church's basement and begins his cover work by repairing the roof at a house where Walter, one of the children, is sick because of the pollution. He attempts to question the family, but they have little to say. He fares the same elsewhere; even Cotton, the man who tipped off the EPA, is decidedly taciturn. While testing the water, Taggert wanders into a marijuana field and is accosted by the growers. After disarming them, he tells them that he has no interest in arresting them.\nThe men responsible for Agent Elkins' death soon notice Taggert's presence. As a newcomer to the small community, he is threatened by Hanner's son Orin Jr., the incompetent local tool of the company, corrupt Sheriff Lloyd Foley and several thugs that work for them. The thugs in question start by leaving two rattlesnakes in his dwelling; Taggert responds by capturing the snakes alive and leaving them in the pickup that the thugs were driving, causing them to crash. Soon after, five of them attack him while he is buying supplies and receive a severe beating as a result. Orin then orders one of his truck drivers to arrange an \"accident\" by running him off the road, but Taggert escapes alive while the driver is killed after falling off an open-pit mine cliff.\nWhile these conflicts occur, Taggert strikes up a relationship with Sarah Kellogg, a young woman who lives in the town. She is considered an outcast because of her father's murder, a crime of which she was accused but not convicted. Eventually, she agrees to testify against Orin and his people, much to the anger of her estranged brother Earl, who committed the murder, after their father found out about his sexual abuse against her. Working as one of Hanner's thugs, Earl sets the church on fire, in the process killing Reverend Bob Goodall, the preacher who was helping Taggert. He then attempts to collapse the mine with Taggert inside it. Taggert escapes, while several mercenaries are killed, including Earl.\nWith evidence and a witness, Taggert calls the FBI to take Sarah into protective custody. However, they are revealed to be corrupt and a firefight ensues. Taggert kills one agent, then sends the second back to Orin with a message that he will be coming for him next. However, when Orin is arrested and charged, he gets off with a slap on the wrist for the environmental violations. Taggert goes back into the town and fights his way past the last of Orin Jr.'s thugs, then demands the truth from him. Orin Jr. agrees to turn the state's evidence, implicating his father on racketeering, conspiracy, and murder charges. Taggert goes to a casino to arrest Orin. Upon hearing about the reception awaiting him in federal prison, Orin produces a gun and resists, but Taggert shoots him in the shoulder and he is taken into custody. Taggert then returns to Jackson, where he is reunited with Sarah.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*Steven Seagal as EPA Agent Jack Taggert\n \nProduction.\nThe film was shot on location in and around Kentucky; parts of the \"truck chase scene\" were shot at Natural Bridge State Resort Park. Some of the opening scenes were filmed at Cumberland Falls State Resort Park. The cave scenes were filmed in the Great Saltpetre Cave. This was the third, and final time that Kane Hodder worked with Steven Seagal as a stuntman.\nSeagal liked the film in part because it was \"kind of an environmental movie.\" He also enjoyed working with Marg Helgenberger. \"While I don't think she's a physical, spectacular, drop dead gorgeous woman, at the same time she's a spectacular actress,\" said Seagal. \"Her performance was wonderful.\"\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Fire Down Below\" was released on September 5, 1997. It grossed $6 million on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada and went on to gross $16.2 million plus $8.3 million internationally for a worldwide total of $24.5 million.\nCritical response.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on reviews from 13 critics.\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.\nAccolades.\nThe film was nominated for four Golden Raspberry Awards at the 18th Golden Raspberry Awards:\nSeagal was also nominated for Worst Actor at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to Tom Arnold for \"McHale's Navy\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67435", "revid": "11042835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67435", "title": "Second Triumvirate", "text": "Roman political entity (43\u201332 BC)\nThe Second Triumvirate was an extraordinary commission and magistracy created at the end of the Roman republic for Mark Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian to give them practically absolute power. It was formally constituted by law on 27 November 43\u00a0BC with a term of five years; it was renewed in 37\u00a0BC for another five years before expiring in 32\u00a0BC. Constituted by the \"lex Titia\", the triumvirs were given broad powers to make or repeal legislation, issue judicial punishments without due process or right of appeal, and appoint all other magistrates. The triumvirs also split the Roman world into three sets of provinces.\nThe triumvirate, formed in the aftermath of a conflict between Antony and the senate, emerged as a force to reassert Caesarian control over the western provinces and wage war on the \"liberatores\" led by the men who assassinated Julius Caesar. After proscriptions, purging the senatorial and equestrian orders, and a brutal civil war, the \"liberatores\" were defeated at the Battle of Philippi. After Philippi, Antony and Octavian took the east and west, respectively, with Lepidus confined to Africa. The last remaining opposition to the Triumvirs came from Sextus Pompey, a son of Pompey the Great, who controlled Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia.\nOctavian and Antony were pushed to cooperation, in part by their soldiers, and the triumvirs had their legal arrangement renewed for another five years in 37\u00a0BC. Eventually, after Antony's defeat in Parthia and Octavian's victory over Sextus Pompey, Octavian forced Lepidus from the triumvirate in 36\u00a0BC. Relations between the two remaining triumvirs broke down in the late 30s\u00a0BC before they fought a final war, from which Octavian emerged the victor.\nName.\nThe name \"Second Triumvirate\" is a modern misnomer derived from the branding of the political alliance between Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar (created c.\u200959\u00a0BC) as the \"First\" Triumvirate. This nomenclature was unknown during and before the Renaissance and was first attested in the late 17th century, coming into widespread use only in the following century. Recent books have started to avoid the traditional nomenclature of \"First\" and \"Second\" Triumvirates. The \"Oxford Classical Dictionary\", for example, warns \"'First' and 'Second Triumvirate' are modern and misleading terms\".\nTriumviral period.\nFollowing the assassination of Julius Caesar on 15 March 44\u00a0BC, there was initially a settlement reached between the perpetrators, who styled themselves \"liberatores\", and remaining Caesarian supporters. This settlement included an amnesty for the tyrannicides, confirmation of Caesar's official actions, and abolition of the dictatorship. By late spring 44\u00a0BC, the provinces assigned by Caesar before his death \u2013 many to his later killers \u2013 were largely confirmed.\nMark Antony was one of the consuls for 44\u00a0BC and on 2 June 44\u00a0BC, was able to push through illegal legislation assigning to himself the provinces of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul, displacing their existing governors. These governorships secured for Antony a political future where he would be able to intimidate the senate and Italy from across the river Rubicon. Antony also persuaded the senate to disarm Marcus Brutus and Cassius (the two leading tyrannicides) giving them grain supply assignments; both men viewed these assignments as insults, later compounded by their assignment to minor provinces after their praetorships.\nRelations between Antony and Caesar's legal heir, Octavian, also started to break down: Octavian was successful in attracting some of Caesar's veterans from Antony's camp, undercutting Antony's military support. Antony also sought later in the year to isolate Cicero politically, as the eloquent ex-consul was prestigious and on friendly terms with large portions of the aristocracy. Octavian, starting a bidding war for extreme Caesarians, broke with Antony and formed for himself a private army. In December 44\u00a0BC, Cicero induced the senate to honour Octavian's efforts and to support the existing governors of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul in retaining their provinces against Antony. The senate's forces, led by the two consuls and Octavian, put Antony to flight at the Battle of Mutina on 21 April 43\u00a0BC. After news of the victory, Cicero had the senate declare Antony a public enemy. But with both consuls dead, Octavian moved against the senate \u2013 both sides knew they were only using the other \u2013 and marched south to secure for himself the consulships opened by their deaths.\nCreation, 43\u00a0BC.\nAfter Octavian and his forces reached Rome on 19 August 43\u00a0BC, he secured for himself election to the consulship with his cousin Quintus Pedius. They moved quickly to enact legislation confirming Octavian's adoption as Caesar's heir and establishing courts to condemn Caesar's assassins \"in absentia\". They also repealed the declaration of Antony as a public enemy. Octavian then moved north to treat with Antony under Lepidus' protection. With the Caesarian soldiers' urging, Octavian and Antony reconciled; Octavian also would marry Antony's step-daughter Clodia. The three men then established themselves as the \"triumviri rei publicae constituendae\" (the latter words indicate a \"causa\" or commission for the reconstitution of the republic) for five years. This was confirmed by the \"lex Titia\", proposed by a friendly tribune at their request.\nThe law was modelled on the \"lex Valeria\" in 82\u00a0BC which established Sulla's dictatorship. They received power to issue legally binding edicts, were granted \"imperium maius\" which permitted them to overrule the ordinary provincial governors and to take credit for their victories, and to act (without right of appeal). They also received powers to call the senate and directly appoint magistrates and provincial governors. The legal powers given, exceeding those of the ordinary consuls, were noted on the Capitoline Fasti, which list the triumvirs above the consuls.\nOctavian and Antony then prepared to wage war on the \"liberatores\" with forty total legions. They also divided the western Roman world:\nThe triumvirs' powers were initially set to lapse on 31 December 38\u00a0BC, though the legal powers may have been retained (after their later renewal in 38\u00a0BC) all the way until 27\u00a0BC when Octavian abdicated his magistracy.\nProscriptions.\nThe three men issued a declaration which \u2013 according to Appian \u2013 declared Caesar's \"clementia\" to have been a failure; it was appended with a death list. The number of persons proscribed differs considerably between ancient sources and need not reflect the number \"proscribed\", but rather, simply swept up in the killings. Plutarch in three different lives \u2013 \"Brutus\" (27.6), \"Cicero\" (46.2), and \"Antony\" (20.2) \u2013 gives figures of 200, a bit more than 200, and 300 men, respectively. Livy gave only 130 senators and many besides; Florus gave 140 senators. Appian gives 17 names at first before, in two rounds, 130 and 150 others were added. Figures in Orosius (6.18.10) are significantly lower than those of other sources and are likely corrupt. Appian also gives a total of 300 senators and some 2,000 , but this figure describes all persons who were killed or had properties confiscated between 43 and the treaty of Misenum in 39. \nFran\u00e7ois Hinard, reviewing the evidence in the 1985 book \"Les proscriptions de la Rome r\u00e9publicaine\", believes there were 300 proscribed in total, split roughly evenly between senators and equestrians. Historians who have argued for or accepted a fiscal rationale for the proscriptions, ie that the triumvirs lacked for money and sought proscription auctions for rich mens' properties to raise it, have generally trended towards the higher figures in Appian. Regardless, some of the victims escaped to Macedonia or Sicily (held by Brutus and Sextus Pompey, respectively) or were able to plead successfully for clemency. Still without sufficient funds, the triumvirs seized eighteen rich Italian towns and redistributed them to their soldiers.\nThe proscriptions claimed enemies and friends of the triumvirs. Cicero, whom Octavian had held in high esteem, was placed on the death lists along with his brother Quintus, nephew, and son; Cicero's activism against Antony in the Philippicae marked him for retribution. The triumvirs themselves traded friends and family to secure the addition of their enemies to the death lists. Persons on the proscription lists had their properties confiscated and sold; freelance assassins, bounty hunters, and informers received cash rewards for aiding in the killings.\nLiberators' civil war, 42\u00a0BC.\nPreparations for war on the tyrannicides started promptly. In Rome, the new year saw Julius Caesar consecrated as a god. With the triumvirs having slaughtered their political enemies in Italy, they moved with some forty legions against Brutus and Cassius in the east: Lepidus remained in Italy \u2013 supervised by two pro-Antony governors \u2013 while Antony and Octavian moved to cross the Adriatic for Macedonia.\nWhile some eight legions had crossed the Adriatic early in the year, the naval forces of the \"liberatores\" and of Sextus Pompey were able to interdict the triumvir's transports. Octavian dispatched Quintus Salvius Salvidienus Rufus against Sextus Pompey's base of operations in Sicily, resulting in a bloody but indecisive battle near Messana. It took until summer for the triumvirs to move all their armies into Macedonia. Through early 42\u00a0BC, Brutus and Cassius were active in Asia sacking cities and forcing tribute from the provincials to pay their own soldiers. The \"liberatores\", busy, delayed marching west (perhaps an error in retrospect); they moved to intercept Antony and Octavian only in mid-July.\nThe triumvirs' advance forces reached Philippi first, but were outmanoeuvred and forced to retreat. Brutus and Cassius, hugely outnumbering the advance force, reached Philippi in early September, forcing the triumvirs' advance forces to retreat. Antony and Octavian arrived some days later. The \"liberatores\" first attempted to avoid battle in light of the triumvirs' weak supply situation. But Antony was successful in forcing battle with the construction of earthworks on Cassius' flank.\nThe \"liberatores\" accepted battle, triggering the first battle: Brutus fought Octavian, Cassius fought Antony. Brutus' forces were successful and stormed Octavian's camp and destroying three of Octavian's legions. Cassius' forces, however, were less successful; Antony was able to storm Cassius' camp around the same time. Believing the battle was lost, Cassius died by suicide. In the aftermath, Cassius' forces were amalgamated into Brutus' army.\nThree weeks later, on 23 October 42\u00a0BC, Brutus offered battle again, fearing desertions and possible cutting of his supply lines. In this second battle, the combined forces of Antony and Octavian defeated Brutus' army. Antony was largely the victor \u2013 Octavian apparently spent most of the first battle hiding in a marsh \u2013 and had forced the \"liberatores\" to battle and defeat twice. In the aftermath, Brutus died by suicide.\nAntony turns east.\nIn the aftermath of Philippi, Antony moved to reorganise the wealthy eastern provinces. His provinces and legions were also adduced: retaining Transalpine Gaul, he took Narbonensis from Lepidus, though he gave up Cisalpine Gaul to Italy. Octavian's assignment was less easy: he would have the privilege of settling the veterans of Philippi in Italy and carrying on the war against Sextus Pompey in Sicily. Lepidus, however, not sharing in the glory, gave Spain to Octavian in return for Africa only. This new strategic position placed Antony at the head of an enormous advantage. His position in the east allowed him enormous resources with which he could overwhelm the west as Sulla had. His position in Gaul gave him easy access to Italy, just as Caesar had before his civil war. Moreover, while Antony would be in the east, his trusted lieutenants controlled the Gallic provinces. This strategic position placed him firmly at the head of the triumvirate.\nAntony moved first against Parthia, which had aided the \"liberatores\" and was harbouring the Pompeian commander Quintus Labienus, (son of Titus Labienus who had served with Caesar during the Gallic wars and fought against him during the civil war). In the preparations for war, however, Antony found most of the east largely sucked dry by the previous armies of Dolabella, Cassius, and Brutus, and so was gentle with the areas that Brutus and Cassius had pillaged. He also displayed favour for great cultural centres and toured the eastern provinces seeking to buttress popular support.\nMoving down the Mediterranean coast, Antony confirmed a number of rulers \u2013 in spite of their previous support for the \"liberatores\" or for Parthia \u2013 in Palestine and called Cleopatra to attend to him in Cilicia. Cleopatra quickly entered into an affair with Antony, which proved useful to her: Antony helped her secure her throne with the death of her sister Arsinoe and against other Ptolemaic claimants. While ancient writers speculated on Antony being manipulated by the Egyptian queen, it is more likely in this period he was merely attempting to strengthen Cleopatra's position in Egypt as part of his policy of favouring strong allied monarchs. Regardless, he left her in the spring of 40 to embark on a campaign against Parthia.\nThe Parthians, in the winter of 41 BC, knowing that Antony was preparing an offensive, struck first. Invading Asia Minor and Syria under the command of Pacorus and Quintus Labienus in the early spring of 40\u00a0BC, the Parthian forces were largely unchallenged: Pacorus moved south for Palestine while Labienus moved west through Cilicia for Ionia. Antony at the time was wholly distracted from the Parthian invasion due to the Perusine War.\nPerusine War, 41\u201340 BC.\nThe veterans' demands for lands in Italy \u2013 in the midst of a famine, which itself was exacerbated by Sextus Pompey's naval blockade of Italy, \u2013 caused protests and unrest throughout the Italian countryside. Antony's brother, Lucius Antonius, serving as consul for 41\u00a0BC, and Antony's wife Fulvia fanned the flames of this unrest to undermine Octavian. They spread propaganda indicting Octavian's regime with stomping on citizen rights and favouring Octavian's veterans over Antony's. Although there was little truth behind these charges, they were largely able to build up support for a militant rising against Octavian.\nAntony attempted to remain largely aloof to the goings-on, probably so he could exploit the outcome, but his supporters in Italy were largely uninformed of his intentions and readied for conflict. The consul Lucius, in the summer of 41\u00a0BC, occupied Rome with an army; however, he was beaten back by Octavian's forces and besieged in Perusia. Unsure of Antony's intentions, the pro-Antony governors in the two Gauls and in southern Italy stood by. Eventually, Perusia was captured: Octavian let Lucius Antonius and Fulvia go and spared Lucius' soldiers when Octavian's own soldiers interceded; Octavian, however, sacked the town, massacred its councillors, and had it burnt to the ground.\nAfter the death of one of the pro-Antony governors in Gaul in the summer of 40\u00a0BC, Octavian occupied the province. He also gained the support of the legions in southern Italy. Antony, concerned, hurried back to Italy from the east that same summer with substantial forces.\nTreaties of Brundisium and Misenum, 40\u201339\u00a0BC.\nAs relations deteriorated between Antony and Octavian, Octavian moved to woo Sextus Pompey over to his side. As part of this, he married Scribonia, Sextus' sister-in-law, in the summer of 40\u00a0BC. At the same time, however, Sextus was attempting to broker an agreement with Antony; receiving a positive response from Antony, he raided the Italian coast and took Sardinia from Octavian. Another ex-republican naval commander, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, was also induced to join Antony's side.\nWhen Antony sailed to Brundisium, Octavian's garrison of five legions refused to admit him. It was then besieged. Octavian's lieutenant Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa arrived with reinforcements but was turned back after some skirmishing. The troops on both sides, however, urged their leaders to come to terms. Octavian and Antony conducted negotiations through intermediaries (the envoys were Gaius Maecenas and Gaius Asinius Pollio, respectively). Negotiations for the treaty completed in September 40\u00a0BC:\nThe treaty would be sealed by another marriage: Antony would wed Octavian's sister Octavia. The announcement of peace was greatly celebrated by the people of Italy. Both dynasts celebrated ovations when entering Rome in October. But public opinion soured when they also announced new higher taxes amid further disruption of grain ships from Sextus' fleet. While in Rome, they also secured the senate's rubber stamp for a required dispensation for Octavia's marriage (she was not yet out of mourning for her previous husband) and for triumviral political and territorial settlements generally.\nThe dynasts also negotiated peace with Sextus Pompey at Misenum in the summer of 39\u00a0BC: they confirmed him in Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and the Peloponnese for five years. They promised him the consulship in 33\u00a0BC on expiration of his commands and had him elected augur. In exchange, Sextus would guarantee free passage of Italian grain ships and suppress Mediterranean piracy; his supporters also would receive amnesty and compensation for seized properties; his soldiers received the same retirement benefits as those of the triumvirs and his runaway slaves were granted freedom. The last concessions to Sextus' soldiers and slave forces were especially important for the triumvirs: with the soldiers and slaves' main grievances resolved, Sextus' military power was permanently neutered. After celebrations for this agreement, Antony departed for the east on 2 October 39\u00a0BC.\nRenewal of the triumvirate.\nAntony in the east.\nWhile Antony was in Italy, his lieutenant Publius Ventidius scored major victories against the Parthian invasion of Asia Minor: he defeated Labienus' forces and presumably had him killed. He also won the Battle of Amanus Pass against Phranipates, the Parthian satrap of Syria, killing the satrap and forcing the Parthians to retreat beyond the Euphrates. All of these victories were won before the autumn of 39\u00a0BC.\nAntony wintered in Athens and returned eastward in the spring of 38\u00a0BC. With the defence of the provinces largely complete, he prioritised reorganisations in the eastern provinces and client states. Among other boundary adjustments, he gave Cleopatra portions of eastern Cilicia and Cyprus with which to harvest timber to build a fleet. He also started to publicly identify with the god Dionysus. But before he moved further east he was drawn back to Brundisium by Octavian to discuss a worsening situation in Italy; when Octavian did not arrive promptly, he issued a public rebuke and sailed east for Syria, where he found Ventidius' victories uninterrupted. Ventidius was relieved of command by Antony and then returned to Rome to celebrate a triumph on 27 November 38\u00a0BC before dying shortly thereafter.\nOctavian in the west.\nThe agreement between Sextus Pompey and Octavian, without Antony's presence to balance the two, started to break down in autumn 39\u00a0BC. That winter, the famine in Italy and pirate raids on grain ships continued. One of Sextus' admirals also defected to Octavian, giving Octavian back the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, along with three legions and sixty ships. Sextus, outraged, declared war.\nTwo large naval battles were fought in the spring of 38\u00a0BC near Cumae and near Messana. Both resulted in victories for Sextus, but he did not exploit his advantage and allowed Octavian to retire to Campania. Antony likely sought to maintain the power balance between both Octavian and Sextus for his own advantage. Octavian now requested some support after these defeats. To preserve the balance of power, Antony prepared to move west and provide support. There also was a rebellion in Gaul, which Agrippa put down by the end of 38\u00a0BC. Agrippa, loyal to Octavian and in light of Octavian's inglorious defeat, tactfully went without a triumph.\nTreaty of Tarentum.\nIn the spring of 37\u00a0BC, Antony sailed for Italy with 300 ships. Denied entrance at Brundisium (the townsfolk suspected an invasion), he docked at Tarentum instead. Octavian travelled there to meet him. Negotiations dragged on until late July or early August. Antony apparently had to be persuaded by his wife Octavia to support Octavian against Sextus.\nThey agreed to strip Sextus of his augurate and future consulship. Octavian would wait a year to attack Sextus and would receive 120 ships from Antony in exchange for 20,000 men and 1,000 elite troops. The triumvirate also had uncomfortably expired at the end of 38\u00a0BC. Normal republican practice had magistrates abdicate their offices at the close of their terms; the triumvirs' terms had ended, but they had not abdicated. Nor were any successors appointed. Regardless, the legal position of the triumvirs was of little practical relevance. Making a show of constitutionalism, the triumvirate was then renewed by law for another five years, to expire on the last day of 33\u00a0BC.\nParthia and Sicily, 36\u00a0BC.\nPreparations for war continued apace. Agrippa, serving as consul in 37\u00a0BC, built a large harbour (the \"portus Julius\") to train and supply troops against Sextus in Sicily. In the east, Roman client Herod retook most of Judaea; even better for the Romans, the Parthian threat disappeared amid a dynastic struggle when Orodes II abdicated in favour of his chosen successor Phraates IV, who promptly murdered his father, all of his brothers, and his own son, precipitating a revolt.\nAmid a general reorganisation of the east which again strengthened client kingdoms \u2013 among a number of changes, Cleopatra received Crete and Cyrene, \u2013 Antony fathered a son with Cleopatra and publicly acknowledged his paternity of two twins born in 40\u00a0BC. This may have been related to strengthening Antony and Cleopatra's positions in Egypt and building popular support there; even if so, the relationship was unpopular in Italy and Antony should have known this.\nParthian campaign.\nAntony demanded the return of Crassus' eagles from Phraates; Phraates, needing to ensure his own position, refused. Antony struck north towards Armenia, where he was joined by detachments from allied kings and a Roman governor. With sixteen legions and many auxiliaries, he drove south into Persia. Moving quickly without his siege engines, he arrived to Phraata, the Parthian capital, but then discovered that his slow-moving siege engines had been intercepted and destroyed. He was then abandoned by Artavasdes, the Armenian king; Antony, while successful in some defences, was unable to effectively counter the swift Parthian cavalry.\nAbandoning the siege, he was forced into a difficult retreat with few supplies and harried by Parthian archers. Over 27 days, the army returned after a famous display of resilience and valour, to Armenia. Reaching an agreement with Artavasdes, Antony continued to retreat through the winter until he reached Cappadocia. In total, he lost around a third of his entire army.\nThe failure of the Parthian campaign fatally damaged Antony's military prestige and power. If it had been successful, it would clearly placed him above Octavian; but after its failure, Antony's fortunes turned for the worse.\nSicily.\nAgrippa prepared exhaustively for Octavian's campaign against Sicily. Octavian also was able to secure support from Lepidus in Africa, who possibly had plans of his own. In July 36\u00a0BC, Octavian and Lepidus launched a three-pronged attack on Sicily with Octavian's forces landing in the north and east while Lepidus landed in the south.\nInitially, Octavian's naval forces were beset by storms. Lepidus' forces, however, successfully effected a landing in his theatre and placed one of Sextus' lieutenants under siege in Lilybaeum. In the north and east, there were naval battles: Octavian was personally defeated off Tauromenium while Agrippa was victorious off Mylae. Even so, Sextus' forces were stretched thin and Octavian was able to effect landings of 21 legions onto the island. A decisive naval battle ended the campaign, with Agrippa defeating Sextus near Naulochus on 3 September 36\u00a0BC. Sextus, able to muster only 17 ships, fled for Antony in the east.\nLepidus, buoyed by victory, attempted to suborn Octavian's troops. After accepting the surrender of Sextus Pompey's legions, he attempted to negotiate with Octavian to exchange Sicily and Africa for his old provinces of Narbonensis and Spain. Octavian, walking into Lepidus' camp almost unaccompanied, secured the loyalty of the soldiers; defeated, Lepidus was then stripped of membership in the triumvirate and his provincial commands. Kept in his property, life, and the title of \"pontifex maximus\", Lepidus was forced into exile and retirement.\nBreakdown.\nWith the three reduced to two, Octavian started to prepare for a showdown against Antony. He furthered his attempts to link Antony with Cleopatra and drilled his troops in Illyricum near the dividing line of the provinces. Antony, however, was slow to respond and was focused on the far east against Armenia. In the interim, Sextus arrived in Antony's provinces, where he was caught and executed, though Antony erected some cover of plausible deniability for the actions.\nOctavian's troops, believing Octavian's propaganda about having brought to an end the civil wars and restoring peace, started to demand demobilisation. While some of the longest-serving were released, Octavian was keenly aware of his need to keep his men mobilised. To that end, he offered some donatives and a ploy about spoils in Illyricum. He also offered an embassy led by Octavia to transfer to Antony about half of his lent ships and 2, 000 elite men \u2013 nowhere near the 20, 000 promised at Tarentum \u2013 which had the effect of forcing Antony to choose between accepting Octavian's so-called repayment or insulting his wife in the eyes of the Italians. Antony accepted his wife's troops but bade her to winter in Athens while he went back to Alexandria to stay with Cleopatra.\nPropaganda war, 34\u00a0BC.\nAntony, through treacherous means, tricked the Armenian king Artavasdes into a meeting in 34\u00a0BC. Capturing the Armenian king, he occupied his country and then paraded him in a Dionysiac procession in Alexandria. Octavian's propaganda seized on the procession as a sacrilege and betrayal of Rome's gods. Antony also engaged on an unwise ceremony, the \"donations of Alexandria\", where he crowned his children with Cleopatra as oriental monarchs. These antics went down very poorly in Rome. In a political climate which blamed the civil wars on a collapse of public morality, Octavian was able to link Antony with oriental immorality under Cleopatra's influence.\nAntony and his supporters, of course, responded: they alleged Octavian to be a coward; they objected to Octavian's shabby treatment of Lepidus; they accused Octavian of monopolising all the land in Italy for his own veterans; they also made allegations that Octavian was stealing ex-consuls' wives and prostituting his daughter Julia to foreign kings.\nWhile the propaganda war was raging, Octavian campaigned in Illyricum; he was successful at defeating, with overwhelming force, a number of barbarian tribes. Able to keep his soldiers in arms and build their experience, he celebrated with friendly generals a large number of triumphs; those triumphs also financed, from the spoils, building and renovation projects in Rome. Octavian and Antony competed on building new public works in the city. Octavian's ally Agrippa also engaged in renovations of the sewers and aqueducts; and during a term as aedile in 33\u00a0BC, sponsored spectacular games and public donations.\nEnd of the triumvirate, 32\u201330\u00a0BC.\nThe triumvirate's legal term expired on 31 December 33\u00a0BC (Octavian's holding of his triumviral legal powers may have continued to 27\u00a0BC). In the new year, Octavian used force to drive the potentially resurgent consuls from Rome after one of the consuls started to publicly attack him. The consuls fled to the east and Antony with several hundred senators, which Antony organised into a \"counter-senate\".\nAntony started to move his massive army, of some 100,000 men and 800 ships, west towards Greece. His men debated whether or not they should permit Cleopatra to stay with them: the main argument to remove her was that her presence would further Octavian's propaganda depicting a war on the east; however, removing her would also demoralise some of their own forces, who were fighting for their queen against Rome rather than for Antony, a Roman general. Arriving in Athens, Antony divorced Octavia; the choice of removing his Roman wife to stay with his Egyptian mistress alienated Italian public opinion.\nLucius Munatius Plancus then fled Antony's camp for Octavian's. Upon his arrival, he recommend that Octavian open Antony's will, legally sealed with the Vestal Virgins. Opening it, Octavian allegedly found that Antony planned to be buried in Alexandria, would recognise Caesarion as Caesar's son, and give large portions of Roman lands to his children with Cleopatra. It is likely that Octavian may have invented provisions: the Vestals in Rome would not have seen the sealed will; some provisions may have been alleged which Antony would find uncomfortable to deny (losing eastern support) or admit (losing western support).\nAntony's forces in Greece provoked panic in Italy; Octavian, no longer calling himself triumvir (but retaining his provincial commands) organised defence of the peninsula. He organised a civil oath to his personal leadership, unprecedented in republican history. Declaring war on Cleopatra, Octavian also had the republic strip Antony of his legal position.\nEarly in the campaigning season of 31\u00a0BC, Agrippa launched a series of surprise attacks on the western Greek harbours under Antony's control. Octavian moved quickly to take beachheads on the Greek mainland near Corcyra. After cutting off Antony's supplies and escape by land, Antony and Cleopatra engaged in a sea battle, attempting to break out with his remaining fleet. They fought Octavian on 2 September 31\u00a0BC at the Battle of Actium. Antony and Cleopatra were able to flee through a gap in the line, which was the plan, but most of his fleet did not follow and returned to port. After the battle, most of his forces in Greece surrendered.\nAfter a number of defections to Octavian \u2013 both Roman governors and client kings \u2013 through the winter of 31 and 30\u00a0BC, Antony's remaining forces were only those in the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Troubled by demands from his soldiers for land, and only able to solve them with large-scale land purchases, Octavian marched on Egypt in pursuit of its booty. He marched overland on the Mediterranean coast. He engaged negotiations with Cleopatra but they broke down by July 30\u00a0BC. Later that month, Octavian arrived at Alexandria and on 1 August, took and sacked the city. He killed Caesarion and Antony's heir, Antyllus, but captured Cleopatra's children for his triumph. Cleopatra and Antony died by suicide.\nLegacy.\nIn formation of the Principate.\nThe ascendancy of Octavian at the triumvirate's close was closely followed by his constitutional \"settlements\" and the formation of the Principate and the Roman empire. The creation of the triumvirate and its system of absolute rule, however, was not then known to be permanent. Even in the imperial period, writers like Tacitus reflected on how the republic had been dominated by single men before. Moreover, it was not inevitable that the triumvirs were going to defeat the \"liberatores\". Their successful campaign, culminating at Philippi, was recognised in coming generations as a turning point in the republic's history. Tacitus, for example, dates the end of the republic to the triumviral victory there, which left the republic defenceless and \"nulla iam publica arma\" (i.e., the republic was disarmed). Erich Gruen, in \"The Last Generation of the Roman Republic\", attributes the republic's collapse to the long and brutal conflicts after Caesar's assassination, largely fought by (and then between) the triumvirs, which eventually \"made it impossible to pick up the pieces\".\nThe mass violence of triumviral rule and their untraditional form of government was contemporaneously seen as illegitimate. To combat such charges, the triumvirs attempted to preserve the appearance of republican practices and legality. Of course, the extent to which the triumvirate heeded republican traditions changed over time. Over time, as the political situation stabilised, Octavian in Rome resumed the normal operation of the consulship (rather than appointment of many and multiple suffect consulships in a single year).\nThe traditional magistrates did not yield all of their duties to the triumvirs; they were still expected to and did conduct public business. Moreover, the consuls still exercised some degree of independent political authority. The traditional means of moving legislation before the senate and the assemblies also was not abandoned: the triumvirs moved multiple laws before the people on diverse subjects such as extending citizenship, ratification of Antony's eastern settlements, extension of the triumvirate, and expanding the patriciate. While the mere operation of the republic's institutional machinery did not represent a free state, the triumvirs made a show of following traditional legal niceties. The triumvirs at various times also made repeated promises or offers to give their powers back to the senate and people, though of course these promises were never kept. Most especially, the triumvirs' powers to appoint all provincial governors served as part of the division between military and civic provinces later adopted in Augustus' political settlements.\nIn Roman culture.\nThe political chaos of the triumviral years proved a ladder for many provincials, veterans, and former slaves. Many of the great works of Latin literature were produced in this unstable period, such as Horace's \"Epodes\" and \"Satires\", Virgil's \"Eclogues\" and \"Georgics\", and the histories of Sallust and Asinius Pollio. The political competition between Octavian and Antony provided the impetus for Octavian's ally, Gaius Maecenas, to support many leading artists of his day.\nVirgil's \"Eclogues\", for example, shed light on the fears of shepherds and herdsmen in rural Italy during Octavian's land confiscations when he sought lands to settle veterans in the aftermath of Philippi. The proscriptions also proved a topic of embellishment; many stories are told of the plight of victims and their attempts to escape. Cicero's plight during the proscriptions, especially, was a recurrent topic in ancient schools of oratory.\nTimeline.\nThe following years are taken from the narrative in .\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67436", "revid": "21678789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67436", "title": "Pseudoephedrine", "text": "Synthetic Decongestant\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Infobox drug/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPseudoephedrine, sold under the brand name Sudafed among others, is a sympathomimetic medication which is used as a decongestant to treat nasal congestion. It has also been used off-label for certain other indications, like treatment of low blood pressure. At higher doses, it may produce various additional effects including stimulant, appetite suppressant, and performance-enhancing effects. In relation to this, non-medical use of pseudoephedrine has been encountered. The medication is taken by mouth.\nSide effects of pseudoephedrine include insomnia, elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, restlessness, dizziness, anxiety, and dry mouth, among others. Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been associated with serious cardiovascular complications like heart attack and hemorrhagic stroke. Some people may be more sensitive to its cardiovascular effects. Pseudoephedrine acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent, thereby indirectly activating adrenergic receptors. As such, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Pseudoephedrine significantly crosses into the brain, but has some peripheral selectivity due to its hydrophilicity. Chemically, pseudoephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and amphetamine. It is the (1\"S\",2\"S\")-enantiomer of \u03b2-hydroxy-\"N\"-methylamphetamine.\nAlong with ephedrine, pseudoephedrine occurs naturally in ephedra, which has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. It was first isolated from ephedra in 1889. Subsequent to its synthesis in the 1920s, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant. Pseudoephedrine is widely available over-the-counter (OTC) in both single-drug and combination preparations. Availability of pseudoephedrine has been restricted starting in 2005 as it can be used to synthesize methamphetamine. Phenylephrine has replaced pseudoephedrine in many over-the-counter oral decongestant products. However, oral phenylephrine appears to be ineffective as a decongestant. In 2023, pseudoephedrine was the 292nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. In 2023, the combination with brompheniramine and dextromethorphan was the 281st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700,000 prescriptions. In 2023, the combination with loratadine was the 300th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMedical uses.\nNasal congestion.\nPseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic and is well-known for shrinking swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a decongestant. It reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of sinus secretions, and opening of obstructed Eustachian tubes. The same vasoconstriction action can also result in hypertension, which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine.\nPseudoephedrine can be used either as oral or as topical decongestant. Due to its stimulating qualities, however, the oral preparation is more likely to cause adverse effects, including urinary retention. According to one study, pseudoephedrine may show effectiveness as an antitussive drug (suppression of cough).\nPseudoephedrine is indicated for the treatment of nasal congestion, sinus congestion, and Eustachian tube congestion. Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of allergic rhinitis, croup, sinusitis, otitis media, and tracheobronchitis.\nOther uses.\nAmphetamine-type stimulants and other catecholaminergic agents are known to have wakefulness-promoting effects and are used in the treatment of hypersomnia and narcolepsy. Pseudoephedrine at therapeutic doses does not appear to improve or worsen daytime sleepiness, daytime fatigue, or sleep quality in people with allergic rhinitis. Likewise, somnolence was not lower in children with the common cold treated with pseudoephedrine for nasal congestion. In any case, insomnia is a known side effect of pseudoephedrine, although the incidence is low. In addition, doses of pseudoephedrine above the normal therapeutic range have been reported to produce stimulant effects including insomnia and fatigue resistance.\nThere has been interest in pseudoephedrine as an appetite suppressant for the treatment of obesity. However, due to lack of clinical data and potential cardiovascular side effects, this use is not recommended. Only a single placebo-controlled study of pseudoephedrine for weight loss exists (120mg/day slow-release for 12weeks) and found no significant difference in weight lost compared to placebo (-4.6kg vs. -4.5kg). This was in contrast to phenylpropanolamine, which has been found to be more effective at promoting weight loss compared to placebo and has been more widely studied and used in the treatment of obesity.\nPseudoephedrine has been used limitedly in the treatment of orthostatic intolerance including orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). However, its effectiveness in the treatment of POTS is controversial. Pseudoephedrine has also been used limitedly in the treatment of refractory hypotension in intensive care units. However, data on this use are limited to case reports and case series.\nPseudoephedrine is also used as a first-line prophylactic for recurrent priapism. Erection is largely a parasympathetic response, so the sympathetic action of pseudoephedrine may serve to relieve this condition. Data for this use are however anecdotal and effectiveness has been described as variable.\nTreatment of urinary incontinence is an off-label use for pseudoephedrine and related medications.\nAvailable forms.\nPseudoephedrine is available by itself over-the-counter in the form of 30 and 60mg immediate-release and 120 and 240mg extended-release oral tablets in the United States.\nPseudoephedrine is also available over-the-counter and prescription-only in combination with numerous other drugs, including antihistamines (acrivastine, azatadine, brompheniramine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, dexbrompheniramine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, triprolidine), analgesics (acetaminophen, codeine, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, naproxen), cough suppressants (dextromethorphan), and expectorants (guaifenesin).\nPseudoephedrine has been used in the form of the hydrochloride and sulfate salts and in a polistirex form. The drug has been used in more than 135 over-the-counter and prescription formulations. Many prescription formulations containing pseudoephedrine have been discontinued over time.\nContraindications.\nPseudoephedrine is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, severe or uncontrolled hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, closed-angle glaucoma, or by pregnant women. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.\nSide effects.\nCommon side effects with pseudoephedrine therapy may include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, insomnia, restlessness, excitability, dizziness, and anxiety. Infrequent side effects include tachycardia or palpitations. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy may be associated with mydriasis (dilated pupils), hallucinations, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures, and ischemic colitis; as well as severe skin reactions known as recurrent pseudo-scarlatina, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-pigmenting fixed drug eruption. Pseudoephedrine, particularly when combined with other drugs including narcotics, may also play a role in the precipitation of episodes of psychosis. It has also been reported that pseudoephedrine, among other sympathomimetic agents, may be associated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke and other cardiovascular complications.\nDue to its sympathomimetic effects, pseudoephedrine is a vasoconstrictor and pressor agent (increases blood pressure), a positive chronotrope (increases heart rate), and a positive inotrope (increases force of heart contractions). The influence of pseudoephedrine on blood pressure at clinical doses is controversial. A closely related sympathomimetic and decongestant, phenylpropanolamine, was withdrawn due to associations with markedly increased blood pressure and incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. There has been concern that pseudoephedrine may likewise dangerously increase blood pressure and thereby increase the risk of stroke, whereas others have contended that the risks are exaggerated. Besides hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary vasospasm, and sudden death have also rarely been reported with sympathomimetic ephedra compounds like pseudoephedrine and ephedrine.\nA 2005 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at recommended doses had no meaningful effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure in healthy individuals or people with controlled hypertension. Systolic blood pressure was found to slightly increase by 0.99mmHg on average and heart rate was found to slightly increase by 2.83bpm on average. Conversely, there was no significant influence on diastolic blood pressure, which increased by 0.63mgHg. In people with controlled hypertension, systolic hypertension increased by a similar degree of 1.20mmHg. Immediate-release preparations, higher doses, being male, and shorter duration of use were all associated with greater cardiovascular effects. A small subset of individuals with autonomic instability, perhaps in turn resulting in greater adrenergic receptor sensitivity, may be substantially more sensitive to the cardiovascular effects of sympathomimetics. Subsequent to the 2005 meta-analysis, a 2015 systematic review and a 2018 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at high doses (&gt;170mg) could increase heart rate and physical performance with larger effect sizes than lower doses.\nA 2007 Cochrane review assessed the side effects of short-term use of pseudoephedrine at recommended doses as a nasal decongestant. It found that pseudoephedrine had a small risk of insomnia and this was the only side effect that occurred at rates significantly different from placebo. Insomnia occurred at a rate of 5% and had an odds ratio (OR) of 6.18. Other side effects, including headache and hypertension, occurred at rates of less than 4% and were not different from placebo.\nTachyphylaxis is known to develop with prolonged use of pseudoephedrine, especially when it is re-administered at short intervals.\nThere is a case report of temporary depressive symptoms upon discontinuation and withdrawal from pseudoephedrine. The withdrawal symptoms included worsened mood and sadness, profoundly decreased energy, a worsened view of oneself, decreased concentration, psychomotor retardation, increased appetite, and increased need for sleep.\nPseudoephedrine has psychostimulant effects at high doses and is a positive reinforcer with amphetamine-like effects in animals including rats and monkeys. However, it is substantially less potent than methamphetamine or cocaine.\nOverdose.\nThe maximum total daily dose of pseudoephedrine is 240mg. Symptoms of overdose may include sedation, apnea, impaired concentration, cyanosis, coma, circulatory collapse, insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions, headache, dizziness, anxiety, euphoria, tinnitus, blurred vision, ataxia, chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, increased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure, thirstiness, sweating, difficulty with urination, nausea, and vomiting. In children, symptoms have more often included dry mouth, pupil dilation, hot flashes, fever, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Pseudoephedrine may produce toxic effects both with use of supratherapeutic doses but also in people who are more sensitive to the effects of sympathomimetics. Misuse of the drug has been reported in one case at massive doses of 3,000 to 4,500mg (100\u2013150\u00d730-mg tablets) per day, with the doses gradually increased over time by this individual. No fatalities due to pseudoephedrine misuse have been reported as of 2021. However, death with pseudoephedrine has been reported generally.\nInteractions.\nConcomitant or recent (previous 14days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use can lead to hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crisis, and should be avoided. Clinical studies have found minimal or no influence of certain MAOIs like the weak non-selective MAOI linezolid and the potent selective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (as a transdermal patch) on the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. This is in accordance with the fact that pseudoephedrine is not metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). However, pseudoephedrine induces the release of norepinephrine, which MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of, and as such, MAOIs can still potentiate the effects of pseudoephedrine. No significant pharmacodynamic interactions have been found with selegiline, but linezolid potentiated blood pressure increases with pseudoephedrine. However, this was deemed to be without clinical significance in the case of linezolid, though it was noted that some individuals may be more sensitive to the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine and related agents. Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated with MAOIs like phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, and moclobemide due to the potential for synergistic sympathomimetic effects and hypertensive crisis. It is also considered to be contraindicated with linezolid and selegiline as some individuals may react more sensitively to coadministration.\nConcomitant use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors, including ergot alkaloids like ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, linezolid, oxytocin, ephedrine, phenylephrine, and bromocriptine, among others, is not recommended due to the possibility of greater increases in blood pressure and risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Sympathomimetic effects and cardiovascular risks of pseudoephedrine may also be increased with digitalis glycosides, tricyclic antidepressants, appetite suppressants, and inhalational anesthetics. Likewise, greater sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine may occur when it is combined with other sympathomimetic agents. Rare but serious cardiovascular complications have been reported with the combination of pseudoephedrine and bupropion. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, guanethidine, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by sympathomimetics like pseudoepehdrine. Beta blockers like labetalol may reduce the effects of pseudoephedrine.\nUrinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride can increase the excretion of and thereby reduce exposure to amphetamines including pseudoephedrine, whereas urinary alkalinizing agents including antacids like sodium bicarbonate as well as acetazolamide can reduce the excretion of these agents and thereby increase exposure to them.\nPharmacology.\nPharmacodynamics.\nPseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent which acts primarily or exclusively by inducing the release of norepinephrine. Hence, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Some sources state that pseudoephedrine has a mixed mechanism of action consisting of both indirect and direct effects by binding to and acting as an agonist of adrenergic receptors. However, the affinity of pseudoephedrine for adrenergic receptors is described as very low or negligible. Animal studies suggest that the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine are exclusively due to norepinephrine release.\nPseudoephedrine induces monoamine release \"in vitro\" with an EC50Tooltip half maximal effective concentration of 224nM for norepinephrine and 1,988nM for dopamine, whereas it is inactive for serotonin. As such, it is about 9-fold selective for induction of norepinephrine release over dopamine release. The drug has negligible agonistic activity at the \u03b11- and \u03b12-adrenergic receptors (Kact &gt;10,000nM). At the \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors, it acts as a partial agonist with relatively low affinity (\u03b21 = Kact = 309\u03bcM, IATooltip intrinsic activity = 53%; \u03b22 = 10\u03bcM; IA = 47%). It was an antagonist or very weak partial agonist of the \u03b23-adrenergic receptor (Kact = ND; IA = 7%). It is about 30,000 to 40,000times less potent as a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist than (\u2013)-isoproterenol.\nPseudoephedrine's principal mechanism of action relies on its action on the adrenergic system.&lt;ref name=\"Thomson/Micromedex 2007 2452\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The vasoconstriction that pseudoephedrine produces is believed to be principally an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor response. Pseudoephedrine acts on \u03b1- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors, to cause vasoconstriction and relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi, respectively. \u03b1-Adrenergic receptors are located on the muscles lining the walls of blood vessels. When these receptors are activated, the muscles contract, causing the blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction). The constricted blood vessels now allow less fluid to leave the blood vessels and enter the nose, throat, and sinus linings, which results in decreased inflammation of nasal membranes, as well as decreased mucus production. Thus, by constriction of blood vessels, mainly those located in the nasal passages, pseudoephedrine causes a decrease in the symptoms of nasal congestion. Activation of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors produces relaxation of the smooth muscle of the bronchi, causing bronchial dilation and in turn decreasing congestion (although not fluid) and difficulty breathing.\nPseudoephedrine is less potent as a sympathomimetic and psychostimulant than ephedrine. Clinical studies have found that pseudoephedrine is about 3.5- to 4-fold less potent than ephedrine as a sympathomimetic agent in terms of blood pressure increases and 3.5- to 7.2-fold or more less potent as a bronchodilator. Pseudoephedrine is also said to have much less central effect than ephedrine and to be only a weak psychostimulant. Blood vessels in the nose are around five times more sensitive than the heart to the actions of circulating epinephrine (adrenaline), which may help to explain how pseudoephedrine at the low doses used in over-the-counter products can produce nasal decongestion with minimal effects on the heart. Compared to dextroamphetamine, pseudoephedrine is about 30 to 35times less potent as a norepinephrine releasing agent and 80 to 350times less potent as a dopamine releasing agent \"in vitro\".\nPseudoephedrine is a very weak reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) \"in vitro\", including both MAO-A and MAO-B (Ki = 1,000\u20135,800\u03bcM). It is far less potent in this action than other agents like dextroamphetamine and moclobemide.\nPharmacokinetics.\nAbsorption.\nPseudoephedrine is orally active and is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Its oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. The drug reaches peak concentrations after 1 to 4hours (mean 1.9hours) in the case of the immediate-release formulation and after 2 to 6hours in the case of the extended-release formulation. The onset of action of pseudoephedrine is 30minutes.\nDistribution.\nPseudoephedrine, due to its lack of polar phenolic groups, is relatively lipophilic. This is a property it shares with related sympathomimetic and decongestant agents like ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. These agents are widely distributed throughout the body and cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, it is said that pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine cross the blood-brain barrier only to some extent and that pseudoephedrine has limited central nervous system activity, suggesting that it is partially peripherally selective. The blood-brain barrier permeability of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine is reduced compared to other amphetamines due to the presence of a hydroxyl group at the \u03b2 carbon which decreases their lipophilicity. As such, they have a greater ratio of peripheral cardiovascular to central psychostimulant effect. Besides entering the brain, these substances also cross the placenta and enter breast milk.\nThe plasma protein binding of pseudoephedrine has been reported to be approximately 21 to 29%. It is bound to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and albumin (HSA).\nMetabolism.\nPseudoephedrine is not extensively metabolized and is subjected to minimal first-pass metabolism with oral administration. Due to its methyl group at the \u03b1 carbon (i.e., it is an amphetamine), pseudoephedrine is not a substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is not metabolized by this enzyme. It is also not metabolized by catechol \"O\"-methyltransferase (COMT). Pseudoephedrine is demethylated into the metabolite norpseudoephedrine to a small extent. Similarly to pseudoephedrine, this metabolite is active and shows amphetamine-like effects. Approximately 1 to 6% of pseudoephedrine is metabolized in the liver via \"N\"-demethylation to form norpseudoephedrine.\nElimination.\nPseudoephedrine is excreted primarily via the kidneys in urine. Its urinary excretion is highly influenced by urinary pH and is increased when the urine is acidic and is decreased when it is alkaline.\nThe elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine on average is 5.4hours and ranges from 3 to 16hours depending on urinary pH. At a pH of 5.6 to 6.0, the elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine was 5.2 to 8.0hours. In one study, a more acidic pH of 5.0 resulted in a half-life of 3.0 to 6.4hours, whereas a more alkaline pH of 8.0 resulted in a half-life of 9.2 to 16.0hours. Substances that influence urinary acidity and are known to affect the excretion of amphetamine derivatives include urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride as well as urinary alkalinizing agents like acetazolamide.\nA majority of an oral dose of pseudoephedrine is excreted unchanged in urine within 24hours of administration. This has been found to range from 43 to 96%. The amount excreted unchanged is dependent on urinary pH similarly to the drug's half-life, as a longer half-life and duration in the body allows more time for the drug to be metabolized.\nThe duration of action of pseudoephedrine, which is dependent on its elimination, is 4 to 12hours.\nPseudoephedrine has been reported to accumulate in people with renal impairment.\nChemistry.\nPseudoephedrine, also known structurally as (1\"S\",2\"S\")-\u03b1,\"N\"-dimethyl-\u03b2-hydroxyphenethylamine or as (1\"S\",2\"S\")-\"N\"-methyl-\u03b2-hydroxyamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine, amphetamine, and \u03b2-hydroxyamphetamine derivative. It is a diastereomer of ephedrine.\nPseudoephedrine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C10H15NO and a molecular weight of 165.23g/mol. It has an experimental log P of 0.89, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The compound is relatively lipophilic, but is also more hydrophilic than other amphetamines. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to pseudoephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of ephedrine is 1.1, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5\u20132.7).\nPseudoephedrine is readily reduced into methamphetamine or oxidized into methcathinone.\nNomenclatures.\nThe dextrorotary (+)- or d- enantiomer is (1\"S\",2\"S\")-pseudoephedrine, whereas the levorotating (\u2212)- or l- form is (1\"R\",2\"R\")-pseudoephedrine.\nIn the outdated (+)-pseudoephedrine is also referred to as L-pseudoephedrine and (\u2212)-pseudoephedrine as D-pseudoephedrine (in the Fischer projection then the phenyl ring is drawn at bottom).\nOften the D/L system (with small caps) and the (with lower-case) are confused. The result is that the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine is wrongly named D-pseudoephedrine and the levorotary l-ephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly L-ephedrine.\nThe IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1\"S\",2\"S\")- respectively (1\"R\",2\"R\")-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. Synonyms for both are \"psi\"-ephedrine and \"threo\"-ephedrine.\nPseudoephedrine is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name of the (+)-form, when used as pharmaceutical substance.\nDetection in body fluids.\nPseudoephedrine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor any possible performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Some commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with pseudoephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish pseudoephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations are typically in the 50 to 300\u03bcg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 500 to 3,000\u03bcg/L in people with substance use disorder involving pseudoephedrine or poisoned patients, and 10 to 70mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdose.\nManufacturing.\nAlthough pseudoephedrine occurs naturally as an alkaloid in certain plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the \"Ephedra\" species, also known as \"ma huang\", in which it occurs together with other isomers of ephedrine), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from yeast fermentation of dextrose in the presence of benzaldehyde. In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of \"Candida utilis\" or \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\") are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment, the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC). L-PAC is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via reductive amination.\nThe bulk of pseudoephedrine is produced by commercial pharmaceutical manufacturers in India and China, where economic and industrial conditions favor its mass production for export.\nHistory.\nPseudoephedrine, along with ephedrine, occurs naturally in ephedra. This herb has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. Pseudoephedrine was first isolated and characterized in 1889 by the German chemists Ladenburg and Oelschl\u00e4gel, who used a sample that had been isolated from \"Ephedra vulgaris\" by the Merck pharmaceutical corporation of Darmstadt, Germany. It was first synthesized in the 1920s in Japan. Subsequently, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant.\nSociety and culture.\nGeneric names.\n\"Pseudoephedrine\" is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while \"pseudo\u00e9ph\u00e9drine\" is its DCFTooltip D\u00e9nomination Commune Fran\u00e7aise and \"pseudoefedrina\" is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. \"Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride\" is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt; \"pseudoephedrine sulfate\" is its USAN in the case of the sulfate salt; \"pseudoephedrine polistirex\" its USAN in the case of the polistirex form; and \"d-isoephedrine sulfate\" is its JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name in the case of the sulfate salt. Pseudoephedrine is also known as \"\u03a8-ephedrine\" and \"isoephedrine\".\nBrand names.\nThe following is a list of consumer medicines that either contain pseudoephedrine or have switched to a less-regulated alternative such as phenylephrine.\nRecreational use.\nOver-the-counter pseudoephedrine has been misused as a psychostimulant. Six case reports and one case series of pseudoephedrine misuse have been published as of 2021. There is a case report of self-medication with pseudoephedrine in massive doses for treatment of depression.\nUse in exercise and sports.\nPseudoephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports due to its sympathomimetic and stimulant effects. Because of these effects, pseudoephedrine can increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, improve mental energy, and reduce fatigue, among other performance-enhancing effects.\nA 2015 systematic review found that pseudoephedrine lacked performance-enhancing effects at therapeutic doses (60\u2013120mg) but significantly enhanced athletic performance at supratherapeutic doses (\u2265180mg). A subsequent 2018 meta-analysis, which included seven additional studies, found that pseudoephedrine had a small positive effect on heart rate (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference = 0.43) but insignificant effects on time trials, perceived exertion ratings, blood glucose levels, and blood lactate levels. However, subgroup analyses revealed that effect sizes were larger for heart rate increases and quicker time trials in well-trained athletes and younger participants, for shorter exercise sessions with pseudoephedrine administered within 90minutes beforehand, and with higher doses of pseudoephedrine. A dose\u2013response relationship was established, with larger doses (&gt;170mg) showing greater increases in heart rate and faster time trials than with smaller doses (\u2264170mg) (SMD = 0.85 for heart rate and SMD = -0.24 for time trials, respectively). In any case, the meta-analysis concluded that the performance-enhancing effects of pseudoephedrine were marginal to small and likely to be lower in magnitude than with caffeine. It is relevant in this regard that caffeine is a permitted stimulant in competitive sports.\nPseudoephedrine was on the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) banned substances list until 2004 when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list replaced the IOC list. Although WADA initially only \"monitored\" pseudoephedrine, it went back onto the \"banned\" list on 1 January 2010.\nPseudoephedrine is excreted through urine, and the concentration in urine of this drug shows a large inter-individual spread; that is, the same dose can give a vast difference in urine concentration for different individuals. Pseudoephedrine is approved to be taken up to 240\u00a0mg per day. In seven healthy male subjects, this dose yielded a urine concentration range of 62.8 to 294.4 microgram per milliliter (\u03bcg/mL) with mean \u00b1 standard deviation 149 \u00b1 72\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Thus, normal dosage of 240\u00a0mg pseudoephedrine per day can result in urine concentration levels exceeding the limit of 150\u00a0\u03bcg/mL set by WADA for about half of all users. Furthermore, hydration status does not affect the urinary concentration of pseudoephedrine.\nManufacture of amphetamines.\nIts membership in the amphetamine class has made pseudoephedrine a sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. As a result of the increasing regulatory restrictions on the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine, pharmaceutical firms have reformulated medications to use alternative compounds, particularly phenylephrine, even though its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been demonstrated to be indistinguishable from placebo.\nIn the United States, federal laws control the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Retailers in the US have created corporate policies restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Their policies restrict sales by limiting purchase quantities and requiring a minimum age and government issued photographic identification. These requirements are similar to and sometimes more stringent than existing law. Internationally, pseudoephedrine is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.\nLegal status.\nAustralia.\nIllicit diversion of pseudoephedrine in Australia has caused significant changes to the way the products are regulated. As of 2006[ [update]], all products containing pseudoephedrine have been rescheduled as either \"Pharmacist Only Medicines\" (Schedule 3) or \"Prescription Only Medicines\" (Schedule 4), depending on the amount of pseudoephedrine in the product. A Pharmacist Only Medicine may only be sold to the public if a pharmacist is directly involved in the transaction. These medicines must be kept behind the counter, away from public access.\nPharmacists are also encouraged (and in some states required) to log purchases with the online database Project STOP.\nAs a result, some pharmacies no longer stock Sudafed, the common brand of pseudoephedrine cold/sinus tablets, opting instead to sell Sudafed PE, a phenylephrine product that has not been proven effective in clinical trials.\nBelgium.\nUntil 2024, several formulations of pseudoephedrine were available over-the-counter in Belgium. However, new legislation came into effect in November 2024, banning the over-the-counter sale of all medicines containing pseudoephedrine.\nCanada.\nHealth Canada has investigated the risks and benefits of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine/Ephedra. Near the end of the study, Health Canada issued a warning on their website stating that those who are under the age of 12, or who have heart disease and may have strokes, should avoid taking pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. Also, they warned that everyone should avoid taking ephedrine or pseudoephedrine with other stimulants like caffeine. They also banned all products that contain both ephedrine (or pseudoephedrine) and caffeine.\nProducts whose only medicinal ingredient is pseudoephedrine must be kept behind the pharmacy counter. Products containing pseudoephedrine along with other medicinal ingredients may be displayed on store shelves but may be sold only in a pharmacy when a pharmacist is present.\nColombia.\nThe Colombian government prohibited the trade of pseudoephedrine in 2010.\nEstonia.\nPseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter drug in Estonia.\nFinland.\nPseudoephedrine medicines can only be obtained with a prescription in Finland.\nFrance.\nPseudoephedrine-containing combination products were available over-the-counter from pharmacies, most commonly with paracetamol, under the brand names \"Dolirhume\",\"Actifed Rhyme Jour et Nuit\" et al. Products combining pseudoephedrine and ibuprofen or certain antihistamines were also available (e.g. \"Rhinadvil\"). However, products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not sold. In October 2023, the French health department officially warned against the usage of pseudoephedrine for patients with a cold. It also suggested the substance's availability could be restricted in the future, pending its pharmaceutical re-evaluation on EU level.\nIn December 2024, the government announced pseudoephedrine medicines would henceforth only be obtainable with a prescription.\nGermany.\nVarious pseudoephedrine-containing products in combination with ibuprofen, aspirin, or antihistamines can be obtained without a prescription upon request at a pharmacy. Common names include Aspirin Complex, Reactine Duo, and RhinoPront. Products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not available.\nJapan.\nMedications that contain more than 10% pseudoephedrine are prohibited under the Stimulants Control Law in Japan.\nMexico.\nOn 23 November 2007, the use and trade of pseudoephedrine in Mexico was made illegal as it was argued that it was extremely popular as a precursor in the synthesis of methamphetamine.\nNetherlands.\nPseudoephedrine was withdrawn from sale in 1989 due to concerns about adverse cardiac side effects.\nNew Zealand.\nSince April 2024, pseudoephedrine has been classified as a restricted (pharmacist-only) drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 which allows the purchase of medicines containing pseudoephedrine from a pharmacist without a prescription.\nPseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and any product containing these substances, e.g. cold and flu medicines, were first classified in October 2004 as Class C Part III (partially exempted) controlled drugs, due to being the principal ingredient in methamphetamine. New Zealand Customs and police officers continued to make large interceptions of precursor substances believed to be destined for methamphetamine production. On 9 October 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced pseudoephedrine-based cold and flu tablets would become prescription-only drugs and reclassified as a class B2 drug. The law was amended by The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill 2010, which passed in August 2011.\nIn November 2023, the National-led coalition government announced that the sale of cold medication containing pseudoephedrine would be allowed (as part of the coalition agreement between the National and ACT parties).\nSwitzerland.\nPseudoephedrine is available without a prescription in combination (with aspirin) under the brand name \"Aspirin Complex.\" There is also a preparation consisting of a single ingredient 120\u00a0mg extended-release tablet that can be obtained at pharmacies with a prescription or after consultation with a pharmacist.\nTurkey.\nIn Turkey, medications containing pseudoephedrine are available by prescription only.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, pseudoephedrine is available over-the-counter under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist, or on prescription. In 2007, the MHRA reacted to concerns over the diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine by introducing voluntary restrictions limiting over-the-counter sales to one box containing no more than 720\u00a0mg of pseudoephedrine in total per transaction. These restrictions became law in April 2008. No form of ID is required.\nUnited States.\nFederal.\nThe United States Congress has recognized that pseudoephedrine is used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. In 2005, the Committee on Education and the Workforce heard testimony concerning education programs and state legislation designed to curb this illegal practice.\nAttempts to control the sale of the drug date back to 1986, when federal officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) first drafted legislation, later proposed by Senator Bob Dole, that would have placed several chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would have required each transaction involving pseudoephedrine to be reported to the government, and federal approval of all imports and exports. Fearing this would limit legitimate use of the drug, lobbyists from over-the-counter drug manufacturing associations sought to stop this legislation from moving forward and were successful in exempting from the regulations all chemicals that had been turned into a legal final product, such as Sudafed.\nBefore the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, sales of the drug became increasingly regulated, as DEA regulators and pharmaceutical companies continued to fight for their respective positions. The DEA continued to make greater progress in its attempts to control pseudoephedrine as methamphetamine production skyrocketed, becoming a serious problem in the western United States. When purity dropped, so did the number of people in rehab and people admitted to emergency rooms with methamphetamine in their systems. This reduction in purity was usually short-lived, however, as methamphetamine producers eventually found a way around the new regulations.\nCongress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA) as an amendment to the renewal of the USA Patriot Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on 6 March 2006, the act amended \u00a0https://, concerning the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. The law mandated two phases, the first needing to be implemented by 8 April 2006, and the second to be completed by 30 September 2006. The first phase dealt primarily with implementing the new buying restrictions based on the amount, while the second phase encompassed the requirements of storage, employee training, and record keeping. Though the law was mainly directed at pseudoephedrine products it also applies to all over-the-counter products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, their salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers.\nPseudoephedrine was defined as a \"scheduled listed chemical product\" under \u00a0https://(45(A)). The act included the following requirements for merchants (\"regulated sellers\") who sell such products:\nThe requirements were revised in the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2008 to require that a regulated seller of scheduled listed chemical products may not sell such a product unless the purchaser:\nState.\nMost states also have laws regulating pseudoephedrine.\nThe states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii (as of May\u00a01, 2009[ [update]]) Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana (as of August\u00a015, 2009[ [update]]), Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have laws requiring pharmacies to sell pseudoephedrine \"behind the counter.\" Though the drug can be purchased without a prescription, states can limit the number of units sold and can collect personal information from purchasers.\nThe states of Oregon and Mississippi previously required a prescription for the purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine. However, as of 1 January 2022, these restrictions have been repealed. The state of Oregon reduced the number of methamphetamine lab seizures from 448 in 2004 (the final full year before implementation of the prescription only law) to a new low of 13 in 2009. The decrease in meth lab incidents in Oregon occurred largely before the prescription-only law took effect, according to a NAMSDL report titled \"Pseudoephedrine Prescription Laws in Oregon and Mississippi\". The report posits that the decline in meth lab incidents in both states may be due to other factors: \"Mexican traffickers may have contributed to the decline in meth labs in Mississippi and Oregon (and surrounding states) as they were able to provide ample supply of equal or greater quality meth at competitive prices.\" Additionally, similar decreases in meth lab incidents were seen in surrounding states, according to the report, and meth-related deaths in Oregon have dramatically risen since 2007. Some municipalities in Missouri have enacted similar ordinances, including Washington, Union, New Haven, Cape Girardeau and Ozark. Certain pharmacies in Terre Haute, Indiana do so as well.\nAnother approach to controlling the drug on the state level mandated by some state governments to control the purchases of their citizens is the use of electronic tracking systems, which require the electronic submission of specified purchaser information by all retailers who sell pseudoephedrine. Thirty-two states now require the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx) to be used for every pseudoephedrine and ephedrine OTC purchase, and ten of the eleven largest pharmacy chains in the US voluntarily contribute all of their similar transactions to NPLEx. These states have seen dramatic results in reducing the number of methamphetamine laboratory seizures. Before the implementation of the system in Tennessee in 2005, methamphetamine laboratory seizures totaled 1,497 in 2004 but were reduced to 955 in 2005, and 589 in 2009. Kentucky's program was implemented statewide in 2008, and since statewide implementation, the number of laboratory seizures has significantly decreased. Oklahoma initially experienced success with its tracking system after implementation in 2006, as the number of seizures dropped in that year and again in 2007. In 2008, however, seizures began rising again, and have continued to rise in 2009.\nNPLEx appears to be successful by requiring the real-time submission of transactions, thereby enabling the relevant laws to be enforced at the point of sale. By creating a multi-state database and the ability to compare all transactions quickly, NPLEx enables pharmacies to deny purchases that would be illegal based on gram limits, age, or even to convicted meth offenders in some states. NPLEx also enforces the federal gram limits across state lines, which was impossible with state-operated systems. Access to the records is by law enforcement agencies only, through an online secure portal.\nResearch.\nPseudoephedrine has been studied in the treatment of snoring. However, data are inadequate to support this use.\nA study has found that pseudoephedrine can reduce milk production in breastfeeding women. This might have been due to suppression of prolactin secretion. Pseudoephedrine might be useful for lactation suppression.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The bomb squad arrives; Frank Glass (Steven Seagal) finds a bomb in the basement and works to disarm it while the SWAT team is in a shootout with the hostage takers. Glass disarms the bomb but deems it too easy, believing it was designed to mislead him. The real bomb detonates, killing everyone inside.\nA year later in San Francisco, narcotics cops Ray Nettles (Tom Sizemore) and partner Art \"Fuzzy\" Rice (Nas) arrest a suspect on drug charges. Ray lets a woman go who pleads for her and her child; Fuzzy tells Ray to get some help for his \"demons\" - he has never mourned the car bombing death of his wife and son. They see people entering a warehouse late at night and investigate. Ray apprehends a woman and three men converge on him; Fuzzy is shot by their leader (Dennis Hopper) and the three men flee. Ray arrests the woman, Claire (Jaime Pressly), but she refuses to say anything about the men. She is wearing an odd-looking bracelet which Nettles takes to the bomb squad for Glass to look over. The bracelet is found to contain detonation cord and Semtex explosive. The leader tells the police they have one hour to release Claire; when they do not, he bombs a bar.\nRay takes Glass back to the warehouse where they find a French cigarette and matchbook from a jazz club. They go to the club and kill one of the bombers, disarming his bomb. Ray questions Claire again; she reveals the bomber's names - Alex Swan, the leader, and Vershbow, the surviving member. She claims that no matter what happens, she will be killed for getting caught, and has decided to cooperate. Swan intends to plant a bomb at the police station, but Vershbow gets cold feet and forces Swan to give him the bomb at gunpoint. The police corner him and Glass apparently prevents the detonation, but Swan detonates several more bombs using a pay phone.\nSwan arranges a massive bombing with a crew led by Vincent Cruichshank (Ice-T). Ray convinces the police to release Claire, hoping to avert another bombing, and they give her a tracking device. Once she meets up with Swan, however, she disables the tracker and works with him. They discuss their upcoming \"masterpiece,\" and Claire goes to a phone booth to activate the bomb. She detonates a car bomb in Swan's car, instead. Confused, Glass tells Ray they must both be dead. Seeing City Hall on TV, Ray remembers Claire's story about her husband and realizes she was the mastermind all along. They rush to City Hall and split up - Ray goes to the basement and Glass to the roof. Ray is forced to disarm a bomb with advice over the radio from Glass, who coaches him to relax and forget his grief, but the device is a decoy. Glass disarms the real bomb on the roof.\nProduction.\nIn May 2000, it was reported that Artisan Entertainment had entered into a pact with Nu Image for domestic distribution of \"Ticker\", an action thriller starring Steven Seagal to be directed by Albert Pyun. Emmett/Furla Oasis backed the film under their Family Room Entertainment Banner with Tom Sizemore having come aboard to co-star in the film. Dennis Hopper was announced to have joined the film the following month. \nPost-production.\nDuring post-production, Nu-Image dictated many changes that Pyun denounced as \"Horrible\" particularly the removal of character building scenes for Seagal as according to Pyun Nu-Image just wanted him fighting against both Pyun and Seagal's wishes. Pyun's director's cut would later be posted to Vimeo under the title of \u201cTICKER\u201d Anti-Studio Director\u2019s Cut, but the link is now dead.\nRelease.\n\"Ticker\" was given a straight-to-video release in the United States on November 13, 2001.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Seagal plays Orin Boyd, a Detroit police detective notorious for pushing the limits of the law in his quest for justice. The screenplay is based on a novel of the same name by John Westermann.\nThis is the second of three films directed by Bartkowiak and produced by Silver that focus on martial arts-based action in an urban setting with a hip-hop soundtrack, following \"Romeo Must Die\" (2000) and preceding \"Cradle 2 the Grave\" (2003). The three films feature many of the same cast, key crew, and locations.\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. It earned $19 million in its opening weekend, and went on to gross a worldwide total of $79.9 million against a budget of $33 million. \"Exit Wounds\" was the final film under Steven Seagal's exclusive contract with Warner Bros.\nPlot.\nDetroit Police Department's detective Orin Boyd is a cop in Detroit's 21st precinct, who saves the Vice President of the United States from a right-wing militant group trying to kill him. Because he disobeyed orders, however, Captain Frank Daniels transfers Boyd to the 15th precinct \u2014 the city's worst.\nBoyd's new captain, former internal affairs officer Annette Mulcahy, knows of his reputation, and she tells him that she will not tolerate insubordination. Annette sends Boyd to an anger management class where he meets Henry Wayne, the high-strung host of a local talk show called \"Detroit AM\". Boyd comes across local drug dealer Latrell Walker and his fast-talking sidekick T.K. Johnson doing a shady deal with a man named Matt Montini. After a brief fight, Boyd discovers that Montini has been working undercover trying to nail Walker and Boyd ruined the sting, and that does not sit well with Montini's musclebound partner Useldinger.\nSergeant Lewis Strutt steps in to cool things down when Boyd gets in a fight with Useldinger. After Boyd stumbles upon the theft of $5,000,000 worth of heroin from evidence storage, Boyd and new partner George Clark begin focusing their efforts on Walker and T.K. Intrigued by what little they have on Walker, they investigate why he has been visiting Shaun Rollins. Henry discovers that Walker is not a drug dealer, but a computer expert and billionaire whose real name is Leon Rollins, Shaun Rollins' brother. After an attempt on his life, Boyd confronts Leon, who explains that a group of corrupt cops needed a fall guy for a deal gone bad and pinned it on Shaun. It is further revealed that Strutt is the leader of the group, which also includes Montini and Useldinger. Leon and his friend Trish have been videotaping the activities of Strutt's gang, hoping that it might help prove Shaun's innocence and get him out of jail.\nBoyd meets Mulcahy at a parking lot to inform her what he has uncovered. Montini, Useldinger, and some other men try to kill Boyd and Annette. Mulcahy is killed in the chase and Boyd escapes. Boyd calls Frank and tells him that Strutt will be having a meeting at a warehouse in about an hour, to sell the heroin that was stolen. Strutt plans to try to sell it to Leon and T. K., not knowing that Leon is working against him. Frank promises that he will be there with some backup.\nBoyd and Daniels show up, but Strutt tells Frank to keep Boyd under control. Boyd realizes that it is Frank who is behind everything. Clark blows open the door and barges in with backup, including police chief Hinges. Useldinger shoots Boyd and as he is about to shoot him again, Clark shoots Useldinger dead. Chief Hinges kills Frank by shooting him four times with a shotgun. After a fight with Boyd, Strutt grabs a case full of money and runs up to the roof, where a helicopter is waiting. Montini gets the upper hand in his fight with Leon after he damages Leon's vision with indigo fabric dye. Leon manages to stab Montini in the leg with a piece of broken glass, before killing him by having his neck impaled on a clothes rack. As the helicopter ladder is dragging Boyd across the roof with Strutt hanging on to the ladder, Boyd hooks the ladder to the roof; Strutt falls and is impaled on a metal pipe.\nAt dawn, Leon gives Hinges the videotape that proves the corruption, hoping that the tape will help prove Shaun's innocence. Hinges does not believe the courts will care about the tape, so he had Shaun released from county about an hour before. Boyd decides to stay with the 15th precinct with George as his partner, and T.K. becomes Henry's television co-host.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Steven Seagal as Detective Orin Boyd\nProduction.\nThe film is based on the book of the same name by John Westermann. The book is set in Long Island, New York, but the film moves the setting to Detroit. Seagal signed on to the film under a pay-or-play deal.\nFilming took place in 2000 in Toronto, Ontario; Hamilton, Ontario and the Centre Street Bridge in Calgary, Alberta. The club scene inside was filmed at Guvernment nightclub in Toronto. The exterior of the club was outside of Tonic nightclub in Toronto.\nThe film reunites actors DMX, Isaiah Washington, and Anthony Anderson with Polish film director Andrzej Bartkowiak, with whom they first worked together on the earlier 2000 film \"Romeo Must Die\". It is the second of three films directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak and produced by Joel Silver that focus on martial arts based action in an urban setting with a hip-hop soundtrack and featuring many of the same cast. Two years later they collaborated again on the film \"Cradle 2 the Grave\".\nEva Mendes' voice was dubbed over by another, unidentified actress without her prior knowledge, as producers felt Mendes didn't sound \"intelligent enough\".\nDion Lam was the film's martial arts choreographer.\nAccident on set.\nStuntman Chris Lamon died of head injuries on August 23, 2000, six days after a stunt went wrong on the \"Exit Wounds\" set in Hamilton, Ontario. A van was being towed along a street upside-down as part of a chase scene; he was supposed to roll safely out, but apparently struck his head. Another stuntman suffered a concussion in the same incident.\nMusic.\nA soundtrack containing hip hop music was released on March 20, 2001, by Virgin Records.

It was hailed as Seagal's big \"comeback\".\nCritical response.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 35% based on 63 reviews. The site's critical consensus states: \"It probably goes without saying that \"Exit Wounds\" is loaded with plotholes and bad dialogue.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 39 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.\nLawrence Van Gelder of \"The New York Times\" gave the film 3 out of 5 and wrote: \"For those in search of action-filled escapist entertainment who are willing to jettison expectations of credibility into the nearest popcorn tub, Exit Wounds ... will do to pass time on an inclement day.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote: \"In its low grade way, this blithely brutal cops and drugs thriller is an efficient hot wire entertainment.\" Gleiberman singled out Jill Hennessy for praise, saying that she \"takes the minor character of Seagal's precinct commander and invests her with an intelligence and a flirty warm panache that sparkles on screen.\"\nTodd McCarthy of \"Variety magazine\" gave the film a negative review, particularly Seagal's performance saying he \"makes one wonder how he ever managed to be regarded as anything resembling a movie star.\" McCarthy complained that the action scenes were \"routine and unimaginative\" lacking the flair director Bartkowiak had shown in \"Romeo Must Die\". McCarthy was also critical of unconvincing use of easily recognizable Toronto locations as a stand in for Detroit.\nJonathan Foreman of \"The New York Post\" suggests that Barkowiak was trying to make a John Woo movie but simply did not have the skills. Foreman called the screenplay \"embarrassingly clunky and inane\". He concludes, \"It's hard to know which is more offensive, \"Exit Wounds'\" ineptitude or its disgusting, cynical brutality. But the people responsible for it are crass and shameless.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hubbard's assistant Donny Johnson, and 49er Six, the team finds Lester, and they want him to give up the location of his hidden stash of gold. When Lester will not tell them, Donny shoots a nearby priest and threatens to kill others if the information is not delivered.\nDonny's plan is disrupted, however, when Sasha decides to step in and fight back. With the 49ers having strapped Jane to the electric chair and threaten to kill her, while Ellen and her team prepare a rescue plan from the mainland, Sasha extracts Lester and plans to use him later in a prisoner exchange with Jane. After Nick helps Sasha get away from Donny, Sasha reveals his true identity along with the fact he used Nick to get to Sonny Eckvall, on whom he seeks revenge on for the death of his wife.\nWith the help of Nick and some of the other inmates such as Twitch and Little Joe, Sasha sets out to rescue Jane and bring Donny down, before Alcatraz becomes everyone's final resting place. The conflict culminates in the 49ers taking McPherson and Lester on a helicopter and departing with Sasha in pursuit. Donny attempts to buy time by throwing MacPherson out of the helicopter, but Sacha dives after her and manages to save her using a parachute. Lester reveals that he was previously given an improvised bomb vest of grenades that he sets off, killing himself and Donny. Sasha subsequently leads the investigators to the gold, as Lester told him the location before his death.\nA month later, Nick, having previously learnt of Sasha's reasons for hunting Sonny, is still recovering in prison, but is informed in a meeting with Sasha that he is being released early for his role in the hostage crisis.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nThe film was at one stage known as \"Lockdown\" and was shot in Germany.\nRelease.\nHome media.\nThe film was released on DVD in the US on March 4, 2003.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Half Past Dead\" was released on November 15, 2002, in the United States, where it grossed $7.8 million on its opening weekend.

Goldstein was a supporter of Kach, a religious Zionist party that the United States, the European Union and other countries designate as a terrorist organization.&lt;ref name=\"eu-2009/67/CFSP\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kach was banned less than a month after Goldstein's attacks on account of statements made in support of his actions.\nBorn in 1956 in Brooklyn, New York, to an Orthodox Jewish family, Goldstein received his education there, starting with Jewish scripture studies, and eventually studying medicine at Yeshiva University. In the United States, he was a member of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a militant Jewish organization founded by his boyhood acquaintance Meir Kahane. In 1983, Goldstein immigrated to Israel, and served as a physician in the Israeli military, during which he refused to treat Arabs, including those serving as soldiers. Later, he worked as a physician, and lived in the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Goldstein was active in Kahane's Kach party, and was third on the party list for the Knesset during the 1984 elections.\nOn February 25, 1994, Goldstein dressed in an Israeli military uniform, entered a mosque in the Cave of the Patriarchs and opened fire on the 800 Palestinian Muslim worshippers praying there during the month of Ramadan, killing 29 and wounding 125\u00a0worshippers, until he was beaten to death by survivors.\nGoldstein's gravesite became a pilgrimage site for Jewish extremists. The following words are inscribed on the tomb: \"He gave his life for the people of Israel, its Torah and land.\" In 1999, after the passing of Israeli legislation outlawing monuments to terrorists, the Israeli Army dismantled the shrine that had been built to Goldstein at the site of his interment. The tombstone and its epitaph, calling Goldstein a martyr with clean hands and a pure heart, was left untouched. After the flagstones around it were removed, the ground was covered with gravel.\nEarly life and education.\nGoldstein was born on December 9, 1956, as Benjamin Goldstein in Brooklyn, New York, to an Orthodox Jewish family. He attended the Yeshiva of Flatbush religious day school. He studied medicine at Yeshiva University, receiving a medical degree from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He belonged to the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a militant Jewish organization founded by his boyhood acquaintance Meir Kahane.\nImmigration to Israel.\nGoldstein immigrated to Israel in 1983. He served as a physician in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), first as a conscript, then in the reserve forces. Following the end of his active duty, Goldstein worked as a physician, and lived in the Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron, where he worked as an emergency doctor, and was involved in treating victims of Arab-Israeli violence. He changed his name from Benjamin to Baruch, married a Soviet immigrant named Miriam, and had four children. Israeli press reports claimed that Goldstein refused to treat Arabs, even Arab soldiers serving in the IDF, believing it was against Jewish laws to treat non-Jews even for payment. This was also reflected in comments by his acquaintances. Goldstein was active in Kahane's Kach party, and was third on the party list for the Knesset during the 1984 elections.\nHe compared Israel's democracy to the Nazi regime, and often wore a yellow star with the word \"JUDE\" on it.\nMassacre.\nOn February 25, 1994, that year's Purim day, Goldstein entered a room in the Cave of the Patriarchs that was serving as a mosque, wearing an Israeli army uniform \"with the insignia of rank, creating the image of a reserve officer on active duty\". He then opened fire, killing 29 worshippers and wounding more than 125. Mosque guard Mohammad Suleiman Abu Saleh said he thought that Goldstein was trying to kill as many people as possible, and described how there were \"bodies and blood everywhere\". Eventually, Goldstein was overcome and beaten to death by survivors of the massacre. According to Ian Lustick, \"By mowing down Arabs he believed wanted to kill Jews, Goldstein was re-enacting part of the Purim story.\"\nPalestinian protests and riots immediately followed the shooting; in the following week, twenty-five Palestinians were killed (by the Israel Defense Forces), as well as five Israelis. Following the riots, the Israeli government imposed a two-week curfew on the 120,000 Palestinian residents of Hebron. The 400 Jewish settlers of H2 were free to move around. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin telephoned Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat, and described the attack as a \"loathsome, criminal act of murder\". In an address to the Knesset, Rabin, addressing not just Goldstein and his legacy but also other militant settlers, stated: \n\"You are not part of the community of Israel\u00a0... You are not part of the national democratic camp which we all belong to in this house, and many of the people despise you. You are not partners in the Zionist enterprise. You are a foreign implant. You are an errant weed. Sensible Judaism spits you out. You placed yourself outside the wall of Jewish law\u00a0... We say to this horrible man and those like him: you are a shame on Zionism and an embarrassment to Judaism.\"\nThe Israeli government condemned the massacre, and responded by arresting followers of Meir Kahane, forbidding certain settlers from entering Arab towns, and demanding that those settlers turn in their army-issued rifles, though rejecting a PLO demand that settlers be disarmed and that an international force be created to protect Palestinians. Goldstein was immediately \"denounced with shocked horror even by the mainstream Orthodox\", and many in Israel classified Goldstein as insane.\nGravesite and shrine.\nIsraeli military authorities refused to allow Goldstein to be buried in the Jewish cemetery in Hebron. He was buried opposite the Meir Kahane Memorial Park in Kiryat Arba, a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. The park is named in memory of Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the Israeli far-right political party Kach, a group classified by the United States and Israeli governments as a terrorist group. Goldstein was a long-time devotee of Kahane.\nThe gravesite has become a pilgrimage site for Jewish extremists; a plaque near the grave reads, \"To the holy Baruch Goldstein, who gave his life for the Jewish people, the Torah, and the nation of Israel\". According to Baruch Marzel, about 10,000 people had visited the grave by the year 2000. In 1996, members of the Labor Party called for the shrine-like landscaped prayer area near the grave to be removed, and Israeli security officials expressed concern that the grave would encourage extremists. In 1999, following passage of a law designed to prohibit monuments to terrorists, and an associated Supreme Court ruling, the Israeli Army bulldozed the shrine and prayer area set up near Goldstein's grave. As of 2014, a new tomb has been built, and still receives visits from Jewish pilgrims.\nVeneration by extremists.\nWhile mainstream Jewish religious leaders, including the chief rabbis of Israel, rejected the suggestion that killing Palestinians was authorized by the Torah, some extremist religious Jews have defended Goldstein's actions.\nAt Goldstein's funeral, Rabbi Yaacov Perrin claimed that even one million Arabs are \"not worth a Jewish fingernail\". Samuel Hacohen, a teacher at a Jerusalem college, declared Goldstein the \"greatest Jew alive, not in one way, but in every way\", and said that he was \"the only one who could do it, the only one who was 100 percent perfect\". Rabbi Dov Lior of Kiryat Arba declared that Goldstein was \"holier than all the martyrs of the Holocaust\".\nIn the weeks following the massacre, hundreds of Israelis traveled to Goldstein's grave to celebrate his actions. Some Hasidim danced and sang around his grave. According to one visitor to the gravesite in the wake of the attacks, \"If [Goldstein] stopped these so-called peace talks, then he is truly holy because this is not real peace.\" Some visitors declared Goldstein a \"saint\" and \"hero of Israel\".\nThe phenomenon of the veneration of Goldstein's tomb persisted for years. Even after the dismantling of Goldstein's shrine in 1999, radical Jewish settlers continued to celebrate the anniversary of the massacre in the West Bank, sometimes even dressing up themselves or their children to look like Goldstein.\nIn 2010, Jewish settlers sang songs in praise of Baruch Goldstein's massacre demonstratively in front of their Arab neighbours, during celebrations of Purim. A phrase from one song reads, \"Dr. Goldstein, there is none other like you in the world. Dr. Goldstein, we all love you\u00a0... He aimed at terrorists' heads, squeezed the trigger hard, and shot bullets, and shot, and shot.\"\nPrior to entering the Knesset, Otzma Yehudit party leader and current Israeli Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir displayed a portrait of Goldstein in his living room. It was removed when Ben-Gvir entered politics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
