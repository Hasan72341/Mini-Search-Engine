The screenplay is by George Axelrod, based on the 1959 Richard Condon novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\". The film's leading actors are Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, and Janet Leigh, with co-stars Angela Lansbury, Henry Silva, and James Gregory.\nThe plot centers on Korean War veteran Raymond Shaw, part of a prominent political family. Shaw is brainwashed by communists after his Army platoon is captured. He returns to civilian life in the United States, where he becomes an unwitting assassin in an international communist conspiracy. The group, which includes representatives of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Soviet Union, plans to assassinate the presidential nominee of an American political party, with the death leading to the overthrow of the U.S. government.\nThe film was released in the United States on October 24, 1962, at the height of U.S.\u2013Soviet hostility during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was widely acclaimed by Western critics and was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress (Angela Lansbury) and Best Editing. It was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nSoviet and Chinese soldiers capture a U.S. Army platoon during the Korean War, taking them to communist China. Three days later, Sergeant Raymond Shaw and Captain Bennett \"Ben\" Marco return to UN lines. Upon Marco's recommendation, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor for saving his soldiers' lives in combat, though two men were killed. Shaw returns to the U.S., where his mother, Eleanor Iselin, exploits his heroism to further the political career of her husband, Senator John Iselin. When asked to describe Shaw, two soldiers in his unit uniformly respond that he is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being they have ever known. In fact, Shaw is a strict, cold, unsympathetic loner hated by his men.\nAfter Marco is promoted to major and assigned to Army Intelligence, he has a recurring nightmare: a hypnotized Shaw blithely murders two soldiers from his platoon before an assembly of communist military leaders to demonstrate their revolutionary brainwashing technique.\nDuring captivity, Shaw was programmed as a sleeper agent, who obeys orders to kill and immediately forgets having done so. His heroism is a false memory implanted during the brainwashing. Agents trigger Shaw by suggesting he play solitaire; the queen of diamonds activates him. Meanwhile, Eleanor is masterminding John's political ascent with his baseless claims that communists work at the Defense Department (a clear parallel to the demagogic activities of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in the early 1950s). To spite his mother and stepfather, Shaw takes a job at a newspaper published by Holborn Gaines, Iselin's harshest critic. Communist agents later have Shaw murder Gaines to confirm that his brainwashing still works.\nChunjin, a North Korean agent who posed as a guide for Shaw's platoon, arrives at Shaw's apartment asking for work. The unsuspecting Shaw hires him as a valet and cook. Marco recognizes Chunjin when he visits Shaw; he violently attacks him and demands to know what happened during the platoon's captivity. After Marco is arrested for assault, Eugenie \"Rosie\" Cheyney, an attractive young woman he met on the train, posts his bail. Marco learns that Allen Melvin, a fellow soldier, has the same nightmare. When Melvin and Marco separately identify identical photos of the two male communist leaders from their dreams, Army Intelligence agrees to investigate.\nShaw rekindles a romance with Jocelyn Jordan, the daughter of liberal Senator Thomas Jordan, the Iselins' chief political foe. Eleanor wants to garner Senator Jordan's support for Iselin's vice-presidential bid. Unswayed, Jordan insists he will oppose the nomination. After Jocelyn inadvertently triggers Shaw's programming by wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume at the Iselins' party, they elope. Furious at Senator Jordan's rebuff, Eleanor\u2014who is Shaw's American \"operator\" (handler)\u2014sends him to kill Senator Jordan at his home. Shaw also kills Jocelyn when she inadvertently happens upon the murder scene. Having no memory of the killing, Shaw is grief-stricken upon learning they are dead.\nAfter discovering the queen of diamonds card's role in Shaw's conditioning, Marco uses a forcing deck to deprogram him, hoping to learn Shaw's next assignment. Eleanor primes Shaw to assassinate their party's presidential nominee during the convention so that Iselin, as the vice-presidential candidate, will become the nominee by default. In the uproar, he will seek emergency powers to establish a strict authoritarian regime. Eleanor tells Shaw that she had requested a programmed assassin, never knowing it would be her own son. When taking power, she vows revenge upon her superiors for choosing him.\nDisguised as a priest, Shaw enters Madison Square Garden, taking a sniper's position in a vacant overhead spotlight booth. Marco and his supervisor, Colonel Milt, race to the convention to stop Shaw. At the last moment, Shaw aims away from the presidential nominee and instead kills Senator Iselin and Eleanor. When Marco bursts into the booth, Shaw, wearing the Medal of Honor, says he was the only one who could stop his mother and stepfather, then kills himself. Later that evening with Rosie, Marco mourns Shaw's death.\nThe title of the book and film thus refers not to the assassin Raymond but to Senator Iselin, a so-called anti-Communist whose political rise was actually engineered by means of a Communist plot originating in Manchuria, making Iselin the \"Manchurian Candidate.\" Author Richard Condon intended his book partially as an ironic comment on the anti-Communist hysteria of \"McCarthyism,\" although this aspect of the story was played down somewhat in the film version.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Frank Sinatra as Major Bennett Marco\nProduction.\nSinatra suggested Lucille Ball for the role of Eleanor Iselin, but Frankenheimer, who had worked with Lansbury in \"All Fall Down\", insisted that Sinatra watch her performance in that film before a final choice was made. Although Lansbury played Raymond Shaw's mother, she was, in fact, only three years older than Laurence Harvey, who played Shaw. An early scene in which Shaw, recently decorated with the Medal of Honor, argues with his parents, was filmed in Sinatra's own private plane.\nJanet Leigh plays Marco's love interest. In a short biography of Leigh broadcast on Turner Classic Movies, her daughter, actress Jamie Lee Curtis, reveals that Leigh had been served divorce papers on behalf of her father, actor Tony Curtis, the morning that the scene where Marco and her character first meet on a train was filmed.\nIn the scene where Marco attempts to deprogram Shaw in a hotel room opposite the convention, Sinatra is at times slightly out of focus. It was a first take, and Sinatra failed to be as effective in subsequent retakes, a common factor in his film performances. In the end, Frankenheimer elected to use the out-of-focus take. Critics subsequently praised him for showing Marco from Shaw's distorted point of view.\nIn the novel, Eleanor Iselin's father had sexually abused her as a child. Before the dramatic climax, she uses her son's brainwashing to have sex with him. Concerned with the reaction to even a reference to a taboo topic such as incest in a mainstream film at that time, the filmmakers instead had Eleanor kiss Shaw on the lips to imply her incestuous attraction to him.\nNearly half the film's $2.2 million production budget went to Sinatra's salary for his performance.\nIt is now commonly rated PG-13.\nCold War.\n\"The Manchurian Candidate\" has been called one of the most \"iconic\" films of the Cold War period, especially in its discussion of \"mind-control.\" With one of the major plot points being the popular Cold War myth that China was brainwashing US soldiers for communist purposes during the Korean War. Political scientist Michael Rogin further cements the film in this time period by describing it as being \"a Kennedy Administration film.\" Rogin cites Sinatra's character within the film as being a \"lonely Kennedy Hero,\" who works within the army bureaucracy towards reform.\nDepiction of communists.\nIn the garden scene, pictures of Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin are hung on the wall with a Soviet star in between them and the head of the Manchurian candidates standing beneath the star. This insinuates a collaboration between China and Russia with the goal to manipulate the US for communist world domination. During their demonstration, the communist leaders refer to Raymond as \"the mechanism\" and \"the weapon\", which affirms the idea that communists only see people as gadgets that can be thrown away after their use. The film depicts communists as eager to give up their lives, which are expendable in their eyes anyway, for the cause of universal communism, which is a \"less than essential end\".\nIn \"The Manchurian Candidate\", communists are not peers, but instead relate to each other within the hierarchy of communist leaders. For example, there are rows of communist leaders who all look down upon the Manchurian Candidates in the garden scene. In addition, Raymond Shaw\u2019s mother only uses those around her, such as her son and husband, as pawns in her communist ploy to gain a powerful position through her husband\u2019s candidacy for Vice President of the US. This is juxtaposed with loving, trusting, and open relationships such as those between Shaw and Jocelyn Jordan, and Marco and Cheyney.\nConspiracy theories and US mind control.\n\"The Manchurian Candidate\" uses \"science, the conditioned subject, and the moving image\" to create a realistic framework for the existence of mind control. Specifically, it plays on the idea of a \"covert sphere\" of communism within the US, mixing real life events with those out of science fiction. This theme added to the growing suspicion of the US government, redirecting concerns of possible brainwashing toward the homefront. Janja Lalich, a counter-cult sociologist, notes that the term \"brainwashing\" used by this counterculture movement was first made popular by \"The Manchurian Candidate\". The ever growing fear that anyone, even a decorated soldier like Raymond Shaw, could be coerced unwittingly by communists contributed to the United States\u2019 expansion of their own mind control experiments. In 1975, a little over ten years after the release of \"The Manchurian Candidate\", the fear of a US-funded mind control scheme would come true with the reveal of Project MKUltra, in which the CIA looked to control human behavior through trauma programming and psychoactive drugs starting in the early 1950s and ending in 1973. According to the CIA, \"historians have asserted that creating a 'Manchurian Candidate' subject through 'mind control' techniques was a goal of MK-ULTRA and related CIA projects.\"\nReception.\nBox office.\nIn the United States and Canada, for its original release, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" netted $3.3million in distributor rentals, against a budget of $2.2million. After Sinatra\u00a0\u2013 who owned the film rights\u00a0\u2013 allowed re-release in 1988, followed by other theatrical re-releases, the film has grossed $7.7million.\nCritical response.\n\"The Manchurian Candidate\" was praised by critics for its performances, direction, themes, satire, editing and visuals. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 94 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating .\nCritic Pauline Kael attributed the strength of the film less to its directing than to the power of its script.\nWriting an extensive retrospective analysis in 2003, film critic Roger Ebert addressed the many elements that led him to rate \"The Manchurian Candidate\" one of the 'Great Movies'\u00a0\u2013 films he gave his maximum 4 stars out of 4; he declared it \"inventive and frisky, takes enormous chances with the audience, and plays not like a 'classic', but as a work as alive and smart as when it was first released\".\nAcademic response.\nScholars have used \"The Manchurian Candidate\" as a window into Cold War paranoia. Professor Catherine Canino claimed that the film fulfilled the prophecies of \"the imagined loss of cherished American autonomy and free will\". Political scientist Michael Rogin concluded that \"The Manchurian Candidate\" \"aims to reawaken a lethargic nation to a communist menace\". Humanities Center director [Timothy Melley] argued that \"\"The Manchurian Candidate\"'s deepest worry is neither communism nor anticommunism but embattled human autonomy.\"\nAwards and honours.\nIn 1994, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film ranked 67th on the \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies\" when that list was first compiled in 1998, but a 2007 revised version excluded it. It was 17th on AFI's \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills\" lists. In April 2007, Lansbury's character was selected by \"Time\" as one of the 25 greatest villains in cinema history.\nReleases.\nAccording to a false rumor, Sinatra removed the film from distribution after John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. According to Michael Schlesinger, who was responsible for the film's 1988 reissue by MGM/UA, the film was never removed. Newspaper display ads indicate that after the assassination, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" was rereleased less frequently or widely than other 1962 movies, but it was available. The movie played at a Brooklyn cinema in January 1964, and that same month in White Plains, New York, and Jersey City, New Jersey. It was televised nationwide on \"CBS Thursday Night Movie\" on September 16, 1965.\nSinatra's representatives acquired rights to the film in 1972 after the initial contract with United Artists expired. The film was rebroadcast on nationwide television in April 1974 on \"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies\". After a showing at the New York Film Festival in 1987 increased public interest in the film, the studio reacquired the rights and it became again available for theater and video releases.\nOn March 15, 2016, The Criterion Collection issued a Blu-Ray of the film. In June 2023, Kino Lorber issued a 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray of the film.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58155", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58155", "title": "Army of Northern Virginia", "text": "Field army of the Confederate States\nMilitary unit\nThe Army of Northern Virginia was a field army of the Confederate States Army in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War and one of the most storied military organizations in American history. It was also the primary command structure of the Department of Northern Virginia. It was most often arrayed against the Union's Army of the Potomac.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe name Army of Northern Virginia referred to its primary area of operation, which was typical of most Confederate States Army names. The Army originated as the Army of the Potomac, which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in Northern Virginia. On July 20 and July 21, the Army of the Shenandoah and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the Army of the Northwest were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed the Army of Northern Virginia on March 14. The Army of the Peninsula was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\nRobert E. Lee's biographer, Douglas S. Freeman, asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862. However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Joseph E. Johnston, his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect.\nIn addition to Virginians, it included regiments from all over the Confederacy, some from as far away as Georgia, Texas, and Arkansas. One of the most well known was the Texas Brigade, made up of the 1st, 4th, and 5th Texas, and the 3rd Arkansas, which distinguished themselves in numerous battles, such as during their fight for the Devil's Den at the Battle of Gettysburg. Although West Virginia became a Union state in 1863, Virginia's western counties had contributed between 20,000 and 22,000 men. They greatly outnumbered their Union counterparts at Gettysburg, though the latter received four monuments from West Virginia. Missouri was also represented by a company of cavalry known as the 1st Missouri Cavalry, Co. A. They suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of New Market in 1864.\nBeauregard's command.\nThe first commander of the Army of Northern Virginia was General P. G. T. Beauregard, under its previous name, the Confederate Army of the Potomac, from June 20 to July 20, 1861. His forces consisted of six brigades, with various militia and artillery from the former Department of Alexandria. During his command, Beauregard is noted for creating the battle flag of the army, which came to be the primary battle flag for all corps and forces under the Army of Northern Virginia. The flag was designed due to confusion during battle between the Confederate Stars and Bars flag and the flag of the United States. Beauregard continued commanding these troops as the new First Corps under Gen. Joseph E. Johnston as it was joined by the Army of the Shenandoah on July 20, 1861, when command was relinquished to Johnston. The following day this army fought its first major engagement in the First Battle of Manassas.\nJohnston's command.\nWith the merging of the Army of the Shenandoah, General Joseph E. Johnston took command from July 20, 1861, until May 31, 1862.\nWing organization under Johnston 1862.\nUnder the command of Joseph E. Johnston, the Army immediately entered into the First Battle of Manassas. On October 22, 1861, the Department of Northern Virginia was officially created, officially ending the Army of the Potomac. The department comprised three districts: Aquia District, Potomac District, and the Valley District. In April 1862, the department was expanded to include the Departments of Norfolk and the Peninsula (of Virginia). Johnston was eventually forced into maneuvering the Army southward to the defenses of Richmond during the opening of the Peninsula Campaign, where it conducted delay and defend tactics until Johnston was severely wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines.\nDuring the months after the First Battle of Bull Run, Johnston organized his Shenandoah Army and Beauregard's Potomac Army into two divisions under a unified command with Gustavus W. Smith and James Longstreet as division commanders. Beauregard quarreled with Johnston and was transferred to the Western theater over the winter months. Stonewall Jackson was sent to the Shenandoah Valley in October 1861, initially with his own old Stonewall Brigade and later with two other brigades from Western Virginia. Several newly arrived brigades were added to Johnston's army in late 1861-early 1862.\nWhen the Peninsula Campaign began, Johnston took his army down to the Richmond environs where it was merged with several smaller Confederate commands, including a division led by D.H. Hill as well as Benjamin Huger's Department of Norfolk, John Magruder's Army of the Peninsula, and miscellaneous brigades and regiments pulled from various Southern states. Richard Ewell was elevated to division command in the spring of 1862 and sent to join Jackson in the Valley.\nOn May 27, an additional new division was created and led by A.P. Hill consisting of several new brigades from the Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia, soon augmented with James Archer's brigade from Smith's division. At Seven Pines, Longstreet and Smith served as temporary wing commanders, and operational control of their divisions went to Brig. Gen William H.C. Whiting and Brig. Gen Richard H. Anderson.\nSmith's temporary command.\nMaj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith commanded the Army of Northern Virginia on May 31, 1862, following the wounding of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston during the Battle of Seven Pines. With Smith seemingly having a nervous breakdown, President Jefferson Davis drafted orders to place Gen. Robert E. Lee in command the following day.\nLee's command.\nOn June 1, 1862, General Robert E. Lee, its final and best known leader historically, took command after Johnston was wounded and Smith suffered what may have been a nervous breakdown at the Battle of Seven Pines. William Whiting received permanent command of Smith's division, while Richard Anderson reverted to brigade command. Longstreet served as a wing commander for part of the Seven Days Battles and Anderson had operational command of the division at Glendale.\nThe cavalry, organized into a division on August 17, 1862, and into a corps on September 9, 1863, was commanded by Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart until May 11, 1864 (the day he was mortally wounded). The cavalry corps was then temporarily split into divisions, but was merged again on August 11, 1864, under command of Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III. The Reserve Artillery was commanded by Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton for most of the war.\nDuring the Seven Days Battles, Lee had eleven separate divisions under his command. Aside from the original core army that had been led by Johnston, there were assorted other commands from the Richmond area and North Carolina, as well as Jackson's Valley Army. The inexperience and poor coordination of the army led to the failure of Lee's plans to destroy the Army of the Potomac. As soon as the Seven Days Battles were over, Lee reorganized his army into two corps commanded by Jackson and Longstreet. He removed several generals who had turned in a less-than-inspiring performance in the Seven Days Battles, including John Magruder and Benjamin Huger.\nJackson had five divisions, the commands of A.P. Hill, Ewell, D.H. Hill, and Winder. Longstreet had six divisions commanded by Richard Anderson (formerly Benjamin Huger's division), Cadmus M. Wilcox, James L. Kemper (each commanding half of Longstreet's former division), John Bell Hood (formerly William Whiting's division), David Rumph Jones, and Lafayette McLaws. D.H. Hill's and McLaws's divisions were left behind in the Richmond area and did not participate in the Northern Virginia campaign. The army was also joined for the Northern Virginia and Maryland Campaigns by Nathan G. Evans's independent South Carolina brigade and a North Carolina brigade led by Brig. Gen Thomas Drayton.\nDuring the Maryland campaign, D.H. Hill rejoined the main army along with Lafayette McLaws. Kemper's division was merged with the division of David R. Jones, a more senior, experienced officer, and Kemper reverted to brigade command. In addition, Robert Ransom commanded two brigades from the Department of North Carolina. At Antietam, Longstreet commanded the divisions of Anderson, McLaws, Jones, Hood, and Ransom while Jackson had the divisions of John R. Jones, Alexander Lawton, A.P. Hill, and D.H. Hill.\nThe Northern Virginia and Maryland Campaigns still showed numerous defects in the organization and leadership of the Army of Northern Virginia, particularly the high rate of straggling and desertion during the invasion of Maryland. Lee had fewer than 40,000 men on the field at Antietam, the smallest his army would be until the Appomattox Campaign.\nDuring the Fredericksburg Campaign, Longstreet had the divisions of Anderson, Hood, McLaws, Ransom, and George Pickett, who had just returned to action after months of convalescence from a wound sustained at the Battle of Gaines's Mill. Jackson had the divisions of D.H. Hill, A.P. Hill, Jubal Early, and Elisha Paxton. Robert Ransom's division returned to North Carolina after Fredericksburg. D.H. Hill also departed after quarreling with Lee.\nIn the Chancellorsville Campaign, Longstreet was sent with Pickett and Hood to the Richmond area. His other two divisions remained with the main army; they were directly commanded by Lee during this time. Robert Rodes took over D.H. Hill's division. Jackson was mortally wounded during the Battle of Chancellorsville. Afterwards, Lee divided the army into three corps with three divisions each. Longstreet got the divisions of Pickett, McLaws, and Hood; A.P. Hill got the divisions of Harry Heth, William D. Pender, and Richard Anderson; and Richard Ewell (returning to action after almost a year of recovering from the loss of a leg at Second Bull Run) got the divisions of Robert Rodes, Jubal Early, and Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson. A Fourth Corps, under Lt. Gen. Richard H. Anderson, was organized on October 19, 1864; on April 8, 1865, it was merged into the Second Corps. The commanders of the first three corps changed frequently in 1864 and 1865.\nBy the time of the Pennsylvania invasion, Lee had fixed the organizational defects that plagued the army during its early campaigns and the straggling problems of the Maryland Campaign did not repeat themselves.\nAfter taking over command in mid-1862, Lee began preparing to lead the Army of Northern Virginia for the first time. However, his aggressiveness to attack the Union led to the loss of many troops especially at the Battle of Antietam, which ended up being a turning point in the war for the Union. After the costly victories during the Seven Days Battles and at Second Manassas in August 1862, Lee had now lost a total of 30,000 of his approximately 92,000 troops within three months of becoming the Confederate's top general. Lee then planned to take his troops north into Maryland to destroy a critical railroad bridge across the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg in a letter written to President Davis. Lee even questioned his own plan, as he wrote, \"I am aware that the movement is attended with much risk, yet I do not consider success impossible...\" In addition, historians question Lee's aggressiveness to move his army to Maryland. \"There can be no sort of doubt that Lee underestimated the exhaustion of his army after Second Manassas. That is, in reality, the major criticism of the Maryland operation: he carried worn-out men across the Potomac.\" His men were also underarmed and underfed, so the journey to Maryland added to the overall exhaustion. Once Lee arrived in Maryland and was preparing for Antietam, he made another controversial decision. Against the advice from General Longstreet and Jackson, Lee split his troops into four parts to attack the Union from different fronts. Clearly outnumbered and opposed to Lee's plan, Longstreet stated, \"General, I wish we could stand still and let the damned Yankees come to us!\" As the fighting played out on September 17, 1862, known as the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, the battles at Dunker Church and Burnside's Bridge proved to be too much for Lee and his Confederate army. Luckily for Lee, the arrival of A.P. Hill's troops and the mixture of McClellan's and Burnside's sluggishness, saved Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and allowed them to barely hold off the Union in Maryland.\nCorps organization under Lee.\nAlthough the Army of Northern Virginia swelled and shrank over time, its units of organization consisted primarily of corps, earlier referred to as \"wings\" or \"commands\":\nCampaigns and battles.\nThe Army fought in a number of campaigns and battles, including:\nOn April 9, 1865, the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to the Army of the Potomac at Appomattox Court House, effectively ending the Civil War, with General Lee signing the papers of surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant. The day after his surrender, Lee issued his Farewell Address to the Army of Northern Virginia.\nOrganization of the Army.\nDepartment of Northern Virginia, October 22, 1861.\nThe Military Department of Northern Virginia was embattled on October 22, 1861. The department initially consisted of three districts under the overall command of General Joseph E. Johnston.\nOn February 28, 1862, there were 47,617 soldiers present for duty to the military district. The Cavalry Brigade was provided from the Potomac's Military District and under direct control from the Defense District. The artillery formed an Artillery Corps with 109 cannons.\nOrganization April 30, 1862.\nThe Army of Northern Virginia was established on March 14, 1862, again under Johnston. Though the military department stayed existent its role changed into an administrative division for most of the war.\nAt the outset of the Peninsula Campaign the Army of Northern Virginia had more than 55,633 soldiers. The cannon was assigned to the brigades, as well as the Reserve's artillery. Nominally, Jackson's Corps in the Shenandoah Valley, was subordinate to the Army. Since Jackson led his own campaign at the time of the Peninsula Campaign and was not under Lee's direct command this overview does not include his three divisions.\nThe Army's organization soon proved inept in the course of the Peninsula Campaign. The corps-like structure was rearranged before the Seven Days Battle to converge with the requirements of actual command. In the course of this battle the Army featured two Corps; Jackson's and Magruder's, with four and three divisions respectively, and three actual divisions with five to six brigades. Also the Defense District of North Carolina answered directly to the Army as well as the Reserve Artillery with six battalions and the cavalry with six regiments. The army's complete strength was about 90,000 soldiers. The exact strength cannot be determined, because only a few notes for actual provisionings survived. The estimated strength results, if not explicitly noted, from in-battle dispatches.\nOrganization at the setout of the Northern Virginia Campaign.\nThe Seven Days Battle showed the Army still suffered from insufficient organization in army command. General Lee subdivided the army again, but this time only with single commands. He introduced a corps-like structure of command, and as an intermediate army management he named the left and right wing. The Army was organized on August 28, 1862, as follows.\nThe Army's Reserve Artillery consisted of one regiment and two battalions. They stayed in the area of Richmond in the course of the whole Northern Virginia Campaign and only returned on September 3, 1862, to the Army. Major General Hill's Division also remained in the eastern parts of Richmond with the order to bind McClellan's attention as long as possible. As it became predictable that the Army of the Potomac would soon be transferred to support Pope, Lee ordered the Division north. Hill never entered battle in the campaign. A total of about 54,000 soldiers saw action throughout the campaign.\nOrganization at the beginning of the Maryland Campaign.\nThe Army's losses before and following the Battle of Second Manassas needed to be replaced before the Maryland Campaign could commence. While fundamental changes in the Army's command structure were not necessary, General Lee exchanged divisions and brigades or added additional strength to some. The wings of the Army were now officially called 'Corps'. In the Maryland Campaign the Army was subdivided as follows.\nWhile organization of the corps was found to be generally reliable, the corps' subdivision into four or five divisions hampered overall ease of command. General Lee had already considered before the Battle of Antietam to slim down the overall structure, but intended there be no changes in leadership. The Confederate Congress authorized the establishment of the Corps, and President Davis affirmed the assignment of the commanders and promoted Major Generals Longstreet and Jackson to Lieutenant Generals. General Lee announced this in Special Order 234 on November 6, 1862. About 60,000 soldiers served at the Maryland Campaign.\nFredericksburg and Chancellorsville.\nIn the days following the Battle of Chancellorsville there were no changes in the army's command structure or hierarchy. The army replaced its own losses with new recruits and soldiers returning to duty. Lee made demands that all regiments had to be consolidated solely with recruits originating from their corresponding home states.\nFollowing the Battle of Fredericksburg the Army of Northern Virginia could muster over 72,497 soldiers not counting other personnel. Not figuring into this overall number is the fact that Lee had made the decision to station a whole division and a single cavalry brigade at Shenandoah Valley for protection at this time and these troops are missing from the total estimates.\nDuring the autumn of 1862 lasting throughout the following winter the army faced the Army of the Potomac at Rappahannock. Thereout arose a new problem: Because of the necessity to always show its presence to the enemy there were only limited supplies available for the army from the surrounding villages and towns. Any army at these times supplied itself along the way while moving across the theater of war. Even ordering supplies through the use of the rail, if it was an available option at all, took up considerable time and efforts and supply treks by wagons were potentially prone to enemy assaults. This left Lee with few options and therefore he gave the special order on December 24, 1862, to move half of his artillery into the hinterlands to have his horses better supplied. He forbade to assign all of the horses to any other task than official assignments.\nOn February 15, 1863, Lee rearranged his artillery. Six battalions were assigned to both corps, and the reserve was composed out of two more battalions. The Confederate War Department strongly suggested in position papers to Lee dating from the February 18th, 1862 to station two divisions at the Atlantic coast. Lee was not averse to any such demands, probably very much on the contrary, because of the tight position he was in with the general lack of provisions, so he gave orders to General Longstreet to have it done so. Both of the assigned divisions only returned to join the Army of Northern Virginia again following the Battle of Chancellorsville. The army was composed at this battle out of over 61.500 soldiers.\nOrganization from May 30, 1863, until April 9, 1865.\nLee took Jackson's death as an opportunity to subdivide the North Virginia Corps again. President Jefferson Davis agreed to the subdivision and ordered Lee in his Special Order Nr. 146 to reorganize the Army.\nLee ordered the artillery battalions of the Reserve Artillery to serve directly with the Corps for the duration of the Gettysburg campaign. The Army of Northern Virginia now comprised a total of 75,054 soldiers at the Battle of Gettysburg.\nThe army fielded more than 241 cannons following the Battle of Gettysburg.\nOn September 9, General Lee had to dispatch the First Corps to Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. Following this the army was resubordinated again. Changes were not significant; only the cavalry saw important reorganization.\nThe Army's strength was then 55,221 soldiers. The changes in command until December 31, 1863, were only minor. Cooke's Brigade was assigned to serve with Heth's Division, Hampton's Division grew by a cavalry brigade and the Third Corps gained an additional artillery battalion. Imboden's Command remained at Shenandoah Valley and was taken over by Major General Early as the Defense District of Shenandoah Valley. The strength of the army was 54,715 men on December 31.\nThe organization of the Army of Northern Virginia did not change until the end of the war. The Army featured several corps, the corps featured several divisions, and the artillery was divided between the corps. The strength of the Army grew in the first six months from about 46,380 to 62,230 soldiers. The army was assigned in July to the Defense District of North Carolina and Richmond. In the course of the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign the number of soldiers temporarily grew to 82,633 while parts of the Army were under the command by Lieutenant General Early in Shenandoah Valley.\nIn 1864, the Army of Northern Virginia fought forces over twice as strong as that of the Potomac, James and Shenandoah Army in Grant's Overland Campaign, Early's Raid against the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign, and Shenandoah Campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. The Army reorganized on January 31, 1865 because 69,659 soldiers were fit for battle, but 4,500 or more had no rifles.\nSurrender and parole.\nFollowing Lieutenant General A.P. Hill's death on April 2, 1865, the Third Corps was dissolved and assigned to the First Corps. On April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered. One day later he thanked his men and his officers for their bravery and sturdiness and announced the dismissal of all troops on their word of honor in General Order No. 9. The listings of the Army of Northern Virginia say that 28,231 soldiers were dismissed on their word of honor on April 10, 1865.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58161", "revid": "1960810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58161", "title": "Dust devil", "text": "Type of whirlwind\nA dust devil (also known regionally as a dirt devil) is a strong, well-formed, and relatively short-lived whirlwind. Its size ranges from small (18\u00a0in/half a metre wide and a few yards/metres tall) to large (more than 30\u00a0ft/10\u00a0m wide and more than half a mile/1\u00a0km tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to endanger both people and property.\nThey are comparable to tornadoes in that both are a weather phenomenon involving a vertically oriented rotating column of wind. Most tornadoes are associated with a larger parent circulation, the mesocyclone on the back of a supercell thunderstorm. Dust devils form as a swirling updraft under sunny conditions during fair weather, rarely coming close to the intensity of a tornado.\nFormation.\nDust devils form when a pocket of hot air near the earth surface rises quickly through cooler air above it, forming an updraft. The hot air rises because it is less dense than the cooler air. In the right conditions, the updraft begins to rotate. The rising air stretches vertically, moving closer to the axis of rotation, which intensifies the spinning by conservation of angular momentum. The secondary flow of air causes more hot air to speed horizontally inward to the bottom of the forming vortex. As more hot air rushes toward the vortex to replace the rising air, the spinning intensifies. A fully-formed dust devil is a funnel-like chimney through which hot air moves upwards and in a circle. As the hot air rises, it cools, loses its buoyancy and eventually ceases to rise. As it rises, it displaces air which descends outside the core of the vortex. This cool air returning acts as a balance against the spinning hot-air outer wall and keeps the system stable.\nThe spinning and surface friction produce a forward momentum which moves the vortex horizontally. The dust devil may be sustained if it moves over nearby sources of hot surface air.\nHowever, it dissipates in seconds if cooler air is sucked in instead of hot air. This happens when it enters an area of cooler surface air or when its movement slows down, thereby using up all available hot air.\nCertain conditions increase the likelihood of dust devil formation.\nIntensity and duration.\nMany dust devils are usually small and weak, often less than 3\u00a0feet (0.9\u00a0m) in diameter with maximum winds averaging about 45\u00a0miles per hour (70\u00a0km/h), and they often dissipate less than a minute after forming. On rare occasions, a dust devil can grow very large and intense, sometimes reaching a diameter of up to 300\u00a0feet (90\u00a0m) with winds in excess of 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h+) and can last for upwards of 20\u00a0minutes before dissipating. Because of their small diameter, Coriolis force is not significant in the dust devil itself so dust devils with anticyclonic rotation do occur.\nHazards.\nDust devils typically do not cause injuries, but rare, severe dust devils have caused damage and even deaths in the past. One such dust devil struck the Coconino County Fairgrounds in Flagstaff, Arizona, on September 14, 2000, causing extensive damage to several temporary tents, stands and booths, as well as some permanent fairgrounds structures. Several injuries were reported, but there were no fatalities. Based on the degree of damage left behind, it is estimated that the dust devil produced winds as high as 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), which is equivalent to an EF0 tornado. On May 19, 2003, a dust devil lifted the roof off a two-story building in Lebanon, Maine, causing it to collapse and kill a man inside. On June 18, 2008, a woman near Casper, Wyoming was killed when a dust devil caused a small scorer's shed at a youth baseball field to flip on top of her. She had been trying to shelter from the dust devil by going behind the shed. At East El Paso, Texas in 2010, three children in an inflatable jump house were picked up by a dust devil and lifted over 10 feet (3\u00a0m), travelling over a fence and landing in a backyard three houses away. In Commerce City, Colorado in 2018, a powerful dust devil hurtled two porta-potties into the air; no one was injured. In 2019, a large dust devil in Yucheng county, Henan province, China killed 2 children and injured 18 children and 2 adults when an inflatable jump house was lifted into the air.\nDust devils have been implicated in around 100 aircraft accidents. While many incidents have been simple taxiing problems, a few have had fatal consequences. Dust devils are also considered major hazards among skydivers and paragliding pilots as they can cause a parachute or a paraglider to collapse with little to no warning, at altitudes considered too low to cut away, and contribute to the serious injury or death of parachutists. Such was the case on June 1, 1996, when a dust devil caused a skydiver's parachute to collapse about above the ground. He later died from the injuries he sustained. Dust devils can also contribute to wildfires. One case occurred in Engeb\u00e6k, Billund Municipality, Denmark in 1868 where a dust devil tossed tuft into a heater, causing a wildfire that possibly extended from 10,000 to 50,000 hectares or more.\nElectrical activities.\nDust devils, even small ones, can produce radio noise and electrical fields exceeding 10,000 volts per metre. A dust devil picks up small dirt and dust particles, which become electrically charged through contact or frictional charging (triboelectrification) as they whirl around. The whirling charged particles also create a magnetic field that fluctuates between 3 and 30 times each second.\nThese electric fields may assist the vortices in lifting material from the ground to the atmosphere. Field experiments indicate that a dust devil can lift 1\u00a0gram of dust per second from each square metre (10\u00a0lb/s from each acre) of ground over which it passes. A large dust devil measuring about 100\u00a0metres (330\u00a0ft) across at its base can lift about 15 tonnes (17 short tons) of dust into the air in 30\u00a0minutes. Giant dust storms that sweep across the world's deserts contribute 8% of the mineral dust in the atmosphere each year during the handful of storms that occur. In comparison, the significantly smaller dust devils that twist across the deserts during the summer lift about three times as much dust, thus having a greater combined impact on the dust content of the atmosphere. When this occurs, they are often called sand pillars.\nAlternate names.\nIn Australia, a dust devil is more commonly known as \"Willy willy\".\nIn Ireland, dust devils are known as \"s\u00ed gaoithe\" or \"fairy wind\".\nRelated phenomena.\nAsh devils.\nHot cinders underneath freshly deposited ash in recently burned areas may sometimes generate numerous dust devils. The lighter weight and the darker color of the ash may create dust devils that are visible hundreds of feet into the air.\nAsh devils form similar to dust devils and are often seen on unstable days in burn scar areas of recent fires.\nCoal devils are common at the coal town of Tsagaan Khad in South Gobi Province, Mongolia. They occur when dust devils pick up large amounts of stockpiled coal. Their dark color makes them resemble some tornadoes.\nFire whirls.\nFire whirls or swirls, sometimes called fire devils or fire tornadoes, can be seen during intense fires in combustible building structures or, more commonly, in forest or bush fires. A fire whirl is a vortex-shaped formation of burning gases being released from the combustible material. The genesis of the vortex is probably similar to a dust devil's. As distinct from the dust devil, it is improbable that the height reached by the fire gas vortex is greater than the visible height of the vertical flames because of turbulence in the surrounding gases that inhibit creation of a stable boundary layer between the rotating/rising gases relative to the surrounding gases.\nHay devils.\nA \"hay devil\" is a gentle whirlwind that forms in the warm air above fields of freshly-cut hay. A vortex forms from a column of hot air rising from the ground on calm, sunny days, tossing and swirling stalks and clumps of hay harmlessly through the air, often to the delight of children and onlookers.\nSnow devils.\nThe same conditions can produce a \"snow whirlwind\", \"snow devil\", or sometimes referred to as a \"snownado\", although differential heating is more difficult in snow-covered areas.\nSteam devils.\nSteam devils are a small vortex column of saturated air of varying height but small diameter forming when cold air lies over a much warmer body of water or saturated surface. They are also often observed in the steam rising from power plants.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58162", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58162", "title": "Alliance", "text": "Coalition made between two or more parties to secure common interests\nAn alliance is a relationship among people, groups, or states that have joined together for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not an explicit agreement has been worked out among them. Members of an alliance are called allies. Alliances form in many settings, including political alliances, military alliances, and business alliances.\nExamples.\nWhen spelled with a capital \"A\", \"the Allies\" usually denotes the countries who fought together against the Central Powers in World War I (the Allies of World War\u00a0I), or those who fought against the Axis Powers in World War II (the Allies of World War\u00a0II).\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the Cold War was characterised by the intense rivalry between the military alliances of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, as each competed to expand and maintain their spheres of influence. \nMore recently, the term \"Allied forces\" has also been used to describe the coalition of the Gulf War, as opposed to forces the Multi-National Forces in Iraq which are commonly referred to as \"Coalition forces\" or, as by the George W. Bush administration, \"the coalition of the willing\".\nAt the onset of the 21st century, shifts in the global order led to the formation of new alliances rooted in ideological and historical precedents, exemplified by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS). This alliance possesses a broad and vaguely defined agenda, with its members exhibiting varying degrees of commitment to and motivations for participating in this initiative. The inaugural BRICS meeting occurred in 2006. In 2023, the alliance expanded with the invitation of six new members\u2014Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014and was rebranded as BRICS Plus.\nEffects.\nScholars are divided as to the impact of alliances. Several studies find that defensive alliances deter conflict. One study questions these findings, showing that alliance commitments deterred conflict in the prenuclear era but has no statistically meaningful impact on war in the postnuclear era. Another study finds that while alliance commitments deter conflict between sides with a recent history of conflict, alliances tend to provoke conflicts between states without such a history.\nA 2000 study in the \"Journal of Conflict Resolution\" found that allies fulfill their alliance commitments approximately 75% of the time. Most research suggests that democracies are more reliable allies than non-democracies. A 2004 study did however question whether alliance commitments by democracies are more durable. A 2018 study updated and extended the data from the 2000 \"Journal of Conflict Resolution\" study and found that allies only fulfill their commitments about 50% of the time from 1816 to 2003. According to the study, \"States honored their alliance commitments 66% of the time prior to 1945 but the compliance rate drops to 22% from 1945 to 2003. Moreover, the rates of fulfillment for defense pacts (41%) and nonaggression pacts (37%) are dramatically lower than offensive alliances (74%) and neutrality agreements (78%).\"\nOne of the most profound effects of alliances can be seen in technological innovation, due to conduits of knowledge flows that are open between allies but closed between rivals.\nInternational opinion.\nAccording to a 2017 poll by WIN/GIA, the United States was the most preferred ally internationally. Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China (CRINK), who preferred one another, both trailed America globally. Four countries, Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia and Turkey, preferred Russia, despite being members of NATO.\nIn Pakistan, 72% of respondents preferred ties to China, the largest margin of any country surveyed, while 46% of Bangladesh preferred India. A total of 22 countries indicated a preference for the United Kingdom at a rate of 10% or more, but the United States was the only country to prefer Britain over any other, at a rate of 43%. Five countries preferred France at a rate of 10% or more, led by Belgium at a rate of 25%. A single country, Iraq, expressed no preference, while three other countries, Lebanon, Palestine, and Slovenia, expressed no preference at a rate of 11% or more, although at a smaller rate than their preference for Russia on the part of Lebanon and Slovenia, and China on the part of Palestine. Kosovo reported the most unified opinion, preferring the United States at a rate of 92%, while Russia's most unified supporters were Mongolia (71%), Armenia (67%) and Serbia (56%). In total, 21 countries expressed a preference for America at a rate of 50% or more. \n&lt;/div style&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58163", "revid": "44555953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58163", "title": "Lonely Mountain", "text": "Middle-earth mountain\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, the Lonely Mountain is a mountain northeast of Mirkwood. It is the location of the Dwarves' Kingdom under the Mountain and the town of Dale lies in a vale on its southern slopes.\nIn \"The Lord of the Rings\", the mountain is called by the Sindarin name Erebor. The Lonely Mountain is the destination of the protagonists, including the titular Hobbit Bilbo Baggins in \"The Hobbit\", and is the scene of the novel's climax.\nThe mountain has been described as the goal of Bilbo's psychological quest in \"The Hobbit\"; scholars have noted that it and \"The Lord of the Rings\" are both structured as quests to a distant mountain, but that the quests have very different motivations. Further, the mountain is a symbol of adventure in \"The Hobbit\", and of Bilbo's maturation as an individual, while to the Dwarves, it stands for the gain of beauty in return for loss of life.\nFictional mountain.\nErebor stands hundreds of miles from the nearest mountain range. Tolkien's rendering of Thr\u00f3r's map in \"The Hobbit\" shows it with six ridges stretching out from a central peak that was snowcapped well into spring. The whole mountain is some ten miles in diameter; it contains an immense wealth of gold and jewels.\nOrigins.\nErebor becomes the home of the Folk of Durin, a clan of Dwarves known as the Longbeards, after they are driven from their ancestral home of Khazad-d\u00fbm. In the latter days of the Third Age, this Kingdom under the Mountain holds one of the largest dwarvish treasure hoards in Middle-earth. Dale, a town of Men built between the two southern spurs of Erebor, grew in harmony with the dwarves. The Kingdom under the Mountain is founded by Thr\u00e1in I the Old, who had discovered the Arkenstone there. His son, Thorin I, leaves the mountain with much of the Folk of Durin to live in the Ered Mithrin (Grey Mountains) on account of the great riches to be found in that range. After dragons plunder their hoards, the Longbeards, led now by Thr\u00f3r, a descendant of Thorin, return to Erebor to take up the title King under the Mountain. Under Thr\u00f3r's reign, Erebor becomes a great stronghold where the dwarves are numerous and prosperous.\nErebor in \"The Hobbit\".\nIn the Third Age, while the young Thorin II Oakenshield is out hunting, the dragon Smaug flies south from the Grey Mountains, kills all the dwarves he could find, and destroys the town of Dale. Smaug takes over the mountain, using the dwarves' hoard as a bed. King Thr\u00f3r, his son Thr\u00e1in II, and several companions escape death by a secret door. While Thr\u00f3r and Thr\u00e1in later perish, Thorin lives in exile in the Ered Luin, far to the west. On a journey, he meets the wizard Gandalf. Together they form a plan to reclaim the mountain. Gandalf insists that burglary is the best approach and recommends the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.\nBilbo, Thorin, and Thorin's company of twelve other Dwarves travel to the Lonely Mountain to regain the treasure. They plan to use the secret door, whose key and map Gandalf had obtained from Thr\u00e1in, whom he had found at the point of death in the pits of Dol Guldur. On Durin's Day, when the setting sun and the last moon of autumn are in the sky together, the day's last sunlight falls on the door and exposes its keyhole. The Hobbit enters the mountain and steals a golden cup.\nSmaug, enraged by the theft, emerges from the mountain and flies south to destroy Lake-town, which he suspects is the source of the \"thieves\". During this attack Smaug is killed by Bard the Bowman; Thorin claims the mountain on learning of Smaug's demise. However, the Men of Esgaroth, supported by Thranduil and the Elves of Mirkwood, march in force to the mountain to demand a part of the dragon's hoard as recompense for the destruction. Thorin, mad with greed, refuses all claims and sends word to his second cousin D\u00e1in II Ironfoot, chief of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills, who bring reinforcements. Before battle can begin, an army of Orcs and Wargs descends on Erebor. Dwarves, Elves, and Men join ranks against them, leading to the Battle of Five Armies. Thorin's nephews F\u00edli and K\u00edli are killed, and Thorin is mortally injured; he dies shortly afterwards. The title of King under the Mountain passes to D\u00e1in.\nErebor in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nWith the restoration of the Kingdom under the Mountain, the area becomes prosperous again. Dale is rebuilt under Bard's leadership, and Dwarves and Men reforge their friendship. Some of the Dwarves, led by Balin, leave Erebor to reclaim the ancient Dwarvish Kingdom of Moria. They established a colony there but five years later Balin is killed by an Orc, and soon afterwards Moria is overrun by Orcs and the rest of the Dwarves are killed. Gimli, a dwarf of Erebor and the son of Gl\u00f3in, one of Thorin's twelve companions, is chosen to represent his people in the Fellowship of the Ring; he helps Aragorn regain the throne of Gondor.\nIn the War of the Ring, an emissary from Sauron, the lord of Mordor, twice comes to Erebor and speaks to D\u00e1in. The messenger asks for assistance in finding Bilbo Baggins and retrieving a stolen ring, and in return offers Moria and three of the seven Dwarf rings to D\u00e1in, who declines to reply. Sauron's northern army, including many Easterlings, then attacks; Dale is overrun, and many Dwarves and Men take refuge in Erebor, which is promptly surrounded. D\u00e1in is killed before the gates of Erebor defending the body of his fallen ally King Brand of Dale. D\u00e1in's son Thorin III Stonehelm and King Bard II withstand the siege and rout Sauron's forces.\nAnalysis.\nGoal of psychological quest.\nThe Jungian psychoanalyst Dorothy Matthews, viewing \"The Hobbit\" as a psychological quest, writes that the Lonely Mountain is an apt symbol of Bilbo's maturation as an individual, as the place where he takes on a leadership role and acts and makes decisions independently. The Tolkien scholar Jared Lobdell comments that he is \"profoundly unsympathetic\" to Matthews's approach, but that she \"carries it off well\". Lobdell explains, citing C. S. Lewis's essay \"Psychoanalysis and Literary Criticism\", that many different stories could, for instance, have the same Freudian interpretation, but be quite different as literature. He remarks on the other hand that a psychoanalytic approach is at least richer than a purely materialistic one.\nThe scholar of children's literature William H. Green calls the Lonely Mountain the fourth and final stage of Bilbo's education. He identifies multiple parallels and repetitions of structure between the stages, each one involving a journey, privation, and \"unlikely escape\". The Lonely Mountain stage, too, symbolically echoes the first stage in the Shire: before setting out, Bilbo was peacefully smoking a pipe of tobacco at his own front door; at the mountain, the smoke is the dragon's, and its meaning is anything but peaceful. The Christian writer Joseph Pearce views the journey to the Lonely Mountain as a \"pilgrimage of grace\", a Christian \"bildungsroman\", at its deepest level. Pearce states further that Bilbo's quest to the mountain parallels Frodo's quest to a different mountain, Mount Doom, which he calls \"a mirror of Everyman's journey through life\".\nTwo scholars of literature, Paul Kocher and Randel Helms analyse Bilbo's journey to the lonely mountain, describing it as the goal of his quest and the point at which it is achieved. Both compare the quest in \"The Hobbit\" with that of \"The Lord of the Rings\", noting that the two novels, for all their differences including the reason for the quests, are structurally similar.\nGain and loss.\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that in \"The Hobbit\", the lonely mountain is a symbol of adventure, and the \"true end\" of the story is the moment when Bilbo looks back from a high pass and sees \"There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight. On its highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale. 'So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!' said Bilbo, and he turned his back on his adventure.\"\nAmelia Harper, in the \"J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\", writes that the mountain's history, as usual for the Dwarves, was a tale of \"beauty gained and lives lost\".\nAdaptations.\n\"The Lonely Mountain: Lair of Smaug the Dragon\" is a board game produced in 1985 by Iron Crown Enterprises, designed by Coleman Charlton, which features groups of adventurers, either Dwarves, Elves, Orcs or Men entering Smaug's Lair to capture his treasure before he awakens.\n\"Erebor\", specifically the southern spurs of the Mountain and Dale, is a playable map in \"\". It has three gates, including the one Tolkien described and two which cannot be closed, to allow those playing as invading forces to easily enter the stronghold.\nThe Lonely Mountain appears in Peter Jackson's film adaptations of \"The Hobbit\": ', ', and \"\". The actual setting was Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand.\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58164", "revid": "50300158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58164", "title": "Drag queen", "text": "Entertainer dressed and acting with exaggerated femininity\nA drag queen is a person, usually male, who uses drag clothing and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles for entertainment purposes. Historically, drag queens have usually been gay men, and have been a part of gay culture.\nPeople do drag for reasons ranging from self-expression to mainstream performance. Drag shows frequently include lip-syncing, live singing, and dancing. They typically occur at LGBTQ pride parades, drag pageants, cabarets, carnivals, and nightclubs. Drag queens vary by type, culture, and dedication, from professionals who star in films and spend a lot of their time in their drag personas, to people who do drag only occasionally. In most cases, women who dress as men and entertain by imitating them are called drag kings.\nThose who do occasional drag may be from backgrounds other than the LGBT community. There is a long history of folkloric and theatrical crossdressing that involves people of all orientations. Not everyone who does drag at some point in their lives is a drag queen or a drag king.\nTerminology, scope, and etymology.\nDrag term.\nThe term \"drag\" may date as far back as the Elizabethan era in England, whereas the first recorded use of \"drag\" in this context is from 1870. There are several other possible origins.\nTraditionally, drag involves cross-dressing and transforming one's sex through the use of makeup and other costume devices. However, under newer conceptions of drag, conceivably performing an exaggerated and heightened form of one's own gender could be considered a drag performance.\nFemale impersonator.\nThe term \"female impersonation\" refers to a type of theatrical performance where a man dresses in women's clothing for the sole purpose of entertaining an audience. The term \"female impersonator\" is sometimes used interchangeably with drag queen, although they are not the same. For example, in 1972, Esther Newton described a female impersonator as a \"professional drag queen\". She considered the term \"female impersonator\" to be the one that was (then) widely understood by heterosexual audiences. However, feminist and queer studies scholar Sarah French defined a clear separation between these two terms. She defined drag as an art form associated with queer identity, whereas female impersonation comes from a wide range of gender identity paradigms, including heteronormativity. Additionally, many drag artists view drag as a lived form of self-expression or creativity, and perceive drag as something that is not limited to the stage or to performance. In contrast, female impersonation is specifically limited to performance and may or may not involve an LGBTQI point of view.\nFemale impersonation can be traced back at least as far as ancient Greece. There was little to no gender equity then, and women held a lower social status. This meant male actors would play female roles during theatrical performances. This tradition continued for centuries but began to be less prevalent as motion pictures became popular. During the era of vaudeville, it was considered immodest for women to appear on stage. Due to that circumstance, some men became famous as \"female impersonators\", the most notable being Julian Eltinge. At the peak of his career, he was one of the most sought-after and highest-paid actors in the world. Andrew Tribble was another early female impersonator who gained fame on Broadway and in Black Vaudeville.\nIn the twentieth century, some gender impersonators, both female and male, in the United States became highly successful performing artists in non-LGBTQ nightclubs and theaters. There was a concerted effort by these working female and male impersonators in America to separate the art of gender impersonation from queer identity, with an overt representation of working gender impersonators as heterosexual. Some of the performers were in fact cisgender heterosexual men and women, but others were closeted LGBTQI individuals due to the politics and social environment of the period. It was criminal in many American cities to be homosexual, or for LGBTQI people to congregate, and it was therefore necessary for female and male impersonators to distance themselves from identifying as queer publicly to avoid criminal charges and loss of career. The need to hide and dissociate from queer identity was prevalent among gender impersonators working in non-LGBTQ nightclubs before heteronormative audiences as late as the 1970s.\nFemale impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen Jos\u00e9 Sarria to hand out labels to his friends reading, \"I am a boy\", so they could not be accused of female impersonation. American drag queen RuPaul once said, \"I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?\" He also said, \"I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!\"\nDrag queens and kings.\nThe meaning of the term \"drag queen\" has changed across time. The term first emerged in New York City in the 1950s, and initially had two meanings. The first meaning referred to an amateur performer who did not make a living in drag but may have participated in amateur public performances such as those held at a drag ball or a drag pageant. This was meant to draw a line differentiating amateurs performing in drag for fun from professional female impersonators who made a living performing in drag.\nThe second original meaning of drag queen was applied to men who chose to wear women's clothing on the streets, an act which was at that time illegal in New York City. Of this latter type, two additional slang terms were applied: \"square drag queens\" which meant \"boys who looked like girls but who you knew were boys,\" and \"street queens\" who were queer male sex workers, often homeless, who dressed as women. This second use of the term was also layered with transphobic subtext, and the term drag queen was again meant to protect the professional female impersonator by allowing them to dissociate themselves from both aspects of queer culture and from sex workers to maintain respectability among the predominantly heteronormative audiences who employed them. This understanding of the term drag queen persisted through the 1960s.\nIn 1971, an article in Lee Brewster's \"Drag Queens\" magazine described a drag queen as a \"homosexual transvestite\" who is hyperfeminine, flamboyant, and militant. Drag queens were further described as having an attitude of superiority, and commonly courted by heterosexual men who would \"not ordinarily participate in homosexual relationships\". While the term \"drag queen\" implied \"homosexual transvestite\", the term \"drag\" carried no such connotations.\nIn the 1970s, \"drag queen\" was continually defined as a \"homosexual transvestite\". \"Drag\" was parsed as changing one's clothes to those of a different sex, while \"queen\" was said to refer to a homosexual man.\nFor much of history, drag queens were men, but in more modern times, cisgender and trans women, as well as non-binary people, also perform as drag queens. In a 2018 article, \"Psychology Today\" stated that drag queens are \"most typically gay cisgender men (though there are many drag queens of varying sexual orientations and gender identities)\".\nExamples of trans-feminine drag queens, sometimes called \"trans queens\", include Monica Beverly Hillz and Peppermint. Cisgender female drag queens are sometimes called \"faux queens\" or \"bioqueens\", though critics of this practice assert that \"faux\" carries the connotation that the drag is fake, and that the use of \"bioqueen\" exclusively for cisgender females is a misnomer since trans-feminine queens exhibit gynomorphic features.\nDrag queens' counterparts are drag kings: performers, usually women, who dress in exaggeratedly masculine clothing. Examples of drag kings include Landon Cider. Trans men who dress like drag kings are sometimes termed trans kings.\nAlternative terms.\nSome drag queens may prefer to be referred to as \"she\" while in drag and desire to stay completely in character. Other drag performers are indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to them. RuPaul has said, \"You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just so long as you call me.\"\nDrag queens are sometimes called transvestites, although that term also has many other connotations than the term \"drag queen\" and is not much favored by many drag queens themselves. The term \"tranny,\" an abbreviation of the term transvestite, has been adopted by some drag performers, notably RuPaul, and the gay male community in the United States, but it is considered offensive to most transgender and transsexual people.\nMany drag performers refer to themselves as drag artists, as opposed to drag queens, as some contemporary forms of drag have become nonbinary. In Brazil, androgynous drag performers are sometimes called \"drag queer\", as a form of gender neutrality.\nAmong drag queens and their contacts today, there is an ongoing debate about whether transgender drag queens are actually considered \"drag queens\". Some argue that, because a drag queen is defined as a man portraying a woman, transgender women cannot be drag queens. Drag kings are women who assume a masculine aesthetic, but this is not always the case, because there are also biokings, bioqueens, and female queens, which are people who perform their own biological sex through a heightened or exaggerated gender presentation.\nHistory of drag.\nCanada.\nIn the 1940s, John Herbert, who sometimes competed in drag pageants, was the victim of an attempted robbery while he was dressed as a woman. His assailants falsely claimed that Herbert had solicited them for sex, and Herbert was accused and convicted of indecency under Canada's same-sex sexual activity law (which was not repealed until 1969). After being convicted, Herbert served time in a youth reformatory in Guelph, Ontario. Herbert later served another sentence for indecency at reformatory in Mimico. Herbert wrote \"Fortune and Men's Eyes\" in 1964 based on his time behind bars. He included the character of Queenie as an authorial self-insertion.\nIn 1973, the first Canadian play about and starring a drag queen, \"Hosanna\" by Michel Tremblay, was performed at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Quat'Sous in Montreal.\nIn 1977, the Canadian film \"Outrageous!\", starring drag queen Craig Russell, became one of the first gay-themed films to break out into mainstream theatrical release.\nIndia.\nIn September 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the application of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to consensual homosexual sex between adults was unconstitutional, \"irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary\". Since then, drag culture in India has been growing and becoming the mainstream art culture. The hotel chain of Lalit Groups operates a franchise of clubs where drag performances are hosted in major cities of India, such as Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore.\nMaya the Drag Queen, Rani Kohinoor (Sushant Divgikar), Lush Monsoon, Betta Naan Stop, Tropical Marca, Zeeshan Ali, and Patruni Sastry are some examples of Indian drag artists. In 2018, Hyderabad had its first drag convention. In 2020, India's first drag specific magazine Dragvanti began publication.\nLebanon.\nLebanon is the only country in the Arab world with an increasingly visible drag scene. Drag culture has existed in Lebanon for several decades but gained popularity with the astronomical rise of Bassem Feghali, who came to prominence in the 1990s, becoming a household name for his impersonation of Lebanese female singers. Due to the global success of Rupaul's Drag Race, Beirut's drag scene has adopted various influences that blend American drag culture with local, unique cultural elements. The drag scene has grown so much that in 2019 \"Vogue\" magazine declared it a drag-aissance.\nParaguay.\nUsha Didi Gunatita was a pioneer of drag art during the later years of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. Many drag queens of later generations claim her as a reference, and base their characters on Usha's exaggerated characteristics in her performances. She is also remembered as one of the first trans people who was featured on Paraguayan television without being censored.\nPhilippines.\nBefore being colonized by Spain in the mid-1500s, it was a national custom for men to dress in women's clothing. However, when the Spaniards arrived, they not only outlawed homosexuality but executed men that appeared to be homosexual. Spain cast a culture of Machismo onto the Philippines, causing any kind of queerness and queer culture to be heavily suppressed.\nNonetheless, in the early 1900s, drag started to reappear in the media. Drag became a key element of national pantomime theatre, and as time went on, drag queens appeared in other forms of theatre and in movies.\nSouth Africa.\nDrag in South Africa emerged in the 1950s in major cities such as Johannesburg and Cape Town. It started in the form of underground pageants which created a safe space for members of the LGBTQ+ community in Apartheid South Africa, where people could be punished by law for being gay. Being gay was not legalized in South Africa until 1998, so pageants, such as the famous Miss Gay Western Cape, did not become official until the late 1990s.\nDiscrimination against drag is widespread in South Africa, and drag queens face the threat of violence because of being openly gay. Furthermore, there is not language to explore queerness in Xhosa, one of the indigenous languages of South Africa.\nTaiwan.\nIn 1994, entertainer Cai Tou established the male-to-female cross-dressing (Red-Top Artists) singing and dancing troupe, inspired by the ladyboy cabaret shows in Thailand. \nIn 1998, the Public Television Service program featured the character \"Grandma Fruit\" (Sui Guo Nai Nai) in male-to-female cross-dressing; this character became a staple on television.\nThe introduction of Taiwanese drag culture began with the underground \"Paradise Party\" in the 1990s. This party served as the starting point for Taiwan's first generation of local drag queens while the rights of the gay community were still limited. Following the end of Paradise Party, the development of drag culture in Taiwan stagnated between approximately 1990 and 2010.\nIn 2006, Alvin (the \"Drag Grandma\") opened the bar \"Caf\u00e9 Dalida\" in Ximending, and began regularly inviting drag queens to perform. In the 2010s, Taiwan saw the emergence of two new underground parties: \"Werk party\" and \"Cum party\".\" These parties became the staging grounds for Taiwan's new generation of local drag queens, such as Nymphia Wind.\nFollowing the resurgence, many local Taiwanese drag queens began to emerge. In 2020, the Taiwanese YouTube channel \"FJ234\" independently produced the online drag queen pageant show \"\"Make a Diva\".\" This program ran for two seasons. In 2024, Nymphia Wind won the sixteenth season of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", becoming the first person of East Asian descent to win an installment of the American series.\nThailand.\nAfter homosexual acts were decriminalized in Thailand in 1956, gay clubs and other queer spaces began opening, which led to the first cabaret. However, drag in Thailand was actually heavily influenced by drag queens from the Philippines as the first drag show started after the owner of a gay club saw drag queens from the Philippines perform in Bangkok. Therefore, drag shows started in Thailand in the mid-1970s and have become increasingly popular over time, especially in major cities like Bangkok.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn Renaissance England, women were forbidden from performing on stage, so female roles were played by men or boys. The practice continued, as a tradition, when pantomimes became a popular form of entertainment in Europe during the late 1800s to the mid-1900s. The dame became a stock character with a range of attitudes from \"charwoman\" to \"grande dame\" who was mainly used for improvisation. A notable, and highly successful, pantomime dame from this period was Dan Leno.\nBeyond theatre, in the 1800s, Molly houses became a place for gay men to meet, often dressed in drag. Despite homosexuality being outlawed, men would dress in women's clothing and attend these taverns and coffee houses to congregate and meet other, mostly gay, men.\nBy the mid-1900s, pantomime and the use of pantomime dames had declined, although it remains a popular Christmas tradition. The role of the dame, however, evolved to become more about the individual performer. Many female impersonators built up their own fan bases and began performing outside of their traditional pantomime roles.\nUnited States.\nOrigins.\nDrag performance in the United States had its roots in the female impersonations of performers in minstrel shows of the 19th century, followed by female impersonators working in vaudeville, burlesque, and the legitimate theatre in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\nThe Pansy Craze was a period of increased LGBT visibility in American popular culture from the late-1920s until the mid-1930s; during the \"craze,\" drag queens \u2013 known as \"pansy performers\" \u2013 experienced a surge in underground popularity, especially in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The exact dates of the movement are debated, with a range from the late 1920s until 1935.\nThe term \"pansy craze\" was coined by the historian George Chauncey in his 1994 book \"Gay New York\".\nFirst drag balls.\nThe first person known to describe himself as \"the queen of drag\" was William Dorsey Swann, born enslaved in Hancock, Maryland, who in the 1880s started hosting drag balls in Washington, DC attended by other men who were formerly enslaved. The balls were often raided by the police, as documented in the newspapers. In 1896, Swann was convicted and sentenced to 10 months in jail on the false charge of \"keeping a disorderly house\" (a euphemism for running a brothel). He requested a pardon from President Grover Cleveland, but was denied.\nNightclubs.\nIn the early to mid-1900s, female impersonation had become tied to the LGBT community and thus criminality, so it had to change forms and locations. It moved from being popular mainstream entertainment to something done only at night in disreputable areas, such as San Francisco's Tenderloin. Here female impersonation started to evolve into what we today know as drag and drag queens. Drag queens such as Jos\u00e9 Sarria first came to prominence in these clubs. People went to these nightclubs to play with the boundaries of gender and sexuality, and it became a place for the LGBT community, especially gay men, to feel accepted.\nAs LGBT culture has slowly become more accepted in American society, drag has also become more, though not totally, acceptable in today's society. In the 1940s and 1950s, Arthur Blake was one of the few female impersonators to be successful in both gay and mainstream entertainment, becoming famous for his impersonations of Bette Davis, Carmen Miranda, and Eleanor Roosevelt in night clubs. At the invitation of the Roosevelts, he performed his impersonation of Eleanor at the White House. He impersonated Davis and Miranda in the 1952 film \"Diplomatic Courier\".\nProtests.\nThe Cooper Donuts Riot was a May 1959 incident in Los Angeles in which drag queens, lesbians, transgender women, and gay men rioted; it was one of the first LGBT protests in the United States.\nThe Compton's Cafeteria riot, which involved drag queens and others, occurred in San Francisco in 1966. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.\nOn 17 March 1968, in Los Angeles, to protest entrapment and harassment by the Los Angeles Police Department, two drag queens known as \"The Princess\" and \"The Duchess\" held a St. Patrick's Day party at Griffith Park, a popular cruising spot and a frequent target of police activity. More than 200 gay men socialized throughout the day.\nDrag queens were also involved in the Stonewall riots, a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the LGBT community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of 28 June 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The riots are widely considered to be the catalyst for the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.\nDuring the summer of 1976, a restaurant in Fire Island Pines, New York, denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren's friends in Cherry Grove heard what had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on 4 July 1976, sailed to the Pines by water taxi. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to the Pines, called the Invasion of the Pines.\nPolitics.\nIn 1961, drag queen Jos\u00e9 Sarria ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States.\nIn 1991, drag queen Terence Alan Smith, as Joan Jett Blakk, ran against Richard M. Daley for the office of mayor of Chicago, Illinois. The campaign was chronicled in the 1991 video \"Drag in for Votes\". After qualifying for presidency on his 35th birthday, Smith announced a campaign for presidency in 1992 under the slogan \"Lick Bush in '92!\" and documented in the 1993 video of the same name. Smith also ran for president in 1996 with the slogan \"Lick Slick Willie in '96!\" In each of these campaigns, Smith ran on the Queer Nation Party ticket. In June 2019, a play based on Smith's 1992 presidential campaign, titled \"Ms. Blakk for President,\" written by Tarell Alvin McCraney and Tina Landau and starring McCraney in the title role, opened at Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago.\nIn 2019, Maebe A. Girl became the first drag queen elected to public office in the United States when she was elected to the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council.\nOther.\nD'Arcy Drollinger was appointed San Francisco's first drag laureate in May 2023. The role consists of serving as an ambassador for San Francisco's LGBTQ+, arts, nightlife, and entertainment communities.\nPickle Drag Queen became West Hollywood's first drag laureate on International Drag Day, 16 July 2023.\nDrag families.\nDrag families are a part of ball culture and drag houses\".\"\nDrag mother.\nA drag queen may either pick a drag name, or be given it by a friend or a \"drag mother\". Drag mothers often come to lead their drag house, or start their own, and are more experienced and acclaimed members of the drag community. As such, drag mothers and drag daughters have a mentor-apprentice relationship. This is because drag mothers help hone the skills of their younger queens, or drag daughters, by teaching them things such as how to apply makeup, walk in heels, sew clothing, dance, sing, etc. In addition to this, drag mothers also promote their drag children at events and performances.\nArt of drag.\nThe process of getting into drag or into character can take hours. A drag queen may aim for a certain style, celebrity impression, or message with their look. Hair, make-up, and costumes are the most important essentials for drag queens. Drag queens tend to go for a more exaggerated look with a lot more makeup than a typical woman would wear.\nSome people do drag simply as a means of self-expression, but often drag queens (once they have completed a look) will go out to clubs and bars and perform in a \"drag show\". Many drag queens dress up for money by doing different shows, but there are also drag queens that have full-time jobs but still enjoy dressing up in drag as a hobby.\nMany parts of the drag show, and of the drag queens' other intellectual properties, cannot be protected by intellectual property law. To substitute for the lack of legal protection, drag queens revert to social norms to protect their intellectual property.\nIn entertainment.\nDrag shows and venues.\nA drag show is a piece of entertainment consisting of a variety of songs, monologues or skits featuring either single performers or groups of performers in drag meant to entertain an audience. They range from amateur performances at small bars to elaborately staged theatrical presentations. Many drag shows feature performers singing or lip-synching to songs while performing a pre-planned pantomime, or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous female singers or personalities. Some events are centered around drag, such as Southern Decadence, where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally drag queens.\nIn 2020, the first West End play to feature an all drag cast, \"Death Drop,\" launched at the Garrick Theatre in London. Produced by Tuckshop and Trafalgar Entertainment it was written by drag performer Holly Stars and starred Courtney Act, Monet X Change, Latrice Royale, Willam, Holly Stars, Anna Phylactic, LoUis CYfer, Don One, Kemah Bob, Myra Dubois and Vinegar Strokes and was directed by Jesse Jones. The show ran for a number of weeks in November and December 2020 before being closed due to a COVID lockdown in London. The show reopened on 19 May 2021 and ran until its scheduled end date of 11 July 2021. \"Death Drop\" received 5-star reviews from many publications including Gay Times and Attitude magazine and was widely celebrated for breaking new ground in theatrical drag performance.\nIn music.\nWhile some male music celebrities wear exaggerated feminine clothing as part of their show, they are not necessarily drag queens. An example of a band that utilised drag as part of their stage act was the New York Dolls. Similarly, English new wave singer Boy George wears drag queen style clothes and cosmetics; he once stated he was not a drag queen but on another occasions he said he was. However, RuPaul is a professional drag queen performer and singer.\nExamples of songs where lyrics refer to drag queens:\nIn television.\nDrag queen Don McLean (drag name Lori Shannon) appeared in three episodes of the CBS sitcom \"All in the Family\" as drag queen Beverly LaSalle: \"Archie the Hero\" (1975), in which Archie Bunker gives her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, not realizing she is male; \"Beverly Rides Again\" (1976), in which Archie uses her to play a practical joke on a friend; and \"Edith's Crisis of Faith, Part 1\" (1977), in which her murder leads Edith Bunker to question her faith in God. The role was noteworthy for its uncommonly respectful and sympathetic treatment of Beverly as a \"transvestite\".\nBritish entertainer Paul O'Grady was a staple of light entertainment and variety shows on UK television from the early 80s to the mid 90s, playing the drag persona Lily Savage: an over-the-top, glamorous diva character for comedic effect.\n\"CODCO\" was a Canadian sketch comedy series which aired on CBC Television from 1988 to 1993; two of its actors, Tommy Sexton and Greg Malone, were especially renowned for drag-based impersonations of celebrity women such as Queen Elizabeth, Barbara Frum, Barbara Walters, Tammy Faye Bakker and Margaret Thatcher. In one famous sketch, Malone as Frum moderated a debate between Andy Jones as a gay teacher who had been fired from his job for testing HIV-positive and Sexton as Clarabelle Otterhead, the president of an anti-gay lobby group called Citizens Outraged by Weird Sex (or COWS).\nDrag queen Amnesia Sparkles tried out for \"American Idol\" in 2002.\n\"What Would You Do?\", airing since early 2008, has had episodes featuring drag queens.\nIn mid-2008, RuPaul began producing \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", a reality television game show which began airing in February 2009. The premise of the program has several drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as \"America's next drag superstar\". It inspired the similar spin-off shows \"RuPaul's Drag U\" and \"\", as well as the international franchise editions \"Drag Race Thailand\", \"The Switch Drag Race\" (Chile), \"RuPaul's Drag Race UK\", \"Canada's Drag Race\", \"Drag Race Holland\", \"Drag Race Espa\u00f1a\", \"RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under\", \"Drag Race France\", \"Drag Race Philippines\" among many others.\nIn 2018, \"American Idol\" featured a drag queen, Adam Sanders (drag name Ada Vox) as one of its contestants. He made it to the top ten.\nIn 2018, \"Celebrity Big Brother\" featured Queen Shane Jenek (drag name Courtney Act) as one of its contestants, placing first in the season with 49.43% of the public vote.\nAlso in 2018, \"So You Think You Can Dance\" featured Jay Jackson (drag name Laganja Estranja) as one of its contestants.\nThe Netflix show \"Dancing Queen\", also released in 2018, starred Justin Johnson (drag name Alyssa Edwards) and his dance studio, Beyond Belief Dance Company.\nA 2018 episode of \"The Simpsons,\" titled \"Werking Mom\", featured many drag queens, including cameos from RuPaul and Raja (the season three winner of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\").\nGingzilla, also known as Ben Hudson and the \"Glamonster\", an Australian drag queen, appeared on \"The X Factor\" in 2018, and \"America's Got Talent\" in 2019.\n\"Dragnificent!\" is a television series on the American network TLC. The show started as a special branded as Drag Me Down the Aisle, which aired on 9 March 2019. It features Alexis Michelle, BeBe Zahara Benet, Jujubee, and Thorgy Thor, four drag queens who are all \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" alumnae, helping an engaged woman to plan her upcoming wedding. On 15 January 2020, TLC announced that it had given a full season run to \"Dragnificent!\", a new show to be based on the \"Drag Me Down the Aisle\" special. The series premiered on 19 April 2020.\nThe Netflix show \"AJ and the Queen\", released in 2020, followed \"Ruby Red, a bigger-than-life but down-on-her-luck drag queen [played by RuPaul] who travels across America from club to club in a rundown 1990s R/V with her unlikely sidekick AJ, a recently orphaned, tough-talking, scrappy ten-year-old stowaway. As the two misfits travel from city to city, Ruby's message of love and acceptance winds up touching people and changing their lives for the better.\"\nIn 2020, RuPaul became the first drag queen to host \"Saturday Night Live,\" though he was not in drag at the time.\nIn 2020-21, British drag queen Holly Stars wrote and performed in two seasons of a mockumentary series, \"Holly Stars: Inspirational,\" broadcast on OutTV,\n\"Queen of the Universe\", a drag queen singing competition television series hosted by Graham Norton with four pop music judges, premiered on Paramount+ on 2 December 2021. On 23 June 2023, the series was canceled after two seasons.\nIn education.\nWhile drag queens are entertainers, they play a role in educating people on gender roles and stereotyping. Professor Stephen Schacht of Plattsburgh State University of New York began introducing his and his students' experiences of attending a drag show to his gender/sexualities class to challenge his students' ideas of dichotomy. Over time, he began inviting students to attend with him. He gathered from his students that after attending the drag show, they had a new appreciation for gender and sexuality and often became very vocal about their new experiences in the classroom.\nWith children.\nNina West, \"Drag Race\" season eleven contestant and winner of \"Miss Congeniality\", and producer of \"Drag Is Magic\", an EP of children's music about the art form, says she hopes to inspire them to \"dream big, be kind, and be their perfect selves.\" West feels the art form is \"an opportunity for children to get creative and think outside the boxes us silly adults have crafted for them.\" Marti Gould Cummings said something similar when a video of them performing \"Baby Shark\" at a drag brunch event went viral. \"Anyone who thinks drag isn't for children is wrong,\" said Cummings, \"Drag is expression, and children are such judgment-free beings; they don't really care what you're wearing, just what you're performing.\" As of May 2019, the video has been viewed over 806,000 times.\nWest responded to critics who question if children are too young to experience drag, saying \"Drag is an opportunity for anyone \u2013 including and especially children \u2013 to reconsider the masks we are all forced to wear daily.\" West added, \"Children are inundated with implicit imagery from media about what is 'boy' and what is 'girl.' And I believe that almost all kids are really less concerned about playing with a toy that's supposedly aligned to their gender, and more concerned with playing with toys that speak to them.\"\nJohn Casey, an adjunct professor at Wagner College in New York City, posits in \"The Advocate\",&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"[Drag queens] are incredibly talented, and they are trying to live their lives, and in the process, brighten the lives of those around them. That's the message parents should be communicating to their kids, at any age. It's all about acceptance and being loved for who you are.\"\nSeparately from kids watching drag, the phenomenon of drag kids is relatively recent, \"The New York Times\" in September 2019, published a guess that there are about a hundred children who do drag in the U.S., with Desmond is Amazing being the one with the most followers. The mainstream access to drag queens on television exponentially increased in 2009 when \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" started airing.\nHowever, as of 2022, exposing kids to drag has become somewhat controversial. Lawmakers in states such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas are attempting to ban minors from attending drag shows and punish parents who expose their kids to drag. These attempts to ban minors from watching drag are based on allegations of drag being a form of perversion and hyper-sexualization. Some have argued that these accusations are the same that were leveled against homosexual men since the lavender scare of the 1950s. Those who disagree with the accusations have argued that drag queens provide a safe and creative environment for young children, especially LGBTQ+ children, and are a source of both education and entertainment.\nStory time in libraries.\nIn December 2015, Radar Productions and Michelle Tea developed the concept of Drag Queen Story Hour. Launched at the San Francisco Public Library, Drag Queen Story Hour was adopted by the Brooklyn Public Library in the summer of 2016, and has since traveled to various libraries, museums, bookstores, recreation centers, and parks across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\nSuch events sometimes prompt opposition against the libraries and organizers. In one instance in California, men belonging to the far-right group known as the Proud Boys arrived in a group and disrupted the event by shouting homophobic and transphobic phrases at the crowd. The County Sheriff's Office opened a hate crime investigation into the incident due to the nature of the disruption. Proud Boys sometimes bring guns for intimidation purposes. Some leftist groups, such as the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, organize armed counter-protests to keep protesters out of the building. This usually leads to the presence of police to ensure that both groups don't harm each other.\nSocietal reception.\nDrag has come to be a celebrated and important aspect of modern gay life, but has also been criticized for degrading women. In the era of second-wave feminism some women \"were angry and appalled by what they perceived as the charade of femininity expressed by some drag queens and transsexual women.\" These critics compared drag to blackface and saw it \"as a kind of gender minstrel.\"\nMany gay bars and clubs around the world hold drag shows as regular events or for special parties. Several \"International Drag Day\" holidays have been started over the years to promote the shows. In the United States, Drag Day is typically celebrated in early March.\nA televised drag competition, \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", is the most successful program on the Logo television network. In 2016, the show won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. In 2018, the show became the first show to win a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program in the same year.\nRuPaul received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry on 16 March 2018, making him the first drag queen to be given such an award.\nMoral panic.\nA moral panic called drag panic has emerged in the United States in relation to drag queen performers. It alleges that contact between children and drag queens would involve drag queens attempting to molest them or indoctrinate them into the \"queer way of life\". This moral panic has also been linked to the LGBT grooming conspiracy theory, also from the United States.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The events sometimes also serve as demonstrations for legal rights such as same-sex marriage. Most occur annually throughout the Western world, while some take place every June to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, which was a pivotal moment in modern LGBTQ social movements. The parades seek to create community and honor the history of the movement.\nIn 1970, pride and protest marches were held in Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco around the first anniversary of Stonewall. The events became annual and grew internationally. In 2019, New York and the world celebrated the largest international Pride celebration in history: Stonewall 50 - WorldPride NYC 2019, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, with five million attending in Manhattan alone. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s a surge of public demonstrations in the US focused on civil rights, anti-war movements, and early LGBTQ+ rights activism. One of the first demonstrations for the cause of gay and lesbian rights was a 1965 \"homophile march\" by the Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis outside the White House, highlighting discrimination in federal employment and advancing LGBTQ+ equality.\nAlso in 1965, the gay rights protest movement was visible at the Annual Reminder pickets, again organized by members of the lesbian group Daughters of Bilitis, and the gay men's group Mattachine Society. Mattachine members were also involved in demonstrations in support of homosexuals imprisoned in Cuban labor camps. Early on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, LGBTQ people rioted following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. The Stonewall Inn was a gay bar which catered to an assortment of patrons, but which was popular with the most marginalized people in the gay community: transvestites, transgender people, effeminate young men, hustlers, and homeless youth.\nFirst pride marches.\nAs the movement became more radical in the late 1960s, particularly after the Stonewall Uprising, they were called Gay Liberation or Gay Freedom marches which emphasized demands for full equality and liberation.\nOn Saturday, June 27, 1970, the Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march from Washington Square Park (\"Bughouse Square\") to the Water Tower at the intersection of Michigan and Chicago avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants spontaneously marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza. The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers.\nThe West Coast of the United States saw a march in San Francisco on June 27, 1970, and 'Gay-in' on June 28, 1970 and a march in Los Angeles on June 28, 1970. In Los Angeles, Morris Kight (Gay Liberation Front LA founder), Reverend Troy Perry (Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches founder) and Reverend Bob Humphries (United States Mission founder) gathered to plan a commemoration. They settled on a parade down Hollywood Boulevard. But securing a permit from the city was no easy task. They named their organization Christopher Street West, \"as ambiguous as we could be.\" But Rev. Perry recalled the Los Angeles Police Chief Edward M. Davis telling him, \"As far as I'm concerned, granting a permit to a group of homosexuals to parade down Hollywood Boulevard would be the same as giving a permit to a group of thieves and robbers.\" Grudgingly, the Police Commission granted the permit, though there were fees exceeding $1.5 million. After the American Civil Liberties Union stepped in, the commission dropped all its requirements but a $1,500 fee for police service. That, too, was dismissed when the California Superior Court ordered the police to provide protection as they would for any other group. The eleventh-hour California Supreme Court decision ordered the police commissioner to issue a parade permit citing the \"constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.\" From the beginning, L.A. parade organizers and participants knew there were risks of violence. Kight received death threats right up to the morning of the parade. Unlike later editions, the first gay parade was very quiet. The marchers convened on Mccadden Place in Hollywood, marched north and turned east onto Hollywood Boulevard. \"The Advocate\" reported \"Over 1,000 homosexuals and their friends staged, not just a protest march, but a full-blown parade down world-famous Hollywood Boulevard.\"\nOn Sunday, June 28, 1970, at around noon, in New York gay activist groups held their own pride parade, known as the Christopher Street Liberation Day, to recall the events of Stonewall one year earlier. On November 2, 1969, Craig Rodwell, his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, and Linda Rhodes proposed the first gay pride parade to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in Philadelphia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAll attendees to the ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia voted for the march except for the Mattachine Society of New York City, which abstained. Members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) attended the meeting and were seated as guests of Rodwell's group, Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods (HYMN).\nMeetings to organize the march began in early January at Rodwell's apartment in 350 Bleecker Street. At first there was difficulty getting some of the major New York organizations like Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) to send representatives. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, Michael Brown, Marty Nixon, and Foster Gunnison of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization. Other mainstays of the GLF organizing committee were Judy Miller, Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie and Brenda Howard. Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970. With Dick Leitsch's replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended.\nThe first marches were both serious and fun and served to inspire the widening LGBTQ movement; they were repeated in the following years and more and more annual marches started up in other cities throughout the world. In Atlanta and New York City the marches were called \"Gay Liberation Marches\", and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem heteronormative and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this queer culture into the space. The marches spread internationally, including to London where the first \"gay pride rally\" took place on 1 July 1972, the date chosen deliberately to mark the third anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities, and they dropped \"Gay Liberation\" and \"Gay Freedom\" from the names, replacing them with \"Gay Pride\". The term \"Gay Pride\" was claimed to be coined either by Jack Baker and Michael McConnell, an activist couple in Minnesota, or by Thom Higgins, another gay rights activist in Minnesota.\nThe Middle East had its first pride march in 1979 in Israel. The pride march has grown to over 250,000 participants by 2019. In 2017, the first pride march week in the Middle East was established in Lebanon.\nThe oldest LGBT community center in South Florida Pridelines has been a partner of Miami Beach Pride for more than a decade.\nIn Southeast Asia, the first pride march was celebrated on June 26, 1994, when 30-50 individuals marched in Quezon City in the Philippines. Less than three decades later, the government rejected an equality legislation, sparking the largest pride march in Southeast Asia, where over 110,000 people in 2023 marched in Quezon City in support of the SOGIE Equality Bill.\nEast Asia saw its first pride march on August 28, 1994, when a march was held in Tokyo in Japan. The largest ever pride march in the region was held in 2022 when over 120,000 people marched in Taiwan to support equal rights.\nThe first pride march in South Asia was held on July 2, 1999, in the city of Kolkata in India.\nDescription.\nMany parades still have at least some of the original political or activist character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even Mardi Gras-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, drag queens and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as Metropolitan Community Churches, United Church of Christ, and Unitarian Universalist Churches, PFLAG, and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of AIDS and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and corporate sponsors and promoted as major tourist attractions for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named \"Gay\", the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.\nBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, as many of the actual participants had grown older, moved on to other issues, or died, this passage of time led to misunderstandings as to who had actually participated in the Stonewall riots, who had actually organized the subsequent demonstrations, marches and memorials, and who had been members of early activist organizations such as Gay Liberation Front and Gay Activists Alliance. The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events. Changing first to \"Lesbian and Gay\", today most are called \"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender\" (LGBT) or simply \"Pride\". Pride parades are held in many urban areas and in many countries where the urbanization rate is at least 80%.\nPride events by country.\nAfrica.\nMalawi.\nOn 26 June 2021, the LGBT community in Malawi held its first Pride Parade. The parade was held in the country's capital city, Lilongwe, despite its anti-LGBTQ laws.\nMauritius.\nAs of June 2006, the Rainbow Parade Mauritius is held every June in Mauritius in the town of Rose Hill. It is organized by the Collective Arc-En-Ciel, a local non-governmental LGBTI rights group, along with some other local non-governmental groups.\nSouth Africa.\nThe first South African pride parade was held towards the end of the apartheid era in Johannesburg on October 13, 1990, the first such event on the African continent. Section Nine of the country's 1996 constitution provides for equality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation among other factors. The Joburg Pride organizing body disbanded in 2013 due to internal conflict about whether the event should continue to be used for political advocacy. A new committee was formed in May 2013 to organize a \"People's Pride\", which was \"envisioned as an inclusive and explicitly political movement for social justice\". Other pride parades held in the Johannesburg area include Soweto Pride which takes place annually in Meadowlands, Soweto, and Ekurhuleni Pride which takes place annually in KwaThema, a township on the East Rand. Pride parades held in other South African cities include the Cape Town Pride parade and Khumbu Lani Pride in Cape Town, Durban Pride in Durban, and Nelson Mandela Bay Pride in Port Elizabeth. Limpopo Pride is held in Polokwane, Limpopo.\nUganda.\nIn August 2012, the first Ugandan pride parade was held in Entebbe to protest the government's treatment of its LGBT citizens and the attempts by the Ugandan Parliament to adopt harsher sodomy laws, colloquially named the Kill the Gays Bill, which would include life imprisonment for aggravated homosexuality. A second pride parade was held in Entebbe in August 2013. The law was promulgated in December 2013 and subsequently ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court of Uganda on August 1, 2014, on technical grounds. On August 9, 2014, Ugandans held a third pride parade in Entebbe despite indications that the ruling may be appealed and/or the law reintroduced in Parliament and homosexual acts still being illegal in the country.\nAsia.\nEast Timor.\nThe first pride march in East Timor's capital Dili was held in 2017.\nHong Kong.\nThe first International Day Against Homophobia pride parade in Hong Kong was held on May 16, 2005, under the theme \"Turn Fear into Love\", calling for acceptance and care amongst gender and sexual minorities in a diverse and friendly society.\nThe Hong Kong Pride Parade 2008 boosted the rally count above 1,000 in the second largest East Asian Pride after Taipei's. By now a firmly annual event, Pride 2013 saw more than 5,200 participants. The city continues to hold the event every year, except in 2010 when it was not held due to a budget shortfall.\nIn the Hong Kong Pride Parade 2018, the event broke its previous record, with 12,000 participants. The police arrested a participant who violated the law of \"outraging public decency\" by wearing only his underwear in an area of the road cordoned off for the parade.\nIndia.\nOn June 29, 2008, four Indian cities (Delhi, Bangalore, Pondicherry, and Kolkata) saw coordinated pride events. About 2,200 people turned up overall. These were also the first pride events of all these cities except Kolkata, which had seen its first such event in 1999 - making it South Asia's first pride walk and then had been organizing pride events every year since 2003 (although there was a gap of a year or so in-between). The pride parades were successful, given that no right-wing group attacked or protested against the pride parade, although the opposition party BJP expressed its disagreement with the concept of gay pride parade. The next day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for greater social tolerance towards homosexuals at an AIDS event. On August 16, 2008 (one day after the Independence Day of India), the gay community in Mumbai held its first-ever formal pride parade (although informal pride parades had been held many times earlier), to demand that India's anti-gay laws be amended. A high court in the Indian capital, Delhi ruled on July 2, 2009, that homosexual intercourse between consenting adults was not a criminal act, although the Supreme Court later reversed its decision in 2013 under widespread pressure from powerful conservative and religious groups, leading to the re-criminalization of homosexuality in India. Pride parades have also been held in smaller Indian cities such as Nagpur, Madurai, Bhubaneshwar and Thrissur. Attendance at the pride parades has been increasing significantly since 2008, with an estimated participation of 3,500 people in Delhi and 1,500 people in Bangalore in 2010. On September 6, 2018, sex between same-sex adults was legalized by India's Supreme Court.\nTripura.\nOn September 12, 2022, Tripura celebrated its first 'Queer Pride Walk' held in Agartala. The major goal of the queer pride parade is to honor and celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons, as well as to raise awareness in society so that people can break free from the stigma and biases that surround them. Swabhiman, a non-governmental organization, coordinated the Queer Pride Walk. More than seven months after four transgender people in Tripura had a harrowing experience at a police station that went viral on social media, the state's queer community held its first-ever pride walk on Monday in Agartala, claiming the right to live in dignity and equality, free of gender discrimination, stigma, and taboo for being different. Hundreds of lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) persons marched in the colorful pride parade, waving rainbow flags and holding banners urging people to reject gender stigma and sexuality stereotypes. 'Swabhiman' President Sneha Gupta Roy asserted the necessity for the state to establish a Transgender Welfare Board to protect the rights of the gay community, adding, \"The society must accept us as we are. We, too, are members of society and should not face discrimination. The source of societal biases, discrimination, and injustice directed at us is, surprisingly, a lack of knowledge. We, too, have the right to live with respect and dignity, and in order to do so, the Central Government must work to develop the community's skills and create employment opportunities that will prevent members of the community from resorting to unethical means of income and thus becoming socially marginalized.\"\nIsrael.\nTel Aviv hosts an annual pride parade, attracting more than 260,000 people, making it the largest LGBT pride event in Asia. Three Pride parades took place in Tel Aviv on the week of June 11, 2010. The main parade, which is also partly funded by the city's municipality, was one of the largest ever to take place in Israel, with approximately 200,000 participants. The first Pride parade in Tel Aviv took place in 1993.\nOn June 30, 2005, the fourth annual Pride march of Jerusalem took place. The Jerusalem parade has been met with resistance due to the high presence of religious bodies in the city. It had originally been prohibited by a municipal ban which was canceled by the court. Many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem's Muslim, Jewish, and Christian communities had arrived at a rare consensus asking the municipal government to cancel the permit of the parades.\nAnother parade, this time billed as an international event, was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2005, but was postponed to 2006 due to the stress on police forces during the summer of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. In 2006, it was again postponed due to the Israel\u2013Hezbollah war. It was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006, caused a wave of protests by Haredi Jews around central Israel. The Israel National Police had filed a petition to cancel the parade due to foreseen strong opposition. Later, an agreement was reached to convert the parade into an assembly inside the Hebrew University stadium in Jerusalem. June 21, 2007, the Jerusalem Open House organization succeeded in staging a parade in central Jerusalem after police allocated thousands of personnel to secure the general area. The rally planned afterwards was canceled due to an unrelated national fire brigade strike which prevented proper permits from being issued. The parade was postponed once more in 2014, as a result of Protective Edge Operation.\nIn 2022 local environmentalists from Tel Aviv started planning how to make the current year's parade and future parades more sustainable, using composting stations and removing single use plastic from the largest pride parade in the Middle East.\nJapan.\nThe first Pride Parade in Japan was held on August 28, 1994, in Tokyo (while the names were not Pride Parade until 2007). In 2005, an administrative institution, the Tokyo Pride was founded to have Pride Parade constantly every year. In May 2011, Tokyo Pride was dissolved and most of the original management went on to found Tokyo Rainbow Pride.\nLebanon.\nBeirut Pride is the annual non-profit Pride (LGBTQ culture)LGBTIQ+ pride event and militant march held in Beirut, the capital of the Lebanon, working to decriminalize homosexuality in Lebanon. Since its inception in 2017, Beirut Pride has been the first and only LGBTIQ+ pride in the arabophone world, and its largest LGBTIQ+ event. It has been the topic of four MA theses, one post-doctoral research and six documentaries, so far covered in 17 languages in 350 articles. Its first installment gathered 4,000 persons, and 2,700 people participated in the first three days of its 2018 edition, before the police cracked it down and arrested its founder Hadi Damien. The next day, the prosecutor of Beirut suspended the scheduled activities, and initiated criminal proceedings against Hadi for organizing events \"that incite to debauchery\". Beirut Pride holds annual events adapted to the current circumstances in the country.\nSouth Korea.\nQueer Culture Festivals in South Korea consist of pride parades and various other LGBT events, such as film festivals.

There are also Pride Parades organized by Blue Diamond Society and Mitini Nepal. A youth-led pride parade which uses broader umbrella terms as Queer and MOGAI, is organized by Queer Youth Group and Queer Rights Collective. Blue Diamond Society's rally on Gai Jatra is technically not considered as a Pride Parade. Mitini Nepal organizes Pride Parades on Feb 14 while, a Queer Womxn Pride is also organized on International Women's Day.\nPhilippines.\nIn 1992, the Lesbian Collective marched during the International Women's Day celebrations, and participated in the program after negotiations with organizers.\nIn 1993, UP Babaylan, an LGBT student support group, participated in the University of the Philippines Diliman's Lantern Parade. Thanks to the positive reception from this march, members of UP Babaylan would participate in future Lantern Parades.\nOn June 26, 1994, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Progressive Organization of Gays in the Philippines (Pro Gay Philippines) and Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) Manila organized the first LGBT Pride March in Philippines, marching from EDSA corner Quezon Avenue to Quezon City Memorial Circle (Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines) and highlighting broad social issues. At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\nIn 1995, Pro Gay Philippines and MCC did not lead a pride parade. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reach Out AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. These pride parades were organized a celebration of gay pride, but also were parading to raise awareness for discrimination and the misinformation surrounding AIDS.\nIn 1999, Reach Out Aids Foundation handed its organization to a newly formed Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community. In 2003, the Pride March was moved from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10). TFP organized the pride parades for two decades before the Metro Manila Pride organization assumed the responsibility in 2016.\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nIn 2007, the first transgender women's group participated in the Metro Manila Pride March.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Metro Manila Pride March with the theme: Come Out for Love \"Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin\" (Come Out for Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\nSingapore.\nA pride parade known as Pink Dot SG has been held in Singapore since 2009 with increasing attendance amounting to the tens of thousands.

However, the route was changed for the 2017 Parade due to Luas Cross City works.\nThe parade attracts thousands of people who line the streets each year. It gained momentum after the 2015 Marriage Equality Referendum.\nA separate annual pride march, Trans &amp; Intersex Pride Dublin has also gained large crowds of supporters Trans &amp; Intersex Pride Dublin marches with the goal of bringing pride back to its radical roots of protest and for better access to gender affirming care in Ireland.\nItaly.\nThe first public demonstration within the LGBT community in Italy took place in San Remo on April 5, 1972, as a protest against the International Congress on Sexual Deviance organized by the Catholic-inspired Italian Center of Sexology. The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain's Gay Liberation Front, and Italy's activist homosexual rights group \"Fuori!\".\nThe first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of \"Fuori!\" held in Turin in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects. Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in Livorno. In Pisa in November of that year, the Orfeo Collective organized the first march against anti-gay violence. Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.\nLater, a system of \"national Pride\" observances designated one city to hold the official events, starting with Rome in 1994. Starting in 2013, the organization Onda Pride organized additional events, and in 2019 events were organized in 39 cities nationwide.\nKosovo.\nEvents celebrating the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia have been organized in Kosovo since 2007. The first pride parade occurred in Pristina in May 2017, with attendance from President Hashim Tha\u00e7i and British and American diplomats. The annual Pride Week has been held in Pristina since 2017. In 2018, Mayor Shpend Ahmeti participated. During the event's third edition in October 2019, participants started at the Skanderbeg Square, making their way down Mother Teresa Boulevard to Zahir Pajaziti Square, passing the government and parliament buildings and other landmarks of the city, with the slogan \"Whoever your heart beats for\" (\"P\u00ebr kon t'rreh zemra\"). The events have been held without incidence, and consist of various artistic exhibitions, parties, conferences, discussions and a parade.\nLatvia.\nOn July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in Riga, surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the Riga City Council, and the then-Prime Minister of Latvia, Aigars Kalv\u012btis, opposed the event, stating Riga should \"not promote things like that\", however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead. In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by \"No Pride\" protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed. In 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around V\u0113rmane Garden, protected physically from \"No Pride\" protesters by 1,500 Latvian police, with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses. A man and his son were afterwards arrested by the police. This caused some alarm but no injury, although participants did have to run the gauntlet of \"No Pride\" abuse as they ran to the buses. They were driven to a railway station on the outskirts of Riga, from where they went to a post Pride \"relax\" at the seaside resort of J\u016brmala. Participants included MEPs, Amnesty International observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 Embankment) beneath the Riga Castle. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the Latvian President. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 \"No Pride\" protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held. The events were attended by the United States Ambassador to Latvia Judith Garber and the Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds.\nIn 2015, Riga hosted the pan-European EuroPride event with about 5000 participants engaging in approximately 50 cultural and entertainment events.\nThe Baltic Pride event returned to Riga in 2018, the year of the centenary of the independence of Latvia and all three Baltic states. An estimated 8000 people took part. The events took place for 100 days from March 3 to June 10 with the parade being held through the city on June 9.\nLithuania.\nIn 2010 first pride parade - the 2nd Baltic Pride - in Lithuania was held in Vilnius. About 300 foreign guests marched through the streets along the local participants. Law was enforced with nearly a thousand policemen.\nThe city also hosted the event in 2013 and 2016 gathering around 3 thousand participants each year.\nThe 2019 Baltic Pride was held on June 4\u20139 in Vilnius. An estimated 10 thousand people marched through the central part of the city.\nNetherlands.\nIn Amsterdam, a pride parade has been held since 1996. The week(end)-long event involves concerts, sports tournaments, street parties and most importantly the Canal Pride, a parade on boats on the canals of Amsterdam. In 2008 three government ministers joined on their own boat, representing the whole cabinet. Mayor of Amsterdam Job Cohen also joined. About 500,000 visitors were reported. 2008 was also the first year large Dutch international corporations ING Group and TNT NV sponsored the event.\nThe Utrecht Canal Pride is the second largest gay pride in the country, organised annually since 2017. Smaller Pride parades are organised in many larger cities across the country.\nNorway.\nThe first pride demonstration in Norway was in 1974, with around 250 participants. The first pride parade was in 1982. During the 1990s, the event developed into a 10 day long festival, including seminars, debates, concerts and parties at different places in Oslo. The 2019 festival involved a total of around 450,000 participants and spectators. The 2025 parade had between 90,000 and 100,000 participants, including the Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\nOslo has been host for the international Europride twice, in 2005 and 2014.\nPoland.\nThe oldest pride parade in Poland, the Equality Parade in Warsaw, has been organized since 2001. In 2005, the parade was forbidden by local authorities (including then-Mayor Lech Kaczy\u0144ski) but occurred nevertheless. The ban was later declared a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights (B\u0105czkowski and Others v. Poland). In 2008, more than 1,800 people joined the march. In 2010 EuroPride took place in Warsaw with approximately 8,000 participants. The last parade in Warsaw, in 2019, drew 80,000 people. Other Polish cities which host pride parades are Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144, Gda\u0144sk, Toru\u0144, Wroc\u0142aw, Lublin, Cz\u0119stochowa, Rzesz\u00f3w, Opole, Zielona G\u00f3ra, Konin, Bydgoszcz, Szczecin, Kalisz, Koszalin, Olsztyn, Kielce, Gniezno, Katowice, Bia\u0142ystok, Radomsko, and P\u0142ock.\nPortugal.\nIn Lisbon, the Pride Parade, known as \"Marcha do Orgulho LGBTI+,\" has been held every year since 2000, as well as in Porto since 2006. Other locations, such as Funchal, Braga and Ovar have hosted their Pride Parades.\nRussia.\nPrides in Russia are generally banned by city authorities in St. Petersburg and Moscow, due to opposition from politicians and religious leaders. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has described the proposed Moscow Pride as \"satanic\". Attempted parades have led to clashes between protesters and counter-protesters, with the police acting to keep the two apart and disperse participants. In 2007 British activist Peter Tatchell was physically assaulted. This was not the case in the high-profile attempted march in May 2009, during the Eurovision Song Contest. In this instance the police played an active role in arresting pride marchers. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia has until January 20, 2010, to respond to cases of pride parades being banned in 2006, 2007 and 2008. \nIn June 2012, Moscow courts enacted a hundred-year ban on pride parades.\nSerbia.\nBelgrade Pride.\nBelgrade Pride is an annual LGBTQ+ pride parade and festival held in Belgrade, Serbia. It is the most prominent LGBTQ+ event in Serbia and has a history marked by both struggle and progress.\nThe first attempt to hold a Belgrade Pride march in 2001 was met with violence from opponents, and subsequent attempts faced government bans and clashes with extremists. In 2014, a turning point was reached when the first major, peaceful Pride march took place with significant police protection.\nSince 2014, Belgrade Pride has become a more regular and peaceful event, with growing participation. In 2023, Belgrade Pride saw its largest ever turnout, marking a significant step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in Serbia.\nIn 2022, Belgrade hosted EuroPride. The Government of Serbia banned the Pride march due to the potential risk for its participants shown by protests by extremist ultra-right-wing organizations. Despite the ban, the EuroPride march happened and approximately 10 000 people walked the shortened march route. Minor incidents happened during the parade walk, orchestrated by opponents of Europride.\nSlovenia.\nAlthough first LGBTQ festival in Slovenia dates to 1984, namely the Ljubljana Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the first pride parade was only organized in 2001 after a gay couple was asked to leave a Ljubljana caf\u00e9 for being homosexual. Ljubljana pride is traditionally supported by the mayor of Ljubljana and left-wing politicians.\nOn June 30, 2019, Maribor held their first pride parade which was largely supported by several embassy ambassadors and other organizations.\nSpain.\nSpain's first pride parade was held in Barcelona on 26 June 1977, but was violently repressed by police, as official attitudes towards the LGBT community had not yet changed much since Franco's death in 1975. However, \"Orgull de Barcelona\" (\"Barcelona Pride\") is nowadays a yearly event, and local politicians attend. The 2022 gathering drew a crowd of some 90,000.\nMadrid Pride Parade, known as \"Fiesta del Orgullo Gay\" (or simply \"Fiesta del Orgullo\"), \"Manifestaci\u00f3n Estatal del Orgullo LGTB\" and \"D\u00eda del Orgullo Gay\" (or simply \"D\u00eda del Orgullo\"), is held the first Saturday after June 28 since 1979.\nThe event is organised by COGAM (Madrid GLTB Collective) and FELGTBI+ (Spanish Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Trans, Bisexuals, Intersex, and more) and supported by other national and international LGTB groups. The first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator Francisco Franco, with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like Microsoft, Google and Schweppes and several political parties and trade unions, including Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, PODEMOS, United Left, Union, Progress and Democracy, CCOO and UGT have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the Spanish government.\nIn 2007, Europride, the European Pride Parade, took place in Madrid. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district Chueca, the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. Barcelona, Valencia and Seville hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 Barcelona hosted the EuroGames.\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at Maspalomas, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations. Within a few years of its existence, Winter Pride Maspalomas became a major Pride celebration within Spain and Europe. During its 6th edition in November 2019, the Pride Walk LGBT equal rights march had over 18,000 international visitors.\nIn 2017, Madrid hosted the WorldPride. It would be the first time WorldPride was celebrated in a Spanish city.\nSweden.\nThe Stockholm Pride, sometimes styled as \"STHLM Pride\", is the biggest annual Pride event in the Nordic countries with over 60,000 participants early and 600,000 people following the parade. The Stockholm Pride is notable for several officials such as the Swedish Police Authority and Swedish Armed Forces having their own entities in the parade.\nSeveral Swedish cities have their own Pride festivals, most notably Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6. In 2018, Stockholm Pride and Gothenburg West Pride, co-hosted the 25th annual EuroPride parade.\nTurkey.\nTurkey was the first Muslim-majority country in which a gay pride march was held. Gay pride march in Istanbul started with 30 people in 2003. Similar pride marches were being held each year in other cities including Ankara (since 2008), \u0130zmir and Antalya (since 2013). In Istanbul, the numbers have increased each year, reaching roughly 15,000 people by 2011. The 2014 pride attracted more than 100,000 people, therefore making Gay Pride Istanbul the biggest march of its kind in the Muslim World. The European Union praised Turkey that the parade went ahead without disruption. Politicians of the biggest opposition party, CHP and another opposition party, BDP also lent their support to the demonstration. \nThe pride march in Istanbul does not receive any support of the municipality or the government. However, on 28 June 2015, Turkish police used a water cannon to disperse the gay pride parade. In 2016, the pride march was banned by the Istanbul Governor's Office \"for the safety of our citizens, first and foremost the participants'.\" \nIn 2019, for the fifth consecutive year the Istanbul Governor's Office yet again banned the LGBTQ Pride Parade, citing security concerns. On 29 June, hundreds of people defied the ban, they were met with tear gas and water cannon from the police.\nOn 10 June 2018, the 6th \u0130zmir Pride was held. Around 50,000 people participated at the Pride.\nNorthern Cyprus.\nThe annual pride parade has been held in North Nicosia without incidents since 2014. In 2024, Mayor\u00a0Mehmet Harmanci participated.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThere are five main pride events in the UK LGBT pride calendar: London, Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham being the largest and are the cities with the biggest gay populations.\nPride in London is one of the biggest in Europe and takes place on the final Saturday in June or first Saturday in July each year. London also hosted a Black Pride in August and Soho Pride or a similar event every September. During the early-1980s, there was a women-only Lesbian Strength march held each year a week before the Gay Pride march. 2012 saw World Pride coming to London.\nStarting in 2017, there is a Pride parade for the city's black community that takes place the day after the main Pride parade, at the Vauxhall Gardens. In February 2018, the charity Stonewall announced that they would support Black Pride instead of the main Pride parade.\nOn 5 July 2025, the Pride in London parade was carried out from Hyde Park Corner to its destination in Whitehall. \nBrighton Pride is held on the first Saturday of August (apart from in 2012 when the event was moved to September due to the 2012 Olympics). The event starts from the seafront and culminating at Preston Park.\nLiverpool Pride was launched in 2010, but by 2011 it became the largest free Gay Pride festival in the United Kingdom outside London. (Liverpool's LGBTQ population was 94,000 by mid-2009 according to the North West Regional Development Agency.\nManchester Pride has been running since 1985 and centres around the famous Canal Street. It is traditionally a four-day celebration held over the August bank holiday weekend.\nBirmingham Pride usually takes place during the final Spring bank holiday weekend in May, and focuses on the Birmingham Gay Village area of the city, with upwards of 70,000 people in attendance annually.\nPride events also happen in most other major cities such as Pride Cymru in Cardiff and events in Belfast, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield.\nIn 2025 the Christian Institute was planning a judicial review of civil service staff participation in Pride events.\nNorth America.\nBarbados.\nThe island nation held its first pride parade in July 2018. It attracted a diverse group, which included members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, allies of the community, tourists and at least one member of the local clergy who came out strongly in support of the LGBT movement.\nCanada.\nMontreal.\nMontreal Pride Parade, is held in mid-August and has taken place every year since 1979, when a group of 200 people commemorated New York City's 1969 Stonewall Riots with \"Gairilla\", a precursor to Montreal's gay pride parade celebrations. The LGBTQ+ festivities take place over eleven days, with events centered around the Gay Village.\nIn May 2023, Montreal Pride launched a comprehensive rebrand of its website and logo, meant to signal that the non-profit had moved on from the last-minute cancellation of the 2022 parade, which was cancelled due to a lack of organization.\nMontreal Pride has hired 200 additional employees with event planning experience to ensure the August 13, 2023 parade is well-organized and prepared for the 100,000 expected attendees.\nOttawa.\nOttawa Pride Parade, inaugurated in 1989, is an annual LGBT pride event spanning Canada's capital city of Ottawa, Ontario, and its neighbour Gatineau, Quebec. Over the years, this event has significantly grown and is now a prominent fixture held on the fourth Sunday of August. \nOttawa's inaugural Pride Parade took place on Sunday, June 18, 1989, initially occurring annually in June until 1994 when it was rescheduled to July. In 2005, the Pride Festival moved from Bank Street back to Festival Plaza due to the high costs and outstanding debts of the Pride Committee. Consequently, the festival's dates were shifted from July to August, aligning with constraints at Festival Plaza. This scheduling adjustment is the reason why Ottawa's Pride Parade is held on the fourth Sunday of August each year.\nToronto.\nToronto's pride parade has been held yearly or every June since 1981; the first pride parade in Toronto was held in June 1981. In 2003, its activists helped score a major victory when the Ontario Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling which made same-sex marriage legal in Ontario, the first jurisdiction in North America to do so. By this time the Toronto Pride Week Festival had been running for twenty-three years. It is also one of the largest, attracting around 1.3 million people in 2009. The 38th pride parade in Toronto was held on June 24, 2018. Toronto hosted WorldPride in 2014.\nVancouver.\nVancouver's Pride Parade takes place each year during the August long weekend (BC Day falls on the first Monday of August in the province of British Columbia). The parade takes place in the downtown core with over 150 floats moving along Robson Street, Denman Street and along Davie Street. The parade has a crowd of over 150,000 attendees with well over half a million in attendance for the August 4, 2013 Pride Parade. New for 2013 are the permanently painted rainbow crosswalks in Vancouver's West End neighbourhood at Davie and Bute streets. The city of Surrey, in the Metro Vancouver area also hosts a Pride Festival, though on a much smaller scale.\nWinnipeg.\nWinnipeg's Pride Parade takes place annually over the course of several days and is one of the largest Pride events in central Canada with 10 days of community based events and activities. Winnipeg's first Pride event came about after the government voted in favour of including the provision of sexual orientation, under the prescribed provincial human rights code in 1987. The parade started as a march of celebration led by activists and supporters who gathered outside Manitoba's Legislative Assembly awaiting the announcement of the governments decision, when it was released, activists numbered around 250, including notable figures such as Albert McLeod and Connie Merasty who were active parts of community organizations advocating for human rights recognition.\nOn June 4, 2023, Winnipeg's Pride president Barry Karlenzig revealed that a record-breaking 10,000 people had registered to march. This marked the largest parade in the event's history.\nMexico.\nThe first gay pride parade in Mexico occurred in Mexico City in 1979, and it was attended by over a thousand people. Ever since, it has been held annually under different slogans, with the purpose of bringing visibility to sexual minorities, raising awareness about HIV/AIDS, fighting homophobia, and advocating for LGBT rights, including the legalization of civil unions, same-sex marriages, and LGBTQ adoption. In 2009, more than 350,000 people attended the gay pride march in Mexico City\u2014100,000 more than the previous year. Guadalajara has also held their own Guadalajara Gay Pride every June since 1996, and it is the second largest gay pride parade in the country. Gay pride parades have also spread to the cities of Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, Puebla, Tijuana, Toluca, Canc\u00fan, Acapulco, M\u00e9rida, Xalapa, Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, Matamoros, Saltillo, Mazatlan, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta, and Hermosillo, among others.\nTrinidad and Tobago.\nTrinidad and Tobago organised its first pride parade on 27 July 2018 at the Nelson Mandela Park in Port of Spain. Expressing his opinion on the march, Roman Catholic Archbishop Rev. Jason Gordon said: \"TT is a democracy and as such members of society have a right to protest whenever they believe their rights are not being upheld or violated. (The) LGBT+ community has several areas where there is legitimate concern and these have to be taken seriously by the country and by the government and people of TT. \"\nUnited States.\nThe first pride parade was the Chicago Pride Parade, which has been hosted annually since June 27, 1970. It also is the largest pride parade in Illinois. Pride parades would eventually be greater media visibility and participation in the 1990s, which led to US President Bill Clinton issuing Presidential Proclamation 7203, which declared June 1999 the first national Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. In 2015, the Stonewall Inn was declared a historic landmark by the City of New York, which was then upgraded the next year by US President Barack Obama to a national monument.\nRural &amp; small-towns.\nPride festivals, celebrations of LGBTQ+ identity and community, are often associated with major metropolitan areas. However, rural and small-town America has witnessed a flourishing of pride events in recent decades. While the exact number is difficult to pinpoint due to varying levels of promotion, estimates suggest that nearly half of all pride celebrations in the United States take place in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. These rural pride festivals hold a special significance. They provide a vital space for LGBTQ+ individuals in smaller communities to connect, celebrate their identities, and find acceptance. In areas where isolation and discrimination can be more pronounced, pride festivals offer a sense of belonging and foster important social networks.\nRural Pride festivals often possess a distinct character compared to their urban counterparts. Events tend to be smaller in scale, fostering a closer-knit atmosphere. Local businesses and community organizations are frequently involved, lending the celebrations a personal touch. Events may feature parades, drag performances, barbecues, potlucks, and line dancing.\nOne rural pride event, the Borderland Pride parade, is a unique pride celebration held annually. It takes place in International Falls, Minnesota, United States, and concludes in Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada, making it the only Pride march to cross an international border. Participants gather at Smokey Bear Park in International Falls before proceeding to the Canadian Border Services Agency office. After crossing the border, the march concludes at Rainy Lake Square in Fort Frances, where festivities including food and entertainment take place.\nNew York.\nThe annual New York City Pride March began on June 28, 1970. The New York City Pride March rivals the Sao Paulo Gay Pride Parade as the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June.\nOn June 30, 2019, State of New York hosted the largest international LGBTQ pride celebration in history, known as Stonewall 50 \u2013 WorldPride NYC 2019, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. The twelve-hour parade included 150,000 pre-registered participants among 695 groups and an estimated five million visitors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Savinja is the main river of the Savinja Alps (Sln. \"Savinjske Alpe\"). It flows into the Sava River at the town of Zidani Most. It has often flooded, such as in the 1960s, 1990, and 1995. The Savinja has a length of and a catchment area of .\nSources.\nThe stream is created by Rinka Falls, which flows along a regulated riverbed to the lower end of the Logar Valley, where it flows into Jezera Creek, from which point it becomes the Savinja River. This spring has been proclaimed a natural heritage object, and Rinka Falls is one of the most beautiful and best-known waterfalls in Slovenia. It is the highest waterfall of the 20 waterfalls in the Logar Valley and is visited throughout the year. In the winter it is popular for ice-climbers. The best view of the waterfall is from Kamnik Saddle ().\nTributaries.\nThe main tributaries of the Savinja are the Ju\u0161ef and the Kloba\u0161a at Sol\u010dava, the Lu\u010dnica at Lu\u010de, the Ljubnica at Ljubno, the Dreta at Nazarje, the Paka at \u0160martno ob Paki, and the Lo\u017enica and Voglajna with the Hudinja at Celje.\nWater quality.\nThe quality of water is first-class to Radmirje, then it falls to second class and after to third.\nHydronym and etymology.\nThe name \"Savinja\" (attested in written sources in 980 as \"Sovuina\") is derived from \"*Sav\u044cn\u2032a\", in turn derived from the hydronym \"Sava\", of which it is a tributary. The German name \"Sann\" was attested later. In the local dialect, the river is known as \"S\u00e1\u0144e\". The form *\"Sav\u044cn\u2032a\" should have yielded \"Savnja\" as the current Slovene name, but it was reshaped on the model of \"Hudinja\". The name is believed to ultimately not be of Slavic origin, but of older pre-Slavic origin.\nThe German name \"Sann\" was also used in some older English sources; for example, in the ninth edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica from 1911.\nSome other names for the river include:\nThe Celtic goddess Adsaluta, whose altars were found in the area of the settlement of Sava, was long identified with the Savinja. Modern scholars have rejected the connection.\nLife along the river.\nRaftsmen from Ljubno traveled along the river until the 1950s. In their memory, a bronze sculpture of a raftsman (\"Splavar\"), created in 1961 by Boris Kalin, stands on the river's left bank in Celje.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Japan, the line of products was marketed under the brand AirMac due to previous registration by I-O Data.\nApple introduced the AirPort line in 1999. Wireless cards were discontinued in 2009 following the Mac transition to Intel processors, after all of Apple's Mac products had adopted built-in Wi-Fi. Apple's line of wireless routers consisted of the AirPort Base Station (later AirPort Extreme); the AirPort Time Capsule, a variant with a built-in hard disk for automated backups; and the AirPort Express, a compact router.\nIn 2018, Apple discontinued the AirPort line. The remaining inventory was sold off, and Apple later sold routers from Linksys, Netgear, Amplifi and Eero in Apple retail stores.\nOverview.\nAirPort debuted in 1999, as \"one more thing\" at Macworld New York, with Steve Jobs surfing the web on an iBook using wireless internet technology for the very first time in a public demo of an Apple laptop. The initial offering consisted of an optional expansion card for Apple's new line of iBook notebooks and an AirPort Base Station. The AirPort card (a repackaged Lucent ORiNOCO Gold Card PC Card adapter) was later added as an option for almost all of Apple's product line, including PowerBooks, eMacs, iMacs, and Power Macs. Only Xserves did not have it as a standard or optional feature. The original AirPort system allowed transfer rates up to 11\u00a0Mbit/s and was commonly used to share Internet access and files between multiple computers.\nIn 2003, Apple introduced AirPort Extreme, based on the 802.11g specification, using Broadcom's BCM4306/BCM2050 two-chip solution. AirPort Extreme allows theoretical peak data transfer rates of up to 54\u00a0Mbit/s, and is fully backward-compatible with existing 802.11b wireless network cards and base stations. Several of Apple's desktop computers and portable computers, including the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Mini, and iMac shipped with an AirPort Extreme (802.11g) card as standard. All other Macs of the time had an expansion slot for the card. AirPort and AirPort Extreme cards are not physically compatible: AirPort Extreme cards cannot be installed in older Macs, and AirPort cards cannot be installed in newer Macs. The original AirPort card was discontinued in June 2004.\nIn 2004, Apple released the AirPort Express base station as a \"Swiss Army knife\" multifunction product. It can be used as a portable travel router, using the same AC connectors as on Apple's AC adapters; as an audio streaming device, with both line-level and optical audio outputs; and as a USB printer sharing device, through its USB host port.\nIn 2007, Apple unveiled a new AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N) Base Station, which introduced 802.11 Draft-N to the Apple AirPort product line. This implementation of 802.11 Draft-N can operate in both the 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz ISM bands, and has modes that make it compatible with 802.11b/g and 802.11a. The number of Ethernet ports was increased to four\u2014one nominally for WAN, three for LAN, but all can be used in bridged mode. A USB port was included for printers and other USB devices. The Ethernet ports were later updated to Gigabit Ethernet on all ports. The styling is similar to that of the Mac Mini and Apple TV.\nIn January 2008, Apple introduced Time Capsule, an AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N) with an internal hard drive. The device includes software to allow any computer running a reasonably recent version of Mac OS or Windows to access the disk as a shared volume. Macs running Mac OS X 10.5 and later, which includes the Time Machine feature, can use the Time Capsule as a wireless backup device, allowing automatic, untethered backups of the client computer. As an access point, the unit is otherwise equivalent to an AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N), with four Gigabit Ethernet ports and a USB port for printer and disk sharing.\nIn March 2008, Apple released an updated AirPort Express Base Station with 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 radio. All other features (analog and digital optical audio out, single Ethernet port, USB port for printer sharing) remained the same. At the time, it was the least expensive ($99) device to handle both frequency bands (2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz) in 2x2 802.11 Draft-N.\nIn March 2009, Apple unveiled AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule products with simultaneous dual-band 802.11 Draft-N radios. This allows full 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 communication in both 802.11 Draft-N bands at the same time.\nIn October 2009, Apple unveiled the updated AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule products with antenna improvements (the 5.8\u00a0GHz model).\nIn 2011, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme base station, referred to as AirPort Extreme 802.11n (5th Generation). The latest AirPort base stations and cards work with third-party base stations and wireless cards that conformed to the 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11 Draft-N, and 802.11 Final-N networking standards. It was not uncommon to see wireless networks composed of several types of AirPort base station serving old and new Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Linux systems. Apple's software drivers for AirPort Extreme also supported some Broadcom and Atheros-based PCI Wireless adapters when fitted to Power Mac computers. Due to the developing nature of Draft-N hardware, there was no assurance that the new model would work with all 802.11 Draft-N routers and access devices from other manufacturers.\nDiscontinuation.\nIn approximately 2016, Apple disbanded its wireless router team. In 2018, Apple formally discontinued all of its AirPort products, exiting the router market. \"Bloomberg News\" noted that \"Apple rarely discontinues product categories\" and that its decision to leave the business was \"a boon for other wireless router makers.\"\nAirPort routers.\nAn AirPort router is used to connect AirPort-enabled computers to the Internet, each other, a wired LAN, and/or other devices.\nAirPort Base Station.\nThe original AirPort Base Station (known as \"Graphite\", model M5757, part number M7601LL/B) features a dial-up modem and an Ethernet port. It employs a Lucent WaveLAN Silver PC Card as the Radio, and uses an embedded AMD \u00c9lan SC410 processor. It connects to the machine via the Ethernet port. It was released July 21, 1999. The Graphite AirPort Base Station is functionally identical to the Lucent RG-1000 wireless base station and can run the same firmware. Due to the original firmware-locked limitations of the Silver card, the unit can only accept 40-bit WEP encryption. Later aftermarket tweaks can enable 128-bit WEP on the Silver card. Aftermarket Linux firmware has been developed for these units to extend their useful service life.\nA second-generation model (known as \"Dual Ethernet\" or \"Snow\", model M8440, part number M8209LL/A) was introduced on November 13, 2001. It features a second Ethernet port when compared to the Graphite design, allowing for a shared Internet connection with both wired and wireless clients. Also new (but available for the original model via software update) was the ability to connect to and share America Online's dial-up service\u2014a feature unique to Apple base stations. This model is based on Motorola's PowerPC 855 processor and contained a fully functional original AirPort Card, which can be removed and used in any compatible Macintosh computer.\nAirPort Extreme Base Station.\nThree different configurations of model A1034 are all called the \"AirPort Extreme Base Station\":1. M8799LL/A \u2013 2 Ethernet ports, 1 USB port, external antenna connector, 1 56k (V.90) modem port2. M8930LL/A \u2013 2 Ethernet ports, 1 USB port, external antenna connector.3. M9397LL/A \u2013 2 Ethernet ports, 1 USB port, external antenna connector, powered over Ethernet cable (PoE/UL2043)\nThe AirPort Base Station was discontinued after the updated AirPort Extreme was https:// on January 7, 2003. In addition to providing wireless connection speeds of up to a maximum of 54\u00a0Mbit/s, it adds an external antenna port and a USB port. The antenna port allows the addition of a signal-boosting antenna, and the USB port allows the sharing of a USB printer. A connected printer is made available via Bonjour's \"zero configuration\" technology and IPP to all wired and wireless clients on the network. The CPU is an AU1500-333MBC Alchemy (processor). A second model (https://) lacking the modem and external antenna port was briefly made available, but then discontinued after the launch of AirPort Express (see below). On April 19, 2004, a third version, marketed as the \"AirPort Extreme Base Station (with Power over Ethernet and UL 2043)\", was introduced that supports Power over Ethernet and complies to the UL 2043 specifications for safe usage in air handling spaces, such as above suspended ceilings. All three models support the Wireless Distribution System (WDS) standard. The model introduced in January 2007 does not have a corresponding PoE, UL-compliant variant.\nAn AirPort Extreme base station can serve a maximum of 50 wireless clients simultaneously.\nAirPort Extreme 802.11n.\nThe AirPort Extreme was updated on January 9, 2007, to support the 802.11n protocol. This revision also adds two LAN ports for a total of three. It now more closely resembles the square-shaped 1st generation Apple TV and Mac Mini, and is about the same size as the mini.\nThe new AirPort Disk feature allows users to plug a USB hard drive into the AirPort Extreme for use as a network-attached storage (NAS) device for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows clients. Users may also connect a USB hub and printer. The performance of USB hard drives attached to an AirPort Extreme is slower than if the drive were connected directly to a computer. This is due to the processor speed on the AirPort extreme. Depending on the setup and types of reads and writes, performance ranges from 0.5 to 17.5\u00a0MB/s for writing and 1.9 to 25.6\u00a0MB/s for reading. Performance for the same disk connected directly to a computer would be 6.6 to 31.6\u00a0MB/s for writing and 7.1 to 37.2\u00a0MB/s for reading.\nThe AirPort Extreme has no port for an external antenna.\nOn August 7, 2007, the AirPort Extreme began shipping with Gigabit Ethernet, matching most other Apple products.\nOn March 19, 2008, Apple released a firmware update for both models of the AirPort Extreme to allow AirPort Disks to be used in conjunction with Time Machine, similar to the functionality provided by Time Capsule.\nOn March 3, 2009, Apple unveiled a new AirPort Extreme with simultaneous dual-band 802.11 Draft-N radios. This allows full 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 communication in both 802.11 Draft-N bands at the same time.\nOn October 20, 2009, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme base station with antenna improvements.\nOn June 21, 2011, Apple unveiled an updated AirPort Extreme base station, referred to as \"AirPort Extreme 802.11n (5th Generation)\".\nAirPort Express.\nThe AirPort Express is a simplified and compact AirPort Extreme base station. It allows up to 50 networked users, and includes a feature called AirTunes (predecessor to AirPlay). The original version (M9470LL/A, model A1084) was introduced by Apple on June 7, 2004, and includes an analog\u2013optical audio mini-jack output, a USB port for remote printing or charging the iPod (iPod Shuffle only), and a single Ethernet port. The USB port cannot be used to connect a hard disk or other storage device.\nThe AirPort Express functions as a wireless access point when connected to an Ethernet network. It can be used as an Ethernet-to-wireless bridge under certain wireless configurations.\nIt can be used to extend the range of a network, or as a printer and audio server.\nIn 2012, the AirPort Express took on a new shape, similar to that of the second and third generation Apple TV. The new product also features two 10/100\u00a0Mbit/s Ethernet LAN ports.\nAirPort Time Capsule.\nThe AirPort Time Capsule is a version of AirPort Extreme with a built-in hard drive currently coming in either 2\u00a0TB or 3\u00a0TB sizes, with a previous version having 1\u00a0TB or 500\u00a0GB. It features a built-in design that, when used with Time Machine in Mac OS X Leopard, automatically makes incremental data backups. Acting as a wireless file server, AirPort Time Capsule can serve to back up multiple Macs. It also includes all AirPort Extreme (802.11 Draft-N) functionality.\nOn March 3, 2009, the Time Capsule was updated with simultaneous dual-band 802.11 Draft-N capability, remote AirPort Disk accessibility through Back to My Mac, and the ability to broadcast a guest network at the same time as an existing network.\nOn October 20, 2009, Apple unveiled the updated Time Capsule with antenna improvements resulting in wireless performance gains of both speed and range. Also stated is a resulting performance improvement/time reduction on Time Capsule backups of up to 60%.\nIn June 2011, Apple unveiled the updated Time Capsule with a higher capacity 2\u00a0TB and 3\u00a0TB. They also changed the wireless card from a Marvell chip to a Broadcom BCM4331 chip. When used in conjunction with the latest 2011 MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and MacBook Airs (which also use a Broadcom BCM4331 wireless chip), the wireless signal is improved thanks to Broadcom's Frame Bursting technology.\nOn June 10, 2013, Apple renamed the Time Capsule to the AirPort Time Capsule and added support for the 802.11ac standard.\nAirPort Time Capsule backups will no longer be supported starting with macOS 27 in 2026.\nAirPort cards.\nApple produced numerous wireless card used to connect to wireless networks such as those provided by an AirPort Base Station.\nAirPort 802.11b card.\nThe original model, known as simply \"AirPort card\", was a re-branded Lucent WaveLAN/Orinoco Gold PC card, in a modified housing that lacked the integrated antenna. It was designed to be capable of being user-installable. It was also modified in such a way that it could not be used in a regular PCMCIA slot (at the time it was significantly cheaper than the official WaveLAN/Orinoco Gold card).\nAn AirPort card adapter is required to use this card in the slot-loading iMacs.\nAirPort Extreme 802.11g cards.\nCorresponding with the release of the AirPort Extreme Base Station, the AirPort Extreme card became available as an option on the current models. It is based on a Broadcom 802.11g chipset and is housed in a custom form factor, but is electrically compatible with the Mini PCI standard. It was also capable of being user-installed.\nVariants of the user-installable AirPort Extreme card are marked A-1010 (early North American spec), A-1026 (current North American spec), A-1027 (Europe/Asia spec (additional channels)) and A-1095 (unknown).\nA different 802.11g card was included in the last iteration of the PowerPC-based PowerBooks and iBooks. A major distinction for this card was that it was the first \"combo\" card that included both 802.11g as well as Bluetooth. It was also the first card that was not user-installable. It was again a custom form factor, but was still electrically a Mini PCI interface for the Broadcom WLAN chip. A separate USB connection was used for the on-board Bluetooth chip.\nThe AirPort Extreme (802.11g) card was discontinued in January 2009.\nIntegrated AirPort Extreme 802.11a/b/g/n and /ac cards.\nAs 802.11g began to come standard on all notebook models, Apple phased out the user-installable designs in their notebooks, iMacs and Mac Minis by mid-2005, moving to an integrated design. AirPort continued to be an option, either installed at purchase or later, on the Power Mac G5 and the Mac Pro.With the introduction of the Intel-based MacBook Pro in January 2006, Apple began to use a standard PCI Express mini card. The particular brand and model of card has changed over the years; in early models, it was Atheros brand, while since late 2008 they have been Broadcom cards. This distinction is mostly of concern to those who run other operating systems such as Linux on MacBooks, as different cards require different device drivers.\nThe MacBook Air Mid 2012 13\", MacBook Air Mid 2011 13\" and MacBook Air Late 2010 (11\", A1370 and 13\", Model A1369) each use a Broadcom BCM 943224 PCIEBT2 Wi-Fi card (main chip BCM43224: 2 \u00d7 2 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz).\nThe MacBook Pro Retina Mid 2012 uses Broadcom BCM94331CSAX (main chip BCM4331: 3 \u00d7 3 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz, up to 450\u00a0Mbit/s).\nIn early 2007, Apple announced that most Intel Core 2 Duo-based Macs, which had been shipping since November 2006, already included AirPort Extreme cards compatible with the draft-802.11 Draft-N specification. Apple also offered an application to enable 802.11 Draft-N functionality on these Macs for a fee of $1.99, or free with the purchase of an AirPort Extreme base station. Starting with Leopard, the Draft-N functionality was quietly enabled on all Macs that had Draft-N cards. This card was also a PCI Express mini design, but used three antenna connectors in the notebooks and iMacs, in order to use a 2 \u00d7 3 MIMO antenna configuration. The cards in the Mac Pro and Apple TV have two antenna connectors and support a 2 \u00d7 2 configuration. The Network Utility application located in \"Applications \u2192 Utilities\" can be used to identify the model and supported protocols of an installed AirPort card. \nStarting with the 2013 MacBook Air, Macs began using the IEEE 802.11ac standard (main chip http://: 2 \u00d7 2 : 2).\nSecurity.\nAirPort and AirPort Extreme support a variety of security technologies to prevent eavesdropping and unauthorized network access, including several forms of cryptography.\nThe original graphite AirPort base station used 40-bit Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). The second-generation model (known as Dual Ethernet or Snow) AirPort base station, like most other Wi-Fi products, used 40-bit or 128-bit Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). AirPort Extreme and Express base stations retain this option, but also allow and encourage the use of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and, as of July 14, 2005, WPA2.\nAirPort Extreme cards, which use the Broadcom chipset, have the media access control layer in software. The driver is proprietary.\nAirPort Disk.\nThe AirPort Disk feature shares a hard disk connected to an AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule (though not AirPort Express), as a small-scale NAS. AirPort Disk can be accessed from Windows and Linux as well as Mac OS X using the SMB/CIFS protocol for FAT volumes, and both SMB/CIFS and AFP for HFS+ partitions. NTFS- or exFAT-formatted volumes are not supported.\nAlthough Windows does not natively support HFS+, an HFS+ volume on an AirPort Disk can be easily accessed from Windows. This is because the SMB/CIFS protocol used to access the disk, and hence access from Windows is filesystem-independent. Therefore, HFS+ is a viable option for Windows as well as OS X users, and more flexible than FAT32 as the latter has a 4\u00a0GiB file size limit.\nRecent firmware versions cause the internal disk and any external USB drives to sleep after periods of time as short as 2 minutes.\nA caveat of the use of AirPort Disk is that the AFP port 548 is reserved for the service, which then does not allow for simultaneous use of port forwarding to provide AFP services to external users. This is also true of a Time Capsule setup for use as a network-based Time Machine Backup location, its main purpose and default configuration. An AirPort administrator must choose between using AirPort Disk and providing remote access to AFP services.\nThe AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule will recognize multiple disks connected via a USB hub.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58180", "revid": "199747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58180", "title": "Freckle", "text": "Melanin spots on skin\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nFreckles are clusters of concentrated melaninized cells which are most easily visible on people with a fair complexion. Freckles do not have an increased number of the melanin-producing cells, or melanocytes, but instead have melanocytes that overproduce melanin granules (melanosomes) changing the coloration of the outer skin cells (keratinocytes). As such, freckles are different from lentigines and moles, which are caused by accumulation of melanocytes in a small area. Freckles can appear on all types of skin tones. Of the six Fitzpatrick skin types, they are most common on skin tones 1 and 2, which usually belong to North Europeans. However, it can also be found on people all over the world.\nBiology.\nThe formation of freckles is caused by exposure to sunlight. The exposure to UV-B radiation activates melanocytes to increase melanin production, which can cause freckles to become darker and more visible. This means that one who has never developed freckles may develop them suddenly following extended exposure to sunlight.\nFreckles are predominantly found on the face, although they may appear on any skin exposed to the sun, such as arms or shoulders. Heavily distributed concentrations of melanin may cause freckles to multiply and cover an entire area of skin, such as the face. Freckles are rare on infants, and more commonly found on children before puberty.\nUpon exposure to the sun, freckles will reappear if they have been altered with creams or lasers and not protected from the sun, but do fade with age in some cases.\nFreckles are not a skin disorder, but people with freckles generally have a lower concentration of photo-protective melanin, and are therefore more susceptible to the harmful effects of UV radiation. It is suggested that people whose skin tends to freckle should avoid overexposure to sun and use sunscreen.\nGenetics.\nThe presence of freckles is related to rare alleles of the MC1R gene, though it does not differentiate whether an individual will have freckles if they have one or even two copies of this gene. Also, individuals with no copies of the MC1R do sometimes display freckles. Even so, individuals with a high number of freckling sites have one or more of variants of the MC1R gene. Of the variants of the MC1R gene Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, and Asp294His are the most common in the freckled subjects. The MC1R gene is also associated with red hair more strongly than with freckles. Most red-haired individuals have two variants of the MC1R gene and almost all have one. The variants that cause red hair are the same that cause freckling. Freckling can also be found in areas, such as Japan, where red hair is not seen. These individuals have the variant Val92Met which is also found in Europeans, although it has minimal effects on their pigmentation. The R162Q allele has a disputed involvement in freckling.\nThe variants of the MC1R gene that are linked with freckles started to emerge in the human genotype when humans started to leave Africa. The variant Val92Met arose somewhere between 250,000 and 100,000 years ago, long enough for this gene to be carried by humans into central Asia. Arg160Trp is estimated to have arisen around 80,000 years ago while Arg151Cys and Asp294His have been estimated to arise around 30,000 years ago. The wide variation of the MC1R gene exists in people of European descent because of the lack of strong environmental pressures on the gene. The original allele of MC1R is coded for dark skin with a high melanin content in the cells. The high melanin content is protective in areas of high UV light exposure. The need was less as humans moved into higher latitudes where incoming sunlight has lower UV light content. The adaptation of lighter skin is needed so that individuals in higher latitudes can still absorb enough UV for the production of vitamin D. Freckled individuals tend to tan less and have very light skin, an adaptation to allow individuals that expressed these genes to synthesise sufficient vitamin D.\nTypes.\n\"Ephelides\" describes a freckle that is flat and light brown or red and fades with a reduction of sun exposure. Ephelides are more common in those with light complexions, although they are found on people with a variety of skin tones. The regular use of sunblock can inhibit their development.\nLiver spots (also known as sunspots and lentigines) look like large freckles, but they form after years of exposure to the sun. Liver spots are more common in older people.\nIn culture.\nWestern societies traditionally perceived freckles as imperfections. For example, Pliny the Elder described freckles as spiritual and religious stains. \nThis perception changed after the mid-20th century, when a tan, and the freckles associated with it, came to be desired as a status symbol indicating a life of leisure. Freckles became increasingly fashionable in the late 20th century as a result of the 1960s \"youthquake\" movement and through association with popular figures such as the model Twiggy and the musician Jane Birkin. In the early 2000s, freckled models were a trend in advertising and fashion.\nBy the 2020s, the popularity of freckle tattoos further increased due to their popularity on social media such as TikTok.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Moreover, his sons played an important role in fighting against the Irish Catholic rebellion in the 1640s and 1650s, assisting in the victory of the British and Protestant interests in Ireland.\nIn addition to being the first Earl of Cork, he was the patriarch of the Boyle family through his many prominent descendants, whose titles included Earl of Orrery (1660), Earl of Burlington (1664) and Earl of Shannon (1756).\nBackground.\nBoyle was born at Canterbury on 13 October 1566, the second son of Roger Boyle (d. 24 March 1576 at Preston, near Faversham in Kent), a descendant of an ancient landed Herefordshire family, and of Joan (15 October 1529\u00a0\u201320 March 1586), daughter of John Naylor, who were married in Canterbury on 16 October 1564. Both his parents are interred in an alabaster tomb at the upper end of the chancel of the parish church of Preston. His elder brother was John Boyle, Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross.\nYoung Boyle went to The King's School, Canterbury, at the same time as Christopher Marlowe. His university education began at Bennet (Corpus Christi) College, Cambridge, England, in 1583. After this he studied law at the Middle Temple in London and became a clerk to Sir Roger Manwood, Kt., who was then the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer.\nBefore completing his studies, Boyle decided \"to gain learning, knowledge, and experience abroad in the world\" and left London for a new start in Ireland. He arrived in Dublin on 23 June 1588 with just over \u00a327 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023),as well as a gold bracelet worth \u00a310 (\u00a3 in 2023), and a diamond ring (given to him by his mother at her death and which he wore all his life), besides some fine clothing, and his \"rapier and dagger\".\nIn 1590 he obtained the appointment of deputy Escheator to John Crofton, the Escheator-General. On 6 November 1595, he married Joan Apsley, the daughter and co-heiress of William Apsley of Limerick, one of the council to the first President of the province of Munster. This marriage brought Boyle an estate of \u00a3500 a year (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023), which he continued to receive until at least 1632.\nJoan died at Mallow, County Cork on 14 December 1599 during childbirth (the son was still-born). Both were buried in Buttevant church, County Cork.\nIt is said by his detractors that unlike many of his other close relatives whom he took great care to commemorate, he took no trouble to have Joan commemorated after her death, leading to the conviction among some that his (in every sense) monumental commemorative endeavours were entirely practical (in terms of securing his personal objectives) rather than sentimental (her connections being of no direct use to him after her death).\nPolitical career.\nBoyle by this time had been the object of the attacks of Sir Henry Wallop, Treasurer at War, Sir Robert Gardiner, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Sir Robert Dillon, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, and Sir Richard Bingham, Chief Commissioner of Connaught, a demonstration, said Boyle, of their envy of his success and increasing prosperity.\nBoyle was arrested on charges of fraud and collusion with the Spanish (essentially accusations of covert papist infiltration, a treasonable offence for an official in Queen Elizabeth I's Protestant civil service) in his office. He was thrown into prison (at least once by Sir William FitzWilliam in about 1592) several times during this episode. He was about to leave for England to justify himself to Queen Elizabeth I, when there was a rebellion in Munster in October 1598, and \"all my lands were wasted\" which once again returned him to poverty. The Nine Years' War arrived in Munster with Irish rebels from Ulster, who were joined by locals who had lost land to English settlers. Boyle was forced to flee to Cork for safety.\nThis turn of events left him obliged to return to London and his chambers at The Temple. At this point, he was almost immediately taken into the service of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex.\nHenry Wallop then renewed his prosecution of Boyle. Boyle was summoned to appear at the Court of Star Chamber. In the proceedings, Boyle's adversaries seem to have failed to substantiate their accusations. Boyle had somehow managed to secure the attendance of Queen Elizabeth I herself at the proceedings, and he successfully exposed some misconduct on the part of his adversaries.\nElizabeth famously said: \"By God's death, these are but inventions against the young man\" and she also said he was \"a man fit to be employed by ourselves\".\nHe was immediately appointed Clerk of the Council of Munster by Elizabeth I in 1600. In December 1601, Boyle brought to Elizabeth the news of the victory near Kinsale.\nIn October 1602, Boyle was again sent over by Sir George Carew, the president of Munster, on Irish affairs. He was knighted at St Mary's Abbey, near Dublin, by Carew on 25 July 1603. the same day that he married his second wife, Catherine, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton, Principal Secretary of State. In 1606 he was appointed as Privy Councillor for Munster and in 1612 as Privy Councillor for Ireland.\nAcquisition of property, rank, and titles.\nIn 1602, Richard Boyle bought Sir Walter Raleigh's estates of for \u00a31,500 (\u00a3 in 2023) in the counties of Cork (including Myrtle Grove), Waterford (including Lismore Castle) and Tipperary. He made these purchases on the insistence of Sir George Carew. Boyle made Lismore Castle his chief country abode after purchasing it and turned it into a magnificent residence with impressive gabled ranges on each side of the courtyard. He also built a crenellated outer wall and a gatehouse known as the Riding Gate for the castle. The principal apartments of the castle were decorated with fretwork plaster ceilings, tapestry hangings, embroidered silks, and velvet. Boyle also had a substantial residence at Youghal, besides Myrtle Grove, known today as \"The College\", close to the Collegiate Church of St Mary Youghal. Order on the Boyle estates was maintained in 13 castles which were garrisoned by retainers. The town of Clonakilty was formally founded in 1613 by him when he received a charter from King James I of England.\nBoyle was then returned as a burgh commissioner (Member of Parliament) for Lismore in the Irish Parliament of 1614, (held at Dublin Castle) on 18 May 1614. He ascended to the Irish Peerage as Lord Boyle, Baron of Youghal on 6 September 1616.\nLord Boyle claimed to have built the town of Bandon in County Cork, but in fact, the town was planned and built by Henry Beecher, John Archdeacon, and William Newce. The land on which Bandon was built had been granted by Queen Elizabeth I to Phane Beecher in 1586, and inherited by his eldest son Henry who then sold it to Boyle in November 1618. In Bandon, Boyle founded iron-smelting and linen-weaving industries and brought in English settlers, many from Bristol.\nLord Boyle was created Earl of Cork and Viscount Dungarvan on 26 October 1620. He then occupied the office of Sheriff from 1625 to 1626. On 26 October 1629, he was appointed as a Lord Justice, and on 9 November 1631, he became the Lord Treasurer of Ireland. Although he was not a Peer in the English Parliament, it is nonetheless recorded that he was \"by writ called into the Upper House by His Majesty's great grace\", and he subsequently took up the honoured position of an \"assistant sitting on the inside of the Woolsack.\"\nOliver Cromwell is reported to have said of Lord Cork 'If there had been an Earl of Cork in every province, it would have been impossible for the Irish to have raised a rebellion.' One of Lord Cork's major political allies during the era was Piers Crosby.\nIt is a mistake to see Lord Cork's 'empire' as merely being exclusively confined to the development of the 'Raleigh estates': for instance, his acquisition of the entirety of the town of Bandon was not completed until 1625. Other towns which also form part of Lord Cork's municipal development legacy (which records employment of over 4,000 people during his lifetime) include Midleton, Castlemartyr, Charleville and Doneraile.\nBy 1636, Lord Cork had opted to live in the West Country to see out the rest of his days. He purchased from The 3rd Earl of Castlehaven, for \u00a35,000, the manor of Stalbridge in Dorset which became his English seat, and in 1637, he laid out a further \u00a320,000 for Temple Coombe Manor, close by in Somerset. Lord Cork, at the insistence of the Howards, also bought Annery House near Bideford in 1640 for \u00a35000. The Earl was most delighted with Annery House and the living that came with the estate; he was also delighted that he could easily travel to Youghal from Bideford. Annery House was left to his sixth son Francis Boyle upon his death in 1643. Lord Cork had also been left the manor of Salcombe in Devon by his friend Thomas Stafford, the illegitimate son of George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes. Salcombe, along with Halberton Manor, was also left to his son Francis and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew.\nBoyle's adversaries.\nThe Great Earl's most famous enemy was Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford. Strafford arrived in Ireland in 1633 as Lord Deputy, and at first successfully deprived Boyle of much of his privilege and income. Boyle patiently husbanded forces in opposition to Strafford's Irish program and this successful political manoeuvering by Boyle was an important factor in Strafford's demise. It may be said in defence of Boyle that he would have been quite prepared to work amicably with Strafford, had Strafford not quickly made it clear that he saw Boyle as an \"over-mighty subject\", whose power must be curbed, if not crushed entirely. Boyle initially made friendly overtures, and tried to establish a family link by marrying his eldest son Richard to Elizabeth Clifford, a niece of Strafford's first wife, but soon abandoned any hope of an amicable relationship.\nAn illuminating example of the humiliations to which Wentworth subjected Boyle, was the instance where he forced Boyle to remove his wife's tomb from the choir in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. He was also prosecuted in the Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber, for alleged misappropriation of the funds of Youghal College.\nArchbishop William Laud delighted in Wentworth's attacks on Boyle and wrote: \"No physic better than a vomit if it be given in time, and therefore you have taken a very judicious course to administer one so early to my Lord of Cork. I hope it will do him good\".\nLaud and Wentworth shared, with King Charles I, the same fate as many others, who at some time in their lives, found reasons to conspire against Boyle: an early demise. With Boyle showing his customary astuteness by putting on a convincing show of politically appropriate response at every crucial juncture. His one serious miscalculation was his failure to anticipate the Irish Rebellion of 1641.\nBoyle made an entry concerning Wentworth in his diary: \"A most cursed man to all Ireland and to me in particular\".\nAt Wentworth's trial, Boyle was a key witness, but he did not take any other direct part in the prosecution itself. Unsurprisingly, he was in full support of the condemnation of Wentworth and wholeheartedly approved of his execution: he made a grim entry in his diary: \"Lord Strafford was beheaded on the Tower Hill, as he well deserved\".\nFrom his children, Boyle expected obedience, although he was a genuinely affectionate father, and far more forgiving of opposition from them than from his political enemies. Lady Mary, \"my unruly daughter\" angered her father by refusing to marry Lord Clanbrassil on the rather modern ground that she found him repulsive, and again by marrying the future Earl of Warwick, who was then a penniless younger son, against her father's wishes; but they were soon reconciled and he furnished her with a generous dowry.\nBoyle died at Youghal in September 1643, having been chased off his lands in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. His sons, however, recovered the family estates after the suppression of the rebellion. Boyle's tomb is in Youghal's St Mary's Collegiate Church.\nBoyle's \"philosophical\" legacy.\nLord Cork has been described as the \"first colonial millionaire\".\nHistorian Roy Foster, in his \"Modern Ireland\", calls him an 'epitome of Elizabethan adventurer-colonist in Ireland'.\nThe Boyle motto is: 'God's Providence is my inheritance'.\nLord Cork's theopolitical philosophy has been described as 'providentialist' when contrasted with its counterpart which prevailed to the north in parts of Ulster at the time, which is more typically characterised as Presbyterian.\nSuch a comparison of these two standpoints is neither exclusively religious nor secular, a factor which perhaps offers some small insight as to how Lord Cork managed to achieve what seems now the extraordinary feat of gaining strong favour at various times with the leaders on either side of the English Civil War.\nIssue.\nBy his second wife, Catherine Fenton, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton and his wife Alice Weston, the 1st Earl of Cork had fifteen children:\nBoyle erected an elaborate monument to himself, his wives, his mother, and his children in The Collegiate Church of St Mary Youghal, County Cork and there is a similar but much larger Boyle monument in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. His elder brother John is also buried in the tomb.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It borders on the North Brabant province of the Netherlands to the north and the Belgian provinces of Limburg, Flemish Brabant and East Flanders. Its capital is Antwerp, which includes the Port of Antwerp, the second-largest seaport in Europe. It has an area of , and with over 1.92 million inhabitants as of January 2024, is the country's most populous province. The province consists of three arrondissements: Antwerp, Mechelen and Turnhout. The eastern part of the province comprises the main part of the Campine region.\nHistory.\nDuring the early Middle Ages the region was part of the Frankish Empire, which was divided into several \"pagi\". The territory of the present-day province belonged to several \"pagi\" of which the region around what would become the city of Antwerp belonged to the Pagus Renesium. The Pagus Toxandria stretched from North Brabant into the Campine region. To the south there was the Pagus Bracbatinsis and the Pagus Hasbaniensis. In 843 the Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne was divided among his sons and the river Scheldt became the border between West Francia and East Francia. In 974 Otto II established the Margraviate of Antwerp as a defence against the County of Flanders.\nIn 1106, Henry V granted the Margraviate to Godfrey I of Leuven. His descendants would from 1235 onwards become the Dukes of Brabant and the region itself was the northern part of the Duchy of Brabant. In 1430 the Duchy became part of the Duchy of Burgundy until 1477 when it fell to the House of Habsburg. In 1713, at the end of the Spanish Succession War the region became part of the Austrian Netherlands until 1794, with in 1790 the short lived United States of Belgium. On 1 October 1795 the former Austrian Netherlands were annexed by France under the French Directory.\nThe modern province was created as the \"Department of the two Netes\" during the First French Empire (when the Southern Netherlands were part of France). After the defeat of Napoleon, the territory became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands as the province of Central Brabant, distinguishing it from North Brabant and South Brabant. In 1830, after Belgium's independence the province was renamed Antwerp (after its major city and capital).\nPrefects from 1800 until 1814.\nPrefects of the Department of the two Netes during the First French Empire\nGovernors from 1815 until 1830.\nGovernors of the province of Antwerp during the United Kingdom of the Netherlands\nGovernors since 1830.\nGovernors of the Belgian province of Antwerp \nLanguage.\nAs in all Flemish provinces, the official and standard language of the Antwerp province is Dutch. As with Flemish Brabant, North Brabant and Brussels, the local dialect is a Brabantian variety.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the \"International Social Survey Programme 2008: Religion III\" by the Association of Religion Data Archives, 73.3% of Antwerp's population identify themselves as Catholics, 24.1% as non-religious, 2.6% identify themselves as of other religions.\nGovernment.\nThe province of Antwerp has a provincial council, elected every six years, and an executive deputation headed by a governor. The current governor is Cathy Berx, appointed in 2008 by the Flemish Government.\nThe last elections were held on 14 October 2018. The following parties were elected to the 36-member council:\nTransportation.\nThe province has a network of roads, railroads, canals and rivers which provide a modern infrastructure. Historically, the traffic infrastructure was an important element of connecting the Port of Antwerp with the Ruhr Area in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Both the Iron Rhine railroad and the E313 (\"King Baudouin highway\") and E34 highway connect Antwerp with the Ruhr Area.\nOf the International E-road network, the E313, E19, and E34 run through parts of the province. The Kennedy Tunnel and the Liefkenshoek Tunnel connect the highway network of the province with East Flanders and Ghent. In addition a new Oosterweelconnection is under consideration.\nThe railroads connect the major cities of the province, such as Antwerp, Mechelen, Herentals, Turnhout and Mol. The Iron Rhine connects Antwerp with M\u00f6nchengladbach in Germany. The new High Speed Train connects Antwerpen-Centraal railway station with Brussels (HSL 4) and Amsterdam (HSL-Zuid) at high speed. Antwerp International Airport, located in Deurne, is a regional airport.\nThe river Schelde, an important waterway, connects the Port of Antwerp with the North Sea. The Albert Canal connects the Scheldt in Antwerp with the Meuse and Li\u00e8ge. Other canals are the Canal Dessel \u2013 Kwaadmechelen, Schoten \u2013 Turnhout \u2013 Dessel, and Herentals \u2013 Bocholt which flows into the Nete canal.\nTourism.\nThe province contains several historical cities, such as Antwerp, Mechelen, Turnhout, Herentals and Lier. The Campine region is becoming a popular destination for tourists searching for a quiet and relaxed weekend. Old farms were transformed into bed and breakfast-hotels, the restaurant and caf\u00e9 business is very active and an ingenious network for bicycle tours has come to life in recent years. Here and there are still areas of large heathland - and forests, such as the Kalmthoutse Heide (E: Kalmthout heathland) in Kalmthout, the moors around Turnhout, the \"Liereman\" (Oud-Turnhout) and the \"Prinsenpark\" in Retie. In a number of villages one can still see the typical Campine \"langgevelboerderijen\" (E: \"long facade farms\").\nEducation and research.\nThe province is home to several educational institutions such as the University of Antwerp and Karel de Grote University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Several research institutions are located in the province, such as the SCK\u2022CEN, the European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO).\nInternational schools in Antwerp include Antwerp International School and Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais International d'Anvers.\nEconomy.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 88 billion \u20ac in 2018. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac41,900 or 139% of the EU27 average in the same year.\nThe Port of Antwerp is the economic heart of the province. Until the agricultural crisis of 1880, the eastern part of the province was a largely agricultural region. The industrial development of the eastern part of the province, part of the Campine region, started at the end of the 19th century when industry established itself in the region. The availability of cheap labor, new roads, canals, tramways and railroads such as the Iron Rhine, stimulated the settlement of new industry. A brickmaking industry was established alongside the canals, paper and printing business in Turnhout, as were non-ferrous metallurgy in Balen-Nete, dynamite factories in Arendonk and Balen, tobacco and cigar factories in Arendonk, and the first shoe factory in Herentals. During the 1920s, the industrial expansion of the region continued with the radium and copper factories in Olen, the glass factory in Mol-Gompel and the diamond industry in Grobbendonk and Nijlen.\nIn the 20th century the first nuclear installation in Belgium was established at the SCK\u2022CEN in Mol in 1962. The European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM), one of the EU Joint Research Centres, was founded in Geel in 1957 as a result of the Treaty of Rome. Innotek is a technology centre located in Geel and is part of the European Business and Innovation Centre Network (EBN). Industry in the Campine region of the province is mainly located alongside the E313, the E34 and the Albert Canal.\nUnemployment.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 5.9% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.\nChemical industry.\nAfter World War II the Port of Antwerp was expanded, and on its premises several chemical factories and oil refineries were established, including facilities of Bayer, BASF, and Monsanto. The chemical and petrochemical industry is widely represented in the port region and comprises the world's second-largest cluster petrochemical industry cluster, after that of Houston (United States). Amoco Chemical Belgium N.V., now part of BP, was founded in Geel in 1967.\nA pharmaceutical industry was founded in Beerse in the 1960s, with Janssen Pharmaceutica and more recently with Genzyme in Geel. Soudal (silicon) in Turnhout and Ravago (plastics) in Arendonk became leading companies in their markets.\nDiamond.\nThe diamond industry and trade is traditionally located in Antwerp. At the end of the 19th century Hendrik Cassiers founded a diamond-cutting company outside Antwerp, in Grobbendonk. Hendrik Cassiers and Frans Dela Montagne laid the foundations of the diamond industry in the Campine region. The industry would settle in Nijlen, Herenthout, Bevel, Kessel, Vorselaar and Berlaar.\nPaper.\nThe region around Turnhout became famous for its printing business, with companies such as Brepols, which roots date back to 1796 when Pieter Corbeels established his printing business in Turnhout. In 1833, Van Genechten N.V., Splichal N.V. in 1856, Mesmaekers Freres in 1859, Meses-Goris in 1872, L. Biermans in 1875, Poupaert in 1881, La Belgica N.V. in 1907, H. Proost &amp; Co in 1913, J. Van Mierlo-Proost in 1918, Lityca in 1932 and Veloutex in 1951. More recently in 1970, Cartamundi was established, a world leader in playing cards.\nMetallurgies.\nWhile Wallonia was famous for its steel industry, the Campine region became renowned for its non-ferrous metallurgies. The Campine region was scarcely populated in the 19th century, but with the establishment of canals, the Iron Rhine and cheap labor, several metallurgies were established in the region. In 1888-1889 the metallurgy La Vieille Montagne was founded in Balen-Nete, close to the Iron Rhine and the canal to Beverlo. The company had its roots in the exploitation of the zinc mines of Moresnet.\nThe Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale M\u00e9tallurgique de Hoboken in Olen, which was established along the Iron Rhine and the Albert Canal. The factory produced radium, cobalt and copper from the mines of the Union Mini\u00e8re in Katanga, Belgian Congo and Rhodesia. Along the canal Turnhout-Schoten, the M\u00e9tallurgique de la Campine was established in 1910 for the production of lead and antimony. La Metallo-Chimique was established in 1919; this specialized in the production of copper.\nGlass.\nIn 1872, the Sabli\u00e8res et Carri\u00e8res R\u00e9unies (SCR), now Sibelco, was founded to extract the silica sand layers in Mol for industrial applications (glass). In 1920 the glass bottle manufacturer Beles R\u00e9unios was set up in Mol-Donk.\nIn 1921, a group of Belgian banks, the Mutuelle Mobili\u00e8re &amp; Immobili\u00e8re, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique, the Banque de Bruxelles and the Financi\u00e8re de Transport, together with the American group Libbey-Owens, founded the Cie Internationale pour la fabrication m\u00e9canique de Verre in Mol Gompel. In 1931, due to the economic crisis, the company merged into Glaces et Verres (Glaver). In 1961, Glaver merged with Univerbel to form Glaverbel.\nDynamite.\nGiven that the Campine region was sparsely populated, several dynamite factories were established in the region. In 1875, the Societe Anonyme d'Arendonk was established which premises would later become part of Ravago. In 1881 La Forcite N.V. was established near Balen, which was later acquired in 1920 by the Poudreries R\u00e9unies de Belgique (PRB). In 1887 a factory was founded near Herentals, which was closed due to the vicinity to the city. The factories produced explosives for the mines and quarries. The factories in the province are now closed down.\nTextiles.\nHistorically, wool processing industry was based on the wool from the sheep which were kept on the Campine heath. The centre of the textile industry in the province could be found in Turnhout. Wool processing companies such as Wolspinnerij Van Iersel, Spinnerij en Weverij Van Hoof, and De Wollendekensfabriek Van Doren were located in Mol.\nTobacco.\nAt the end of the 19th century Arendonk became the centre of the tobacco industry. Additional factories were founded in Turnhout, Mol, Geel and Herentals. After World War II, the ALTO cigar factory was founded by Frans Van den Bergh who would also play an important role at Janssen Pharmaceutica.\nAdministrative subdivisions.\nThe province is divided into three administrative arrondissements (\"arrondissementen\" in Dutch) containing 67 municipalities (numbers refer to the location of the municipalities on the map shown in this section):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58193", "revid": "50178569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58193", "title": "Pierre Corneille", "text": "French tragedian (1606\u20131684)\nPierre Corneille (; ; 6 June 1606 \u2013 1 October 1684) was a French tragedian. He is generally considered one of the three great 17th-century French dramatists, along with Moli\u00e8re and Racine.\nAs a young man, he earned the valuable patronage of Cardinal Richelieu, who was trying to promote classical tragedy along formal lines, but later quarrelled with him, especially over his best-known play, \"Le Cid\", about the medieval Spanish warrior, which was denounced by the newly formed for breaching the unities. He continued to write well-received tragedies for nearly forty years.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nCorneille was born in Rouen, Normandy, France, to Marthe Le Pesant and Pierre Corneille, a distinguished lawyer. His younger brother, Thomas Corneille, also became a noted playwright. He was given a rigorous Jesuit education at the \"Coll\u00e8ge de Bourbon\" (Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Corneille since 1873), where acting on the stage was part of the training. At 18 he began to study law, but his practical legal endeavours were largely unsuccessful. Corneille's father secured two magisterial posts for him with the Rouen department of Forests and Rivers. During his time with the department, he wrote his first play. It is unknown exactly when he wrote it, but the play, the comedy \"M\u00e9lite\", surfaced when Corneille brought it to a group of traveling actors in 1629. The actors approved of the work and made it part of their repertoire. The play was a success in Paris, and Corneille began writing plays on a regular basis. He moved to Paris in the same year and soon became one of the leading playwrights of the French stage. His early comedies, starting with \"M\u00e9lite\", depart from the French farce tradition by reflecting the elevated language and manners of fashionable Parisian society. Corneille describes his variety of comedy as \"une peinture de la conversation des honn\u00eates gens\" (\"a painting of the conversation of the gentry\"). His first true tragedy is \"M\u00e9d\u00e9e\", produced in 1635\nThe year 1634 brought more attention to Corneille. He was selected to write verses for Cardinal Richelieu's visit to Rouen. The Cardinal took notice of Corneille and selected him to be among \"\" (\"The Five Poets\"; also translated as \"the society of the five authors\"). The others were Guillaume Colletet, Boisrobert, Jean Rotrou, and Claude de L'Estoile.\nThe five were selected to realize Richelieu's vision of a new kind of drama that emphasized virtue. Richelieu would present ideas, which the writers would express in dramatic form. However, the Cardinal's demands were too restrictive for Corneille, who attempted to innovate outside the boundaries defined by Richelieu. This led to contention between playwright and employer. After his initial contract ended, Corneille left \"\" and returned to Rouen.\n\"Querelle du Cid\".\nIn the years directly following this break with Richelieu, Corneille produced what is considered his finest play. \"Le Cid\" is based on the play \"Mocedades del Cid\" (1621) by Guillem de Castro. Both plays were based on the legend of Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar (nicknamed \"El Cid Campeador\"), a military figure in Medieval Spain.\nThe original 1637 edition of the play was subtitled a tragicomedy, acknowledging that it intentionally defies the classical tragedy/comedy distinction. Even though \"Le Cid\" was an enormous popular success, it was the subject of a heated argument over the norms of dramatic practice, known as the \"Querelle du Cid\" or \"The Quarrel of Le Cid\". Cardinal Richelieu's acknowledged the play's success, but determined that it was defective, in part because it did not respect the classical unities of time, place, and action (Unity of Time stipulated that all the action in a play must take place within a 24-hour time-frame; Unity of Place, that there must be only one setting for the action; and Unity of Action, that the plot must be centred on a single conflict or problem). The newly formed \"Acad\u00e9mie\" was a body that asserted state control over cultural activity. Although it usually dealt with efforts to standardize the French language, Richelieu himself ordered an analysis of \"Le Cid\".\nAccusations of immorality were leveled at the play in the form of a famous pamphlet campaign. These attacks were founded on the classical theory that the theatre was a site of moral instruction. The Acad\u00e9mie's recommendations concerning the play are articulated in Jean Chapelain's \"Sentiments de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise sur la tragi-com\u00e9die du Cid\" (1638). Even the prominent writer Georges de Scud\u00e9ry harshly criticized the play in his \"Observations sur le Cid\" (1637). The intensity of this \"war of pamphlets\" was heightened severely by Corneille's boastful poem Excuse \u00c0 Ariste, in which he rambled and boasted about his talents and claimed that no other author could be a rival. These poems and pamphlets were made public, one after the other, as once \"esteemed\" playwrights traded slanderous blows. At one point, Corneille took several shots at criticizing author Jean Mairet's family and lineage. Scud\u00e9ry, a close friend of Mairet at the time, did not stoop to Corneille's level of \"distastefulness\", but instead continued to pillory \"Le Cid\" and its violations. Scud\u00e9ry even stated of \"Le Cid\" that, \"almost all of the beauty which the play contains is plagiarized.\"\nThis \"war of pamphlets\" eventually influenced Richelieu to call upon the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to analyze the play. In their final conclusions, the academy ruled that even though Corneille had attempted to remain loyal to the unity of time, \"Le Cid\" broke too many of the unities to be a valued piece of work.\nThe controversy, coupled with the academy's ruling proved too much for Corneille, who decided to return to Rouen. When one of his plays was reviewed unfavorably, Corneille was known to withdraw from public life. He remained publicly silent for some time; privately, however, he was said to be \"troubled and obsessed by the issues, making numerous revisions to the play.\"\nResponse to the \"Querelle du Cid\".\nAfter a hiatus from the theater, Corneille returned in 1640. The \"Querelle du Cid\" caused Corneille to pay closer attention to classical dramatic rules. This was evident in his next plays, which were classical tragedies, \"Horace\" (1640, dedicated to Richelieu), \"Cinna\" (1643), and \"Polyeucte\" (1643). These three plays and \"Le Cid\" are collectively known as Corneille's \"Classical Tetralogy\". Corneille also responded to the criticisms of the Acad\u00e9mie by making multiple revisions to \"Le Cid\" to make it closer to the conventions of classical tragedy. The 1648, 1660, and 1682 editions were no longer subtitled \"tragicomedy\", but \"tragedy\".\nCorneille's popularity grew and by the mid-1640s, the first collection of his plays was published. Corneille married Marie de Lamp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 1641. They had seven children together. In the mid to late 1640s, Corneille produced mostly tragedies, \"La Mort de Pomp\u00e9e\" (\"The Death of Pompey\", performed 1644), \"Rodogune\" (performed 1645), \"Th\u00e9odore\" (performed 1646), and \"H\u00e9raclius\" (performed 1647). He also wrote one comedy in this period, \"Le Menteur\" (\"The Liar\", 1644).\nIn 1652, the play \"Pertharite\" met with poor critical reviews and a disheartened Corneille decided to quit the theatre. He began to focus on an influential verse translation of \"The Imitation of Christ\" by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, which he completed in 1656. After an absence of nearly eight years, Corneille was persuaded to return to the stage in 1659. He wrote the play \"Oedipe\", which was favored by Louis XIV. In the next year, Corneille published \"Trois discours sur le po\u00e8me dramatique\" (\"Three Discourses on Dramatic Poetry\"), which were, in part, defenses of his style. These writings can be seen as Corneille's response to the \"Querelle du Cid\". He simultaneously maintained the importance of classical dramatic rules and justified his own transgressions of those rules in \"Le Cid\". Corneille argued the Aristotelian dramatic guidelines were not meant to be subject to a strict literal reading. Instead, he suggested that they were open to interpretation. Although the relevance of classical rules was maintained, Corneille suggested that the rules should not be so tyrannical that they stifle innovation.\nLater plays.\nEven though Corneille was prolific after his return to the stage, writing one play a year for the 14 years after 1659, his later plays did not have the same success as those of his earlier career. Other writers were beginning to gain popularity. In 1670 Corneille and Jean Racine, one of his dramatic rivals, were challenged to write plays on the same incident. Each playwright was unaware that the challenge had also been issued to the other. When both plays were completed, it was generally acknowledged that Corneille's \"Tite et B\u00e9r\u00e9nice\" (1671) was inferior to Racine's play (\"B\u00e9r\u00e9nice\"). Moli\u00e8re was also prominent at the time and Corneille even composed the comedy \"Psych\u00e9\" (1671) in collaboration with him (and Philippe Quinault). Most of the plays that Corneille wrote after his return to the stage were tragedies. They included \"La Toison d'or\" (\"The Golden Fleece\", 1660), \"Sertorius\" (1662), \"Othon\" (1664), \"Ag\u00e9silas\" (1666), and \"Attila\" (1667).\nHe wrote his last piece \"Sur\u00e9na\" in 1674; it was a complete failure. After this, he retired from the stage for the final time and died at his home in Paris in 1684. His grave in the \u00c9glise Saint-Roch went without a monument until 1821.\nLegacy.\nThe dramatist, author and philosopher Voltaire created, with the support of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, a twelve-volume annotated set of Corneille's dramatic works, the \"Commentaires sur Corneille\". It was Voltaire's largest ever work of literary criticism. Voltaire's proposal to the Acad\u00e9mie described Corneille as doing for the French language what Homer had done for Greek: showing the world that it could be a medium for great art. Voltaire was driven to defend classic French literature in the face of increasingly popular foreign influences such as William Shakespeare. This is reflected in the first edition of the \"Commentaires\", published in 1764, which focused on Corneille's better works and had relatively muted criticisms. By the second edition, published ten years later, Voltaire had come to a more negative assessment of Corneille and a stronger view on the need for objective criticism. He added five hundred critical notes, covering more works and taking a more negative tone. Critics' opinions of Corneille were already highly polarised. Voltaire's intervention polarised the debate further and some critics saw his criticisms as pedantic and driven by envy. In the 19th century, the tide of opinion turned against Voltaire. Napoleon expressed a preference for Corneille over Voltaire, reviving the former's reputation as a dramatist while diminishing the latter's.\nIn Episode 31 of the 1989 video lecture series, \u201cThe Western Tradition\u201d, UCLA Professor Eugen Weber offers further commentary on Mssr. Corneille's work:\n\"But remember that Corneille\u2019s plays were directed to an aristocracy that couldn\u2019t be touched by sermons, by moralizing, by sentimentalism. So he touched them by showing the greatness of self-discipline and self-denial, of not doing what you \"want\", but what you \"should\" do. And note that Corneille didn\u2019t say, as a Christian would, that doing your duty makes you \"good\", he said that doing your duty makes you \"great\". When Corneille presented the struggle between passion and duty, it wasn\u2019t a new invention. What was new in Corneille was that he showed one legitimate passion opposed to another passion that was equally legitimate. It was important to elevate the debate from a contest between right and wrong to a contest between two rights. Because a gentleman who got into a fight could not admit that he was wrong, but if you started by stipulating that his motives were honorable, he would at least stop to consider your argument, which is what Corneille achieved by raising the debate to a higher plane. And the seventeenth-century people who loved his adventure stories felt vaguely that they were getting in them something they hadn\u2019t quite known before. And they were right. They hadn\u2019t known it before for the simple reason that it had gone out with the Greeks. Roman thought was too legalistic, Christian thought was too simplistic to tolerate the idea that there could be two rights, that there could be two sides to a conflict. This is a very sophisticated view, and it is only fit for very sophisticated minds. And the tiny minority of the seventeenth-century society that read Corneille, that saw Corneille\u2019s plays, was hardly very sophisticated, but it was beginning to try at least.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is among the most influential figures of anarchism and a major figure in the revolutionary socialist, social anarchist, and collectivist anarchist traditions. Bakunin's prestige as a revolutionary also made him one of the most famous ideologues in Europe, gaining substantial influence among radicals throughout Russia and Europe.\nBakunin grew up in Pryamukhino, a family estate in Tver Governorate. From 1840, he studied in Moscow, then in Berlin, hoping to enter academia. Later in Paris, he met Karl Marx and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who deeply influenced him. Bakunin's increasing radicalism ended hopes of a professorial career. He was expelled from France for opposing the Russian Empire's occupation of Poland. After participating in the 1848 Prague and 1849 Dresden uprisings, Bakunin was imprisoned, tried, sentenced to death, and extradited multiple times. Finally, exiled to Siberia in 1857, he escaped via Japan to the United States and then to London, where he worked with Alexander Herzen on the journal \"Kolokol\" (\"The Bell\"). In 1863, Bakunin left to join the insurrection in Poland, but he failed to reach it and instead spent time in Switzerland and Italy.\nIn 1868, Bakunin joined the International Workingmen's Association, leading the anarchist faction to rapidly grow in influence. The 1872 Hague Congress was dominated by a struggle between Bakunin and Marx, who was a key figure in the General Council of the International and argued for the use of the state to bring about socialism. In contrast, Bakunin and the anarchist faction argued for the replacement of the state by federations of self-governing workplaces and communes. Bakunin could not reach the Netherlands, and the anarchist faction lost the debate in his absence. Bakunin was expelled from the International for maintaining, in Marx's view, a secret organisation within the International, and founded the Anti-Authoritarian International in 1872. From 1870 until his death in 1876, Bakunin wrote his longer works such as \"Statism and Anarchy\" and \"God and the State\", but he continued to directly participate in European worker and peasant movements. In 1870, he was involved in an insurrection in Lyon, France. Bakunin sought to take part in an anarchist insurrection in Bologna, Italy, but his declining health forced him to return to Switzerland in disguise.\nBakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism and as an opponent of Marxism, especially of the dictatorship of the proletariat, arguing that Marxist states would be one-party dictatorships ruling over the proletariat, not ruled by the proletariat. His book \"God and the State\" has been widely translated and remains in print. Bakunin has had a significant influence on thinkers such as Peter Kropotkin, Errico Malatesta, Herbert Marcuse, E. P. Thompson, Neil Postman and A. S. Neill as well as syndicalist organizations such as the IWW, the anarchists in the Spanish Civil War and contemporary anarchists involved in the modern-day anti-globalization movement.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nOn 30 May\u00a0[O.S. 18 May]\u00a01814, Mikhail Aleksandrovich Bakunin was born into Russian nobility. His family's Priamukhino estate, in the Tver region northwest of Moscow, had over 500 serfs. His father, Alexander Mikhailovich Bakunin, was a Russian diplomat who had served in Italy. Upon returning to Priamukhino and marrying the much younger Varvara Aleksandrovna Muravyeva, the elder Bakunin raised his ten children in the Rousseauan pedagogic model. Mikhail Bakunin, their third child and oldest son, read the languages, literature, and philosophy of the period and described his youth as idyllic and sheltered from the realities of Russian life. As an early teenager, he began training for a military career at the St. Petersburg Artillery School, which he rejected. Becoming an officer in 1833, he availed himself of the freedom to participate in the city's social life, but was unfulfilled. Derelict in his studies, he was sent to Belarus and Lithuania as punishment in early 1834, where he read academic theory and philosophy. He deserted the school in 1835 and only escaped arrest through his familial influence. He was discharged at the end of the year and, despite his father's protests, left for Moscow to pursue a career as a mathematics teacher.\nBakunin lived a bohemian, intellectual life in Moscow, where German Romantic literature and idealist philosophy were influential in the 1830s. In the intellectual circle of Nikolai Stankevich, Bakunin read German philosophy, from Kant to Fichte to Hegel, and published Russian translations of their works. Bakunin produced the first Russian translation of Hegel and was the foremost Russian expert on Hegel by 1837. Bakunin befriended Russian intellectuals including the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky, the poet Nikolay Ogarev, the novelist Ivan Turgenev, and the writer Alexander Herzen as youth prior to their careers. Herzen funded Bakunin to study at the University of Berlin in 1840. Bakunin's plans to return to Moscow as a professor were soon abandoned.\nIn Berlin, Bakunin gravitated towards the Young Hegelians, an intellectual group with radical interpretations of Hegel's philosophy, and who drew Bakunin to political topics. He left Berlin in early 1842 for Dresden and met the Hegelian Arnold Ruge, who published Bakunin's first original publication. (\"The Reaction in Germany\") proposes a continuation of the French Revolution to the rest of Europe and Russia. Though steeped in Hegelian jargon and published under a pseudonym, it marked Bakunin's transition from philosophy to revolutionary rhetoric.\nRevolutionary activity and imprisonment.\nThroughout the 1840s, Bakunin grew into revolutionary agitation. When his cadre aroused interest from Russian secret agents, Bakunin left for Z\u00fcrich in early 1843. He met the proto-communist Wilhelm Weitling, whose arrest led Bern's Russian embassy to distrust Bakunin. Defying Russian orders to return, the Russian Senate stripped him of his rights as a nobleman and sentenced him in absentia to penal labor in Siberia. Without steady financial support, Bakunin became an itinerant, traveling Europe, meeting the people who had influenced him. He visited Brussels and Paris, where he joined international emigrants and socialists, befriended the anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and met the philosopher Karl Marx, with whom he would later tussle. Bakunin only became personally active in political agitation in 1847, as Polish emigrants in Paris invited him to commemorate the 1830 Polish uprising with a speech. His call for Poles to overthrow czarism in alliance with Russian democrats made Bakunin known throughout Europe and led the Russian ambassador to successfully request Bakunin's deportation.\nWhen the French King Louis Philippe I abdicated during the February 1848 Revolution, Bakunin returned to Paris and basked in the revolutionary milieu. With the French government's support, he headed to Prussian Poland to agitate for revolt against Russia, but never arrived. He attended the 1848 Prague Slavic Congress to defend Slavic rights against German and Hungarian nationalism, and participated in its impromptu insurrection against the Austrian Habsburgs. Uncaptured, he wrote \"Aufruf an die Slaven\" (\"Appeal to the Slavs\") at the end of the year, advocating for a Slavic federation and revolt against the Austrian, Prussian, Turkish, and Russian governments. It was widely read and translated.\nAfter participating in both the Prague uprising and the 1849 Dresden uprising, Bakunin was imprisoned, tried, sentenced to death, extradited multiple times, and ultimately placed in solitary confinement in the Peter and Paul Fortress of St. Petersberg, Russia, in 1851. Three years later, he transferred to Shlisselburg Fortress near St. Petersberg for another three years. Prison weathered but did not break Bakunin, who retained his revolutionary zeal through his release. He did, however, write an autobiographical, genuflecting \"Confession\" to the Russian emperor, which proved to be a controversial document upon its public discovery some 70 years later. The letter did not improve his prison conditions. In 1857, Bakunin was permitted to transfer to permanent exile in Siberia. He married Antonia Kwiatkowska there before escaping in 1861, first to Japan, then to San Francisco, sailing to Panama and then to New York and Boston, and arrived in London by the end of the year. Bakunin set foot in America just as the Civil War was breaking out. Speaking with supporters of both sides, Bakunin stated that his sympathies were with the North, although he claimed hypocrisy in their stated goal of slave liberation while also forcing the South to remain in the Union. Bakunin also viewed the Southern political system and agrarian character as freer in some respects for its white citizens than in the industrial North. Though a fierce critic and enemy of slavery, Bakunin held a deep admiration for the United States as a whole, referring to the country as \"the finest political organization that ever existed in history.\"\nBack in Europe.\nIn London, Bakunin reunited with Herzen and Ogarev. Bakunin collaborated with them on their Russian-language newspaper but his revolutionary fervor exceeded their moderate reform agenda. Bakunin's 1862 pamphlet \"The People's Cause: Romanov, Pugachev, or Pestel?\" criticized the Russian tsar for not using his position to facilitate a bloodless revolution and forgo another Pugachev's Rebellion. In early August 1862, he briefly travelled to Paris. In Paris at this time, famous photographer Nadar took four famous photographs of him on August 7, 1862. After being photographed, he also signed Nadar's \"Livre d'Or\" (autograph album), and wrote (leaf 161): \"Watch out that liberty doesn't come to you from the north.\" In 1863, Bakunin joined in an unsuccessful effort to supply armed men for the Polish January Uprising against Russia. Bakunin, reunited with his wife, moved to Italy the next year, where they stayed for three years.\nBakunin, in his early 50s, developed his core anarchist thoughts in Italy. He continued to refine these ideas in his remaining 12 years. Among this ideology was the first of many conspiratorial revolutionary societies, though none of these participated in revolutionary actions, chiefly the revolutionary toppling of the state, to be replaced by a free federation between voluntarily associated economic producers.\nHe moved to Switzerland in 1867, a more permissive environment for revolutionary literature. Bakunin's anarchist writings were fragmentary and prolific. With France's collapse in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, Bakunin traveled to Lyon and participated in the fruitless Lyon Commune in which the citizens briefly occupied the city hall. Bakunin retreated to Switzerland.\nIn Switzerland, the Russian revolutionary Sergey Nechayev sought out Bakunin for collaboration. Not knowing Nechayev's past betrayals, Bakunin warmed to Nechayev's revolutionary zeal and they together produced the 1869 \"Catechism of the Revolutionary\", a tract that endorsed an ascetic life for revolutionaries without societal or moral bonds. Bakunin's connection with Nechayev hurt the former's reputation. More recent scholarship, however, challenges the catechism's authorship, crediting Nechayev as the primary or sole author. Bakunin ultimately disavowed their connection.\nFirst International.\nWhile Bakunin encountered Karl Marx in Paris (1844) and London (1864), he came to know him through the First International (International Working Men's Association), which Marx and Friedrich Engels formed in the 1860s. Bakunin's relationship with Marx became strained in the early 1870s for both interpersonal and ideological differences. Bakunin respected Marx's erudition and passion for socialism but found his personality to be authoritarian and arrogant. In turn, Marx was skeptical of Russian reactionism and Bakunin's unruliness. As Bakunin developed his anarchist ideas in this period, he came to see federative social organization, led by the peasantry and poorest workers, as the primary post-revolution goal, whereas Marx believed in a dictatorship of the proletariat, led by organized workers in industrially advanced countries, in which the workers use state infrastructure until the state withers away. Bakunists abhorred the political organization for which Marx advocated.\nMarx had Bakunin and Bakunist anarchists ejected from the First International's 1872 Hague Congress. This breaking point split the Marxist socialist movement from the anarchist movement and led to the undoing of the International. Bakunin's ideas continued to spread nevertheless, to the labor movement in Spain and the watchmakers of the Swiss Jura Federation.\nBakunin wrote his last major work, \"Statism and Anarchy\" (1873), anonymously in Russian to stir underground revolution in Russia. It restates his anarchist position, establishes the German Empire as the foremost centralized state in opposition to European anarchism, likens Marx to German authoritarianism, and warns of Marx's dictatorship of the proletariat being led by autocrats for their own gain in the name of the proletariat. This premonition furthered the gulf between the Marxists and Bakunist anarchists.\nIn one final revolutionary act, Bakunin planned the unsuccessful 1874 Bologna insurrection with his Italian followers. Its failure was a major setback to the Italian anarchist movement. Bakunin retreated to Switzerland, where he retired, dying in Bern on 1 July 1876.\nThought.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The passion for destruction is also a creative passion.\"\nMuch of Bakunin's writings on anarchism reflect antipathy for the state and \"political organization itself as the source of oppression and exploitation\". His revolutionary solutions focus on undoing the state and hierarchical religious, social, and economic institutions, to be replaced by a system of freely federated communes organized \"from below upward\" with voluntary associations of economic producers, starting locally but ostensibly organizing internationally. These thoughts were first published in his unfinished 1871 \"The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution\", expanded by a second part published in his 1908 \"Oeuvres\", and again elaborated a fragment found and published posthumously as \"God and the State\" (1882). The latter was his most famous work, translated widely, and a touchstone of anarchist literature. It appeals to cast off both the state and religion to realize man's inborn freedom.\nBakunin's core political thought addressed emancipatory communities in which members freely develop their abilities and faculties without overpowering each other. Participation within the community was a personal concern of his, and his vision of a community's role in creating free and happy humans stemmed from his close sibling relationships. Bakunin unsuccessfully sought community in religion and philosophy through influences including Arnold Ruge (Left Hegelianism), Ludwig Feuerbach (philosophical humanism), Wilhelm Weitling (proto-communism), and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (early anarchism). Bakunin turned from metaphysics and theory to the practice of creating communities of free, independent people. His first attempts at this, with the Polish emigrants and Prague Slav Congress in the 1840s, focused on national liberation, but he turned to emancipatory community after the failed 1863 Polish naval expedition. For Bakunin, freedom required community (such that humanity could only be free if everyone was free) and equality (that all people have the same starting basis), including equality in rights and social functions for women.\nHe envisioned an international revolution by the awakened masses that would bring about new forms of social organization (by committees of delegates and independent municipalities) in a large-scale federation, undoing all state structure and social coercion. In this emancipated community, every adult would be entitled to freedom, to be governed by their own conscience and reason according to their own will, responsible foremost to themselves and then to their community. He did not believe a reformed bourgeois or revolutionary state could emancipate like such a community he described, so his vision of revolution meant not capturing power but ensuring that no new power took the place of the old.\nBakunin was not a systematic thinker and did not design grand systems or theoretical constructs. His writing was prolific and fragmented. He was prone to large digressions and rarely completed what he set out to address. As a result, much of his writing on anarchism does not cohere and was published only posthumously. Bakunin did develop his theoretical perspective through draft programs. Bakunin first called himself an anarchist in 1867.\nAuthority.\nBakunin saw the institutions of church and state as standing against the aims of the emancipatory community, namely that they impose wisdom and justice from above under the pretense that the masses could not fully self-govern. He wrote that \"to exploit and to govern mean the same thing\". Bakunin held the State as a regulated system of domination and exploitation by a privileged, ruling class. This applied to States, both historical and contemporaneous, including modern monarchies and republics that each used military and bureaucratic centralization. He regarded representative democracies as a paradoxical abstraction from social reality. Although a popular legislature is meant to represent the will of the people, he saw it rarely functions as such in practice. Elected politicians instead represented abstractions. Bakunin believed that powerful institutions to be inherently stronger than individual will and incapable of internal reform due to the overwhelming ambitions and temptations that corrupt those with power. To Bakunin, anarchists were rightly \"enemies of all power, knowing that power corrupts those invested with it just as much as those compelled to submit to it\".\nBakunin clashed with Marx over worker governance and revolutionary change. Bakunin argued that even the best revolutionary placed on the Russian throne would become worse than Czar Alexander. Bakunin wrote that socialist workers in power would become ex-workers who govern by their own pretensions, not representing the people. Bakunin did not believe in transitional dictatorship serving any purpose other than to perpetuate itself, saying that \"liberty without socialism is privilege and injustice, and socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality\". Bakunin disagreed with Marx that the state would wither away under worker ownership and that worker conquest and changes in production conditions would inherently kill the state. Bakunin promoted spontaneous worker actions over Marx's suggested organization of a working-class party.\nWhile Bakunin believed that science and specialists could be useful in enlightening communities, he did not believe in government by experts or letting any privileged minority rule over a majority or any presumed intelligence rule over presumed stupidity. Bakunin wrote of referring to the \"authority to the bootmaker\" on boots and to savants for their specialties, and listening to them freely in respect for their expertise, but not allowing the bootmaker or the savant to impose this authority and not letting them be beyond criticism or censure. Bakunin believed that authority should be in continual voluntary exchange rather than a constant subordination. He believed intelligence to have intrinsic benefits so as not to require additional privileges.\nRevolutionary societies.\nTowards the end of his life, beginning in 1864 in Italy with the International Brotherhood, Bakunin attempted to unite his international network under secret revolutionary societies, a concept at odds with his professed caution against the autocratic tendencies of the revolutionary elite. Composed of Bakunin's circle, these informal groups existed mainly on paper and thus did not participate in revolutionary action or bridge revolutionary theory to practice like Bakunin intended. The groups operated with significant autonomy, having diverged from Bakunin on multiple controversial issues. Despite being cast at the Hague Congress as under Bakunin's stern authority, they were organized by personal relationships rather than the vertical hierarchies and membership ranks found in Bakunin's notes. His written programs played a larger role in his politics than these draft secret societies.\nThe idea of the \"invisible dictatorship\" was central to Bakunin's politics. In combination with Bakunin's opposition to parliamentary politics, historian Peter Marshall wrote that such a secret party\u2014its existence unknown and its policies beholden to none\u2014had the potential for greater tyranny than a Blanquist or Marxist party and was hard to envision as presaging an open, democratic society.\nPersonal life.\nBakunin married Antonia Kwiatkowska, originally from Poland, during his exile in Siberia. Kwiatkowska was much younger than Bakunin (a difference of 26 years; she was 18) and had little interest in politics. Their differences and Bakunin's meagre attention to romance have left biographers speculating about possible psychosexual rationales for Bakunin's personal life and the extent of his dedication to revolutionary action. Though she remained married to Bakunin until his death in 1876, Kwiatkowska had three children with another man while Bakunin was still alive \u2013 an Italian disciple of his, who married her after Bakunin's death.\nLegacy.\nBakunin was the leading anarchist revolutionary of the 19th century, active from the 1840s through the 1870s. His foundational anarchist writings helped the movement stand in contrast to capitalism and Marxism and became more popular after his death, with some of his highest regarded works published posthumously and in new editions. His \"Statism and Anarchy\" influenced the growing Russian Narodnik movement of peasant socialism, and his anarchism influenced ideology in both the Russian Revolution and the Spanish Civil War. The 1960s New Left revived interest in his works and ideas of voluntary association and opposition to authoritarian socialism, with new editions and translations published.\nBakunin's legacy reflects the paradox and ambivalence by which he lived. As historian Paul Avrich put it, Bakunin was \"a nobleman who yearned for a peasant revolt, a libertarian with an urge to dominate others, an intellectual with a powerful anti-intellectual streak\", who professed support for unfettered liberty while demanding unconditional obedience from his followers. Many of his actions put him closer to later authoritarian movements, even if his words were anti-authoritarian.\nIn particular, the antisemitic passages in Bakunin's writing have been the subject of extended interest, such that Bakunin biographer Mark Leier has said the question is raised every time he speaks on Bakunin. Both Leier and scholar of antisemitism Eirik Eiglad have commented that antisemitism was not essential to Bakunin's thought, nor was his thought valued for his antisemitism. Sociologist Marcel Stoetzler argued the opposite, saying that the antisemitic trope of Jewish world domination was at the centre of Bakunin's political thought. Bakunin's anti-Jewish and anti-German resentment are most visible in the context of his attacks on Marx, but his antisemitism predated these passages. Scholar Marshall Shatz noted that there is a gap between Bakunin's egalitarian principles and his ethnic prejudices, even if this antisemitism and stereotyping was common among French radicals of the era and shared by Marx himself.\nNoam Chomsky called Bakunin's prediction in \"Statism and Anarchy\" that Marxist regimes would become dictatorships \"one of the few predictions in the social sciences that actually came true\".\nBakunin archives are held in several places: the Pushkin House, the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the Russian State Library, the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art, the National Library of Russia, and the International Institute of Social History.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58202", "revid": "40923859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58202", "title": "Balaam", "text": "Prophet in the Book of Numbers\nBalaam (; ; ), son of Beor, was, according to the Bible, a non-Israelite prophet and diviner who lived in Pethor, a place identified with the ancient city of Pitru, thought to have been located between the region of Iraq and northern Syria in what is now southeastern Turkey. According to chapters 22\u201324 of the Book of Numbers, he was hired by King Balak of Moab to curse Israel, but instead he blessed the Israelites, as dictated by God. Subsequently, the plan to entice the Israelites into idol worship and sexual immorality is attributed to him.\nBalaam is also mentioned in the Book of Micah, the Book of 2nd Peter and in the Book of Jude.\nIn rabbinic literature, Balaam is portrayed as a non-Israelite prophet with powers comparable to Moses but is often depicted negatively for his attempts to curse Israel, his role in leading them to sin, and his eventual execution. The Talmud emphasizes his importance by stating that Moses authored not only the Torah but also the section relating to Balaam (Bava Batra 14b).\nIn Josephus, Philo, and Christian sources, Balaam is recognized for his exceptional divinatory abilities but is criticized for his moral failings, including greed and corruption. The New Testament portrays Balaam as a symbol of greed, particularly in Revelation 2:14, which accuses him of instructing Balak to lead the Israelites into sin by encouraging idolatry and sexual immorality. Islamic tradition does not mention Balaam by name in the Quran but identifies him with the figure in Surah Al-A\u2019raf 7:175\u2013176, who received divine knowledge but succumbed to worldly desires, leading to his downfall and depiction as a panting dog.\nThe Deir Alla inscription, dating to around 840\u2013760 BC, describes visions of Balaam, son of Beor, and portrays him as receiving messages from multiple deities rather than Yahweh, making it potentially the earliest extra-biblical reference to a biblical figure and the oldest known West Semitic alphabetic text.\nHebrew Tanakh.\nThe main story of Balaam occurs during the sojourn of the Israelites in the plains of Moab, east of the Jordan River, at the close of forty years of wandering, shortly before the death of Moses and the crossing of the Jordan. The Israelites have already defeated two kings in Transjordan: Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan. Balak, king of Moab, consequently becomes alarmed and sends elders of Midian and his Moabite messengers, to Balaam, son of Beor, to induce him to come and curse Israel. Balaam's location, Pethor, which is now located in the region of northern Syria and southeastern Turkey is simply given as \"which is by the river of the land of the children of his people\" in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint. The Samaritan Pentateuch, Vulgate, and Peshitta all identify his land as Ammon.\nBalaam sends back word that he can only do what YHWH commands, and God has, via a nocturnal dream, told him not to go. Balak consequently sends higher-ranking priests and offers Balaam honours; Balaam continues to press God, and God finally permits him to go but with instructions to say only what He commands. Balaam then sets out in the morning with the princes of Moab. God becomes angry that he went and sends the Angel of the Lord (Numbers 22:22) to prevent him. At first, the angel is seen only by the donkey Balaam is riding, which tries to avoid the angel. After Balaam starts punishing the donkey for refusing to move, it is miraculously given the power to speak to Balaam (Numbers 22:28) and says, \"What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?\" At this point, Balaam is allowed to see the angel, who informs him that the donkey's turning away from the messenger is the only reason the angel did not kill Balaam. Balaam immediately repents, but is told to go on.\nBalak meets with Balaam at Kirjat Huzoth, and they go to Bamoth-Baal (the \"high places of Baal\"), and offer sacrifices on seven altars, leading to Balaam being given a prophecy by Yahweh, which He speaks to Balak. However, the prophecy blesses Israel; Balak remonstrates, but Balaam reminds him that he can only speak the words put in his mouth, so Balak takes him to another \"high place\" at Pisgah, to try again. Building another seven altars here, and making sacrifices on each, Balaam provides another prophecy blessing Israel.\nBalaam finally gets taken by a now very frustrated Balak to Peor, and, after the seven sacrifices there, decides not to \"seek enchantments\" but instead looks upon the Israelites from the peak. The Spirit of God comes upon Balaam and he delivers a third positive prophecy concerning Israel. Balak's anger rises to the point where he threatens Balaam, but Balaam merely offers a prediction of fate. Balaam then looks upon the Kenites, and Amalekites and offers two more predictions of their fates. Balak and Balaam then go to their respective homes.\nLater, Numbers 25:1\u20139 describes how Israel engaged in the Heresy of Peor. Numbers 31:16 blames this on Balaam's advice and because of his culpability in the incident, which resulted in deadly divine judgements against the Israelites who participated, he was eventually killed in a retaliatory battle against Midian in Numbers 31:8.\nDeuteronomy 23:3\u20136 summarises these incidents, and further states that the Ammonites were associated with the Moabites. Joshua, in his farewell speech, also makes reference to it. With God's protection taken from him, Balaam is later listed among the Midianites who were killed in revenge for the \"matter of Peor\". Joshua 13:22 records that Balaam died \"by the sword\" during a battle for the Reubenite occupation of Midianite land.\nIn total, Balaam's prophecies consist of seven (Hebrew) poems:\nThe poems fall into three groups. The first group consists of two poems which characteristically start immediately. The third group of three poems also start immediately, but are much shorter. The second group, however, consists of two poems which both start:\nBalaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open\u00a0...\nBiblical criticism.\nOf Balaam's three groups of poems, the documentary hypothesis argued that the first and third groups originated within the Elohist text, whereas the second group belonged to the Jahwist. Thus the Elohist describes Balaam giving two blessings, making sacrifices on seven altars, at the high places of Baal, before each, then deciding not to \"seek enchantments\" after the third set of sacrifices, but to \"set his face upon the wilderness,\" which Balak views as a third blessing, and so Balaam then gives the three final predictions of fate. Conversely, in the Jahwist source, Balaam arrives, the spirit of God comes upon him, and he delivers a blessing and a prophecy in succession.\n\"Agag\", mentioned in the third poem, is described as a great king, which does not correspond to the king of the Amalekites who was named Agag, and described in 1 Samuel 15, since that description considers Amalek to be small and obscure. While the Masoretic Text of the poem uses the word \"Agag\", the Septuagint, other Greek versions, and the Samaritan Pentateuch all have \"Gog\". These names are consequently considered textual corruptions, and \"Og\" has been suggested as the original.\nThe final three poems do not refer to Israel or Moab and are thus considered unusual since they seem to have little relevance to the narrative. It is thought that they may have been added to bring the number of poems up to five if inserted into the Elohist source or up to seven if only inserted once JE was constructed. While the sixth poem refers to Assyria, it is uncertain whether it is a historical reference to ancient Nineveh or a prophecy, which some religious commentators consider refers to the Seleucid Empire, which also took the name \"Assyria\". The seventh is also ambiguous and may either be a reference to the Sea Peoples or, in the view of some religious commentators, to the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great.\nIn the view of some schools of textual criticism, the narrative, excepting the episode involving the donkey, is simply a framework invented to be able to insert much older poems.\nDeir Alla inscription.\nIn 1967, at Deir Alla, Jordan, archaeologists found an inscription with a story relating visions of the seer of the gods Bala'am, son of Be'or, the same name appearing as that of a prophet in the Bible. In both the inscription and the Bible, Balaam is a prophet whose utterances determine the fate of nations. However, other details of the stories are different. According to the inscription, Balaam wakes up weeping and tells his people that the gods appeared to him in the night telling him about a goddess threatening to destroy the land. She is to cover the sky and reduce the world to complete darkness. In contrast with the biblical account where Balaam receives prophecies from Yahweh, the inscription associates Balaam with multiple deities (Ashtar, a god named Shgr, and Shadday gods and goddesses). If this inscription refers to Balaam mentioned in the Book of Numbers, Balaam is the earliest biblical figure identified in extra-biblical source.\n\"The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies\" describes it as \"the oldest example of a book in a West Semitic language written with the alphabet, and the oldest piece of Aramaic literature.\" The inscription is datable to ca. 840\u2013760 BCE; it was painted in red and black inks, apparently to emphasize the text, on fragments of a plastered wall: 119 pieces of inked plaster were recovered. Meindert Dijkstra suggests that \"the reticence of OT scholarship to take account of the text may be attributable to its damaged state, the difficulty of reconstructing and reading it, and the many questions it raises of script, language, literary form and religious content.\"\nIn rabbinic literature.\nIn rabbinic literature Balaam is represented as one of seven non-Israelite prophets; the other six being Beor (Balaam's father), Job, and Job's four friends. In this literature, Balaam gradually acquired a position among the non-Jews, which was exalted as much as that of Moses among the Jews; at first being a mere interpreter of dreams, but later becoming a magician, until finally the spirit of prophecy descended upon him.\nAccording to a negative view of Balaam in the Talmud, Balaam possessed the gift of being able to ascertain the exact moment during which God is angry\u2014a gift bestowed upon no other creature. Balaam's intention was to curse the Israelites at this moment of wrath, and thus cause God himself to destroy them; but God purposely restrained His anger in order to baffle the wicked prophet and to save the nation from extermination. The Talmud also recounts a more positive view of Balaam, stating that when the Torah was given to Israel, a mighty voice shook the foundations of the earth, so much so that all kings trembled, and in their consternation turned to Balaam, inquiring whether this upheaval of nature portended a second deluge; the prophet assured them that what they heard was the voice of God, giving the sacred law to the Israelites.\nAccording to Jewish legend, Balaam was made this powerful in order to prevent the non-Jewish tribes from saying: \"If we had only had our own Moses, we would be as pious as the Jews.\" Balaam is included in the list of persons born circumcised along with Moses.\nIn rabbinical literature the epithet \"rasha\", translating as \"the wicked one\", is often attached to the name of Balaam. Balaam is pictured as blind in one eye and lame in one foot, and his disciples (followers) are distinguished by three morally corrupt qualities: an evil eye, a haughty bearing, and a greedy spirit.\nDue to his behavior with the Midianites, the Rabbis interpret Balaam as responsible for the behavior during the Heresy of Peor, which they consider to have been unchastity, and consequently the death of 24,000 victims of the plague which God sent as punishment. When Balaam saw that he could not curse the children of Israel, the Rabbis assert that he advised Balak, as a last resort, to tempt the Hebrew nation to immoral acts and, through these, to the worship of Baal-peor. \"The God of the Hebrews\", adds Balaam, \"hates lewdness; and severe chastisement must follow\".\nThe Rabbis, playing on the name Balaam, call him \"Belo 'Am\" (without people; that is, without a share with the people in the world to come), or \"Billa' 'Am\" (one that ruined a people); and this hostility against his memory finds its climax in the dictum that whenever one discovers a feature of wickedness or disgrace in his life, one should preach about it. In the process of killing Balaam (Numbers 31:8), all four legal methods of execution\u2014stoning, burning, decapitating, and strangling\u2014were employed. He met his death at the age of 33, and it is stated that he had no portion in the world to come. The book devotes a special section to the history of the prophet discussing why God has taken away the power of prophecy from the Gentiles. The Talmud states that \"Moses wrote his book and the portion of Balaam\", regarding this passage as separate from the rest of the Torah in terms of topic or style, but united in authorship.\nSome have suggested that in Sanhedrin 106b and Gi\u1e6dtin 57a Balaam may be likened to Jesus. Balaam's father Beor was a son of Laban. The Book of Jasher reports that Balaam's sons were Jannes and Jambres.\nBalaam's exclamation, \"How good are your tents, O Jacob, your tabernacles, O Israel!\", was taken by later generations of Jews as the basis of the liturgical prayer Ma Tovu.\nIn Josephus, Philo, and Christian sources.\nBalaam is mentioned in several places in the New Testament, where he is cited as a type of avarice; for example in the Book of Revelation 2:14 describes false teachers at Pergamum who held the \"teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication\". Balaam has attracted much interest, alike from Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Josephus paraphrases the story more so, and speaks of Balaam as the best prophet of his time, but with a disposition ill-adapted to resist temptation. Philo describes him as a great magician in the \"Life of Moses\"; elsewhere he speaks of \"the sophist Balaam, being,\" i.e. symbolizing \"a vain crowd of contrary and warring opinions\" and again as \"a vain people\", both phrases being based on a mistaken etymology of the name Balaam.\nA man also named Balaam also figures as an example of a false prophet motivated by greed or avarice in both 2 Peter 2:15 and in Jude 1:11. This Balaam is listed as the son of Bezer, which is usually identified as Beor. Some authors claim that Bezer was the Aramaic pronunciation of Beor, while others hold that the author was attempting to play off the Hebrew word \"basar\" or \"flesh\" to insult Balaam. Later Jewish tradition similarly played with Balaam's name to call him corrupt and imply bestiality. Still other authors hold that Bezer and Beor are distinct, while still identifying the Balaams of the Old and New Testaments, claiming that Beor is Balaam's father and Bezer is Balaam's home town.\nThe story is also referred to in chapter 10 of 2 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\nIn his commentary on Matthew's Gospel, Dale Allison associates the magi who visited the infant Jesus (Matthew 2) with Balaam, in that both Balaam and the magi were \"from the east\": thus \"Matthew's magi are Balaam's successors\".\nIn the Quran.\nNo clear reference is made to Balaam in the Qur'an. However, the commentators argue that he is the one to whom the following text is referring:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And relate to them \u02f9O Prophet\u02fa the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he abandoned them, so Satan took hold of him, and he became a deviant.&lt;br&gt;\nIf We had willed, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he clung to this life\u2014following his evil desires. His example is that of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it \u02f9still\u02fa pants. This is the example of the people who deny Our signs. So narrate \u02f9to them\u02fa stories \u02f9of the past\u02fa, so perhaps they will reflect.\u2014\u200a\nThe Muslim commentators explain that Bal'am bin Ba'ura () was a Canaanite who had been given knowledge of some of the books of God. His people asked him to curse Moses (Musa) and those who were with him, but he said, \"How can I curse one who has angels with him?\" They continued to press him, however, until he cursed the Israelites, and, as a consequence, they remained 40 years in the Wilderness of the Wanderings. Then, when he had cursed Moses, his tongue came out and fell upon his breast, and he began to pant like a dog.\nThe story as told by Tabari is somewhat more Biblical. Balaam had the knowledge of the Most Sacred Name of God, and whatever he asked of God was granted to him. The story of Balaam and the ass, then follows at length. When it came to the actual cursing, God \"turned his tongue\" so that the cursing fell upon his own people and the blessing upon Israel. Then his tongue came out and hung down on his breast. Finally, he advised his people to adorn and beautify their women and to send them out to ensnare the Israelites. The story of the plague at Baal-peor and of Cozbi and Zimri follows.\nAccording to another story which al-Tabari gives, Balaam was a renegade Israelite who knew the Most Sacred Name, and to gain the things of this world, went over to the Canaanites. Al-Tha'labi adds that Balaam was descended from Lot. He gives, too, the story of Balaam's dream, his being forbidden by God to curse Israel. Another version is that Balak, the king of Bal'a, compelled Balaam to use the Most Sacred Name against Israel. The curse fell automatically, and Moses, having learned whence it came, entreated God to take from Balaam his knowledge of the Name and his faith. This being done, they went out from him in the form of a white dove.\nThe Baghdadi historian Al Masudi said in his book Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems that Balaam ben Beor was in a village in the lands of Shem (Canaan), and he is the son of Baura(Beor) ben Sanur ben Waseem ben Moab ben Lot ben Haran (PUT), and his prayers were answered, so his folks asked him to pray against Joshua ben Nun but he could not do it, so he advised some of the kings of the giants to show the pretty women and release them toward the camp of Joshua ben Nun, and so they did, and they (the Israelites) hurried up to the women and the plague spread among them and seventy thousand of them were dead.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAttribution"}

Resisting the empiricism of his day, he denounced most Western philosophy since Descartes as trending into atheism and has been considered a revival of the Scholastic school. He was an important theorist of androgyny. \nHe was one of the most influential theologians of his age but his influence on subsequent philosophy has been less marked, and tends to be submerged into the esoteric discussions of later thinkers rather than cited explicitly in major publications. Today Baader is thought to have re-introduced theological engagement with Meister Eckhart into academia and even Christianity and Theosophy more generally.\nLife.\nBenedikt Franz Xaver Baader was born in Munich, Bavaria, on 27 March 1765. He was the third son of Joseph Franz von Paula Baader (15 September 1733\u00a0\u2013 16 February 1794) and Maria Dorothea Rosalia von Sch\u00f6pf (25 October 1742\u00a0\u2013 5 February 1829), who were married on 23 May 1761. In 1775, Franz's father Joseph became the court physician of Maximilian III Joseph, the elector of Bavaria. (The elector died two years later.)\nFranz' two older brothers were both distinguished men. Clemens Alois Andreas Baader (8 April 1762\u00a0\u2013 23 March 1838) was an author. Joseph Anton Ignaz Baader (30 September 1763\u00a0\u2013 20 November 1835) was an engineer.\nFranz studied medicine at Ingolstadt and Vienna, and for a short time assisted his father in his medical practice. However, Franz soon discovered that life as a physician did not suit him, and he decided to become a mining engineer instead. He studied under Abraham Gottlob Werner at Freiberg, travelled through several of the mining districts in north Germany, and resided in England from 1792 to 1796.\nIn England, Franz von Baader became acquainted with the empiricism of David Hume, David Hartley, and William Godwin, which was extremely distasteful to him. But he also came into contact with the mystical speculations of Meister Eckhart, Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, and above all those of Jakob B\u00f6hme, which were more to his liking. In 1796, he returned to Germany and, in Hamburg, became acquainted with F. H. Jacobi, with whom he became close friends. He also came into contact with Friedrich Schelling, and the works he published during this period were manifestly influenced by that philosopher, though Baader maintained his independence from Schelling.\nTheir friendship continued till about the year 1822, when Baader's denunciation of modern philosophy in his letter to Tsar Alexander I entirely alienated Schelling.\nDuring this time, Baader continued to apply himself to his profession.\nHe gained a prize of 12,000 gulden (\u2248117\u00a0kg silver) for his new method of employing sodium sulfate instead of potash in the making of glass. From 1817 to 1820, he held the post of superintendent of mines and was raised to the rank of nobility for his services. He retired in 1820, and thereafter published one of the best of his works, \"Fermenta Cognitionis\" in 6 parts from 1822 to 1825. In it, he combats modern philosophy and recommends the study of B\u00f6hme.\nIn 1826, when the new university was opened in Munich, he was appointed professor of philosophy and speculative theology. He published some of his lectures there in 4 parts from 1827 to 1836 under the title \"\".\nHis 1831 \"Forty Sentences from a Religious Erotic\" was dedicated to Emilie Linder, a Munich painter.\nIn 1838, he publicly opposed the interference of the Roman Catholic Church in civil matters and, in consequence, was interdicted from lecturing on the philosophy of religion during the last three years of his life. He died on 23 May 1841. He is buried in the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof in Munich.\nPhilosophy.\nBaader frequently wrote in obscure aphorisms or mystical symbols and analogies. His doctrines are mostly expounded in short detached essays, in comments on the writings of B\u00f6hme and St-Martin, or in his extensive correspondence and journals. Baader starts from the position that human reason by itself can never reach the end at which it aims and maintains that we cannot throw aside the presuppositions of faith, church, and tradition. His point of view may be compared to Scholasticism, since like the Scholastics he believed that theology and philosophy are not opposed but that reason has to make clear the truths given by authority and revelation. In his attempts to draw the realms of faith and knowledge still closer, however, he approaches the mysticism of Meister Eckhart, Paracelsus, and B\u00f6hme. Our existence depends upon God's cognition of us. All self-consciousness is at the same time God-consciousness, and all knowledge is knowing with, consciousness of, or participation in God.\nTheology.\nBaader's philosophy is thus essentially a form of theosophy. God is not to be conceived as mere abstract Being () but as the primary Will at the basis of all things and an everlasting process or activity ('). This process functions as a self-generation of God, in which we may distinguish two aspects\u2014the immanent or esoteric and the eminent or exoteric. Only insofar as the \"primitive will\" thinks or is conscious of itself can it distinguish knower and known, producer and produced, from which proceeds the power to become spirit. God has His reality only insofar as He is absolute spirit. The Trinity (called ' in Baader) is not a given but is rendered possible, is mirrored in, and takes place through the eternal and impersonal idea or wisdom of God, which exists beside through not distinct from the \"primitive will\". Personality and concrete reality is given to separate aspects of this Trinity through nature, which is eternally and necessarily produced by God. These aspects of existence do not occur successively within time but occur \"\" as necessary elements of the self-evolution of divine Being. Its \"nature\" is not to be confused with the nature of Creation, which is an unnecessary, free, and non-temporal act of God's love and will which cannot be speculatively deduced but must be accepted as a historic fact.\nCreated beings were originally of three orders: the intelligent or angels; the non-intelligent material world; and man, who mediated between them. Angels and man were endowed with freedom. The Fall of Adam and Lucifer were historic facts which were possible, though not necessary. Baader considered the angels to have fallen through a desire to ascend to equality with God (i.e., pride) and man through permitting himself to sink to the level of nature (via the various bodily sins). Baader considered that the world as we know it\u2014with time, space, and matter\u2014only began after the fall of mankind and was created as a gift from God permitting humanity the opportunity for redemption. Baader developed theories of physiology and anthropology over a number of works based upon this understanding of the universe, but in the main coincides with the ideas of B\u00f6hme. Principally, he traces the adverse effects of various sins and advocates the restoration of natural harmonies by its removal.\nHis system of ethics rejects the idea that obedience to moral laws alone (as in Kantianism) is enough. Instead, though humanity has lost the ability to accomplish this on its own, it is necessary to realize and participate in our place in the divine order. As grace is required for such a realization, no ethical theory neglecting sin and redemption is satisfactory or even possible. Mere works are never sufficient, but Christ's healing virtue must be received, chiefly through prayer and the sacraments of the church.\nBaader was regarded as among the greatest speculative theologians of 19th-century Catholicism and influenced, among others, Richard Rothe, Julius M\u00fcller, and Hans Lassen Martensen.\nPolitics.\nBaader argued that two things were requisite in the state: common submission to the ruler (without which there would be civil war or invasion) and inequality of rank (without which there would be no organization). As Baader considered God alone to be the true ruler of mankind, he argued that loyalty to a government can be secured or given only when it was truly Christian; he opposed despotism, socialism, liberalism equally. His ideal state was a civil community ruled by the Catholic Church, whose principles opposed both passive and irrational pietism and the excessively rational doctrines of Protestantism.\nRegarding the sexes.\nOne of Baader's central ideas is his concept of androgyny:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Androgyne is the harmonious fusion of the sexes, resulting in a certain asexuality, a synthesis which creates an entirely new being, and which does not merely juxtapose the two sexes 'in an enflamed opposition' as the hermaphrodite does. \nFollowing the literal wording of the first of Genesis's two accounts of the creation of man, Baader says that Man was originally an androgynous being. Neither man nor woman is the \"image and likeness of God\" but only the androgyne. Both sexes are equally fallen from the original divinity of the androgyne. Androgynism is man's likeness to God, his supernatural upsurge. Hence it follows that sexes must cease and vanish. From these positions Baader interpreted the sacrament of marriage as a symbolic restitution of angelic bisexuality: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The secret and the sacrament of true love in the indissoluble bond of the two lovers, consists in each helping the other, each in himself, towards the restoration of the androgyne, the pure and whole humanity.\nUltimately Christ's sacrifice will make possible a restoration of the primal androgyny. Baader believed that primordial androgyny would return as the world neared its end.\nWorks.\nSeveral years after his death, Baader's works were collected and edited by a number of his disciples. This was published in 16 volumes at Leipzig between 1851 and 1860, organized by topic. Vol.\u00a0I dealt with epistemology, Vol.\u00a0II with metaphysics, Vol.\u00a0III with natural philosophy, Vol.\u00a0IV with anthropology, Vols.\u00a0V &amp; VI with social philosophy, Vols.\u00a0VII through X with philosophy of religion, Vol.\u00a0XI with Baader's diaries, Vol.\u00a0XII with his commentaries on St-Martin, Vol.\u00a0XIII with his commentaries on B\u00f6hme, Vol.\u00a0XIV with time, and Vol.\u00a0XV with his biography and correspondence. Vol.\u00a0XVI contained an index to the others, as well as an able sketch of his system by Lutterbeck. Valuable introductions by the editors are prefixed to the several volumes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58204", "revid": "13912083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58204", "title": "Baal", "text": "Semitic title often used in reference to deities\nBaal (), or Ba\u02bfal (), was a title and honorific meaning 'owner' or 'lord' in the Northwest Semitic languages spoken in the Levant during antiquity. From its use among people, it came to be applied to gods. Scholars previously associated the theonym with solar cults and with a variety of unrelated patron deities, but inscriptions have shown that the name Baal was particularly associated with the storm and fertility god Hadad and his local manifestations. The Ugaritic god Baal (\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf93\ud800\udf8d) is the protagonist of one of the lengthiest surviving epics from the ancient Near East, the Baal Cycle.\nKnown by epithets like \u201crider of the clouds\u201d and \u201cVictorious Baal,\u201d he was associated with rain, lightning, wind, fertility, and kingship, and was often depicted in opposition to sea and death deities like Yammu and Mot. Worship of Baal spread throughout the Levant, Egypt, and the Mediterranean via Phoenician colonization, with regional forms such as Baal Hammon in Carthage. The god was also known as \"the mighty one\", and \"the one without equal\" (\"there is none above him\"). \nThe Hebrew Bible includes use of the term in reference to various Levantine deities, often with application towards Hadad, who was decried as a false god. In the Hebrew Bible, Baal appears frequently as a foreign or rival deity, with prophets like Elijah opposing his cult, while in early Israelite contexts, the title may have sometimes referred to Yahweh. Depiction as a false god was taken over into Christianity and Islam, sometimes under the form Beelzebub in demonology.\nClassical sources rendered him as Belus. The Quran also references Baal worship, portraying him as a false god opposed by the prophet Elijah.\nName.\nEpithets.\nBa\u02bbal's widely used epithet is \"rider (or mounter) of the clouds.\" (\"rkb \u02bfrpt\", cf. \"rkb b\u02bfrbt\" in Ps. 68:5; Ugaritic \"rkb \u02bfrpt\".) These are related to Zeus's \"gatherer of the clouds\" and Yahweh's \"rider of the heavens.\" Like the English word ride, \"rkb\" has equine and sexual uses.\nEtymology.\nThe spelling of the English term \"Baal\" derives from the Greek \"B\u00e1al\" () which appears in the New Testament and Septuagint, and from its Latinized form \"\", which appears in the Vulgate. These forms in turn derive from the vowel-less Northwest Semitic form B\u02bfL (Phoenician and ). The word's biblical senses as a Phoenician deity and false gods generally were extended during the Protestant Reformation to denote any idols, icons of the saints, or the Catholic Church generally. In such contexts, it follows the anglicized pronunciation and usually omits any mark between its two As. In close transliteration of the Semitic name, the ayin is represented, as \"Ba\u02bfal\".\nIn the Northwest Semitic languages\u2014Ugaritic, Phoenician, Hebrew, Amorite, and Aramaic\u2014the word \"ba\u02bfal\" signified 'owner' and, by extension, 'lord', a 'master', or 'husband'. \nCognates include the Akkadian \"B\u0113lu\" (), Amharic \"bal\" (), and Arabic \"ba\u02bfl\" (). \"B\u00e1\u02bfal\" () and \"ba\u02bfl\" still serve as the words for 'husband' in modern Hebrew and Arabic respectively. They also appear in some contexts concerning the ownership of things or possession of traits.\nThe feminine form is \"ba\u02bfalah\" (; ), meaning 'mistress' in the sense of a female owner or lady of the house and still serving as a rare word for 'wife'.\nSuggestions in early modern scholarship also included comparison with the Celtic god Belenus, however this is now widely rejected by contemporary scholars.\nSemitic religion.\nGeneric.\nLike En in Sumerian, the Akkadian \"b\u0113lu\" and Northwest Semitic \"ba\u02bfal\" (as well as its feminine form \"ba\u02bfalah\") was used as a title of various deities in the Mesopotamian and Semitic pantheons. Only a definitive article, genitive or epithet, or context could establish which particular god was meant.\nHadad.\nBa\u02bfal was also used as a proper name by the third millennium\u00a0BC, when he appears in a list of deities at Abu Salabikh. Most modern scholarship asserts that this Ba\u02bfal\u2014usually distinguished as \"The Lord\" (, \"Ha-Ba\u02bfal\")\u2014was identical with the storm and fertility god Hadad; it also appears in the form \"Ba\u02bfal Haddu\". Scholars propose that, as the cult of Hadad increased in importance, his true name came to be seen as too holy for any but the high priest to speak aloud and the alias \"Lord\" (\"Ba\u02bfal\") was used instead, as \"Bel\" was used for Marduk among the Babylonians and \"Adonai\" for Yahweh among the Israelites. A minority propose that Ba\u02bfal was a native Canaanite deity whose cult was identified with or absorbed aspects of Adad's. Regardless of their original relationship, by the 1st millennium\u00a0BCE, the two were distinct: Hadad was worshiped by the Aramaeans and Ba\u02bfal by the Phoenicians and other Canaanites.\nBa\u02bfal.\nBa\u02bfal is well-attested in surviving inscriptions and was popular in theophoric names throughout the Levant but he is usually mentioned along with other gods, \"his own field of action being seldom defined\". Nonetheless, Ugaritic records show him as a weather god, with particular power over lightning, wind, rain, and fertility. The dry summers of the area were explained as Ba\u02bfal's time in the underworld, and his return in autumn was said to have caused the storms that revived the land. Thus, the worship of Ba\u02bfal in Canaan\u2014where he eventually supplanted El as the leader of the gods and patron of kingship\u2014was connected to the region's dependence on rainfall for its agriculture, unlike Egypt and Mesopotamia, which focused on irrigation from their major rivers. Anxiety about water availability for crops and trees increased the importance of his cult, which focused attention on his role as a rain god. He was also called upon during battle, showing that he was thought to intervene actively in the world of man, unlike the more aloof El. The Lebanese city of Baalbeck was named after Baal. Alternatively, Ba' al is a divine co-regent with El, where El was the executive while Ba' al was the sustainer of the cosmos.\nThe Ba\u02bfal of Ugarit was the epithet of Hadad, but as time passed, the epithet became the god's name while Hadad became the epithet. Ba\u02bfal was usually said to be the son of Dagan, but appears as one of the sons of El in Ugaritic sources. Both Ba\u02bfal and El were associated with the bull in Ugaritic texts, as they symbolized both strength and fertility. He held special enmity against snakes, both on their own and as representatives of Yammu (\u00a0\"Sea\"), the Canaanite sea god and river god. He fought the Tannin (\"Tunnanu\"), the \"Twisted Serpent\" (\"B\u1e6fn \u02bfqltn\"), \"Lotan the Fugitive Serpent\" (\"Ltn B\u1e6fn Br\u1e25\", the biblical Leviathan), and the \"Mighty One with Seven Heads\" (\"\u0160ly\u1e6d D.\u0161b\u02bft Ra\u0161m\"). Ba\u02bfal's conflict with Yammu is now generally regarded as the prototype of the vision recorded in the 7th chapter of the biblical Book of Daniel. As vanquisher of the sea, the Canaanites and Phoenicians regarded Ba\u02bfal as the patron of sailors and sea-going merchants. As vanquisher of Mot, the Canaanite death god, he was known as Ba\u02bfal R\u0101pi\u02beuma (\"B\u02bfl Rpu\") and regarded as the leader of the Rephaim (\"Rpum\"), the ancestral spirits, particularly those of ruling dynasties.\nFrom Canaan, worship of Ba\u02bfal spread to Egypt by the Middle Kingdom and throughout the Mediterranean following the waves of Phoenician colonization in the early 1st millennium\u00a0BCE. He was described with diverse epithets, and before Ugarit was rediscovered, these were supposed to refer to distinct local gods. However, as explained by Day, the texts at Ugarit revealed that they were considered \"local manifestations of this particular deity, analogous to the local manifestations of the Virgin Mary in the Roman Catholic Church\". In those inscriptions, he is frequently described as \"Victorious Ba\u02bfal\" (\"Aliyn\" or \"\u1ea2l\u1ec9yn Ba\u02bfal\"), \"Mightiest one\" (\"Aliy\" or \"\u02beAly\") or \"Mightiest of the Heroes\" (\"Aliy Qrdm\"), \"The Powerful One\" (\"Dmrn\"), and in his role as patron of the city \"Ba\u02bfal of Ugarit\" (\"Ba\u02bfal Ugarit\"). As Ba\u02bfal Zaphon (\"Ba\u02bfal \u1e62apunu\"), he was particularly associated with his palace atop Jebel Aqra (the ancient Mount \u1e62ap\u0101nu and classical Mons Casius). He is also mentioned as \"Winged Ba\u02bfal\" (\"B\u02bfl Knp\") and \"Ba\u02bfal of the Arrows\" (\"B\u02bfl \u1e24\u1e93\"). Phoenician and Aramaic inscriptions describe \"Ba\u02bfal of the Mace\" (\"B\u02bfl Krntry\u0161\"), \"Ba\u02bfal of the Lebanon\" (\"B\u02bfl Lbnn\"), \"Ba\u02bfal of Sidon\" (\"B\u02bfl \u1e62dn\"), \"B\u02bfl \u1e62md\", \"Ba\u02bfal of the Heavens\" (\"Ba\u02bfal Shamem\" or \"Shamayin\"), Ba\u02bfal \u02beAddir (\"B\u02bfl \u02bedr\"), Ba\u02bfal Hammon (\"Ba\u02bfal \u1e24amon\"), \"B\u02bfl Mgnm\".\nBa\u02bfal Hammon.\nBa\u02bfal Hammon was worshipped in the Tyrian colony of Carthage as their supreme god. It is believed that this position developed in the 5th century\u00a0BCE following the severing of its ties to Tyre following the 480\u00a0BCE Battle of Himera. Like Hadad, Ba\u02bfal Hammon was a fertility god. Inscriptions about Punic deities tend to be rather uninformative, though, and he has been variously identified as a moon god and as Dagan, the grain god. Rather than the bull, Ba\u02bfal Hammon was associated with the ram and depicted with his horns. The archaeological record seems to bear out accusations in Roman sources that the Carthaginians burned their children as human sacrifices to him. He was worshipped as Ba\u02bfal Karnaim (\"Lord of the Two Horns\"), particularly at an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein (\"Two-Horn Hill\") across the bay from Carthage. His consort was the goddess Tanit.\nThe epithet Hammon is obscure. Most often, it is connected with the NW Semitic \"\u1e25amm\u0101n\" (\"brazier\") and associated with a role as a sun god. Renan and Gibson linked it to Hammon (modern Umm el-\u2018Amed between Tyre in Lebanon and Acre in Israel) and Cross and Lipi\u0144ski to Haman or Kham\u014dn, the classical Mount Amanus and modern Nur Mountains, which separate northern Syria from southeastern Cilicia.\nJudaism.\nBa\u02bfal (\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc) appears about 90 times in the Hebrew Bible in reference to various gods. The priests of the Canaanite Ba\u02bfal are mentioned numerous times, most prominently in the First Book of Kings. Many scholars believe that this describes Jezebel's attempt to introduce the worship of the Ba\u02bfal of Tyre, Melqart, to the Israelite capital Samaria in the 9th century\u00a0BCE. Against this, Day argues that Jezebel's Ba\u02bfal was more probably Ba\u02bfal Shamem, the Lord of the Heavens, a title most often applied to Hadad, who is also often titled just Ba\u02bbal.\n1 Kings 18 records an account of a contest between the prophet Elijah and Jezebel's priests. Both sides offered a sacrifice to their respective gods: Ba\u02bbal failed to light his followers' sacrifice while Yahweh's heavenly fire burnt Elijah's altar to ashes, even after it had been soaked with water. The observers then followed Elijah's instructions to slay the priests of Ba\u02bfal, after which it began to rain, showing Yahweh's mastery over the weather.\nOther references to the priests of Ba\u02bfal describe their burning of incense in prayer and their offering of sacrifice while adorned in special vestments.\nYahweh.\nThe title \"ba\u02bfal\" was a synonym in some contexts of the Hebrew \"adon\" (\"Lord\") and \"adonai\" (\"My Lords\") still used as aliases of the Lord of Israel Yahweh. According to some scholars, the early Hebrews did use the names Ba\u02bfal (\"Lord\") and Ba\u02bfali (\"My Lord\") in reference to the Lord of Israel, just as Ba\u02bfal farther north designated the Lord of Ugarit or Lebanon. This occurred both directly and as the divine element of some Hebrew theophoric names. However, according to others it is not certain that the name Baal was definitely applied to Yahweh in early Israelite history. The component Baal in proper names is mostly applied to worshippers of Baal, or descendants of the worshippers of Baal. Names including the element Ba\u02bfal presumably in reference to Yahweh include the judge Gideon (also known as Jeruba\u02bfal, lit.\u00a0\"The Lord Strives\"), Saul's son Eshba\u02bfal (\"The Lord is Great\"), and David's son Beeliada (\"The Lord Knows\"). The name Bealiah (\"The Lord is Jah\"; \"Yahweh is Ba\u02bfal\") combined the two. However John Day states that as far as the names Eshba\u02bbal, Meriba\u02bbal, and Beeliada (that is, Ba\u02bbaliada), are concerned it is not certain whether they simply allude to the Canaanite god Ba\u02bbal, or are intended to equate Yahweh with Ba\u02bbal, or have no connection to Ba\u02bbal.\nIt was the program of Jezebel, in the 9th century\u00a0BCE, to introduce into Israel's capital city of Samaria her Phoenician worship of Baal as opposed to the worship of Yahweh that made the name anathema to the Israelites.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At first the name Baal was used by the Jews for their God without discrimination, but as the struggle between the two religions developed, the name Baal was given up by the Israelites as a thing of shame, and even names like Jerubbaal were changed to Jerubbosheth: Hebrew \"bosheth\" means \"shame\". Eshba\u02bfal became Ish-bosheth and Meriba\u02bfal became Mephibosheth, but other possibilities also occurred. Gideon's name Jeruba\u02bfal was mentioned intact but glossed as a mockery of the Canaanite god, implying that he strove in vain. Direct use of Ba\u02bfali continued at least as late as the time of the prophet Hosea, who reproached the Israelites for doing so.\nBrad E. Kelle has suggested that references to cultic sexual practices in the worship of Baal, in Hosea 2, are evidence of an historical situation in which Israelites were either giving up Yahweh worship for Baal, or blending the two. Hosea's references to sexual acts being metaphors for Israelite \"apostasy\".\nBrian P. Irwin argues that \"Baal\" in northern Israelite traditions is a form of Yahweh that was rejected as foreign by the prophets. In southern Israelite traditions, \"Baal\" was a god that was worshipped in Jerusalem. His worshippers saw him as compatible or identical with Yahweh and honored him with human sacrifices and fragrant meal offerings. Eventually, the Chronicler(s) disapproved of both \"Baals\" whilst the Deuteronomists used \"Baals\" for any god they disapproved of.\nLikewise, Mark S. Smith believes Yahweh was more likely to be inspired by Baal rather than El, since both are stormy divine warriors and lack the pacifistic traits of El according to the Ugaritic texts and Hebrew Bible.\nBa\u02bfal Berith.\nBa\u02bfal Berith (\"Lord of the Covenant\") was a god worshipped by the Israelites when they \"went astray\" after the death of Gideon according to the Hebrew Scriptures. The same source relates that Gideon's son Abimelech went to his mother's kin at Shechem and received 70 shekels of silver \"from the House of Ba\u02bfal Berith\" to assist in killing his 70 brothers from Gideon's other wives. An earlier passage had made Shechem the scene of Joshua's covenant between all the tribes of Israel and \"El Yahweh, our god of Israel\" and a later one describes it as the location of the \"House of El Berith\". It is thus unclear whether the false worship of the \"Ba\u02bfalim\" being decried is the worship of a new idol or rites and teachings placing Yahweh as a mere local god within a larger pantheon. The Hebrew Scriptures record the worship of Ba\u02bfal threatening Israel from the time of the Judges until the monarchy. However, during the period of Judges such worship seems to have been an occasional deviation from a deeper and more constant worship of Yahweh:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Throughout all the stories of Judges the popular faith in YHWH runs as a powerful current. This faith raises the judges, and inspires poets, prophets, and Nazirites. ... Worship of Baals and Ashtoreths has been schematically interspersed between these chapters, but no trace of a vital, popular belief in any foreign gods can be detected in the stories themselves. Baal prophets appeared in Israel centuries later; but during the age of the judges when Israel is supposed to have been most deeply affected by the religion of Canaan, there are no Baal priests or prophets, nor any other intimation of a vital effect of polytheism in Israel\u2019s life.\nThe Deuteronomist and the present form of Jeremiah seem to phrase the struggle as monolatry or monotheism against polytheism. Yahweh is frequently identified in the Hebrew scriptures with El Elyon, however, this was after a conflation with El in a process of religious syncretism. \"\u2019El\" () became a generic term meaning \"god\", as opposed to the name of a worshipped deity, and epithets such as El Shaddai came to be applied to Yahweh alone, while Baal's nature as a storm and weather god became assimilated into Yahweh's own identification with the storm. In the next stage the Yahwistic religion separated itself from its Canaanite heritage, first by rejecting Baal-worship in the 9th century, then through the 8th to 6th centuries with prophetic condemnation of Baal, sun-worship, worship on the \"high places\", practices pertaining to the dead, and other matters.\nBeelzebub.\nBa\u02bfal Zebub (, \u00a0\"Fly-Lord\") occurs in the first chapter of the Second Book of Kings as the name of the Philistine god of Ekron. In it, Ahaziah, king of Israel, is said to have consulted the priests of Ba\u02bfal Zebub as to whether he would survive the injuries from his recent fall. The prophet Elijah, incensed at this impiety, then foretold that he would die quickly, raining heavenly fire on the soldiers sent to punish him for doing so. Jewish scholars have interpreted the title of \"Lord of the Flies\" as the Hebrew way of calling Ba\u02bfal a pile of dung and his followers vermin, although others argue for a link to power over causing and curing pestilence and thus suitable for Ahaziah's question. The Septuagint renders the name as \"Ba\u00e4lzebo\u00fab\" () and as \"Ba\u02bfal of Flies\" (, \"Ba\u00e4l muian\"). Symmachus the Ebionite rendered it as \"Be\u00eblzebo\u00fal\" (), possibly reflecting its original sense. This has been proposed to have been \"B\u2018l Zbl\", Ugaritic for \"Prince Baal\".\nClassical sources.\nOutside of Jewish and Christian contexts, the various forms of Ba\u02bfal were indifferently rendered in classical sources as Belus (, \"B\u0113\u0302los\"). An example is Josephus, who states that Jezebel \"built a temple to the god of the Tyrians, which they call Belus\"; this describes the Ba\u02bfal of Tyre, Melqart. Herrmann identifies the Demarus/Demarous figure mentioned by Philo Byblius as Ba\u02bfal.\nBa\u02bfal Hammon, however, was identified with the Greek Cronos and the Roman Saturn as the Zabul Saturn. He was probably never equated with Melqart, although this assertion appears in older scholarship.\nChristianity.\nBeelzebub or Beelzebul was identified by the writers of the New Testament as Satan, \"prince\" (i.e., king) of the demons.\nJohn Milton's 1667 epic \"Paradise Lost\" describes the fallen angels collecting around Satan, stating that, though their heavenly names had been \"blotted out and ras'd\", they would acquire new ones \"wandring o're the Earth\" as false gods. \"Baalim\" and \"Ashtaroth\" are given as the collective names of the male and female demons (respectively) who came from between the \"bordering flood of old Euphrates\" and \"the Brook that parts Egypt from Syrian ground\".\nIslam.\nThe Quran mentions that Prophet Elias (Elijah) warned his people against Ba\u02bfal worship.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; And Indeed, Elijah was among the messengers, (123) When he said to his people: \"Will you not fear Allah? (124) Do you call upon Ba'l and leave the best of creators - (125) Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers?\" (126) And they denied him, so indeed, they will be brought [for punishment], (127) Except the chosen servants of Allah. (128) And we left for him [favorable mention] among later generations: (129) Peace be upon Ily\u0101seen*. (130) Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. (131) Indeed, he was of Our believing servants. (132). Quran Surah 37, verses 123-132\nAccording to some medieval Islamic scholars, the context of the verse above tells of Ilyas and the inhabitants of the town of Baalbek who worshipped Baal.\nAccording to Tabari, \"baal\" is a term used by Arabs to denote everything which is a \"lord\" over anything.\nAl-Tha\u02bflab\u012b offers a more detailed description about Baal; accordingly it was an idol of gold, twenty cubits tall, and had four faces.\nThe trilateral root, (\"b\u0101, ayn, lam)\" \"ba\u02bfl\" occurs seven times in the Qur\u2019an with its common Semitic usage of \u201cowner, husband,\u201d particularly husband. For example, Sarah, wife of Abraham refers to her husband using the term.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58205", "revid": "50656657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58205", "title": "Vector processor", "text": "Computer processor which works on arrays of several numbers at once\nIn computing, a vector processor is a central processing unit (CPU) that implements an instruction set where its instructions are designed to operate efficiently and architecturally sequentially on large one-dimensional arrays of data called \"vectors\". This is in contrast to scalar processors, whose instructions operate on single data items only, and in contrast to some of those same scalar processors having additional single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) or SIMD within a register (SWAR) Arithmetic Units. Vector processors can greatly improve performance on certain workloads, notably numerical simulation, compression and similar tasks.\nVector processing techniques also operate in video-game console hardware and in graphics accelerators but these are invariably Single instruction, multiple threads (SIMT) and occasionally Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD).\nVector machines appeared in the early 1970s and dominated supercomputer design through the 1970s into the 1990s, notably the various Cray platforms. The rapid fall in the price-to-performance ratio of conventional microprocessor designs led to a decline in vector supercomputers during the 1990s.\nHistory.\nEarly research and development.\nArray processing development began in the early 1960s at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in their \"Solomon\" project. Solomon's goal was to dramatically increase math performance by using a large number of simple coprocessors under the control of a single master Central processing unit (CPU). The CPU fed a single common instruction to all of the arithmetic logic units (ALUs), one per cycle, but with a different data point for each one to work on. This allowed the Solomon machine to apply a single algorithm to a large data set, fed in the form of an array, leading it to be cited as an example Array processor in Flynn's taxonomy.\nIn 1962, Westinghouse cancelled the project, but the effort was restarted by the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign as the ILLIAC IV. Their version of the design originally called for a 1 GFLOPS machine with 256 ALUs, but, when it was finally delivered in 1972, it had only 64 ALUs and could reach only 100 to 150 MFLOPS. Nevertheless, it showed that the basic concept was sound, and, when used on data-intensive applications, such as computational fluid dynamics, the ILLIAC was the fastest machine in the world. The ILLIAC approach of using separate ALUs for each data element is not common to later designs, and is often referred to under a separate category of massively parallel computing: around 1972 Flynn categorized this type of processing as an early form of single instruction, multiple threads (SIMT).\nInternational Computers Limited sought to avoid many of the difficulties with the ILLIAC concept with its own Distributed Array Processor (DAP) design, categorising the ILLIAC and DAP as cellular array processors that potentially offered substantial performance benefits over conventional vector processor designs such as the CDC STAR-100 and Cray 1.\nComputer for operations with functions.\nA computer for operations with functions was presented and developed by Kartsev in 1967.\nSupercomputers.\nThe first vector supercomputers are the Control Data Corporation STAR-100 and Texas Instruments Advanced Scientific Computer (ASC), which were introduced in 1974 and 1972, respectively.\nThe basic ASC (i.e., \"one pipe\") ALU used a pipeline architecture that supported both scalar and vector computations, with peak performance reaching approximately 20 MFLOPS, readily achieved when processing long vectors. Expanded ALU configurations supported \"two pipes\" or \"four pipes\" with a corresponding 2X or 4X performance gain. Memory bandwidth was sufficient to support these expanded modes.\nThe STAR-100 was otherwise slower than CDC's own supercomputers like the CDC 7600, but at data-related tasks they could keep up while being much smaller and less expensive. However the machine also took considerable time decoding the vector instructions and getting ready to run the process, so it required very specific data sets to work on before it actually sped anything up.\nThe vector technique was first fully exploited in 1976 by the famous Cray-1. Instead of leaving the data in memory like the STAR-100 and ASC, the Cray design had eight vector registers, which held sixty-four 64-bit words each. The vector instructions were applied between registers, which is much faster than talking to main memory. Whereas the STAR-100 would apply a single operation across a long vector in memory and then move on to the next operation, the Cray design would load a smaller section of the vector into registers and then apply as many operations as it could to that data, thereby avoiding many of the much slower memory access operations.\nThe Cray design used pipeline parallelism to implement vector instructions rather than multiple ALUs. In addition, the design had completely separate pipelines for different instructions, for example, addition/subtraction was implemented in different hardware than multiplication. This allowed a batch of vector instructions to be pipelined into each of the ALU subunits, a technique they called \"vector chaining\". The Cray-1 normally had a performance of about 80 MFLOPS, but with up to three chains running it could peak at 240\u00a0MFLOPS and averaged around 150 \u2013 far faster than any machine of the era.\nOther examples followed. Control Data Corporation tried to re-enter the high-end market again with its ETA-10 machine, but it sold poorly and they took that as an opportunity to leave the supercomputing field entirely. In the early and mid-1980s Japanese companies Fujitsu, Hitachi and Nippon Electric Corporation (NEC) introduced register-based vector machines similar to the Cray-1, typically being slightly faster and much smaller: the Fujitsu VP series culminated in the VP2600 holding the world record fastest supercomputer in 1990-1991. Oregon-based Floating Point Systems (FPS) built add-on array processors for minicomputers, later building their own minisupercomputers.\nThroughout, Cray continued to be the performance leader, continually beating the competition with a series of machines that led to the Cray-2, Cray X-MP and Cray Y-MP. Since then, the supercomputer market has focused much more on massively parallel processing rather than better implementations of vector processors. However, recognising the benefits of vector processing, IBM developed Virtual Vector Architecture for use in supercomputers coupling several scalar processors to act as a vector processor. IBM also implemented Cray-style Vector processing in the IBM 3090 with an optional vector facility. \nAlthough vector supercomputers resembling the Cray-1 are less popular these days, NEC has continued to make this type of computer up to the present day with their SX series of computers. Most recently, the SX-Aurora TSUBASA places the processor and either 24 or 48 gigabytes of memory on an HBM 2 module within a card that physically resembles a graphics coprocessor, but instead of serving as a co-processor, it is the main computer with the PC-compatible computer into which it is plugged serving support functions.\nGPU.\nModern graphics processing units (GPUs) include an array of shader pipelines which may be driven by compute kernels, and being usually SIMT are frequently miscategorised as vector processors, the two being very similar categorisation of SIMD in Flynn's 1972 SIMD taxonomy. GPUs use a strategy for hiding memory latencies as they run into an extreme form of the Memory wall. As shown in Flynn's 1972 paper the key distinguishing factor of SIMT-based GPUs is that it has a single instruction decoder-broadcaster but that the cores receiving and executing that same instruction are otherwise reasonably normal: their own ALUs, their own register files, their own Load/Store units and their own independent L1 data caches. Thus although all cores simultaneously execute the exact same instruction in lock-step with each other they do so with completely different data from completely different memory locations. This is \"significantly\" more complex and involved than \"Packed SIMD\", which is strictly limited to execution of parallel pipelined arithmetic operations only. Although the exact internal details of today's commercial GPUs are proprietary secrets, the MIAOW team was able to piece together anecdotal information sufficient to implement a subset of the AMDGPU architecture.\nRecent development.\nSeveral modern CPU architectures are being designed as vector processors. The RISC-V vector extension follows similar principles as the early vector processors, and is being implemented in commercial products such as the Andes Technology AX45MPV. There are also several open source vector processor architectures being developed, including ForwardCom and Libre-SOC.\nComparison with modern architectures.\nAs of 2016[ [update]] most commodity CPUs implement architectures that feature fixed-length SIMD instructions. On first inspection these can be considered a form of vector processing because they operate on multiple (vectorized, explicit length) data sets, and borrow features from vector processors. However, by definition, the addition of SIMD cannot, by itself, qualify a processor as an actual \"vector processor\", because SIMD is fixed-length, and vectors are variable-length. The difference is illustrated below with examples, showing and comparing the three categories: Pure SIMD, Predicated SIMD, and Pure Vector Processing.\nOther CPU designs include some multiple instructions for vector processing on multiple (vectorized) data sets, typically known as MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) and realized with VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) and EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing). The Fujitsu FR-V low-power multimedia processor combines VLIW with predication and Packed SIMD.\nDifference between SIMD and vector processors.\nSIMD instruction sets lack crucial features when compared to vector instruction sets. The most important of these is that vector processors, inherently by definition and design, have always been designed to work on variable-length vectors, not restricted to power of two, since their inception.\nPure (fixed-width, no predication) SIMD is often mistakenly claimed to be \"vector\" (because SIMD processes data which happens to be vectors). Close analysis and comparison of historic and modern ISAs shows actual vector ISAs to have \na way to set the vector length at runtime, and to a non-power-of-two quantity. In other words, the number of elements is \"not\" hard-encoded in the instruction as it is in SIMD ISA. This is explained in the \"SIMD Considered harmful\" article.\nAn additional key feature is element-level predicated masking. In the Cyber 200 Model the element-level bitmask was itself a Vector stored in memory. Some Vector processors have Vector mask registers as exemplified by the Cray-1 which, like the Cyber 200, efficiently used one bit per element as a mask. However other Vector ISAs such as RISC-V elected to use a register from the main Vector register file, utilizing only the first bit of each element and ignoring other bits. \nPredicated SIMD (part of Flynn's taxonomy) is comprehensive individual element-level predicate masks on every element, as is now available in ARM SVE2 and AVX-512, but neither of these Instruction sets has an actual explicit \"set vector length\" instruction. Predicated SIMD uses fixed-width SIMD ALUs but allows locally controlled (predicated) activation of units to provide the appearance of variable length vectors. Examples below help explain these categorical distinctions.\nAnother key difference: SIMD, because it uses fixed-width batch processing, is unable by design to cope with iteration and reduction. This is illustrated further with examples, below.\nVector chaining.\nVector processors can be more resource-efficient by using slower hardware and saving power, but still achieving throughput and having less latency than SIMD, through vector chaining.\nConsider both a SIMD processor and a vector processor working on 4 64-bit elements, doing a LOAD, ADD, MULTIPLY and STORE sequence. If the SIMD width is 4, then the SIMD processor must LOAD four elements entirely before it can move on to the ADDs, must complete all the ADDs before it can move on to the MULTIPLYs, and likewise must complete all of the MULTIPLYs before it can start the STOREs. This is by definition and by design.\nHaving to perform 4-wide simultaneous 64-bit LOADs and 64-bit STOREs is very costly in hardware (256 bit data paths to memory). Having 4x 64-bit ALUs, especially MULTIPLY, likewise. To avoid these high costs, a SIMD processor would have to have 1-wide 64-bit LOAD, 1-wide 64-bit STORE, and only 2-wide 64-bit ALUs. As shown in the diagram, which assumes a multi-issue execution model, the consequences are that the operations now take longer to complete. If multi-issue is not possible, then the operations take even longer because the LD may not be issued (started) at the same time as the first ADDs, and so on. If there are only 4-wide 64-bit SIMD ALUs, the completion time is even worse: only when all four LOADs have completed may the SIMD operations start, and only when all ALU operations have completed may the STOREs begin.\nA vector processor, by contrast, even if it is \"single-issue\" and uses no SIMD ALUs, only having 1-wide 64-bit LOAD, 1-wide 64-bit STORE (and, as in the Cray-1, the ability to run MULTIPLY simultaneously with ADD), may complete the four operations faster than a SIMD processor with 1-wide LOAD, 1-wide STORE, and 2-wide SIMD. This more efficient resource utilization, due to vector chaining, is a key advantage and difference compared to SIMD. SIMD, by design and definition, cannot perform chaining except to the entire group of results.\nDescription.\nIn general terms, CPUs are able to manipulate one or two pieces of data at a time. For instance, most CPUs have an instruction that essentially says \"add A to B and put the result in C\". The data for A, B and C could be\u2014in theory at least\u2014encoded directly into the instruction. However, in efficient implementation things are rarely that simple. The data is rarely sent in raw form, and is instead \"pointed to\" by passing in an address to a memory location that holds the data. Decoding this address and getting the data out of the memory takes some time, during which the CPU traditionally would sit idle waiting for the requested data to show up. As CPU speeds have increased, this memory latency has historically become a large impediment to performance; see .\nIn order to reduce the amount of time consumed by these steps, most modern CPUs use a technique known as instruction pipelining in which the instructions pass through several sub-units in turn. The first sub-unit reads the address and decodes it, the next \"fetches\" the values at those addresses, and the next does the math itself. With pipelining the \"trick\" is to start decoding the next instruction even before the first has left the CPU, in the fashion of an assembly line, so the address decoder is constantly in use. Any particular instruction takes the same amount of time to complete, a time known as the \"latency\", but the CPU can process an entire batch of operations, in an overlapping fashion, much faster and more efficiently than if it did so one at a time.\nVector processors take this concept one step further. Instead of pipelining just the instructions, they also pipeline the data itself. The processor is fed instructions that say not just to add A to B, but to add all of the numbers \"from here to here\" to all of the numbers \"from there to there\". Instead of constantly having to decode instructions and then fetch the data needed to complete them, the processor reads a single instruction from memory, and it is simply implied in the definition of the instruction \"itself\" that the instruction will operate again on another item of data, at an address one increment larger than the last. This significantly maximises instruction effectiveness.\nTo illustrate what a difference this can make, consider the simple task of adding two groups of 10 numbers together. In a normal programming language one would write a \"loop\" that picked up each of the pairs of numbers in turn, and then added them. To the CPU, this would look something like this:\n move $10, count ; count := 10\nloop:\n load r1, a\n load r2, b\n add r3, r1, r2 ; r3 := r1 + r2\n store r3, c\n add a, a, $4 ; move on\n add b, b, $4\n add c, c, $4\n dec count ; decrement\n jnez count, loop ; loop back if count is not yet 0\n ret\nBut to a vector processor, this task looks considerably different:\n move $10, count ; count = 10\n vload v1, a, count\n vload v2, b, count\n vadd v3, v1, v2\n vstore v3, c, count\n ret\nNote the complete lack of looping in the instructions, because it is the \"hardware\" which has performed 10 sequential operations: effectively the loop count is on an explicit \"per-instruction\" basis.\nCray-style vector ISAs take this a step further and provide a global \"count\" register, called vector length (VL):\n setvli $10 # Set vector length VL=10\n vload v1, a # 10 loads from a\n vload v2, b # 10 loads from b\n vadd v3, v1, v2 # 10 adds\n vstore v3, c # 10 stores into c\n ret\nThere are several savings inherent in this approach.\nAdditionally, in more modern vector processor ISAs, \"Fail on First\" or \"Fault First\" has been introduced (see below) which brings even more advantages.\nBut more than that, a high performance vector processor may have multiple functional units adding those numbers in parallel. The checking of dependencies between those numbers is not required as a vector instruction specifies multiple independent operations. This simplifies the control logic required, and can further improve performance by avoiding stalls. The math operations thus completed far faster overall, the limiting factor being the time required to fetch the data from memory.\nNot all problems can be attacked with this sort of solution. Including these types of instructions necessarily adds complexity to the core CPU. That complexity typically makes \"other\" instructions run slower\u2014i.e., whenever it is not adding up many numbers in a row. The more complex instructions also add to the complexity of the decoders, which might slow down the decoding of the more common instructions such as normal adding. (\"This can be somewhat mitigated by keeping the entire ISA to RISC principles: RVV only adds around 190 vector instructions even with the advanced features.\")\nVector processors were traditionally designed to work best only when there are large amounts of data to be worked on. For this reason, these sorts of CPUs were found primarily in supercomputers, as the supercomputers themselves were, in general, found in places such as weather prediction centers and physics labs, where huge amounts of data are \"crunched\". However, as shown above the \"efficiency\" of vector ISAs brings other benefits which are compelling even for Embedded use-cases.\nVector instructions.\nThe vector pseudocode example above comes with a big assumption that the vector computer can process more than ten numbers in one batch. For a greater quantity of numbers in the vector register, it becomes unfeasible for the computer to have a register that large. As a result, the vector processor either gains the ability to perform loops itself, or exposes some sort of vector control (status) register to the programmer, usually known as a vector Length.\nThe self-repeating instructions are found in early vector computers like the STAR-100, where the above action would be described in a single instruction (somewhat like ). They are also found in the x86 architecture as the prefix. However, only very simple calculations can be done effectively in hardware this way without a very large cost increase. Since all operands have to be in memory for the STAR-100 architecture, the latency caused by access became huge too.\nBroadcom included space in all vector operations of the Videocore IV ISA for a field, but unlike the STAR-100 which uses memory for its repeats, the Videocore IV repeats are on all operations including arithmetic vector operations. The repeat length can be a small range of power of two or sourced from one of the scalar registers.\nThe Cray-1 introduced the idea of using processor registers to hold vector data in batches. The batch lengths (vector length, VL) could be dynamically set with a special instruction, the significance compared to Videocore IV (and, crucially as will be shown below, SIMD as well) being that the repeat length does not have to be part of the instruction encoding. This way, significantly more work can be done in each batch; the instruction encoding is much more elegant and compact as well. The only drawback is that in order to take full advantage of this extra batch processing capacity, the memory load and store speed correspondingly had to increase as well. This is sometimes claimed to be a disadvantage of Cray-style vector processors, and the Fujitsu VP series did make this mistake: in reality it is part of achieving high performance throughput, as seen in GPUs, which face exactly the same issue.\nModern SIMD computers claim to improve on early Cray by directly using multiple ALUs, for a higher degree of parallelism compared to only using the normal scalar pipeline. Modern vector processors (such as the SX-Aurora TSUBASA) combine both, by issuing multiple data to multiple internal pipelined SIMD ALUs, the number issued being dynamically chosen by the vector program at runtime. Masks can be used to selectively load and store data in memory locations, and use those same masks to selectively disable processing element of SIMD ALUs. Some processors with SIMD (AVX-512, ARM SVE2) are capable of this kind of selective, per-element (\"predicated\") processing, and it is these which somewhat deserve the nomenclature \"vector processor\" or at least deserve the claim of being capable of \"vector processing\". SIMD processors without per-element predication\n(MMX, SSE, AltiVec) categorically do not.\nModern GPUs, which have many small compute units each with their own independent SIMD ALUs, use Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT). SIMT units run from a shared single broadcast synchronised Instruction Unit. The \"vector registers\" are very wide and the pipelines tend to be long. The \"threading\" part of SIMT involves the way data is handled independently on each of the compute units.\nIn addition, GPUs such as the Broadcom Videocore IV and other external vector processors like the NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA may use fewer vector units than the width implies: instead of having 64 units for a 64-number-wide register, the hardware might instead do a pipelined loop over 16 units for a hybrid approach. The Broadcom Videocore IV is also capable of this hybrid approach: nominally stating that its SIMD QPU Engine supports 16-long FP array operations in its instructions, it actually does them 4 at a time, as (another) form of \"threads\".\nVector instruction example.\nThis example starts with an algorithm (\"IAXPY\"), first show it in scalar instructions, then SIMD, then predicated SIMD, and finally vector instructions. This incrementally helps illustrate the difference between a traditional vector processor and a modern SIMD one. The example starts with a 32-bit integer variant of the \"DAXPY\" function, in C:\nvoid iaxpy(size_t n, int a, const int x[], int y[]) {\n for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\n y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];\nIn each iteration, every element of y has an element of x multiplied by a and added to it. The program is expressed in scalar linear form for readability.\nScalar assembler.\nThe scalar version of this would load one of each of x and y, process one calculation, store one result, and loop:\nloop:\n load32 r1, x ; load one 32bit data\n load32 r2, y\n mul32 r1, a, r1 ; r1 := r1 * a\n add32 r3, r1, r2 ; r3 := r1 + r2\n store32 r3, y\n addl x, x, $4 ; x := x + 4\n addl y, y, $4\n subl n, n, $1 ; n := n - 1\n jgz n, loop ; loop back if n &gt; 0\nout:\n ret\nThe STAR-like code remains concise, but because the STAR-100's vectorisation was by design based around memory accesses, an extra slot of memory is now required to process the information. Two times the latency is also needed due to the extra requirement of memory access.\n ; Assume tmp is pre-allocated\n vmul tmp, a, x, n ; tmp[i] = a * x[i]\n vadd y, y, tmp, n ; y[i] = y[i] + tmp[i]\n ret\nPure (non-predicated, packed) SIMD.\nA modern packed SIMD architecture, known by many names (listed in Flynn's taxonomy), can do most of the operation in batches. The code is mostly similar to the scalar version. It is assumed that both x and y are properly aligned here (only start on a multiple of 16) and that n is a multiple of 4, as otherwise some setup code would be needed to calculate a mask or to run a scalar version. It can also be assumed, for simplicity, that the SIMD instructions have an option to automatically repeat scalar operands, like ARM NEON can. If it does not, a \"splat\" (broadcast) must be used, to copy the scalar argument across a SIMD register:\n splatx4 v4, a ; v4 = a,a,a,a\nThe time taken would be basically the same as a vector implementation of described above.\nvloop:\n load32x4 v1, x\n load32x4 v2, y\n mul32x4 v1, a, v1 ; v1 := v1 * a\n add32x4 v3, v1, v2 ; v3 := v1 + v2\n store32x4 v3, y\n addl x, x, $16 ; x := x + 16\n addl y, y, $16\n subl n, n, $4 ; n := n - 4\n jgz n, vloop ; go back if n &gt; 0\nout:\n ret\nNote that both x and y pointers are incremented by 16, because that is how long (in bytes) four 32-bit integers are. The decision was made that the algorithm \"shall\" only cope with 4-wide SIMD, therefore the constant is hard-coded into the program.\nUnfortunately for SIMD, the clue was in the assumption above, \"that n is a multiple of 4\" as well as \"aligned access\", which, clearly, is a limited specialist use-case.\nRealistically, for general-purpose loops such as in portable libraries, where n cannot be limited in this way, the overhead of setup and cleanup for SIMD in order to cope with non-multiples of the SIMD width, can far exceed the instruction count inside the loop itself. Assuming worst-case that the hardware cannot do misaligned SIMD memory accesses, a real-world algorithm will:\nEight-wide SIMD requires repeating the inner loop algorithm first with four-wide SIMD elements, then two-wide SIMD, then one (scalar), with a test and branch in between each one, in order to cover the first and last remaining SIMD elements (0 &lt;= n &lt;= 7).\nThis more than \"triples\" the size of the code, in fact in extreme cases it results in an \"order of magnitude\" increase in instruction count! This can easily be demonstrated by compiling the iaxpy example for AVX-512, using the options to gcc.\nOver time as the ISA evolves to keep increasing performance, it results in ISA Architects adding 2-wide SIMD, then 4-wide SIMD, then 8-wide and upwards. It can therefore be seen why AVX-512 exists in x86.\nWithout predication, the wider the SIMD width the worse the problems get, leading to massive opcode proliferation, degraded performance, extra power consumption and unnecessary software complexity.\nVector processors on the other hand are designed to issue computations of variable length for an arbitrary count, n, and thus require very little setup, and no cleanup. Even compared to those SIMD ISAs which have masks (but no instruction), Vector processors produce much more compact code because they do not need to perform explicit mask calculation to cover the last few elements (illustrated below).\nPredicated SIMD.\nAssuming a hypothetical predicated (mask capable) SIMD ISA, and again assuming that the SIMD instructions can cope with misaligned data, the instruction loop would look like this:\nvloop:\n # prepare mask. few ISAs have min though\n min t0, n, $4 ; t0 = min(n, 4)\n shift m, $1, t0 ; m = 1\u00abt0\n sub m, m, $1 ; m = (1\u00abt0)-1\n # now do the operation, masked by m bits\n load32x4 v1, x, m\n load32x4 v2, y, m\n mul32x4 v1, a, v1, m ; v1 := v1 * a\n add32x4 v3, v1, v2, m ; v3 := v1 + v2\n store32x4 v3, y, m\n # update x, y and n for next loop\n addl x, t0*4 ; x := x + t0*4\n addl y, t0*4\n subl n, n, t0 ; n := n - t0\n # loop?\n jgz n, vloop ; go back if n &gt; 0\nout:\n ret\nHere it can be seen that the code is much cleaner but a little complex: at least, however, there is no setup or cleanup: on the last iteration of the loop, the predicate mask will be set to either 0b0000, 0b0001, 0b0011, 0b0111 or 0b1111, resulting in between 0 and 4 SIMD element operations being performed, respectively.\nOne additional potential complication: some RISC ISAs do not have a \"min\" instruction, needing instead to use a branch or scalar predicated compare.\nIt is clear how predicated SIMD at least merits the term \"vector capable\", because it can cope with variable-length vectors by using predicate masks. The final evolving step to a \"true\" vector ISA, however, is to not have any evidence in the ISA \"at all\" of a SIMD width, leaving that entirely up to the hardware.\nPure (true) vector ISA.\nFor Cray-style vector ISAs such as RVV, an instruction called \"setvl\" (set vector length) is used. The hardware first defines how many data values it can process in one \"vector\": this could be either actual registers or it could be an internal loop (the hybrid approach, mentioned above). This maximum amount (the number of hardware \"lanes\") is termed \"MVL\" (Maximum Vector Length). Note that, as seen in SX-Aurora and Videocore IV, MVL may be an actual hardware lane quantity \"or a virtual one\". \"(Note: As mentioned in the ARM SVE2 Tutorial, programmers must not make the mistake of assuming a fixed vector width: consequently MVL is not a quantity that the programmer needs to know. This can be a little disconcerting after years of SIMD mindset).\"\nOn calling setvl with the number of outstanding data elements to be processed, \"setvl\" is permitted (essentially required) to limit that to the Maximum Vector Length (MVL) and thus returns the \"actual\" number that can be processed by the hardware in subsequent vector instructions, and sets the internal special register, \"VL\", to that same amount. ARM refers to this technique as \"vector length agnostic\" programming in its tutorials on SVE2.\nBelow is the Cray-style vector assembler for the same SIMD style loop, above. Note that t0 (which, containing a convenient copy of VL, can vary) is used instead of hard-coded constants:\nvloop:\n setvl t0, n # VL=t0=min(MVL, n)\n vld32 v0, x # load vector x\n vld32 v1, y # load vector y\n vmadd32 v1, v0, a # v1 += v0 * a\n vst32 v1, y # store Y\n add y, t0*4 # advance y by VL*4\n add x, t0*4 # advance x by VL*4\n sub n, t0 # n -= VL (t0)\n bnez n, vloop # repeat if n != 0\nThis is essentially not very different from the SIMD version (processes 4 data elements per loop if MVL is 4), or from the initial Scalar version (processes just the one). n still contains the number of data elements remaining to be processed, but t0 contains the copy of VL \u2013 the number that is \"going\" to be processed in each iteration. t0 is subtracted from n after each iteration, and if n is zero then all elements have been processed.\nA number of things to note, when comparing against the Predicated SIMD assembly variant:\nThus it can be seen, very clearly, how vector ISAs reduce the number of instructions.\nAlso note, that just like the predicated SIMD variant, the pointers to x and y are advanced by t0 times four because they both point to 32 bit data, but that n is decremented by straight t0. Compared to the fixed-size SIMD assembler there is very little apparent difference: x and y are advanced by hard-coded constant 16, n is decremented by a hard-coded 4, so initially it is hard to appreciate the significance. The difference comes in the realisation that the vector hardware could be capable of doing 4 simultaneous operations, or 64, or 10,000, it would be the exact same vector assembler for all of them \"and there would still be no SIMD cleanup code\". Even compared to the predicate-capable SIMD, it is still more compact, clearer, more elegant and uses less resources.\nNot only is it a much more compact program (saving on L1 Cache size), but as previously mentioned, the vector version can issue far more data processing to the ALUs, again saving power because Instruction Decode and Issue can sit idle.\nAdditionally, the number of elements going in to the function can start at zero. This sets the vector length to zero, which effectively disables all vector instructions, turning them into no-ops, at runtime. Thus, unlike non-predicated SIMD, even when there are no elements to process there is still no wasted cleanup code, or preamble: not even when n=0.\nIBM 370 Vector facility.\nIn the IBM 3090 an additional benefit (further reduction in instruction count) was achieved.\n VLVCU GR4 # Load VCT, update GR4 &amp; CCode\nvloop:\n vld32 v0, x, v0 # load vector x, update v0\n vld32 v1, y # load vector y (no update v1)\n vmadd32 v1, v0, a # v1 += v0 * a\n vst32 v1, y, v1 # store Y, now update v1\n VLVCU GR4 # Load VCT, update GR4 &amp; CCode\n BC 3,vloop # Branch back if VCT&gt;0\nThe instruction would not only set the Vector Count Length () but it would then subtract the new Vector Length from the Scalar register \"and\" update a Condition Code that the Branch could test. In effect combined two (three if including Condition Code setting) into one:\n # IBM 370 VLVCU does the following:\n setvl GR4 # VL=min(MVL, GR4)\n sub GR4, VL # n -= VL (GR4), also set CC\nFurther, both the Vector-Load and Vector-Store instructions could perform the update of the address registers, saving on explicit instructions to perform address-calculations that \"in effect\" had already been done, behind the scenes, when loading/storing each element of the Vector.\nThe exact same principle is used in Libre-SOC, illustrated with a DAXPY (64-bit floating-point) example:\n mtctr 5 # move n to CTR\nvloop:\n setvl MAXVL=32,VL=CTR # actually VL=MIN(MAXVL,CTR)\n # DAXPY is 8-byte, hence 8(r6) and 8(r7)\n sv.lfdup *32,8(r6) # load x into fp32-63, incr x\n sv.lfd/els *64,8(r7) # load y into fp64-95, NO INC\n sv.fmadd *64,*64,1,*32 # (*y) = (*y) * (*x) + a\n sv.stfdup *64,8(r7) # store at y, post-incr y\n sv.bc/ctr vloop # decr CTR by VL, jump !zero\nPost-update modes are added to Vectorised versions of Load-with-Update and Store-with-Update, again saving on the need for a separate instruction for address computation when the CPU's Load/Store internals has already done it. Note again that as with the IBM 370 example: the Vector y address is updated by the Store-with-Update, not a Load-with-Update.\nThe Power ISA CTR register is used for the total count instead of a scalar register, and the instruction performs the reduction of CTR by the current Vector Length (VL) followed by testing CTR for being zero and branching if it is not.\nThe approach is different but achieves the same end-result as the IBM 3090: a significant compacting of instructions that are already considered highly compact. a RISC-V Vector DAXPY inner loop example is 10 instructions, where Libre-SOC and IBM 370 as shown above are both 6: a 40% reduction.\nVector reduction example.\nThis example starts with an algorithm which involves reduction. Just as with the previous example, it will be first shown in scalar instructions, then SIMD, and finally vector instructions, starting in c:\nvoid (size_t n, int a, const int x[]) {\n int y = 0;\n for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\n y += x[i];\n return y;\nHere, an accumulator (y) is used to sum up all the values in the array, x.\nScalar assembler.\nThe scalar version of this would load each of x, add it to y, and loop:\n set y, 0 ; y initialised to zero\nloop:\n load32 r1, x ; load one 32bit data\n add32 y, y, r1 ; y := y + r1\n addl x, x, $4 ; x := x + 4\n subl n, n, $1 ; n := n - 1\n jgz n, loop ; loop back if n &gt; 0\nout:\n ret y ; returns result, y\nThis is very straightforward. \"y\" starts at zero, 32 bit integers are loaded one at a time into r1, added to y, and the address of the array \"x\" moved on to the next element in the array.\nSIMD reduction.\nThis is where the problems start. SIMD by design is incapable of doing arithmetic operations \"inter-element\". Element 0 of one SIMD register may be added to Element 0 of another register, but Element 0 may not be added to anything other than another Element 0. This places some severe limitations on potential implementations. For simplicity it can be assumed that n is exactly 8:\n addl r3, x, $16 ; for 2nd 4 of x\n load32x4 v1, x ; first 4 of x\n load32x4 v2, r3 ; 2nd 4 of x\n add32x4 v1, v2, v1 ; add 2 groups\nAt this point four adds have been performed:\nbut with 4-wide SIMD being incapable by design of adding for example, things go rapidly downhill just as they did with the general case of using SIMD for general-purpose IAXPY loops. To sum the four partial results, two-wide SIMD can be used, followed by a single scalar add, to finally produce the answer, but, frequently, the data must be transferred out of dedicated SIMD registers before the last scalar computation can be performed.\nEven with a general loop (n not fixed), the only way to use 4-wide SIMD is to assume four separate \"streams\", each offset by four elements. Finally, the four partial results have to be summed. The problems compound as the SIMD hardware width increases (an entirely new set of instruction is introduced), and, worse, some instructions to do Horizontal-sum such as the AMD XOP_instruction_set, were \"removed\" after a few years. Some techniques involve shuffle:\nexamples online that involve highly detailed knowledge can be found for AVX-512 and SSE of how to do \"Horizontal Sum\"\nAside from the size of the program and the complexity, an additional potential problem arises if floating-point computation is involved: the fact that the values are not being summed in strict order (four partial results) could result in rounding errors.\nVector ISA reduction.\nVector instruction sets have arithmetic reduction operations \"built-in\" to the ISA. If it is assumed that n is less or equal to the maximum vector length, only three instructions are required:\n setvl t0, n # VL=t0=min(MVL, n)\n vld32 v0, x # load vector x\n vredadd32 y, v0 # reduce-add into y\nThe code when n is larger than the maximum vector length is not that much more complex, and is a similar pattern to the first example (\"IAXPY\").\n set y, 0\nvloop:\n setvl t0, n # VL=t0=min(MVL, n)\n vld32 v0, x # load vector x\n vredadd32 y, y, v0 # add all x into y\n add x, t0*4 # advance x by VL*4\n sub n, t0 # n -= VL (t0)\n bnez n, vloop # repeat if n != 0\n ret y\nThe simplicity of the algorithm is stark in comparison to SIMD. Again, just as with the IAXPY example, the algorithm is length-agnostic (even on Embedded implementations where maximum vector length could be only one).\nImplementations in hardware may, if they are certain that the right answer will be produced, perform the reduction in parallel. Some vector ISAs offer a parallel reduction mode as an explicit option, for when the programmer knows that any potential rounding errors do not matter, and low latency is critical.\nThis example again highlights a key critical fundamental difference between true vector processors and those SIMD processors, including most commercial GPUs, which are inspired by features of vector processors.\nInsights from examples.\nCompared to any SIMD processor claiming to be a vector processor, the order of magnitude reduction in program size is almost shocking. However, this level of elegance at the ISA level has quite a high price tag at the hardware level:\nOverall then there is a choice to either have\nThese stark differences are what distinguishes a vector processor from one that has SIMD.\nVector processor features.\nWhere many SIMD ISAs borrow or are inspired by the list below, typical features that a vector processor will have are:\nGPU vector processing features.\nWith many 3D shader applications needing trigonometric operations as well as short vectors for common operations (RGB, ARGB, XYZ, XYZW) support for the following is typically present in modern GPUs, in addition to those found in vector processors:\nFault (or Fail) First.\nIntroduced in ARM SVE2 and RISC-V RVV is the concept of speculative sequential Vector Loads. ARM SVE2 has a special register named \"First Fault Register\", where RVV modifies (truncates) the Vector Length (VL).\nThe basic principle of ffirst is to attempt a large sequential Vector Load, but to allow the hardware to arbitrarily truncate the \"actual\" amount loaded to either the amount that would succeed without raising a memory fault or simply to an amount (greater than zero) that is most convenient. The important factor is that \"subsequent\" instructions are notified or may determine exactly how many Loads actually succeeded, using that quantity to only carry out work on the data that has actually been loaded.\nContrast this situation with SIMD, which is a fixed (inflexible) load width and fixed data processing width, unable to cope with loads that cross page boundaries, and even if they were they are unable to adapt to what actually succeeded, yet, paradoxically, if the SIMD program were to even attempt to find out in advance (in each inner loop, every time) what might optimally succeed, those instructions only serve to hinder performance because they would, by necessity, be part of the critical inner loop.\nThis begins to hint at the reason why ffirst is so innovative, and is best illustrated by memcpy or strcpy when implemented with standard 128-bit non-predicated non-ffirst SIMD. For IBM POWER9 the number of hand-optimised instructions to implement strncpy is in excess of 240.\nBy contrast, the same strncpy routine in hand-optimised RVV assembler is a mere 22 instructions.\nThe above SIMD example could potentially fault and fail at the end of memory, due to attempts to read too many values: it could also cause significant numbers of page or misaligned faults by similarly crossing over boundaries. In contrast, by allowing the vector architecture the freedom to decide how many elements to load, the first part of a strncpy, if beginning initially on a sub-optimal memory boundary, may return just enough loads such that on \"subsequent\" iterations of the loop the batches of vectorised memory reads are optimally aligned with the underlying caches and virtual memory arrangements. Additionally, the hardware may choose to use the opportunity to end any given loop iteration's memory reads \"exactly\" on a page boundary (avoiding a costly second TLB lookup), with speculative execution preparing the next virtual memory page whilst data is still being processed in the current loop. All of this is determined by the hardware, not the program itself.\nPerformance and speed up.\nLet r be the vector speed ratio and f be the vectorization ratio. If the time taken for the vector unit to add an array of 64 numbers is 10 times faster than its equivalent scalar counterpart, r = 10. Also, if the total number of operations in a program is 100, out of which only 10 are scalar (after vectorization), then f = 0.9, i.e., 90% of the work is done by the vector unit. It follows the achievable speed up of:\nformula_1\nSo, even if the performance of the vector unit is very high (formula_2) there is a speedup less than formula_3, which suggests that the ratio f is crucial to the performance. This ratio depends on the efficiency of the compilation like adjacency of the elements in memory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. In 1998, the city had a population of 82,608. Most of the population consists of Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians; in 2017, there was also a large presence of Syrian refugees.\nBaalbek's history dates back at least 11,000 years. After Alexander the Great conquered the city in 334 BCE, he renamed it Heliopolis (, Greek for \"Sun City\"). The city flourished under Roman rule. However, it underwent transformations during the Christianization period and the subsequent rise of Islam following the Arab conquest in the 7th century. In later periods, the city was sacked by the Mongols and faced a series of earthquakes, resulting in a decline in importance during the Ottoman and modern periods.\nIn the modern era, Baalbek is a tourist destination. It is known for the ruins of the Roman temple complex, which includes the Temple of Bacchus and the Temple of Jupiter, and was inscribed in 1984 as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other tourist attractions are the Great Umayyad Mosque, the Baalbek International Festival, the mausoleum of Sit Khawla, and a Roman quarry site named \"Hajar al-Hibla\". Baalbek's tourism sector has encountered challenges due to conflicts in Lebanon, particularly the 1975\u20131990 civil war, the ongoing Syrian civil war since 2011, and the Israel\u2013Hezbollah conflict (2023\u2013present).\nBaalbek is considered to be part of Hezbollah's heartland and is known to be their political stronghold. During the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon (1982\u20132000), the group managed to overpower the Lebanese army in Baalbek and gain control of the city. The settlement was subsequently used as a base to recruit and train men for attacks against Israeli forces. Hezbollah continues to hold significant political influence and popular support in Baalbek. In the 2022 Lebanese general election the Amal-Hezbollah list won 9 out of 10 seats in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate.\nIsrael has conducted numerous airstrikes and raids against military and civilian targets in the Baalbek area in the past decades. For instance, in 2006 during the Operation Sharp and Smooth, Israeli commandos raided a hospital and bombed multiple houses, killing two Hezbollah fighters and at least eleven civilians. In 2024, during the Israel\u2013Hezbollah conflict, Israel sent forced displacement calls for the entire city. Shortly after, Israeli airstrikes killed 19 people, including 8 women.\nEtymology.\nA few kilometres from the swamp from which the Litani (the classical Leontes) and the Asi (the upper Orontes) flow, Baalbek may be the same as the \"manbaa al-nahrayn\" (\"Source of the Two Rivers\"), the abode of El in the Ugaritic Baal Cycle discovered in the 1920s and a separate serpent incantation.\nBaalbek was called \"Heliopolis\" during the Roman Empire, a latinisation of the Greek \"H\u0113lio\u00fapolis\" () used during the Hellenistic period, meaning \"Sun City\" in reference to the solar cult there. The name is attested under the Seleucids and Ptolemies. However, Ammianus Marcellinus notes that earlier Assyrian names of Levantine towns continued to be used alongside the official Greek ones imposed by the Diadochi, who were successors of Alexander the Great. In Greek religion, Helios was both the sun in the sky and its personification as a god. The local Semitic god Ba\u02bfal Haddu was more often equated with Zeus or Jupiter or simply called the \"Great God of Heliopolis\", but the name may refer to the Egyptians' association of Ba\u02bfal with their great god Ra. It was sometimes described as Heliopolis in Syria or Coelesyria ( or ') to distinguish it from its namesake in Egypt. In Catholicism, its titular see is distinguished as Heliopolis in Phoenicia\"', from its former Roman province Phoenice. The importance of the solar cult is also attested in the name \"Bi\u1e33\u0101\u02bf al-\u02bfAz\u012bz\" borne by the plateau surrounding Baalbek, as it references an earlier solar deity named Aziz. In Greek and Roman antiquity, it was known as \"Heliopolis\". Some of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Lebanon are located here, including one of the largest temples of the Roman empire. The gods worshipped there (Jupiter, Venus, and Bacchus) were equivalents of the Canaanite deities Hadad, Atargatis. Local influences are seen in the planning and layout of the temples, which differ from classic Roman design.\nThe name B\u02bfLBK appears in the Mishnah, a second-century rabbinic text, as a kind of garlic, \"shum ba'albeki\" (\u05e9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d1\u05db\u05d9). It appears in two early 5th-century Syriac manuscripts, a c.\u2009411 translation of Eusebius's \"Theophania\" and a c.\u2009435 life of Rabbula, bishop of Edessa. It was pronounced as Ba\u02bflabakk () in Classical Arabic. In Modern Standard Arabic, its vowels are marked as \"Ba\u02bflabak\" () or \"Ba\u02bflabekk\". It is \"B\u02bfalbik\" (, is ) in Lebanese Arabic.\nThe etymology of Baalbek has been debated since the 18th century. Cook took it to mean \"Ba\u02bfal (Lord) of the Beka\" and Donne as \"City of the Sun\". Lendering asserts that it is probably a contraction of \"Ba\u02bfal Nebeq\" (\"Lord of the Source\" of the Litani River). Steiner proposes a Semitic adaption of \"Lord Bacchus\", from the classical temple complex.\nNineteenth-century Biblical archaeologists proposed the association of Baalbek with the town of Baalgad in the Book of Joshua; the town of Baalath, one of Solomon's cities in the First Book of Kings; Baal-hamon, where Solomon had a vineyard; and the \"Plain of Aven\" in Book of Amos.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe hilltop of Tell Baalbek, part of a valley to the east of the northern Beqaa Valley (), shows signs of almost continual habitation over the last 8\u20139000 years. It was well-watered both from a stream running from the \"R\u0101s al-\u02bfAyn\" spring southwest of the citadel and, during the spring, from numerous rills formed by meltwater from the Anti-Lebanons. Macrobius later credited the site's foundation to a colony of Egyptian or Assyrian priests. The settlement's religious, commercial, and strategic importance was minor enough, however, that it is never mentioned in any known Assyrian or Egyptian record, unless under another name. Its enviable position in a fertile valley, major watershed, and along the route from Tyre to Palmyra should have made it a wealthy and splendid site from an early age. During the Canaanite period, the local temples were primarily devoted to the Heliopolitan Triad: a male god (Ba\u02bfal), his consort (Astarte), and their son (Adon). The site of the present Temple of Jupiter was probably the focus of earlier worship, as its altar was located at the hill's precise summit and the rest of the sanctuary raised to its level.\nIn Islamic mythology, the temple complex was said to have been a palace of Solomon's which was put together by \"djinn\" and given as a wedding gift to the Queen of Sheba; its actual Roman origin remained obscured by the citadel's medieval fortifications as late as the 16th-century visit of the Polish prince Radziwi\u0142\u0142.\nAntiquity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAfter Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia in the 330s\u00a0BC, Baalbek (under its Hellenic name Heliopolis) formed part of the Diadochi kingdoms of Egypt &amp; Syria. It was annexed by the Romans during their eastern wars. The settlers of the Roman colony Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Heliopolitana may have arrived as early as the time of Caesar but were more probably the veterans of the 5th and 8th Legions under Augustus, during which time it hosted a Roman garrison. From 15\u00a0BC to AD\u00a0193, it formed part of the territory of Berytus. It is mentioned in Josephus, Pliny, Strabo, and Ptolemy and on coins of nearly every emperor from Nerva to Gallienus. The 1st-century Pliny did not number it among the Decapolis, the \"Ten Cities\" of Coelesyria, while the 2nd-century Ptolemy did. The population likely varied seasonally with market fairs and the schedules of the Indian monsoon and caravans to the coast and interior.\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the city's temple to Ba\u02bfal Haddu was conflated first with the worship of the Greek sun god Helios and then with the Greek and Roman sky god under the name \"Heliopolitan Zeus\" or \"Jupiter\". The present Temple of Jupiter presumably replaced an earlier one using the same foundation; it was constructed during the mid-1st\u00a0century and probably completed around AD\u00a060. His idol was a beardless golden god in the pose of a charioteer, with a whip raised in his right hand and a thunderbolt and stalks of grain in his left; its image appeared on local coinage and it was borne through the streets during several festivals throughout the year. Macrobius compared the rituals to those for Diva Fortuna at Antium and says the bearers were the principal citizens of the town, who prepared for their role with abstinence, chastity, and shaved heads. In bronze statuary attested from Byblos in Phoenicia and Tortosa in Spain, he was encased in a pillarlike term and surrounded (like the Greco-Persian Mithras) by busts representing the sun, moon, and five known planets. In these statues, the bust of Mercury is made particularly prominent; a marble stela at Massilia in Transalpine Gaul shows a similar arrangement but enlarges Mercury into a full figure. Local cults also revered the Baetylia, black conical stones considered sacred to Ba\u02bfal. One of these was taken to Rome by the emperor Elagabalus, a former priest \"of the sun\" at nearby Emesa, who erected a temple for it on the Palatine Hill. Heliopolis was a noted oracle and pilgrimage site, whence the cult spread far afield, with inscriptions to the Heliopolitan god discovered in Athens, Rome, Pannonia, Venetia, Gaul, and near the Wall in Britain. The Roman temple complex grew up from the early part of the reign of Augustus in the late 1st\u00a0century\u00a0BC until the rise of Christianity in the 4th\u00a0century. (The 6th-century chronicles of John Malalas of Antioch, which claimed Baalbek as a \"wonder of the world\", credited most of the complex to the 2nd-century Antoninus Pius, but it is uncertain how reliable his account is on the point.) By that time, the complex housed three temples on Tell Baalbek: one to Jupiter Heliopolitanus (Ba\u02bfal), one to Venus Heliopolitana (Ashtart), and a third to Bacchus. On a nearby hill, a fourth temple was dedicated to the third figure of the Heliopolitan Triad, Mercury (Adon or Seimios). Ultimately, the site vied with Praeneste in Italy as the two largest sanctuaries in the Western world.\nThe emperor Trajan consulted the site's oracle twice. The first time, he requested a written reply to his sealed and unopened question; he was favorably impressed by the god's blank reply as his own paper had been empty. He then inquired whether he would return alive from his wars against Parthia and received in reply a centurion's vine staff, broken to pieces. In AD\u00a0193, Septimius Severus granted the city \"ius Italicum\" rights. His wife Julia Domna and son Caracalla toured Egypt and Syria in AD\u00a0215; inscriptions in their honour at the site may date from that occasion; Julia was a Syrian native whose father had been an Emesan priest \"of the sun\" like Elagabalus.\nThe town became a battleground upon the rise of Christianity. Early Christian writers such as Eusebius (from nearby Caesarea) repeatedly execrated the practices of the local pagans in their worship of the Heliopolitan Venus. In AD\u00a0297, the actor Gelasinus converted in the middle of a scene mocking baptism; his public profession of faith provoked the audience to drag him from the theater and stone him to death. In the early 4th century, the deacon Cyril defaced many of the idols in Heliopolis; he was killed and (allegedly) cannibalised. Around the same time, Constantine, though not yet a Christian, demolished the goddess' temple, raised a basilica in its place, and outlawed the locals' ancient custom of prostituting women before marriage. Bar Hebraeus also credited him with ending the locals' continued practice of polygamy. The enraged locals responded by raping and torturing Christian virgins. They reacted violently again under the freedom permitted to them by Julian the Apostate. The city was so noted for its hostility to the Christians that Alexandrians were banished to it as a special punishment. The Temple of Jupiter, already greatly damaged by earthquakes, was demolished under Theodosius in 379 and replaced by another basilica (now lost), using stones scavenged from the pagan complex. The \"Easter Chronicle\" states he was also responsible for destroying all the lesser temples and shrines of the city. Around the year 400, Rabbula, the future bishop of Edessa, attempted to have himself martyred by disrupting the pagans of Baalbek but was only thrown down the temple stairs along with his companion. It became the seat of its own bishop as well. Under the reign of Justinian, eight of the complex's Corinthian columns were disassembled and shipped to Constantinople for incorporation in the rebuilt Hagia Sophia sometime between 532 and 537. Michael the Syrian claimed the golden idol of Heliopolitan Jupiter was still to be seen during the reign of Justin\u00a0II (560s &amp; 570s), and, up to the time of its conquest by the Muslims, it was renowned for its palaces, monuments, and gardens.\nMiddle Ages and early modernity.\nBaalbek was occupied by the Muslim army in AD\u00a0634 (AH\u00a013), in 636, or under Abu \u02bfUbaidah following the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk in 637 (AH\u00a016), either peacefully and by agreement or following a heroic defense and yielding of gold, of silver, 2000 silk vests, and 1000 swords. The ruined temple complex was fortified under the name al-Qala' (lit.\u00a0\"The Fortress\") but was sacked with great violence by the Damascene caliph Marwan\u00a0II in 748, at which time it was dismantled and largely depopulated. It formed part of the district of Damascus under the Umayyads and Abbasids before being conquered by Fatimid Egypt in 942. In the mid-10th century, it was said to have \"gates of palaces sculptured in marble and lofty columns also of marble\" and that it was the most \"stupendous\" and \"considerable\" location in the whole of Syria. It was sacked and razed by the Byzantines under John\u00a0I in 974, raided by Basil\u00a0II in 1000, and occupied by Salih ibn Mirdas, emir of Aleppo, in 1025.\nIn 1075, it was finally lost to the Fatimids on its conquest by Tutush\u00a0I, Seljuk emir of Damascus. It was briefly held by Muslim ibn Quraysh, emir of Aleppo, in 1083; after its recovery, it was ruled in the Seljuks' name by the eunuch G\u00fcm\u00fcshtegin until he was deposed for conspiring against the usurper Toghtekin in 1110. Toghtekin then gave the town to his son Buri. Upon Buri's succession to Damascus on his father's death in 1128, he granted the area to his son Muhammad. After Buri's murder, Muhammad successfully defended himself against the attacks of his brothers Isma\u02bfil and Mahmud and gave Baalbek to his vizier Unur. In July 1139, Zengi, atabeg of Aleppo and stepfather of Mahmud, besieged Baalbek with 14 catapults. The outer city held until 10 October and the citadel until the 21st, when Unur surrendered upon a promise of safe passage. In December, Zengi negotiated with Muhammad, offering to trade Baalbek or Homs for Damascus, but Unur convinced the atabeg to refuse. Zengi strengthened its fortifications and bestowed the territory on his lieutenant Ayyub, father of Saladin. Upon Zengi's assassination in 1146, Ayyub surrendered the territory to Unur, who was acting as regent for Muhammad's son Abaq. It was granted to the eunuch Ata al-Khadim, who also served as viceroy of Damascus.\nIn December 1151, it was raided by the garrison of Banyas as a reprisal for its role in a Turcoman raid on Banyas. Following Ata's murder, his nephew Dahhak, emir of the Wadi al-Taym, ruled Baalbek. He was forced to relinquish it to Nur ad-Din in 1154 after Ayyub had successfully intrigued against Abaq from his estates near Baalbek. Ayyub then administered the area from Damascus on Nur ad-Din's behalf. In the mid-12th century, Idrisi mentioned Baalbek's two temples and the legend of their origin under Solomon; it was visited by the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela in 1170.\nBaalbek's citadel served as a jail for Crusaders taken by the Zengids as prisoners of war. In 1171, these captives successfully overpowered their guards and took possession of the castle from its garrison. Muslims from the surrounding area gathered, however, and entered the castle through a secret passageway shown to them by a local. The Crusaders were then massacred.\nThree major earthquakes occurred in the 12th century, in 1139, 1157, and 1170. The one in 1170 ruined Baalbek's walls and, though Nur ad-Din repaired them, his young heir Isma\u02bfil was made to yield it to Saladin by a 4-month siege in 1174. Having taken control of Damascus on the invitation of its governor Ibn al-Muqaddam, Saladin rewarded him with the emirate of Baalbek following the Ayyubid victory at the Horns of Hama in 1175. Baldwin, the young leper king of Jerusalem, came of age the next year, ending the Crusaders' treaty with Saladin. His former regent, Raymond of Tripoli, raided the Beqaa Valley from the west in the summer, suffering a slight defeat at Ibn al-Muqaddam's hands. He was then joined by the main army, riding north under Baldwin and Humphrey of Toron; they defeated Saladin's elder brother Turan Shah in August at Ayn al-Jarr and plundered Baalbek. Upon the deposition of Turan Shah for neglecting his duties in Damascus, however, he demanded his childhood home of Baalbek as compensation. Ibn al-Muqaddam did not consent and Saladin opted to invest the city in late 1178 to maintain peace within his own family. An attempt to pledge fealty to the Christians at Jerusalem was ignored on behalf of an existing treaty with Saladin. The siege was maintained peacefully through the snows of winter, with Saladin waiting for the \"foolish\" commander and his garrison of \"ignorant scum\" to come to terms. Sometime in spring, Ibn al-Muqaddam yielded and Saladin accepted his terms, granting him Ba\u02bfrin, Kafr Tab, and al-Ma\u02bfarra. The generosity quieted unrest among Saladin's vassals through the rest of his reign but led his enemies to attempt to take advantage of his presumed weakness. He did not permit Turan Shah to retain Baalbek very long, though, instructing him to lead the Egyptian troops returning home in 1179 and appointing him to a sinecure in Alexandria. Baalbek was then granted to his nephew Farrukh Shah, whose family ruled it for the next half-century. When Farrukh Shah died three years later, his son Bahram Shah was only a child but he was permitted his inheritance and ruled til 1230. He was followed by al-Ashraf Musa, who was succeeded by his brother as-Salih Ismail, who received it in 1237 as compensation for being deprived of Damascus by their brother al-Kamil. It was seized in 1246 after a year of assaults by as-Salih Ayyub, who bestowed it upon Sa\u02bfd al-Din al-Humaidi. When as-Salih Ayyub's successor Turan Shah was murdered in 1250, al-Nasir Yusuf, the sultan of Aleppo, seized Damascus and demanded Baalbek's surrender. Instead, its emir did homage and agreed to regular payments of tribute.\nThe Mongolian general Kitbuqa took Baalbek in 1260 and dismantled its fortifications. Later in the same year, however, Qutuz, the sultan of Egypt, defeated the Mongols and placed Baalbek under the rule of their emir in Damascus. Most of the city's still-extant fine mosque and fortress architecture dates to the reign of the sultan Qalawun in the 1280s. By the early 14th century, Abulfeda the Hamathite was describing the city's \"large and strong fortress\". The revived settlement was again destroyed by a flood on 10 May 1318, when water from the east and northeast made holes wide in walls thick. 194 people were killed and 1500 houses, 131 shops, 44 orchards, 17 ovens, 11 mills, and 4 aqueducts were ruined, along with the town's mosque and 13 other religious and educational buildings. In 1400, Timur pillaged the town, and there was further destruction from a 1459 earthquake.\nEarly modernity.\nIn 1516, Baalbek was conquered with the rest of Syria by the Ottoman sultan Selim the Grim. In recognition of their prominence among the Shiites of the Beqaa Valley, the Ottomans awarded the sanjak of Homs and local \"iltizam\" concessions to Baalbek's Harfush family. Like the Hamadas, the Harfush emirs were involved on more than one occasion in the selection of Church officials and the running of local monasteries. Tradition holds that many Christians quit the Baalbek region in the eighteenth century for the newer, more secure town of Zahl\u00e9 on account of the Harfushes' oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that the Harfushes were closely allied to the Orthodox Ma'luf family of Zahl\u00e9 (where indeed Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahl\u00e9's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the eighteenth century. What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite 'Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek in this period to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes, establishing itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even serving as consuls of Iran.\nFrom the 16th century, European tourists began to visit the colossal and picturesque ruins. Donne hyperbolised \"No ruins of antiquity have attracted more attention than those of Heliopolis, or been more frequently or accurately measured and described.\" Misunderstanding the temple of Bacchus as the \"Temple of the Sun\", they considered it the best-preserved Roman temple in the world. The Englishman Robert Wood's 1757 \"Ruins of Balbec\" included carefully measured engravings that proved influential on British and Continental Neoclassical architects. For example, details of the Temple of Bacchus's ceiling inspired a bed and ceiling by Robert Adam and its portico inspired that of St George's in Bloomsbury.\nDuring the 18th century, the western approaches were covered with attractive groves of walnut trees, but the town itself suffered badly during the 1759 earthquakes, after which it was held by the Metawali, who again feuded with other Lebanese tribes. Their power was broken by Jezzar Pasha, the rebel governor of Acre, in the last half of the 18th century. All the same, Baalbek remained no destination for a traveller unaccompanied by an armed guard. Upon the pasha's death in 1804, chaos ensued until Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt occupied the area in 1831, after which it again passed into the hands of the Harfushes. In 1835, the town's population was barely 200 people. In 1850, the Ottomans finally began direct administration of the area, making Baalbek a kaza under the Damascus Eyalet and its governor a kaymakam.\nExcavations.\nEmperor Wilhelm\u00a0II of Germany and his wife passed through Baalbek on 1 November 1898, on their way to Jerusalem. He noted both the magnificence of the Roman remains and the drab condition of the modern settlement. It was expected at the time that natural disasters, winter frosts, and the raiding of building materials by the city's residents would shortly ruin the remaining ruins. The archaeological team he dispatched began work within a month. Despite finding nothing they could date prior to Baalbek's Roman occupation, Otto Puchstein and his associates worked until 1904 and produced a meticulously researched and thoroughly illustrated series of volumes. Later excavations under the Roman flagstones in the Great Court unearthed three skeletons and a fragment of Persian pottery dated to the 6th\u20134th\u00a0centuries\u00a0BC. The sherd featured cuneiform letters.\nIn 1977, Jean-Pierre Adam made a brief study suggesting most of the large blocks could have been moved on rollers with machines using capstans and pulley blocks, a process which he theorised could use 512 workers to move a block. \"Baalbek, with its colossal structures, is one of the finest examples of Imperial Roman architecture at its apogee\", UNESCO reported in making Baalbek a World Heritage Site in 1984. When the committee inscribed the site, it expressed the wish that the protected area include the entire town within the Arab walls, as well as the southwestern extramural quarter between Bastan-al-Khan, the Roman site and the Mameluk mosque of Ras-al-Ain. Lebanon's representative gave assurances that the committee's wish would be honoured. Recent cleaning operations at the Temple of Jupiter discovered the deep trench at its edge, whose study pushed back the date of Tell Baalbek's settlement to the PPNB Neolithic. Finds included pottery sherds including a spout dating to the early Bronze Age. In the summer of 2014, a team from the German Archaeological Institute led by Jeanine Abdul Massih of the Lebanese University discovered a sixth, much larger stone suggested to be the world's largest ancient block. The stone was found underneath and next to the Stone of the Pregnant Woman (\"Hajjar al-Hibla\") and measures around . It is estimated to weigh .\nModern history.\nBaalbek was connected to the DHP, the French-owned railway concession in Ottoman Syria, on 19 June 1902. It formed a station on the standard-gauge line between Riyaq to its south and Aleppo (now in Syria) to its north. This Aleppo Railway connected to the Beirut\u2013Damascus Railway but\u2014because that line was built to a 1.05-meter gauge\u2014all traffic had to be unloaded and reloaded at Riyaq. Just before the First World War, the population was still around 5000, about 2000 each of Sunnis and Shia Mutawalis and 1000 Orthodox and Maronites. The French general Georges Catroux proclaimed the independence of Lebanon in 1941 but colonial rule continued until 1943. Baalbek still has its railway station but service has been discontinued since the 1970s, originally owing to the Lebanese Civil War.\nIn March 1974, Musa al-Sadr announced the launching of the \"Movement of the Deprived\" in front of a rally in Baalbek attended by 75,000 men. Its objective was to stand up for Lebanon's neglected Shia community. In his speech he listed grievances with the Lebanese government, including Baalbek's lack of a secondary school, Shia communities receiving disproportionately less funds from the national budget, most of the homeless being Shia etc. The occasion was a religious one, and there was celebratory gunfire preceding it. He also announced the setting up of military training camps to train villagers in southern Lebanon to protect their homes from Israeli attacks. These camps led to the creation of the Amal Militia.\nBy the 2000s, Baalbek was frequently described as a stronghold of Hezbollah, although it also has a large presence of Christians and Sunni Muslims. Many of the city's mayors have been Shia, but since 2022, Baalbek has had a Sunni mayor.\nIsraeli\u2013Lebanon conflict.\nIn 1978, Israel invaded south Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands of Shia Muslims to flee. As a result of the invasion, when Hassan Nasrallah returned to Lebanon from his studies in Najaf, he was unable to return to his hometown in the south, and instead settled in Baalbek. Abbas al-Musawi also moved to Baalbek.\nIn 1982, at the height of another Israeli invasion, Amal split into two factions over Nabih Berri's acceptance of the American plan to evacuate Palestinians from West Beirut. A large number of dissidents, led by Amal's military commander Hussein Musawi moved to Baalbek. Once established in the town the group, which was to evolve into Hezbollah, began to work with Iranian Revolutionary Guards, veterans of the Iran Iraq War. The following year the Iranians established their headquarters in the Sheikh Abdullah barracks in Baalbek. Ultimately there were between 1,500 and 2,000 Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon, with outposts further south in the Shia villages, such as Jebchit.\nIn 1984, Israel launched raids on Baalbek, killing 100 Lebanese civilians and wounding hundreds inside the city. Israel also bombed a school in the Wavel Palestinian refugee camp next to the city, wounding 150 school children.\nOn 24/25 June 1999, following elections in Israel and the new administration undecided, the IAF launched two massive air raids across Lebanon. One of the targets was the al Manar radio station's offices in a four-storey building in Baalbek which was completely demolished. The attacks also hit Beirut's power stations and bridges on the roads to the south. An estimated $52 million damage was caused. Eleven Lebanese were killed as well as two Israelis in Kiryat Shmona.\n2006 Lebanon War.\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon war, many Israeli bombs fell inside the historic Roman town, and some fell as close as 300 meters from the temple of Baalbek. After the war, UNESCO stated that the cracks in the Roman temples had widened. The damage was thought to be due to shockwaves created by the bombs.\nMore than 250 houses and buildings were destroyed by Israel during the war. Reporters investigating the aftermath found these to be civilian houses and didn't find any evidence of military use.\nOn the evening of 1 August 2006, hundreds of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers raided Baalbek and the Dar al-Hikma or Hikmeh Hospital in Jamaliyeh to its north (\"Operation Sharp and Smooth\"). Their mission was to rescue two captured soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who were abducted by Hezbollah on 12 July 2006. They were transported by helicopter and supported by Apache helicopters and unmanned drones, The IDF was acting on information that Goldwasser and Regev were at the hospital. al-Jazeera and other sources claimed the IDF was attempting to capture senior Hezbollah officials, particularly Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek. The hospital had been empty for four days, the most unwell patients having been transferred and the rest sent home. \nOn August 7, Israel killed 9 civilians in an attack on Brital, just south of Baalbek, and by the subsequent attack on the car leaving the scene for the hospital. A Human Rights Watch investigation showed that none of those killed were combatants, it is likely none were members of Hezbollah, and none of the survivors had any knowledge of any military presence at place of the attack.\nOn 14 August just before the ceasefire took effect, two Lebanese police and five Lebanese soldiers were killed by a drone strike while driving their van around the still-damaged road through Jamaliyeh.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nBaalbek has a mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Csa\") with significant continental influences. It is located in one of the drier regions of the country, giving it an annual average of of rainfall compared with in coastal areas, overwhelmingly concentrated in the months from November to April. Baalbek has hot rainless summers with cool (and occasionally snowy) winters. Autumn and spring are mild and fairly rainy.\nDemographics.\nIn 2014, Muslims made up 93.85% and Christians made up 5.66% of registered voters in Baalbek. 59.61% of the voters were Shiite Muslims and 34.24% were Sunni Muslims.\nEconomy.\nTourism.\nThe Roman ruins have been the setting for the long running Baalbek International Festival.\nBaalbek's tourism sector suffered significantly due to the Lebanese Civil war (1975\u20131990). After the civil war ended, tourism gradually saw a resurgence, including opera, orchestras. But it was once again disrupted by Israeli bombings of Baalbek during the 2006 war.\nAfter the 2006 war, conservation work at Lebanon's historic sites began in October that year. The ruins at Baalbek were not directly hit by Israeli bombing but the effects of blasts during the conflict toppled a block of stones at the Roman ruins and existing cracks in the temples of Jupiter and Bacchus were feared to have widened. Frederique Husseini, director-general of Lebanon's Department of Antiquities, requested $550,000 from Europeans to restore Baalbek's souk and another $900,000 for repairs to other damaged structures.\nStarting in the early 2000s, Hezbollah organized permanent or temporary exhibitions called \"Exposition of the Resistance\" which commemorate what is considered to be Lebanese resistance to Israeli occupation. Spanning several hundred square meters, the exhibitions feature defused Israeli weapons, recreated scenes of war, and photos and videos of Lebanese people killed by Israel. Starting in 2009, Hezbollah setup an exhibition to commemorate the 2006 war.\nDuring the Syrian civil war, the UK FCO designated areas close to the Syrian border, including Baalbek and the rest of Beqaa valley, as \"red zone\" \u2013 advising against all travel. The US State Department made a similar designation. These designations, prompted by perceived proximity to Syria and clashes between Sunnis and Alawites, discouraged international tourism.\nDuring its 2024 invasion of Lebanon, Israel bombed a restaurant frequented by tourists and damaged the historic Hotel Palmyra. In November, UNESCO gave Baalbek enhanced protection to safeguard against damage to the archaeological site during the invasion; it was one of 34 areas to receive this protection.\nRuins.\nThe Tell Baalbek temple complex, fortified as the town's citadel during the Middle Ages, was constructed from local stone, mostly white granite and a rough white marble. Over the years, it has suffered from the region's numerous earthquakes, the iconoclasm of Christian and Muslim lords, and the reuse of the temples' stone for fortification and other construction. The temples also suffered minor damage from the shockwaves generated by nearby Israeli bombings in the 2006 Lebanon war. The nearby Qubbat Duris, a 13th-century Muslim shrine on the old road to Damascus, is built out of granite columns, apparently removed from Baalbek. Further, the jointed columns were once banded together with iron; many were gouged open or toppled by the emirs of Damascus to get at the metal. As late as the 16th century, the Temple of Jupiter still held 27 standing columns out of an original 58; there were only nine before the 1759 earthquakes and six today.\nThe complex is located on a raised plaza erected over an earlier T-shaped base consisting of a podium, staircase, and foundation walls. These walls were built from about 24 monoliths, at their lowest level weighing approximately each. The tallest retaining wall, on the west, has a second course of monoliths containing the famous \"Three Stones\" (, \"Tr\u00edlithon\"): a row of three stones, each over long, high, and broad, cut from limestone. They weigh approximately each. A fourth, still larger stone is called the Stone of the Pregnant Woman: it lies unused in a nearby quarry from the town. Its weight is estimated at . A fifth, still larger stone weighing approximately lies in the same quarry. This quarry was slightly higher than the temple complex, so no lifting was required to move the stones.\nThe temple complex was entered from the east through the Propylaea (, \"prop\u00fdlaion\") or Portico, consisting of a broad staircase rising to an arcade of 12 columns flanked by 2 towers. Most of the columns have been toppled and the stairs were entirely dismantled for use in the nearby later wall, but a Latin inscription remains on several of their bases stating that Longinus, a lifeguard of the 1st Parthian Legion, and Septimius, a freedman, gilded their capitals with bronze in gratitude for the safety of Septimius Severus's son Antoninus Caracalla and empress Julia Domna.\nImmediately behind the Propylaeum is a hexagonal forecourt reached through a threefold entrance that was added in the mid-3rd century by the emperor Philip the Arab. Traces remain of the two series of columns which once encircled it, but its original function remains uncertain. Donne reckoned it as the town's forum. Badly preserved coins of the era led some to believe this was a sacred cypress grove, but better specimens show that the coins displayed a single stalk of grain instead.\nThe rectangular Great Court to its west covers around and included the main altar for burnt offering, with mosaic-floored lustration basins to its north and south, a subterranean chamber, and three underground passageways wide by high, two of which run east and west and the third connecting them north and south, all bearing inscriptions suggesting their occupation by Roman soldiers. These were surrounded by Corinthian porticoes, one of which was never completed. The columns' bases and capitals were of limestone; the shafts were monoliths of highly polished red Egyptian granite high. Six remain standing, out of an original 128. Inscriptions attest that the court was once adorned by portraits of Marcus Aurelius's daughter Sabina, Septimius Severus, Gordian, and Velius Rufus, dedicated by the city's Roman colonists. The entablature was richly decorated but is now mostly ruined. A westward-facing basilica was constructed over the altar during the reign of Theodosius; it was later altered to make it eastward-facing like most Christian churches.\nThe Temple of Jupiter\u2014once wrongly credited to Helios\u2014lay at the western end of the Great Court, raised another on a platform reached by a wide staircase. Under the Byzantines, it was also known as the \"Trilithon\" from the three massive stones in its foundation and, when taken together with the forecourt and Great Court, it is also known as the Great Temple. The Temple of Jupiter proper was circled by a peristyle of 54 unfluted Corinthian columns: 10 in front and back and 19 along each side. The temple was ruined by earthquakes, destroyed and pillaged for stone under Theodosius, and 8 columns were taken to Constantinople (Istanbul) under Justinian for incorporation into the Hagia Sophia. Three fell during the late 18th century. 6 columns, however, remain standing along its south side with their entablature. Their capitals remain nearly perfect on the south side, while the Beqaa's winter winds have worn the northern faces almost bare. The architrave and frieze blocks weigh up to each, and one corner block over , all of them raised to a height of above the ground. Individual Roman cranes were not capable of lifting stones this heavy. They may have simply been rolled into position along temporary earthen banks from the quarry. The Julio-Claudian emperors enriched its sanctuary in turn. In the mid-1st century, Nero built the tower-altar opposite the temple. In the early 2nd century, Trajan added the temple's forecourt, with porticos of pink granite shipped from Aswan at the southern end of Egypt.\nThe Temple of Bacchus\u2014once wrongly credited to Jupiter\u2014may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s, as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter. It is the best preserved of the sanctuary's structures, as the other rubble from its ruins protected it. It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity. The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns\u20148 along each end and 15 along each side\u2014nearly in height. These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded, polished, and decorated in position. The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood, but the keystone of the lintel had slid following the 1759 earthquakes; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it. The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit's famed inscription of an eagle, which was entirely covered by the keystone's supporting column. The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake. The interior of the temple is divided into a nave and a adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised above it and fronted by 13 steps. The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune, Triton, Arion and his dolphin, and other marine figures but these have been lost. The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications, although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688. Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate, but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria's governor Rashid Pasha. Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof.\nThe Temple of Venus\u2014also known as the Circular Temple or Nymphaeum\u2014was added under Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century but destroyed under Constantine, who raised a basilica in its place. Jessup considered it the \"gem of Baalbek\". It lies about from the southeast corner of the Temple of Bacchus. It was known in the 19th century as \"El Barbara\" or \"Barbarat el-Atikah\" (St Barbara's), having been used as a Greek Orthodox church into the 18th century.\nThe ancient walls of Heliopolis had a circumference of a little less than . Much of the extant fortifications around the complex date to the 13th century reconstruction undertaken by the Mamluk sultan Qalawun following the devastation of the earlier defenses by the Mongol army under Kitbuqa. This includes the great southeast tower. The earliest round of fortifications were two walls to the southwest of the Temples of Jupiter and Bacchus. The original southern gateway with two small towers was filled in and replaced by a new large tower flanked by curtains, probably under Buri or Zengi. Bahramshah replaced that era's southwest tower with one of his own in 1213 and built another in the northwest in 1224; the west tower was probably strengthened around the same time. An inscription dates the barbican-like strengthening of the southern entrance to around 1240. Qalawun relocated the two western curtains nearer to the western tower, which was rebuilt with great blocks of stone. The barbican was repaired and more turns added to its approach. From around 1300, no alterations were made to the fortifications apart from repairs such as Sultan Barkuk's restoration of the moat in preparation for Timur's arrival.\nMaterial from the ruins is incorporated into a ruined mosque north of downtown and probably also in the Qubbat Duris on the road to Damascus. In the 19th century, a \"shell-topped canopy\" from the ruins was used nearby as a mihrab, propped up to show locals the direction of Mecca for their daily prayers.\nUnder a white dome further towards town is the tomb of Khawla, daughter of Hussein and granddaughter of Ali, who died in Baalbek while Husayn's family was being transported as prisoners to Damascus.\nEcclesiastical history.\nHeliopolis (in Phoenicia; not to be confused with the Egyptian bishopric Heliopolis in Augustamnica) was a bishopric under Roman and Byzantine rule, but it disappeared due to the Islamic rule.\nIn 1701, Eastern Catholics (Byzantine Rite) established anew an Eparchy of Baalbek, which in 1964 was promoted to the present Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Baalbek.\nTitular see.\nIn the Latin Church, the Ancient diocese was only nominally restored (no later than 1876) as Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis (Latin) / Eliopoli (Curiate Italian), demoted in 1925 to Episcopal Titular bishopric, promoted back in 1932, with its name changed (avoiding Egyptian confusion) in 1933 to (non-Metropolitan) Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis in Phoenicia.\nThe title has not been assigned since 1965.

His newspaper \"Le tribun du peuple\" (\"The Tribune of the People\") was best known for its advocacy for the poor and calling for a popular revolt against the Directory, the government of France. He was a leading advocate for democracy and the abolition of private property. He made his own variant of Jacobinism (Robespierrism) which is called \"Neo-Jacobinism\". Besides the influence of Robespierrism on his thought, due to his proto-communism, his political views were more aligned with the ideology of the Enrag\u00e9s. He angered the authorities who were clamping down hard on their radical enemies. In spite of the efforts of his Jacobin friends to save him, Babeuf was executed for his lead role in the Conspiracy of the Equals.\nThe nickname \"Gracchus\" likened him to the Gracchi brothers, who served as tribunes of the people in ancient Rome. Although the terms \"anarchist\", \"communist\" and \"socialist\" were not largely used in Babeuf's lifetime, they have all been used by later scholars to describe his ideas. \"Communism\" was first used in English by John Goodwyn Barmby in a conversation with those he described as the \"disciples of Babeuf\". He has been called \"The First Revolutionary Communist.\"\nAbout his political philosophy, Babeuf wrote: \"Society must be made to operate in such a way that it eradicates once and for all the desire of a man to become richer, or wiser, or more powerful than others.\" In the \"Manifesto of the Equals,\" a piece of writing commissioned by Babeuf, Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal wrote that \"[the] French Revolution [was] nothing but a precursor of another revolution, one that will be greater, more solemn, and which will be the last.\"\nEarly life.\nBabeuf was born at St. Nicaise near the town of Saint-Quentin. His father, Claude Babeuf, had deserted the French Royal Army in 1738 for the Austrian Imperial Army, reportedly rising to the rank of major. Amnestied in 1755, he returned to France, but soon sank into poverty, and had to work as a casual labourer to support his family. The hardships endured by Babeuf during his early years contributed to the development of his political opinions. His father gave him a basic education, but until the outbreak of the Revolution, he was a domestic servant, and from 1785 occupied the office of (commissary of land records), assisting the nobles and priests in the assertion of their feudal rights over the peasants. Accused of abandoning the feudal aristocracy, he would later say that \"the sun of the French Revolution\" had brought him to view his \"mother, the feudal system\" as a \"hydra with a hundred heads.\"\nRevolutionary activities.\nBabeuf was working for a land surveyor at Roye when the Revolution began. His father had died in 1780, and he now had to provide for his wife and two children, as well as for his mother, brothers and sisters.\nHe was a prolific writer, and the signs of his future socialism are contained in a letter of 21 March 1787, one of a series mainly on literature and addressed to the secretary of the Academy of Arras. In 1789 he drew up the first article of the of the electors of the \"bailliage\" of Roye, demanding the abolition of feudal rights. From July to October 1789, he lived in Paris, superintending the publication of his first work: (\"National Cadastre or land register, Dedicated to the National Assembly, Year 1789 and the First One of French Liberty\"), which was written in 1789 and issued in 1790. The same year he published a pamphlet against feudal aids and the \"gabelle\" (salt tax), for which he was denounced and arrested, but provisionally released.\nPolitical writings and imprisonment.\nIn October, on his return to Roye, he founded the , a political journal that would have 40 issues. Babeuf used his journal to agitate for a progressive taxation system, and condemned the \"census suffrage\" planned for the 1791 elections to the Legislative Assembly in which citizen votes would be weighted by their social standing. Due to his political activities, he was arrested on 19 May 1790, but released in July before the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration, thanks to pressure exerted nationally by Jean-Paul Marat. In November Babeuf was elected a member of the municipality of Roye, but was expelled.\nIn March 1791, Babeuf was appointed commissioner to report on the national property () in the town, and in September 1792 was elected a member of the council-general of the of the Somme. A rivalry with the principal administrator and later deputy to the Convention, , forced Babeuf to transfer to the post of administrator of the district of Montdidier. There he was accused of fraud for having altered a name in a deed of transfer of national lands. The error was probably due to negligence; but, distrusting the impartiality of the judges of the Somme, he fled to Paris, and on 23 August 1793 was sentenced \"in contumaciam\" to twenty years' imprisonment. Meanwhile, he had been appointed secretary to the relief committee () of the Paris Commune.\nThe judges of Amiens pursued him with a warrant for his arrest, which took place in Brumaire of the year II (1793). The Court of Cassation quashed the sentence, through defect of form, and sent Babeuf for a new trial before the Aisne tribunal, which acquitted him on 18 July 1794, only days before the Thermidorian Reaction.\nBabeuf returned to Paris, and on 3 September 1794 published the first issue of his (\"Journal of the Freedom of the Press\"), whose title was changed on 5 October 1794 to (\"The Tribune of the People\"). The execution of Maximilien Robespierre on 28 July 1794 had ended the Reign of Terror and begun the White Terror. Babeuf \u2013 now styling himself \"Gracchus\" Babeuf, after the martyred Roman reformers the Gracchi brothers \u2013 defended the fallen Terror politicians with the stated goal of achieving equality \"in fact\" and not only \"by proclamation\". However about the Terror, he said \"I object to this particular aspect of their system.\" Babeuf attacked the leaders of the Thermidorian Reaction and, from a socialistic point of view, the economic outcome of the Revolution. He also argued for the inclusion of women into the political clubs.\nThis was an attitude which had few supporters, even in the Jacobin Club, and in October Babeuf was arrested and imprisoned at Arras. Here he was influenced by political prisoners, notably Philippe Buonarroti, , and Ren\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois Lebois, editor of the (\"Journal of Equality\") and afterwards of the (\"The Friend of the People\") papers of Leclerc which carried on the traditions of Jean-Paul Marat. Babeuf emerged from prison a confirmed advocate of revolution and convinced that his project, fully proclaimed to the world in Issue 33 of his , could come about only through the restoration of the Constitution of 1793. That constitution had been ratified by a national referendum by universal male suffrage but never implemented.\nIn February 1795, Babeuf was arrested again, and the was solemnly burnt in the by the , young men whose mission was to root out Jacobinism. Babeuf might have faded into obscurity like other agitators, but for the appalling economic conditions caused by the fall in the value of .\nConspiracy of the Equals.\nThe attempts of the Directory to deal with the economic crisis gave Babeuf his historical importance. The new government wanted to abolish the system which benefitted Paris at the expense of all France. To this goal, the government planned to abolish the sale of bread and meat at nominal prices, on 20 February 1796. The announcement caused widespread consternation. Workers and the large class of proletarians attracted to Paris by the system, as well as and government officials, whose incomes were paid in arbitrarily set by the government, felt threatened with starvation. The government yielded to the outcry, and tried to mitigate the problem by dividing people entitled to relief into classes, but this only increased alarm and discontent.\nThe universal misery gave point to Babeuf's virulent attacks on the existing order and gained him a hearing. He gained a small circle of followers known as the (\"Society of the Equals\"), soon merged with the rump of the Jacobin Club, who met at the Panth\u00e9on. In November 1795, police reported that Babeuf was openly preaching \"insurrection, revolt and the Constitution of 1793\". The group was influenced by Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal, the author of (\"The Manifesto of the Equals\") and a sympathiser of Babeuf.\nFor a time, the government left Babeuf alone but observed his activities. The Directory benefitted from the leftist agitation because it counteracted royalist movements for overthrowing the Directory. Most workers, even of extreme views, were repelled by Babeuf's bloodthirstiness; and police reported that his agitation increased support for the government. The Jacobin Club refused to admit Babeuf and Lebois, on the ground that they were \"throat-cutters\" ().\nHowever, the economic crisis increased Babeuf's influence. After Napoleon Bonaparte closed the club of the Panth\u00e9on on 27 February 1796, Babeuf increased his activity. In Vent\u00f4se and Germinal (late winter and early spring) under the pseudonym , Babeuf published the paper \"Scout of the People, or Defender of Twenty-Five Million Oppressed\" (), which was passed from group to group secretly in the streets of Paris.\nAt the same time, Issue 40 of Babeuf's caused immense sensation as it praised the authors of the September Massacres as \"deserving well of their country\" and declared that a more complete \"2 September\" was needed to destroy the government, which consisted of \"starvers, bloodsuckers, tyrants, hangmen, rogues and mountebanks\".\nDistress among all classes continued. In March, the Directory tried to replace by a new issue of and this raised hopes, but they were soon dashed. A rumour that national bankruptcy had been declared caused thousands of the lower class of workers to rally to Babeuf's ideas. On 4 April 1796, the government received a report that 500,000 Parisians needed relief. From 11 April, Paris was placarded with posters headed \"Analysis of Babeuf's Teaching\" () [\"sic\"]\", Tribun du Peuple\", which began with the sentence \"Nature has given to every man the right to the enjoyment of an equal share in all property\", and ended with a call to restore the Constitution of 1793.\nArrest and execution.\nBabeuf's song \"Dying of Hunger, Dying of Cold\" (), set to a popular tune, began to be sung in , with immense applause. Reports circulated that the disaffected troops of the French Revolutionary Army in the camp of Grenelle were ready to join an insurrection against the government. The had accumulated through its agents (notably ex-captain Georges Grisel, who was initiated into Babeuf's society) evidence of a conspiracy (later called the Conspiracy of Equals) for an armed uprising fixed for 22 Flor\u00e9al, year IV (11 May 1796), which involved Jacobins and leftists.\nThe Directory thought it time to react. On 10 May Babeuf, who had taken the pseudonym \"Tissot\", was arrested. Many of his associates were gathered by the police on order from Lazare Carnot: among them were Augustin Alexandre Darth\u00e9 and Philippe Buonarroti, the ex-members of the National Convention, Robert Lindet, Jean-Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Amar, Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier and Jean-Baptiste Drouet, famous as the postmaster of Sainte-Menehould who had arrested Louis XVI during the latter's Flight to Varennes, and now a member of the Directory's Council of Five Hundred. The government crackdown was extremely successful. The last issue of the appeared on 24 April, although Ren\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois Lebois in the tried to incite the soldiers to revolt, and for a while there were rumours of a military uprising. \nBabeuf and his accomplices were to be tried at the newly created high court at Vend\u00f4me. When the prisoners were removed from Paris on 10 and 11 Fructidor (27 August and 28 August 1796), there were tentative efforts at a riot hoping to rescue the prisoners, but these were easily suppressed. On 7 September 1796, 500 or 600 Jacobins tried to rouse the soldiers at Grenelle but also failed. The trial was held at Vend\u00f4me beginning on 20 February 1797. Although several people were involved in the conspiracy, the government depicted Babeuf as the leader. On 7 Prairial (26 May 1797) Babeuf and Darth\u00e9 were condemned to death; some of the prisoners, including Buonarroti, were deported; the rest, including Vadier and his fellow-conventionals, were acquitted. Drouet managed to escape, according to Paul Barras, with the connivance of the Directory. Babeuf and Darth\u00e9 were guillotined the next day at Vend\u00f4me, 8 Prairial (27 May 1797), without appeal. Babeuf's body was transported and buried in a mass grave in the Vend\u00f4me's old cemetery of the Grand Faubourg, in Loir-et-Cher.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAttribution"}

He served as Rector of Cockfield, Suffolk. He was a cousin of Cardale Babington.\nLife.\nHe was born at Rothley Temple, in Leicestershire, the only son of Matthew Drake Babington. He was a scion of the Babington family. He was first educated by his father, and then studied under Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, the orientalist and archaeologist. In 1839, he followed his cousin, Cardale, to St John's College, Cambridge and graduated in 1843, seventh in the first class of the classical tripos and a \"senior optime\". In 1845 he obtained the Hulsean Prize for his essay \"The Influence of Christianity in promoting the Abolition of Slavery in Europe\". In 1846, he was elected to a fellowship and took orders. He proceeded to the degree of M.A. in 1846 and D.D. in 1879. From 1848 to 1861, he was vicar of Horningsea, near Cambridge, and from 1866 to his death he was vicar of Cockfield in Suffolk. From 1865 to 1880, he held the Disney professorship of archaeology at Cambridge. In his lectures, illustrated from his own collections of coins and vases, he dealt chiefly with Greek and Ancient Roman pottery and numismatics.\nBabington wrote on a variety of subjects. His early familiarity with country life gave him a taste for natural history, especially botany and ornithology. He was also an authority on conchology. He collected on field trips along with many others including Edward Byles Cowell. He was among the few to record the endangered eskimo curlew in England. He was the author of the appendices on botany (in part) and ornithology in Potter's \"History and Antiquities of Charnwood Forest\" (1842). In 1853, he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society. The lichen species \"Sticta babingtonii\" is named after him.\nHis family was connected with that of the Macaulays and he wrote \"Mr Macaulay's Character of the Clergy\" (1849), a defence of the clergy of the 17th Century, which received the approval of Gladstone. He also brought out the \"editio princeps\" of the speeches of Hypereides \"Against Demosthenes\" (1850), \"On Behalf of Lycophron and Euxenippus\" (1853) and his \"Funeral Oration\" (1858). It was by his edition of these speeches from the papyri discovered at Thebes (Egypt) in 1847 and 1856 that Babington's fame as a Greek scholar was made.\nIn 1855, he published an edition of \"Benefizio della Morte di Cristo\", a remarkable book of the Reformation period, attributed to Paleario, of which nearly all the copies had been destroyed by the Inquisition.

Such professionals are granted certain responsibilities by statute, such as the ability to certify an organization's financial statements, and may be held liable for professional misconduct. Non-qualified accountants may be employed by a qualified accountant, or may work independently without statutory privileges and obligations.\nCahan &amp; Sun (2015) used archival study to find out that accountants' personal characteristics may exert a very significant impact during the audit process and further influence audit fees and audit quality. Practitioners have been portrayed in popular culture by the stereotype of the humorless, introspective bean-counter. It has been suggested that the stereotype has an influence on those attracted to the profession with many new entrants underestimating the importance of communication skills and overestimating the importance of numeracy in the role.\nAn accountant may either be hired for a firm that requires accounting services on a continuous basis, or may belong to an accounting firm that provides accounting consulting services to other firms. The Big Four auditors are the largest employers of accountants worldwide. However, most accountants are employed in commerce, industry, and the public sector. \nCommonwealth of Nations.\nIn the Commonwealth of Nations, which include the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong pre-1997, and several other states, commonly recognised accounting qualifications are Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA), Chartered Accountant (CA or ACA), Certified Management Accountant (Institute of Certified Management Accountants) (CMA), Chartered Management Accountant (ACMA) and International Accountant (AAIA). Other qualifications in particular countries include Certified Public Accountant (CPA \u2013 Ireland and CPA \u2013 Hong Kong), Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA \u2013 Canada), Certified Management Accountant (Institute of Certified Management Accountants|CMA \u2013 Australia) (CMA \u2013 Sri Lanka), Certified Practising Accountant (CPA \u2013 Australia) and members of the Institute of Public Accountants (Australia), and Certified Public Practising Accountant (CPPA \u2013 New Zealand).\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) received its Royal Charter in 1854 and is the world's first professional body of accountants.\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland.\nUnlike a 'Chartered Accountant', the title 'accountant' does not require a specific qualification or licence in the UK, meaning anyone can call themselves an 'accountant'. HMRC's research suggests that one third of practising accountants do not belong to any professional body.\nExcepting the Association of Certified Public Accountants, each of the above bodies admits members only after passing examinations and undergoing a period of relevant work experience. Once admitted, members are expected to comply with ethical guidelines and gain appropriate professional experience.\nChartered, Chartered Certified, Chartered Public Finance, and International Accountants engaging in practice (i.e. selling services to the public rather than acting as an employee) must gain a \"practising certificate\" by satisfying a minimum period of post-qualifying experience and complying with wider obligations including adequate professional indemnity insurance, submitting annual compliance reports and agreeing to undergoing regular inspection.\nThe ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI, ACCA and AAPA are five Recognised Supervisory Bodies (RSB) in the UK. A member of one of them may also become a \"Statutory Auditor\" in accordance with the Companies Act, providing they can demonstrate the necessary professional ability in that area and submit to regular inspection. It is illegal for any individual or firm that is not a Statutory Auditor to perform a company audit.\nThe ICAEW, ICAS, ICAI, ACCA, AIA and CIPFA are six recognised qualifying bodies statutory (RQB) in the UK. A member of one of them may also become a \"Statutory Auditor\" in accordance with the Companies Act, providing they are a member of one of the five Recognised Supervisory Bodies RSB mentioned above.\nAll six RQBs are listed under EU mutual recognition directives to practise in 27 EU member states and individually entered into agreement with the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA).\nFurther restrictions apply to accountants who carry out insolvency work.\nIn addition to the bodies above, technical qualifications are offered by the Association of Accounting Technicians, ACCA and AIA, which are respectively called AAT Technician, CAT (Certified Accounting Technician) and IAT (International Accounting Technician).\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, licensed accountants are Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), and in certain states, Public Accountants (PAs). Unlicensed accountants may be Certified Internal Auditors (CIAs) and Certified Management Accountants (CMAs). The difference between these certifications is primarily the legal status and the types of services provided, although individuals may earn more than one certification. Additionally, much accounting work is performed by uncertified individuals, who may be working under the supervision of a certified accountant. As noted above, the majority of accountants work in the private sector or may offer their services without the need for certification.\nThe training time required for accountancy certification in the US requires specific guidelines:\nA CPA is licensed by a state to provide auditing services to the public. Many CPA firms also offer accounting, tax, litigation support, and other financial advisory services. The requirements for receiving the CPA license vary from state to state, although the passage of the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination is required by all states. This examination is designed and graded by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).\nA PA (sometimes referred to as LPA\u2014Licensed Public Accountant) is licensed by the state to practice accountancy to the same extent as are CPAs, although in some states PAs are not permitted to perform audits or reviews (notably Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, &amp; South Carolina). A PA's ability to practice out of state is very limited due to most states having phased out the PA designation. While most states no longer accept new PA license applicants, four states still accept PA applicants for practice privileges within the state. As with the CPA, the requirements for receiving the PA license vary from state to state. Most states require a passage of either two or three (out of four) sections of the CPA exam or passage of the Comprehensive Examination for Accreditation in Accounting which is administered and graded by the Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT).\nA certified internal auditor (CIA) is granted a certificate from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), provided that the candidate has passed a four-part examination. One of the four parts is waived if the candidate has already passed the CPA Exam. A CIA typically provides services directly to an employer rather than to the public.\nA person holding the Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) is granted the certificate by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), provided that the candidate has passed an examination of two parts and has met the practical experience requirement of the IMA. A CMA provides services directly to employers rather than to the public. A CMA can also provide services to the public, but to an extent much lesser than that of a CPA.\nAn Enrolled Agent (EA) is a federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Enrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS, unlimited rights of representation. The EA credential is recognized across all 50 U.S. states. Candidates must pass a three-part exam (called the Special Enrollment Examination) covering the subjects of individual tax, business tax, and client representation, or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in these areas.\nThe United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there are about one million persons employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.\nU.S. tax laws grant CPAs and EAs a form of accountant\u2013client privilege.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, there are three legally recognised local professional accounting bodies which all enjoy the same recognition and can be considered as \"qualified accountant\": the Institute of Public Accountants (IPA), CPA Australia (CPA) and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ). Other international bodies such as ACCA (The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) enjoy recognition for the purposes of supporting their members in their careers. For instance, ACCA has achieved recognition by the Tax Practitioner Board, as Tax and BAS agents, in 2010.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, a Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) must be a member of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (designatory letters CPA).\nUp to 2013, there were three nationally recognized accounting designations in Canada: Chartered Accountant (CA), Certified General Accountant (CGA), and Certified Management Accountants (CMA). The national CA and CGA bodies were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 and 1913 respectively, The national CMA organization was established under the Canada Corporations Act in 1920.\nIn January 2012, following eight months of member and stakeholder consultation, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), the Society of Management Accountants of Canada (CMA Canada) and Certified General Accountants of Canada (CGA-Canada) issued \"A Framework for Uniting the Canadian Accounting Profession\" under a new Canadian Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation. Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) was established by CICA and CMA Canada on January 1, 2013, under the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act, to support Canadian provincial accounting bodies that were unifying under the CPA banner. CGA-Canada integrated with CPA Canada on October 1, 2014, completing the unification of Canada's accounting profession at the national level.\nAll recognized national and provincial accounting bodies in Canada have now unified under the CPA banner. The Canadian CPA designation is held by more than 200,000 members in Canada and around the world.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, a certified public accountant must be a member of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (JICPA). It is the sole professional accountancy organization in Japan.\nIndia.\nChartered accountancy is offered in India by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), the second largest accounting body in the world. This Institute was established in 1949 under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 for the regulation of the profession of chartered accountants in India.\nThe ICAI set up the Accountancy Museum of India in 2009, the third museum of accounting in the world. It is located at ICAI's office in Noida.A Cost and Management Accountant is registered as a member under the Institute of Cost Accountants of India(ICMAI) previously known as (ICWAI) which is a statutory body constituted under the Cost and Works Accountants Act 1959 enacted by the Parliament of India, it is also the second largest Management Accountancy body in the world. The members of the Institute are widely recognized as Cost and Management Accountants (FCMA, ACMA).\nIndonesia.\nUnder Public Accountants Law ( UU 5/2011), the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Indonesia (IAPI) is the professional organization having the authority to issue CPA designation which is the statutory requirements for obtaining public accountant license from the government.\nPakistan.\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) offers chartered accountant studies in Pakistan. ICAP was established under The Chartered Accountants Ordinance, 1961 as a self-regulatory body.\nThe Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICMAP) offers accountant studies in Pakistan. ICMAP was established under The Cost and Management Accountants Act, 1966.\nPakistan Institute of Public Finance Accountants (PIPFA) is an autonomous body recognized mainly in the government sector and established under license from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan by the authority given under section 42 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984.\nThe body is co-sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan, the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan and the Auditor General of Pakistan.PIPFA has more than 5,000 members and a number of them are members of ICAP and ICMAP.\nThe institute was established to produce a second tier of accounting professionals in Pakistan\nBangladesh.\nChartered accountancy is governed in Bangladesh by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB).\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, there are two local accountancy bodies the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) and the New Zealand Association of Certified Public Accountants (NZACPA) the operating name of New Zealand Association of Accountants Inc (NZAA).\nTo audit public companies an individual must be a member of either the CAANZ or an otherwise gazetted body. Chartered Certified Accountant (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants or FCCA) qualification has also been gazetted under. An ACCA member can practice as long as they hold an ACCA public practice certificate (with audit qualification) in their country of origin.\nSingapore.\nIn Singapore, a public accountant must be a member of any professional accountancy body in Singapore. Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) is the sole local accountancy body, therefore the public accountant must be a member of the ISCA.\nSri Lanka.\nIn Sri Lanka, a chartered accountant must be a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (designatory letters ACA or FCA). It is the sole local accountancy body, therefore to audit public companies an individual must be a member of the ICASL. A Certified management account also must be a member of the Institute of Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (designatory letters ACMA or FCMA).\nAustria.\nIn Austria, the accountancy profession is regulated by the Bilanzbuchhaltungsgesetz 2006 (BibuG \u2013 Management Accountancy Law).\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, the accountancy industry is regulated by Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants(HKICPA) under the Professional Accountants Ordinance (Chapter 50, Laws of Hong Kong). The auditing industry for limited companies is regulated under the Companies Ordinance (Chapter 32, Laws of Hong Kong), and other ordinances such as the securities and futures ordinance, the listing rules, etc.\nHKICPA terminated all recognition of overshare bodies in 2005 for \"accreditation\" under professional accountants ordinance. In general, all British RQBs except for CIPFA were re-accredited. Please refer to HKICPA for latest recognition.\nPortugal.\nIn Portugal, there are two accountancy qualifications: the \"Contabilistas Certificados\" (CC), responsible for producing accounting and tax information, and the \"Revisor Oficial de Contas\" (ROC), more related to auditing practices. The CC certification is exclusively awarded by the professional organization \"Ordem dos Contabilistas Certificados\" (OCC), and the certification to become an auditor is awarded by another professional organization, the \"Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas\" (OROC). In general, accountants or auditors accredited by OTOC or OROC are individuals with university graduation diplomas in business management, economics, mathematics or law who, after further studies, applied for an exam and received the certification to be a CC or ROC. That certification is only received after a one-year (CC) or three-year (ROC) internship. Any citizen having a polytechnic degree as a bookkeeper is also entitled to apply for the exam and certification at the OCC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If the infant was young, this usually included wet-nursing (breast-feeding by a woman not the mother). Some baby farmers \"adopted\" children for lump-sum payments, while others cared for infants for periodic payments.\nDescription.\nThe use of foster care in 18th-century Britain by middle-class parents was described by Claire Tomalin in her biography of Jane Austen, who was fostered in the 1760s in this manner, as were all her siblings, from when they were a few months old until they were toddlers. Tomalin emphasizes the emotional distance this created.\nImportant historical context for the practice is the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which denied the poor the right to subsistence. In particular, single mothers were then forced to work in prison-like workhouses.\nIn late-Victorian Britain (and, less commonly, in Australia and the United States), baby farming was the practice of accepting custody of an infant or child in exchange for payment. Though baby farmers were paid in the understanding that care would be provided, the term \"baby farmer\" was used as an insult, and improper treatment was usually implied. Illegitimacy and its attendant social stigma were usually the impetus for a mother's decision to put her children \"out to nurse\" with a baby farmer, but baby farming also encompassed foster care and adoption in the period before they were regulated by British law in the mid 19th century. Wealthier women would also put their infants out to be cared for in the homes of villagers.\nParticularly in the case of lump-sum adoptions, it was more profitable for the baby farmer if the infant or child she adopted died, since the small payment could not cover the care of the child for long. Some baby farmers adopted numerous children and then neglected them or murdered them outright (see infanticide). Several baby farmers were tried for murder, manslaughter, or criminal neglect and were hanged. Margaret Waters (executed 1870) and Amelia Dyer (executed 1896) were two infamous British baby farmers, as were Amelia Sach and Annie Walters (executed 1903). The last baby farmer to be executed in Britain was Rhoda Willis, who was hanged in Wales in 1907.\nThe only woman to be executed in New Zealand, Minnie Dean, was a baby farmer, although in 1926, a male baby farmer, Daniel Cooper, was executed for the death of his pregnant first wife and two subsequent infants. In Australia, baby-farmer Frances Knorr was executed for infanticide in 1894. Although John and Sarah Makin were also convicted of infanticide, only John Makin had been executed a year earlier (1893) in Sydney for this crime.\nIn Scandinavia there was a euphemism for this activity: \"\u00e4nglamakerska\" (Swedish, including Hilda Nilsson) and \"englemagerske\" (Danish, including Dagmar Overby), both literally meaning a \"(female) angel maker\".\nDecline.\nAn undercover investigation of baby-farming, reported in 1870 in a letter to \"The Times\", concluded that \"My conviction is that children are murdered in scores by these women, that adoption is only a fine phrase for slow or sudden death\".\nSpurred by a series of articles that appeared in the \"British Medical Journal\" in 1867, the Parliament of the United Kingdom began to regulate baby farming in 1872 with the passage of the Infant Life Protection Act 1872.\nLondon coroner Athelstan Braxton Hicks gave evidence in 1896 on the dangers of baby-farming to the Select Committee on Infant Life Protection Bill. One case that he cited was that of Mrs. Arnold, who had been \"sweating\" infants legally by doing so one at a time. At another inquest, the jury were of the \"opinion that there has been gross neglect in the case\" but were unable to allocate responsibility. They added the rider that \"The jury are strongly of opinion that further legislation in what are usually known as baby farming cases is greatly needed, and particularly that the required legislation should extend to the care of one infant only, and that the age of the infant should not be limited to one year, but rather to five years and that it should be an offence for any person undertaking the care of such infant to sub farm it.\"\nThe Infant Life Protection Act 1897 finally empowered local authorities to control the registration of nurses responsible for more than one infant under the age of five for a period longer than 48 hours. \nA series of acts passed over the next seventy years, including the Children Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 67), under which \"no infant could be kept in a home that was so unfit and so overcrowded as to endanger its health, and no infant could be kept by an unfit nurse who threatened, by neglect or abuse, its proper care and maintenance.\"\nThe Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act 1939 gradually placed adoption and foster care under the protection and regulation of the state.\nPostwar Britain.\nIn the 1960s and 70s, thousands of West African children were privately fostered by white families in the UK in a phenomenon known as 'farming'. The biological parents were usually students in the UK who also had a job. They placed ads in the newspapers looking for foster families to care for their children.\nKnown baby farmers with criminal convictions.\n\"The following is a list of baby farmers with criminal convictions associated with their operations, categorized by country and Number of Victims:\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58221", "revid": "12608568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58221", "title": "United States Secret Service", "text": "U.S. federal law enforcement agency\nThe United States Secret Service (USSS or Secret Service) is a federal law enforcement agency under the Department of Homeland Security tasked with conducting criminal investigations and providing protection to American political leaders, their families, and visiting heads of state or government. The Secret Service was, until 2003, part of the Department of the Treasury, due to their initial mandate of combating counterfeiting of U.S. currency. The agency has protected U.S. presidents and presidential candidates since 1901.\nPrimary missions.\nThe Secret Service is mandated by Congress with two distinct and critical national security missions: protecting the nation's leaders and safeguarding the financial and critical infrastructure of the United States.\nProtective mission.\nThe Secret Service is tasked with ensuring the safety of the president, the vice president, the president-elect, the vice president-elect, and their immediate families; former presidents, their spouses and their children under the age of 16; those in the presidential line of succession, major presidential and vice-presidential candidates and their spouses; and visiting foreign heads of state and heads of government. By custom, it also provides protection to the secretary of the treasury and secretary of homeland security, as well as other people as directed by the president (usually the White House chief of staff and national security advisor, among others). Former Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle told the congressional oversight committee that as of July 22, 2024 the secret service has a total of 36 protectees. By federal statute, the president and vice president may not refuse this protection. The Secret Service also provides physical security for the White House Complex; the neighboring Treasury Department building; the vice president's residence; the principal private residences of the president, vice president and former presidents; and all foreign diplomatic missions in Washington, D.C. The protective mission includes protective operations to coordinate manpower and logistics with state and local law enforcement in the US, protective advances to conduct site and venue assessments for protectees, and protective intelligence to investigate all manners of threats made against protectees. The Secret Service is the lead agency in charge of the planning, coordination, and implementation of security operations for events designated as National Special Security Events (NSSE). As part of the service's mission of preventing an incident before it occurs, the agency relies on advance work and threat assessments developed by its Intelligence Division to identify potential risks to protectees.\nInvestigative mission.\nThe Secret Service is tasked with safeguarding the payment and financial systems of the United States from a wide range of financial and cyber-based crimes. Financial investigations include counterfeit U.S. currency, bank and financial institution fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, illicit financing operations, and major conspiracies. Cyber investigations include cybercrime, network intrusions, identity theft, access device fraud, credit card fraud, and intellectual property crimes. The Secret Service is also a member of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) which investigates and combats terrorism on a national and international scale. Also, the Secret Service investigates missing and exploited children and is a partner of the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC).\nThe Secret Service's initial responsibility was to investigate the counterfeiting of U.S. currency, which was rampant following the American Civil War. The agency then evolved into the United States' first domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Many of the agency's missions were later taken over by subsequent agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), and IRS Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI).\nThe Secret Service is also tasked with investigating reports of the existence of specimens of the extremely rare 1933 double eagle gold coin, as only a single example of the thirteen known survivors from this mintage year is authorized to be owned or sold.\nDual objective.\nThe Secret Service combines the two responsibilities into a dual objective. The two core missions of protection and investigation synergize with each other, providing benefits to special agents during the course of their careers. Skills developed during the course of investigations which are also used in an agent's protective duties include but are not limited to: \nProtection of the nation's highest elected leaders and other government officials is one of the primary missions of the Secret Service. After the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley, Congress also directed the Secret Service to protect the president of the United States. The Secret Service investigates thousands of incidents each year of individuals threatening the president of the United States.\nThe Secret Service is authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3056(a) to protect:\nIn addition to the above, the Secret Service can also protect other individuals by executive order of the president. Under Presidential Policy Directive 22, \"National Special Security Events\", the Secret Service is the lead agency for the design and implementation of operational security plans for events designated an NSSE by the secretary of homeland security.\nThere have been changes to the protection of former presidents over time. Under the original Former Presidents Act, former presidents and their spouses were entitled to lifetime protection, subject to limited exceptions. In 1994, this was amended to reduce the protection period to 10 years after a former president left office, starting with presidents assuming the role after January 1, 1997. On January 10, 2013, President Barack Obama signed legislation reversing this limit and reinstating lifetime protection to all former presidents. This change impacted Presidents Obama and G.W. Bush, as well as all future presidents.\nProtection of government officials is not solely the responsibility of the Secret Service, with many other agencies, such as the United States Capitol Police, Supreme Court Police and Diplomatic Security Service, providing personal protective services to domestic and foreign officials. However, while these agencies are nominally responsible for services to other officers of the United States and senior dignitaries, the Secret Service provides protective services at the highest-level \u2013 i.e. for heads of state and heads of government.\nThe Secret Service's other primary mission is investigative; to protect the payment and financial systems of the United States from a wide range of financial and electronic-based crimes including counterfeit U.S. currency, bank and financial institution fraud, illicit financing operations, cybercrime, identity theft, intellectual property crimes, and any other violations that may affect the United States economy and financial systems. The agency's key focus is on large, high-dollar economic impact cases involving organized criminal groups. Financial criminals include embezzling bank employees, armed robbers at automatic teller machines, heroin traffickers, and criminal organizations that commit bank fraud on a global scale.\nThe USSS plays a leading role in facilitating relationships between other law enforcement entities, the private sector, and academia. The service maintains the Electronic Crimes Task Forces, which focus on identifying and locating international cyber criminals connected to cyber intrusions, bank fraud, data breaches, and other computer-related crimes. Additionally, the Secret Service runs the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI), which provides law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges with cyber training and information to combat cybercrime.\nIn the face of budget pressure, hiring challenges and some high-profile lapses in its protective service role in 2014, the Brookings Institution and some members of Congress are asking whether the agency's focus should shift more to the protective mission, leaving more of its original mission to other agencies.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nFollowing the Civil War, counterfeiting of U.S. currency was a problem. Abraham Lincoln established a commission to make recommendations to remedy the problem. According to a Clinton White House archive, the day that Abraham Lincoln signed the approval of starting the Secret Service, Lincoln was shot. The Secret Service was later established on July 5, 1865, in Washington, D.C., Chief William P. Wood was sworn in by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. It was commissioned in Washington, D.C., as the \"Secret Service Division\" of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the U.S. Post Office Department's Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (originally created by the first postmaster general Benjamin Franklin in 1772 as the position of surveyor and becoming an agency in 1830, now known as the United States Postal Inspection Service since 1954), United States Customs Service (formed July 31, 1789), the United States Marshals Service (formed September 24, 1789) and the United States Park Police (originally formed in 1791 as the Park Watchman by George Washington &amp; becoming the Park Police on December 14, 1919). In 1867 Secret Service responsibilities were broadened to include \"detecting persons perpetrating frauds against the government\" with them investigating the Ku Klux Klan, illegal distillers, smugglers, mail theft and land fraud. In 1870 Secret Service headquarters was moved to New York City but was returned to Washington D.C. four years later in 1874, where it remains to this day.\n20th century.\nAfter the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection. In 1902, William Craig became the first Secret Service agent to die while on duty, in a road accident while riding in the presidential carriage.\nThe Secret Service was the first U.S. domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Domestic intelligence collection and counterintelligence responsibilities were later vested in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nTaft Mexican Summit (1909).\nIn 1909, President William H. Taft agreed to meet with Mexican president Porfirio D\u00edaz in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. The historic summit resulted in serious assassination threats and other security concerns for the nascent Secret Service, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, BOI agents, U.S. Marshals, and an additional 250-man private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, were all called in by Chief John Wilkie to provide added security. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. The man was captured and disarmed only a few feet from D\u00edaz and Taft.\n1920s.\nThe first unofficial female special agent was Florence Bolan. She joined the service in 1917. In 1924, Bolan was promoted to operative (the title preceding special agent) where she performed duties, such as searching female prisoners and engaging in occasional fieldwork.\n1940s.\nThe Secret Service assisted in arresting Japanese American leaders and in the Japanese American internment during World War II.\n1950s.\nIn 1950, President Harry S. Truman was residing in Blair House while the White House, across the street, was undergoing renovations. On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, approached Blair House with the intent to assassinate President Truman. Collazo and Torresola opened fire on Private Leslie Coffelt and other White House Police officers. Though mortally wounded by three shots from a 9 mm German Luger to his chest and abdomen, Private Coffelt returned fire, killing Torresola with a single shot to his head. Collazo was also shot, but survived his injuries and served 29 years in prison before returning to Puerto Rico in late 1979. Coffelt is the only member of the Secret Service killed while protecting a US president against an assassination attempt (Special Agent Tim McCarthy stepped in front of President Ronald Reagan during the assassination attempt of March 30, 1981, and took a bullet to the chest but made a full recovery).\n1960s.\nIn 1968, as a result of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, Congress authorized protection of major presidential and vice presidential candidates and nominees. In 1965 and 1968, Congress also authorized lifetime protection of the spouses of deceased presidents unless they remarry and of the children of former presidents until age 16.\n1970s.\nIn 1970, Phyllis Shantz became the first female officer sworn into the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, then called the Executive Protective Service. In 1971, the first five official female Special Agents were sworn in - Laurie Anderson, Sue Baker, Kathryn Clark, Holly Hufschmidt, and Phyllis Shantz.\n1980s.\nIn 1984, the US Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which extended the Secret Service's jurisdiction over credit card fraud and computer fraud.\n1990s.\nIn 1990, the Secret Service initiated Operation Sundevil, which they originally intended as a sting against malicious hackers, allegedly responsible for disrupting telephone services across the entire United States. The operation, which was later described by Bruce Sterling in his book \"The Hacker Crackdown\", affected a great number of people unrelated to hacking, and led to no convictions. The Secret Service, however, was sued and required to pay damages. On March 1, 1990, the Secret Service served a search warrant on Steve Jackson Games, a small company in Austin, Texas, seizing three computers and over 300 floppy disks. In the subsequent lawsuit, the judge reprimanded the Secret Service, calling their warrant preparation \"sloppy.\"\nIn 1994 and 1995, it ran an undercover sting called Operation Cybersnare. The Secret Service has concurrent jurisdiction with the FBI over certain violations of federal computer crime laws. They have created 24 Electronic Crimes Task Forces (ECTFs) across the United States. These task forces are partnerships between the service, federal/state and local law enforcement, the private sector and academia aimed at combating technology-based crimes.\nIn 1998, President Bill Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 62, which established National Special Security Events (NSSE). That directive made the Secret Service responsible for security at designated events. In 1999, the United States Secret Service Memorial Building was dedicated in DC, granting the agency its first headquarters. Prior to this, the agency's different departments were based in office space around the DC area. The General Services Administration acquired the United States Secret Service Memorial Building's adjoining property, the Webster School, for the Secret Service.\n2000s.\nSeptember 11 attacks.\nThe New York City Field office was located at 7 World Trade Center. Immediately after the World Trade Center was attacked as part of the September 11 attacks, Special Agents and other New York Field office employees were among the first to respond with first aid. 67 Special Agents in New York City, at and near the New York Field Office, helped to set up triage areas and evacuate the towers. One Secret Service employee, Master Special Officer Craig Miller, died during the rescue efforts. On August 20, 2002, Director Brian L. Stafford awarded the Director's Valor Award to employees who assisted in the rescue attempts.\nDomestic expansion.\nEffective March 1, 2003, the Secret Service transferred from the Treasury to the newly established Department of Homeland Security.\nThe USA Patriot Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001, mandated the Secret Service to establish a nationwide network of ECTFs in addition to the one already active in New York. As such, this mandate expanded on the agency's first ECTF\u2014the New York Electronic Crimes Task Force, formed in 1995\u2014which brought together federal, state and local law enforcement, prosecutors, private-industry companies, and academia. These bodies collectively provide necessary support and resources to field investigations that meet any one of the following criteria: significant economic or community impact; participation of organized criminal groups involving multiple districts or transnational organizations; or use of schemes involving new technology.\nThe network prioritizes investigations that meet the following criteria:\nInvestigations conducted by ECTFs include crimes such as computer generated counterfeit currency; bank fraud; virus and worm proliferation; access device fraud; telecommunications fraud; Internet threats; computer system intrusions and cyberattacks; phishing/spoofing; assistance with Internet-related child pornography and exploitation; and identity theft.\nInternational expansion.\nOn July 6, 2009, the U.S. Secret Service expanded its fight on cybercrime by creating the first European Electronic Crime Task Force, based on the successful U.S. domestic model, through a memorandum of understanding with Italian police and postal officials. Over a year later, on August 9, 2010, the agency expanded its European involvement by creating its second overseas ECTF in the United Kingdom.\nBoth task forces are said to concentrate on a wide range of \"computer-based criminal activity,\" including:\n2010s.\nIn September 2014, the United States Secret Service came under criticism following two high-profile incidents involving intruders at the White House. One such intruder entered the East Room of the White House through an unlocked door. In 2017, it was reported that the United States Secret Service is able to decode printer tracking dots.\n2020s.\nOn April 15, 2020, the ICE Homeland Security Investigations unit launched \"Operation Stolen Promise\" that targets COVID-19 related fraud. The operation conscripted resources from various branches of law enforcement and the government, including the U.S. Secret Service. About $2 trillion in the relief package known as the CARES Act were earmarked by law in March 2020, bringing unemployment benefits and loans to millions of Americans. However, as Secret Service spokesmen subsequently pointed out, the Act also opened up opportunities for criminals to fraudulently apply for aid. By the end of 2021, nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secret Service had seized more than $1.2 billion in relief funds appropriated by fraudsters.\nOn June 1, 2020, during a peaceful protest outside Lafayette Square, the U.S. Secret Service acted contrary to an operational plan and began advancing seven minutes before U.S. Park Police gave any dispersal warnings. This early deployment increased tensions between law enforcement and the protesters. They faced resistance and used pepper spray in response to eggs and bottles being thrown. Attorney General William Barr spoke with the U.S. Park Police operational commander seven minutes before the Secret Service began advancing, and again later, before President Trump visited a nearby Parish House to pose for a photo while holding a Bible. The U.S. Secret Service later apologized but Joseph Cuffari, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General, prevented career officials from investigating the role U.S. Secret Service played in the Trump administration\u2019s controversial use of force to remove protesters that day.\nIn August 2020, a Secret Service officer shot a man once in the chest at the corner of 17th Street and Pennsylvania during one of then-President Trump\u2019s press conferences. The president was evacuated but returned later and told the White House press corps that the man had a gun. However, according to court documents, the man was actually holding a comb, told the officers he was armed and took a shooting stance before being shot. The man is schizophrenic and was charged with simple assault of a law enforcement officer.\nA day before the January 6 United States Capitol attack in 2021, the Secret Service warned Capitol Police of threats of violence that Capitol Police officers could face violence at the hands of supporters of President Donald Trump. On January 6, Secret Service agents provided security in and around the United States Capitol, as well as evacuating Vice President Mike Pence during the riot. Testimony in Congress indicates Pence was concerned his security detail would remove him from the Capitol, stopping him from completing his duty to oversee the final count of electoral college votes. At the center of the controversy surrounding the Secret Service and January 6 investigations is Anthony M. Ornato, who had been the head of Trump's security detail, but took the unprecedented step of leaving the Secret Service to become deputy White House chief of staff and becoming a \"key part of Trump\u2019s effort to get reelected.\"\nThe Secret Service assisted in the seizure of hacker forum RaidForums in 2022.\nIn April 2022, four Secret Service agents, one of whom was assigned to First Lady Jill Biden, were placed on leave after accepting lavish gifts, rent free apartments, and other bribes from two men ultimately convicted of impersonating federal officers.\nOn August 24, 2022, President Joe Biden named Kimberly Cheatle, the senior director of global security at PepsiCo, as the agency's new director. Cheatle was in the Secret Service for 27 years and became the first woman to serve as assistant director of protective operations, a department tasked with protecting the president and dignitaries.&lt;ref name=\"Viser_8/24/2022\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn November 12, 2023, a Secret Service agent guarding Naomi Biden fired shots at three people seen breaking into an unoccupied government vehicle in Georgetown.\nOn July 13, 2024, Secret Service agents protecting former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in advance of his presumptive Republican candidacy in the 2024 United States presidential election, shot and killed Thomas Matthew Crooks during an assassination attempt on Trump. Crooks, armed with an AR-15\u2013style rifle, had shot at Trump from an elevated position near the venue. Trump was injured in his right ear and quickly rushed to hospital, while Crooks was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. One other attendee, 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, was also killed by Crooks and several others in attendance were injured. \nOn July 23, 2024, Kimberly Cheatle resigned from her position as the director of the Secret Service just one day after she testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability about the assassination attempt and acknowledged it was \"the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades\".\nAttacks on presidents.\nSince the 1960s, presidents John F. Kennedy (killed), Gerald Ford (twice attacked, but uninjured), Ronald Reagan (seriously wounded), and Donald Trump (injured) have been attacked while appearing in public. Agents on scene, though not injured, during attacks on presidents include William Greer and Roy Kellerman. One of the agents was Robert DeProspero, the Special Agent In Charge (SAIC) of Reagan's Presidential Protective Division (PPD) from January 1982 to April 1985. DeProspero was deputy to Jerry Parr, the SAIC of PPD during the Reagan assassination attempt on March 30, 1981.\nThe Kennedy assassination spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, an agent protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was riding in the car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leaped from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped onto the back of the president's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the president and the first lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.\nRufus Youngblood was riding in the vice-presidential car. When the shots were fired, he vaulted over the front seat and threw his body over Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. That evening, Johnson called Secret Service Chief James J. Rowley and cited Youngblood's bravery. Youngblood would later recall some of this in his memoir, \"Twenty Years in the Secret Service\".\nThe period following the Kennedy assassination was the most difficult in the modern history of the agency. Press reports indicated that morale among the agents was \"low\" for months following the assassination. The agency overhauled its procedures in the wake of the Kennedy killing. Training, which until that time had been confined largely to \"on-the-job\" efforts, was systematized and regularized.\nThe Reagan assassination attempt also involved several Secret Service agents, particularly agent Tim McCarthy, who spread his stance to protect Reagan as six bullets were being fired by the would-be assassin, John Hinckley Jr. McCarthy survived a .22-caliber round in the abdomen. For his bravery, McCarthy received the NCAA Award of Valor in 1982. Jerry Parr, the agent who pushed President Reagan into the limousine, and made the critical decision to divert the presidential motorcade to George Washington University Hospital instead of returning to the White House, was also honored with U.S. Congress commendations for his actions that day.\nSignificant investigations.\nOne significant Secret Service investigation was the arrest and indictment of Max Ray Butler, co-founder of the Carders Market carding website. Butler was indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after his September 5, 2007 arrest, on wire fraud and identity theft charges. According to the indictment, Butler hacked into computers at financial institutions and credit card processing centers over the Internet and sold the tens of thousands of credit card numbers that he acquired in the process.\nOperation Firewall.\nIn October 2004, 28 suspects\u2014located across eight U.S. states and six countries\u2014were arrested on charges of identity theft, computer fraud, credit-card fraud, and conspiracy. Nearly 30 national and foreign field offices of the U.S. Secret Service, including the newly established national ECTFs, and countless local enforcement agencies from around the globe, were involved in this operation. Collectively, the arrested suspects trafficked in at least 1.7\u00a0million stolen credit card numbers, which amounted to $4.3\u00a0million of losses to financial institutions. However, authorities estimated that prevented loss to the industry was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The operation, which started in July 2003 and lasted for more than a year, led investigators to identify three cybercriminal groups: Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits.\nFrom the investigation, there was the arrest and indictment of Albert Gonzalez and 11 other individuals: three U.S. citizens, one from Estonia, three from Ukraine, two from the People's Republic of China, one from Belarus, and one known only by an online alias. They were arrested on August 5, 2008, for the theft and sale of more than 40\u00a0million credit and debit card numbers from major U.S. retailers, including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes &amp; Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21, and DSW. Gonzalez, the main organizer of the scheme, was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy for his leading role in the crime.\nPersonnel.\nAs of 2010, the service had over 6,500 employees: 3,200 Special Agents, 1,300 Uniformed Division Officers, and 2,000 technical and administrative employees. Special agents serve on protective details and investigate financial, cyber, and homeland security-related crimes.\nSpecial Agent.\nThe Secret Service's most familiar personnel are the plain-clothes investigators and personal protectors, who form almost half their total number. This special agent position is highly selective, with for example in 2011, the service accepting less than 1% of its 15,600 special agent applicants.\nAt a minimum, a prospective agent must be a U.S. citizen, possess a current valid driver's license, be in excellent health and physical condition, possess visual acuity no worse than 20/100 uncorrected or correctable to 20/20 in each eye, and be between age 21\u201337 at the time of appointment, but eligible veterans may apply past age 37. In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the \"Isabella v. Department of State\" court decision: OPM Letter.\nProspective agents must also qualify for a TS/SCI (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information) clearance, and undergo an extensive background investigation, to include in-depth interviews, drug screening, medical diagnosis, and full-scope polygraph examination.\nSpecial agents receive training in two locations, totaling approximately 31 weeks. The first phase, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) is conducted at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia, lasting approximately 13 weeks. The second phase, the Special Agent Training Course (SATC) is conducted at the Secret Service Academy, James J. Rowley Training Center (JJRTC), just outside Washington, D.C. in Laurel, Maryland, lasting approximately 18 weeks.\nA typical special agent career path, depending upon performance and promotions that affect individual assignments, begins with the first six to eight years on the job assigned to a field office. Applicants are directed to list their office location preference during the application process, and upon receiving a final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from. After their field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective assignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.\nSpecial agents are hired at the GL-07, GL-09, or GS-11 grade level, depending on individual qualifications and/or education. Agents are eligible for promotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to GS-13. The full performance grade level for a journeyman field agent is GS-13, which a GL-07, GL-09, or GS-11 agent may reach in as little as four, three, or two years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible for competitive promotion to supervisory positions, which encompasses the GS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. Higher ranks continue to use variations on the \"Special Agent\" title, as with several other Federal agencies with a plainclothes or investigatory role. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as rank-and-file field agents, will continue to advance the GS-13 step level, capping at GS-13 Step 10.\nSpecial agents also receive Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of premium overtime pay which provides them with an additional 25% bonus pay on top of their salary, as agents are required to work an average workweek of 50 hours as opposed to 40. As of 2025, an agent living in the Washington, DC area (DC, VA, MD) will earn an annual salary of $80,985 (GL-07), $90,317 (GL-09), $105,751 (GS-11), $126,751 (GS-12), $150,723 (GS-13), $178,110 (GS-14), and $195,200 (GS-15). Journeyman field agents at GS-13 Step 10 are also paid a salary of $195,200.\nDue to the nature of their work, Secret Service agents are regularly eligible for overtime pay in addition to LEAP, and are compensated up to $225,700 per year (Level II of the Executive Schedule).\nUniformed Division Officer.\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division is a security police similar to the U.S. Capitol Police or DHS Federal Protective Service, with \"police\" rather than \"agent\"-style ranks. It is in charge of protecting the physical White House grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C. area. Established in 1922 as the White House Police, this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force's responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.\nSecret Service Uniformed Division officers provide protection for the White House Complex, the vice president's residence, the main Treasury Building and Annex, and foreign diplomatic missions and embassies in the Washington, D.C., area. Additionally, Uniformed Division officers travel in support of presidential, vice presidential and foreign head of state government missions. Officers may, as their careers progress, be selected to participate in one of several specialized units, including the:\nWeapons and equipment.\nSince the agency's inception, a variety of weapons have been carried by its agents.\nAs a non-lethal option, Special Agents, Special Officers, and Uniformed Division Officers are armed with the ASP 16\" expandable baton, and Uniformed Division officers also carry pepper spray.\nAttire.\nSpecial agents and special officers of the Secret Service wear attire that is appropriate for their surroundings, in order to blend in as much as possible. In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but it can range from a tuxedo to casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically, Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication earpiece. Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.\nThe attire for Uniformed Division Officers includes standard police uniforms or utility uniforms and ballistic/identification vests for members of the counter-sniper team, Emergency Response Team (ERT), and canine officers. The shoulder patch of the Uniformed Division consists of the U.S. coat of arms on white or black, depending on the garment. Also, the shoulder patch is embroidered with \"U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division Police\" around the emblem.\nVehicles.\nWhen transporting the president in a motorcade, the Secret Service uses a fleet of custom-built armored Cadillac Limousines, the newest and largest version of which is known as \"The Beast\". Armored Chevrolet Suburbans are also used when logistics require such a vehicle or when a more low-profile appearance is required. For official movement, the limousine is affixed with U.S. and presidential flags and the presidential seal on the rear doors. For unofficial events, the vehicles are left sterile and unadorned.\nGovernment audits have criticized the Secret Service for a \"slow embrace of technology\", according to \"The New York Times\".\nField offices.\nThe Secret Service has agents assigned to 136 field offices and field agencies, and the headquarters in Washington, D.C. The service's offices are located in cities throughout the United States and the world. The offices in Lyon (France) and The Hague (Netherlands) are respectively responsible for liaison with the headquarters of Interpol and Europol, located in those cities.\nMisconduct.\nOn April 14, 2012, the U.S. Secret Service placed 11 agents on administrative leave as the agency investigated allegations that the men brought prostitutes to their hotel rooms in Cartagena, Colombia, while on assignment to protect President Obama and that a dispute ensued with one of the women over payment the following morning.\nAfter the incident was publicized, the Secret Service implemented new rules for its personnel. The rules prohibit personnel from visiting \"non-reputable establishments\" and from consuming alcohol less than ten hours before starting work. Additionally, they restrict who is allowed in hotel rooms.\nIn 2015, two inebriated senior Secret Service agents drove an official car into the White House complex and collided with a barrier. Chairperson of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that investigated the incident was Jason Chaffetz. In September 2015, it was revealed that 18 Secret Service employees or supervisors, including Assistant Director Ed Lowery, accessed an unsuccessful 2003 application by Chaffetz for employment with the agency and discussed leaking the information to the media in retaliation for Chaffetz' investigations of agency misconduct. The confidential personal information was later leaked to \"The Daily Beast\". Agency Director Joe Clancy apologized to Chaffetz and said that disciplinary action would be taken against those responsible.\nIn March 2017, a member of Vice President Mike Pence's detail was suspended after the agent was caught visiting a prostitute at a hotel in Maryland.\nIn July 2022, during President Biden's trip to the Middle East, a Secret Service agent was sent back to the United States from Israel after indiscriminately assaulting a woman who was walking in the street, next to a bar in Machane Yehuda. A Secret Service spokesman said in a statement that the agency was informed of the encounter, and the agent, who was working in Israel, was \"briefly detained and questioned by Israeli police, who released him without charges.\"\nOn July 15, 2022, \"The Intercept\" reported that a letter from the Department of Homeland Security revealed the Secret Service had erased text messages from the day before and day of the January 6 insurrection, shortly after those messages were requested by oversight officials investigating the agency\u2019s response to the US Capitol riots. The agency claimed that the messages \u201cwere erased as part of a device-replacement program,\u201d although the agency is bound by regulation to preserve all records of its activity (including text messages, emails, and other electronic communications). According to \"Politico\" on July 19, 2022, as new material becomes available to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, \"a potential second round of hearings gets slated for the fall [of 2022]\". Such related new materials may include further details regarding \u201cthe potential unauthorized deletion\u201d of text messages, particularly those from around January 5 and 6, 2021, by the Secret Service, then headed by Director James M. Murray, an appointee by then-President Trump in 2019. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general has initiated a criminal investigation into the erasure of text messages exchanged by Secret Service agents relating to the January 6 Capitol breach.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This speed was achieved in testing on October 7\u20138, and the results were then presented at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC11) in November 2011.\nThe Fujitsu FR, FR-V and ARM architecture microprocessors are widely used, additionally in ASICs and Application-specific standard products (ASSP) like the Milbeaut with customer variants named Nikon Expeed. They were acquired by Spansion in 2013.\nAdvertising.\nThe old slogan \"The possibilities are infinite\" can be found below the company's logo on major advertisements and ties in with the small logo above the letters J and I of the word Fujitsu. This smaller logo represents the symbol for infinity. As of April 2010, Fujitsu is in the process of rolling out a new slogan focused on entering into partnerships with its customers and retiring the \"possibilities are infinite\" tagline. The new slogan is \"shaping tomorrow with you\".\nHorizon scandal.\nFujitsu designed, developed and operated the Horizon IT system which was at the centre of the legal dispute between the UK Post Office and its sub-postmasters. The case, still unsettled, found that the IT system was unreliable and that faults in the system caused discrepancies in branch accounts which were not the responsibility of the postmasters themselves. Mr Justice Fraser, the judge hearing the case, noted that Fujitsu had given \"wholly unsatisfactory evidence\" and there had been a \"lack of accuracy on the part of Fujitsu witnesses in their evidence\". Following his concerns, Fraser sent a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.\nFujitsu was also found to have pressured the UK government to sign off the controversial and faulty IT system that, as a result of its faulty operation, resulted in numerous UK postmasters and sub-postmasters being accused falsely, and subsequently convicted of theft, false accounting and fraud, with consequences including imprisonment and monetary reparations. Of the hundreds of people affected, as of January 2024 only around 1 in 9 of those convicted have had their convictions overturned, whereas others have died due to the length of time that has elapsed, or have taken their own lives in the wake of their wrongful convictions. Although there has been some media coverage of organised legal appeals by groups of those affected, the matter has recently gained enhanced attention by mainstream media and the wider public as a whole, and is currently being acted upon by authorities in an attempt to accelerate and automate the clearing of the names of all those wrongly convicted, who until now were required to launch their own legal appeals in order to have their names cleared.\nEnvironmental record.\nFujitsu reports that all its notebook and tablet PCs released globally comply with the latest Energy Star standard.\nGreenpeace's Cool IT Leaderboard of April 2013 \"examines how IT companies use their considerable influence to change government policies that will drive clean energy deployment\" and ranks Fujitsu 4th out of 21 leading manufacturers, on the strength of \"developed case study data of its solutions with fairly transparent methodology, and is the leading company in terms of establishing ambitious and detailed goals for future carbon savings from its IT solutions.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The expulsions occurred in multiple waves: After the siege of Jerusalem in 597 BCE, around 7,000 individuals were exiled to Mesopotamia. Further expulsions followed the destruction of Jerusalem and Solomon's Temple in 587 BCE.\nAlthough the dates, numbers of expulsions, and numbers of exiles vary in the several biblical accounts, the following is a general outline of what occurred. After the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem, which resulted in tribute being paid by the Judean king Jehoiakim. In c.\u2009601 BCE, Jehoiakim refused to pay further tribute, which led in 598/597 BCE to another siege of the city by Nebuchadnezzar II and culminated in the death of Jehoiakim and the exile to Babylonia of his successor Jeconiah, Jeconiah's court, and many others. In 587 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed Jerusalem and exiled Jeconiah's successor Zedekiah and others. In 582 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II exiled another group. \nThe Bible recounts how after the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire to the Achaemenid Empire at the Battle of Opis in 539 BCE, exiled Judeans were permitted by the Persians to return to Judah. According to the biblical Book of Ezra, construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem began c.\u2009537 BCE in the new Persian province of Yehud Medinata. All of these events are considered significant to the developed history and culture of the Jewish people, and ultimately had a far-reaching impact on the development of Judaism.\nArchaeological studies have revealed that, although the city of Jerusalem was utterly destroyed, other parts of Judah continued to be inhabited during the period of the exile. Historical records from Mesopotamia and Jewish sources indicate that a significant portion of the Jewish population chose to remain in Mesopotamia. This decision led to the establishment of a sizable Jewish community in Mesopotamia known as the \"golah\" (dispersal), which persisted until modern times. The Iraqi Jewish, Persian Jewish, Georgian Jewish, Bukharian Jewish, and Mountain Jewish communities are believed to derive their ancestry in large part from these exiles; these communities have now largely emigrated to Israel.\nBiblical accounts of the exile.\nIn the late 7th century BCE, the Kingdom of Judah was a client state of the Assyrian empire. In the last decades of the century, Assyria was overthrown by Babylon, an Assyrian province. Egypt, fearing the sudden rise of the Neo-Babylonian empire, seized control of Assyrian territory up to the Euphrates river in Syria, but Babylon counter-attacked. In the process Josiah, the king of Judah, was killed in a battle with the Egyptians at the Battle of Megiddo (609 BCE).\nAfter the defeat of Pharaoh Necho's army by the Babylonians at Carchemish in 605 BCE, Jehoiakim began paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. Some of the young nobility of Judah were taken to Babylon.\nIn the following years, the court of Jerusalem was divided into two parties, one supporting Egypt, the other Babylon. After Nebuchadnezzar was defeated in battle in 601 BCE by Egypt, Judah revolted against Babylon, culminating in a three-month siege of Jerusalem beginning in late 598 BCE. Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, died during the siege and was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin (also called Jeconiah) at the age of eighteen. The city fell on 2 Adar (March 16) 597 BCE, and Nebuchadnezzar pillaged Jerusalem and its Temple and took Jeconiah, his court and other prominent citizens (including the prophet Ezekiel) back to Babylon. Jehoiakim's uncle Zedekiah was appointed king in his place, but the exiles in Babylon continued to consider Jeconiah as their Exilarch, or rightful ruler.\nDespite warnings by Jeremiah and others of the pro-Babylonian party, Zedekiah revolted against Babylon and entered into an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra. Nebuchadnezzar returned, defeated the Egyptians, and again besieged Jerusalem, resulting in the city's destruction in 587 BCE. Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the city wall and the Temple, together with the houses of the most important citizens. Zedekiah and his sons were captured and the sons were executed in front of Zedekiah, who was then blinded and taken to Babylon with many others (Jer 52:10\u201311). Judah became a Babylonian province, called Yehud, putting an end to the independent Kingdom of Judah. Because of the missing years in the Jewish calendar, rabbinic sources place the date of the destruction of the First Temple at 3338 AM (423 BCE) or 3358 AM (403 BCE).\nThe first governor appointed by Babylon was Gedaliah, a native Judahite; he encouraged the many Jews who had fled to surrounding countries such as Moab, Ammon and Edom to return, and he took steps to return the country to prosperity. Some time later, a surviving member of the royal family assassinated Gedaliah and his Babylonian advisors, prompting many refugees to seek safety in Egypt. By the end of the second decade of the 6th century BCE, in addition to those who remained in Judah, there were significant Jewish communities in Babylon and in Egypt; this was the beginning of the later numerous Jewish communities living permanently outside Judah in the Jewish Diaspora.\nAccording to the book of Ezra, the Persian Cyrus the Great ended the exile in 538 BCE, the year after he captured Babylon. The exile ended with the return under Zerubbabel the Prince (so-called because he was a descendant of the royal line of David) and Joshua the Priest (a descendant of the line of the former High Priests of the Temple) and their construction of the Second Temple in the period from 521 to 516 BCE.\nArchaeological and other extra-biblical evidence.\nFirst campaign (597 BCE).\nNebuchadnezzar's siege of Jerusalem, his capture of its king, his appointment of another in his place, and the plundering of the city in 597 BCE are corroborated by a passage in the Babylonian Chronicles:In the seventh year, in the month of Kislev, the king of Akkad mustered his troops, marched to the Hatti-land, and encamped against the City of Judah and on the ninth day of the month of Adar he seized the city and captured the king. He appointed there a king of his own choice and taking heavy tribute brought it back to Babylon.\nJehoiachin's Rations Tablets, describing ration orders for a captive King of Judah, identified with King Jeconiah, have been discovered during excavations in Babylon, in the royal archives of Nebuchadnezzar. One of the tablets refers to food rations for \"Ya\u2019u-k\u012bnu, king of the land of Yahudu\" and five royal princes, his sons.\nSecond campaign (589\u2013587 BCE).\nNebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian forces returned in 589 BCE and rampaged through Judah, leaving clear archaeological evidence of destruction in many towns and settlements there. Clay ostraca from this period, referred to as the Lachish letters, were discovered during excavations; one, which was probably written to the commander at Lachish from an outlying base, describes how the signal fires from nearby towns were disappearing: \"And may (my lord) be apprised that we are watching for the fire signals of Lachish according to all the signs which my lord has given, because we cannot see Azeqah.\" Archaeological finds from Jerusalem testify that virtually the whole city within the walls was burnt to rubble in 587 BCE and utterly destroyed.\nAftermath in Judah.\nArchaeological excavations and surveys have enabled the population of Judah before the Babylonian destruction to be estimated to have been approximately 75,000. Taking the different biblical numbers of exiles at their highest, 20,000, this would mean that perhaps 25% of the population had been deported to Babylon, with the remaining majority staying in Judah. Although Jerusalem was destroyed, with large parts of the city remaining in ruins for 150 years, numerous other settlements in Judah continued to be inhabited, with no signs of disruption visible in archaeological studies.\nArchaeologist Avraham Faust suggests that between the deportations and executions caused by the Babylonians, plus the famines and epidemics that occurred during the war, the population of Judah may have been reduced to as little as 10% of what it had been in the time before deportations.\nConditions in exile.\nIn Mesopotamia, the exiled Judeans were relocated to agricultural settlements, with one notable settlement being Tel-Abib near the city of Nippur. Biblical scholar Niels Peter Lemche suggests that the exiled Judeans experienced a lifestyle scarcely less prosperous than what they were accustomed to in their homeland.\nHowever, there is evidence for hardship. For example, exiled Jewish leaders were suspected of national disloyalty and were reduced to peasantry, where they worked in agriculture and building projects and performed simple tasks such as farming, shepherding and fishing. This ended when the Persians conquered Babylon. Exiled Jewish commoners were nostalgic about Judah and, due to circumstance, were forced to abandon temple-based worship. They mostly worshipped in private homes and kept some religious traditions such as circumcision, Sabbath observance, reading of the Psalms and Law.\nPersian restoration.\nThe Cyrus Cylinder, an ancient tablet on which is written a declaration in the name of Cyrus referring to restoration of temples and repatriation of exiled peoples, has often been taken as corroboration of the authenticity of the biblical decrees attributed to Cyrus, but other scholars point out that the cylinder's text is specific to Babylon and Mesopotamia and makes no mention of Judah or Jerusalem. Professor Lester L. Grabbe asserted that the \"alleged decree of Cyrus\" regarding Judah, \"cannot be considered authentic\", but that there was a \"general policy of allowing deportees to return and to re-establish cult sites\". He also stated that archaeology suggests that the return was a \"trickle\" taking place over decades, rather than a single event.\nAs part of the Persian Empire, the former Kingdom of Judah became the province of Judah (\"Yehud Medinata\") with different borders, covering a smaller territory. The population of the province was greatly reduced from that of the kingdom; archaeological surveys suggesting a population of around 30,000 people in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE.\nA 2017 exhibition in Jerusalem displayed over 100 cuneiform tablets detailing trade in fruits and other commodities, taxes, debts, and credits accumulated between Jews forced or persuaded to move from Jerusalem by King Nebuchadnezzar around 600 BCE. The tablets included details on one exiled Judean family over four generations, all with Hebrew names.\nMost Jews who returned were poor Jews and either saw the exile as \"spiritual regeneration\" or \"divine punishment for sins\". One reason why wealthy Jews stayed in Mesopotamia includes economic opportunities, which were relatively uncommon in Judah.\nExilic literature.\nThe exilic period was a rich source for Hebrew literature. Biblical depictions of the exile include Book of Jeremiah 39\u201343 (which saw the exile as a lost opportunity); the final section of 2 Kings (which portrays it as the temporary end of history); 2 Chronicles (in which the exile is the \"Sabbath of the land\"); and the opening chapters of Ezra, which records its end. Other works from or about the exile include the stories in Daniel 1\u20136, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, the \"Story of the Three Youths\" (1 Esdras 3:1\u20135:6), and the books of Tobit and Judith. The Book of Lamentations arose from the Babylonian captivity. The final redaction of the Pentateuch took place in the Persian period following the exile,and the Priestly source, one of its main sources, is primarily a product of the post-exilic period when the former Kingdom of Judah had become the Persian province of Yehud.\nSignificance for Jewish culture.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the captivity in Babylon is presented as a punishment for idolatry and disobedience to Yahweh. The Babylonian captivity had a number of serious effects on Judaism and Jewish culture. For example, the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, which eventually evolved into the Hebrew alphabet, was adopted during this period. Eventually the Aramaic-based Hebrew alphabet replaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet.\nThis period saw the last high point of biblical prophecy in the person of Ezekiel, followed by the emergence of the central role of the Torah in Jewish life. According to many historical-critical scholars, the Torah was redacted during this time, and began to be regarded as the authoritative text for Jews. This period saw their transformation into an ethno-religious group who could survive without a central Temple. Israeli philosopher and Biblical scholar Yehezkel Kaufmann said \"The exile is the watershed. With the exile, the religion of Israel comes to an end and Judaism begins.\"\nNotably, the period also saw the theological transition of the ancient Israelite religion among the captives from a monolatrous to a monotheistic faith system.\nThis process coincided with the emergence of scribes and sages as Jewish leaders (see Ezra). Prior to exile, the people of Israel had been organized according to tribe. Afterwards, they were organized by smaller family groups. Only the Tribe of Levi continued in its temple role after the return. After this time, there were always sizable numbers of Jews living outside the Land of Israel; thus, it also marks the beginning of the \"Jewish diaspora\", unless this is considered to have begun with the Assyrian captivity.\nIn Rabbinic literature, Babylon was one of a number of metaphors for the Jewish diaspora. Most frequently the term \"Babylon\" meant the diaspora prior to the destruction of the Second Temple. The post-destruction term for the Jewish Diaspora was \"Rome\", or \"Edom\".\nChronology.\nThe following table is based on Rainer Albertz's work on \"Israel in exile\", itself based mainly on biblical texts. (Alternative dates are possible.)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

So-called \"contracts\" exist in the thousands, including a great variety of deeds, conveyances, bonds, receipts, accounts, and most important of all, actual legal decisions given by the judges in the law courts. Historical inscriptions, royal charters and rescripts, dispatches, private letters and the general literature afford welcome supplementary information. Even grammatical and lexicographical texts contain many extracts or short sentences bearing on law and custom. The so-called \"Sumerian Family Laws\" are preserved in this way.\nOther cultures involved with ancient Mesopotamia shared the same common laws and precedents extending to the form of contacts that Kenneth Kitchen has studied and compared to the form of contracts in the Bible with particular note to the sequence of blessings and curses that bind the deal. The Maxims of Ptahhotep and Sharia Law, also include certifications for professionals like doctors, lawyers and skilled craftsmen which prescribe penalties for malpractice very similar to the code of Hammurabi.\nThe discovery of the now-celebrated Code of Hammurabi (hereinafter simply termed \"the Code\") has made possible a more systematic study than could have resulted from just the classification and interpretation of other material. Fragments of other Ancient codes exist and have been published, but there still remain many points whereof evidence is still lacking. There survive legal texts from the earliest writings through the Hellenistic period, but evidence on a particular point may be very full for one period and almost entirely lacking for another. The Code forms the backbone of most reconstructions. Fragments of it recovered from Assur-bani-pal's library at Nineveh and later Babylonian copies show that it was studied, divided into chapters, entitled \"Ninu ilu sirum\" from its incipit (opening words), and recopied for fifteen hundred years or more.\nMuch Babylonian legal precedent remained in force, even through the Persian, Greek and Parthian conquests, which had little effect on private life in Babylonia; and it survived to influence Romans. The laws and customs that preceded the Code may be called \"early\"; that of the Neo-Babylonian empire (as well as the Persian, Greek, etc.), \"late\". The law of Assyria was derived from the Babylonian, but it conserved early features long after they had disappeared elsewhere.\nHistory.\nTribal influence.\nThe early history of Mesopotamia is the story of a struggle for supremacy between the cities. A metropolis demanded tribute and military support from its subject cities but left their local cults and customs unaffected. City rights and usages were respected by kings and conquerors alike. When the ancient Semitic-speaking peoples settled in the cities of Mesopotamia, their tribal customs passed over into city law.\nAs late as the accession of Assur-bani-pal and Shamash-shum-ukin, we find the Babylonians appending to their city laws that groups of aliens to the number of twenty at a time were free to enter the city; that foreign women, once married to Babylonian husbands, could not be enslaved; and that not even a dog that entered the city could be put to death untried.\nThe population of Babylonia was multi-ethnic from early times, and intercommunication between the cities was incessant. Every city had a large number of resident aliens. This freedom of intercourse must have tended to assimilate custom. It was, however, reserved for the genius of Hammurabi to make Babylon his metropolis and weld together his vast empire by a uniform system of law.\nHammurabi's Code.\nBy Hammurabi's time, almost all trace of tribal custom had already disappeared from the law of the Code. It is state law\u2014self-help, blood-feud, and marriage by capture, are all absent; though code of family solidarity, district responsibility, ordeal, and the \"lex talionis\" (an eye for an eye), are primitive features that remain. The king is a benevolent autocrat, easily accessible to all his subjects, both able and willing to protect the weak against the highest-placed oppressor. The royal power, however, can only pardon when private resentment is appeased. Judges are strictly supervised, and appeal is allowed. The whole land is covered with feudal holdings, masters of the levy, police, etc. There is a regular postal system. The \"pax Babylonica\" is so assured that private individuals do not hesitate to ride in their carriage from Babylon to the coast of the Mediterranean. The position of women is free and dignified.\nThe Code did not merely embody contemporary custom or conserve ancient law. It is true that centuries of law-abiding and litigious habitude had accumulated, in the temple archives of each city, vast stores of precedent in ancient deeds and records of judicial decisions and that intercourse had assimilated city custom. The universal habit of writing, and perpetual recourse to written contract, further modified primitive custom and ancient precedent.\nIf the parties themselves could agree to the terms, the Code as a rule left them free to make contracts. Their deed of agreement was drawn up in the temple by a notary public and confirmed with an oath \"by god and the king.\" It was publicly sealed and witnessed by professional witnesses, as well as by collaterally interested parties. The manner in which it was executed may have been sufficient guarantee that its stipulations were not impious or illegal. Custom or public opinion doubtlessly ensured that the parties would not agree to \"wrong\". If a dispute arose, the judges dealt first with the contract. They might not sustain it, but if the parties did not dispute it, they were free to observe it. The judges' decision might, however, be appealed. Many contracts contain the proviso that in case of future dispute, the parties would abide by \"the decision of the king.\" The Code made known, in a vast number of cases, what that decision would be, and many cases of appeal to the king were returned to the judges with orders to decide in accordance with it. The Code itself was carefully and logically arranged, its sections arranged by subject matter. Nevertheless, the order is not that of modern scientific treatises, so a somewhat different order than either is most convenient for our purpose.\nSee also: https://\nThree classes.\nThe Code contemplates the whole population as falling into three classes: the \"avilum\", the \"mushkenu\" and the \"ardu\".\nThe \"avilum\" was originally a patrician, a man from an elite family, possessed of full civil rights, whose birth, marriage and death were registered. He had aristocratic privileges and responsibilities, and the right to exact retaliation for corporal injuries, but was liable to a heavier punishment for crimes and misdemeanours, higher fees and fines. To this class belonged the king and court, the higher officials, the professions and craftsmen. Over time, the term became a mere courtesy title\u2014already in the Code, when status is not concerned, it is used to denote anyone. There was no property qualification, nor does the term appear to be racial.\nIt is most difficult to characterize the \"mushkenu\" exactly. The term in time came to mean \"a beggar\", and that meaning has passed through Aramaic and Hebrew into many modern languages; but though the Code does not regard him as necessarily poor, he may have been landless. He was free but had to accept monetary compensation for corporal injuries, paid smaller fees and fines, and even paid less offerings to the gods. He inhabited a separate quarter of the city. There is no reason to regard him as specially connected with the court, as a royal pensioner, nor as forming the bulk of the population. The rarity of any references to him in contemporary documents makes further specification conjectural.\nThe \"ardu\" was a slave, his master's chattel, and formed a very numerous class. He could acquire property and even own other slaves. His master clothed and fed him and paid his doctor's fees, but took all compensation paid for injury done to him. His master usually found him a slave girl for a wife (the children were then born slaves), often set him up in a house (with farm or business) and simply took an annual rent of him. Otherwise, he might marry a free woman (the children were then free), who might bring him a dower that his master could not touch, and at his death, one-half of his property passed to his master as his heir. He could acquire his freedom by purchase from his master, or might be freed and dedicated to a temple, or even adopted, when he became an \"amelu\" and not a \"mushkenu\". Slaves were recruited by purchase abroad, from captives taken in war, or by freemen degraded for debt or crime. A slave often ran away; if caught, the captor was bound to restore him to his master, and the Code fixes a reward of two shekels that the owner must pay the captor. It was about one-tenth of the average value of a slave. To detain or harbour a slave was punishable by death. So was aiding him to escape the city gates. A slave bore an identification mark, removable only by a surgical operation, that later consisted of his owner's name tattooed or branded on the arm. On the other hand, on the great estates in Assyria and its subject provinces there were many serfs, mostly of subject race, settled captives, or quondam slaves; tied to the soil they cultivated and sold with the estate, yet capable of possessing land and property of their own. There is little trace of serfs in Babylonia, unless the \"mushkenu\" is really a serf.\nCitizens tenants of gods.\nThe god of a city was originally considered the owner of its land, which encircled it with an inner ring of irrigable arable land and an outer fringe of pasture; the citizens were his tenants. The god and his vice regent, the king, had long ceased to disturb tenancy and were content with fixed dues \"in naturalia\", stock, money or service.\nOne of the earliest monuments records the purchase by a king of a large estate for his son, paying a fair market price and adding a handsome honorarium to the many owners, in costly garments, plate, and precious articles of furniture. The Code recognizes complete private ownership of land but apparently extends the right to hold land to votaries and merchants; but all land sold was subject to its fixed charges. The king, however, could free land from these charges by charter, which was a frequent way of rewarding those who deserved well of the state.\nIt is from these charters that we learn of the obligations lying upon land. The state demanded men for the army and the \"corv\u00e9e\", as well as dues in kind. A certain area was bound to provide a bowman, together with his linked pikeman (who bore the shield for both), and to furnish them with supplies for the campaign. This area was termed a \"bow\" as early as the 8th century BC, but the practice goes back much earlier. Later, a horseman was also due from certain areas. A man was only bound to serve a certain number of times, but the land still had to find a man annually. This service was usually discharged by slaves and serfs, but the \"amelu\" (and perhaps the \"mushkenu\") also went to war. The bows were grouped together in tens and hundreds. The \"corv\u00e9e\" was less regular. Special liabilities also lay upon riparian owners to repair canals, bridges, quays, etc. The letters of Hammurabi often deal with claims to exemption. Religious officials and shepherds in charge of flocks were exempt from military duty.\nThe state claimed certain proportions of all crops, stock, etc. The king's messengers could commandeer any subject's property, giving a receipt. Further, every city had its own octroi duties, customs, ferry dues, highway and water rates. The king had long ceased to be owner of the land, if he ever was. He had his own royal estates, his private property, and dues from all his subjects. The higher officials had endowments and official residences.\nThe Code regulates the feudal position of certain classes. They held an estate from the king, consisting of a house, a garden, a field, stock, and a salary, on condition of personal service on the king's errand. They could not delegate the service, on penalty of death. When ordered abroad, they could nominate a capable son to hold the benefice and carry on the duty. If there was no capable son, the state put in a \"locum tenens\" but granted one-third to the wife to maintain herself and her children. The fief was otherwise inalienable; it could not be sold, pledged, exchanged, sublet, devised or diminished. Other land was leased from the state. Ancestral estate was strictly tied to the family. If a holder would sell, the family kept the right of redemption, and there seems to have been no time limit to its exercise.\nTemple.\nThe temple occupied a most important position. It received income from its estates, from tithes and other fixed dues, as well as from the sacrifices (a customary share) and other offerings of the faithful\u2014vast amounts of all sorts of naturalia, besides money and permanent gifts. The larger temples had many officials and servants.\nOriginally, perhaps, each town clustered round one temple, and each head of family had a right to minister there and share its receipts. As the city grew, the right to so many days a year at one shrine (or its gate) descended within certain families and became a kind of property that could be pledged, rented or shared within the family, but not alienated. Despite all these demands, the temples became great granaries and storehouses and were also the city archives. The temple had its responsibilities. If a citizen was captured by the enemy and could not ransom himself, the temple of his city must do so. To the temple came the poor farmer to borrow seed, grain, or supplies for harvesters, etc.\u2014advances that he repaid without interest.\nThe king's power over the temple was not proprietary, but administrative. He might borrow from it, but repaid like other borrowers. The tithe seems to have been considered the rent due to the god for his land. It is not clear that all lands paid tithe; perhaps only such as once had a special connection with the temple.\nThe Code deals with a class of persons devoted to the service of a god, as vestals or hierodules. The vestals were vowed to chastity, lived together in a great nunnery, were forbidden to enter a tavern, and, together with other votaries, had many privileges.\nProperty law.\nThe Code recognizes many ways of disposing of property: sale, lease, barter, gift, dedication, deposit, loan, or pledge, all of which were matters of contract. Sale was the delivery of a purchase (in the case of real estate, symbolized by a staff, a key, or deed of conveyance) in return for purchase money, receipts being given for both. Credit, if given, was treated as a debt, and secured as a loan by the seller to be repaid by the buyer, for which he gave a bond.\nThe Code only allows claims substantiated by documents, or in some cases the oath of witnesses. Saving contracts and receipts thus assumed a vital importance in Babylon - in fact it could literally be a matter of life or death. A buyer had to be sure of the seller's title. If he bought (or received on deposit) property from even a minor or a slave without witnessing contracts, he would be executed as a thief (\u00a77). If purchased goods were stolen and the rightful owner reclaimed them, he had to prove his purchase by producing the seller and the deed of sale, or witnesses to it; otherwise, he would be adjudged a thief and die. If he proved his purchase, he had to give up the property but could pursue a remedy against the seller or, if the seller had died, could reclaim fivefold from his estate.\nA man who bought a slave abroad might find that he had previously been stolen or captured from Babylonia; he would then have to restore him to his former owner without recompense. If he bought property belonging to a feudal holding, or to a ward in Chancery, he had to return it as well as forfeit what he paid for it. He could repudiate the purchase of a slave attacked by the \"bennu\" sickness within a month (later, a hundred days) and could hold a newly purchased female slave for three days \"on approval\". A defect of title, or an undisclosed liability, would invalidate a sale at any time.\nLeasing.\nLandowners frequently cultivated their land themselves, but could also employ a husbandman, or rent it. The husbandman was bound to carry out proper cultivation, raise an average crop, and leave the field in good tilth. In case the crop failed, the Code fixed a statutory return. Land might be leased at a fixed rent, where the Code stipulates that accidental loss fell on the tenant. If leased on profit-sharing terms, the landlord and tenant shared the loss proportionally to their stipulated share of profit. If the tenant paid his rent and kept the land in good tilth, the landlord could not interfere nor forbid subletting.\nWasteland could be leased for reclamation, the tenant being rent-free for three years and paying a stipulated rent in the fourth year. If the tenant neglected to reclaim the land, the Code stipulated that he must hand it over in good tilth and set a statutory rent. Gardens or plantations were leased in the same ways and under the same conditions; but for date groves, four years' free tenure was allowed.\nThe metayer system was common, especially on temple lands. The landlord found land, labour, oxen for ploughing and working the watering machines, carting, threshing or other implements, grain seed, rations for the workmen and fodder for the cattle. The tenant, or steward, usually had other land of his own. If he stole the seed, rations or fodder, the Code stipulated that his fingers be cut off. If he appropriated or sold the implements, or impoverished or sublet the cattle, he was heavily fined and in default of payment, might be condemned to be torn to pieces by the cattle on the field. Rent was determined by contract.\nIrrigation was essential for farming in this region. If the irrigator neglected to repair his dike or left his runnel open and caused a flood, he had to make good the damage done to his neighbours' crops or be sold with his family to pay the cost. The theft of a watering machine, water-bucket or other agricultural implement was heavily fined.\nHouses were usually leased for the year, but also for longer terms, rent being paid in advance, half-yearly. The contract generally specified that the house be in good repair, and the tenant was bound to keep it so. The woodwork, including doors and door frames, was removable, and the tenant might bring and take away his own. The Code stipulated that if the landlord re-entered before the term was up, he must remit a fair proportion of the rent. Land could be leased for the purpose of building houses or other buildings on it, the tenant being rent-free for eight or ten years; after which the building came into the landlord's possession.\nHired labour.\nDespite the multitude of slaves, hired labour was often needed, especially at harvest. This was a matter of contract, and the employer, who usually paid in advance, might demand a collateral against fulfillment of the work. Cattle were hired for ploughing, working the watering machines, carting, threshing, etc. The Code fixed a statutory wage for sowers, ox-drivers, field-labourers, and hire for oxen, asses, etc.\nThere were many herds and flocks. The flocks were committed to a shepherd, who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The Code fixed his wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for ox, sheep for sheep and must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of the flock had to be repaid tenfold, but loss due to disease or wild beasts fell upon the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his own neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of crops, he had to pay damages fourfold; if he turned them into standing crops when they ought to have been folded, he paid twelvefold.\nDebt.\nIn commerce, payment in kind was still common, though contracts usually stipulated cash, naming the currency expected\u2014that of Babylon, Larsa, Assyria, Carchemish, etc. The Code stipulated, however, that a debtor must be allowed to pay in produce according to a statutory scale. If a debtor had neither money nor crops, the creditor must not refuse goods.\nDebt was secured on the debtor's own person. Distraint on a debtor's grain was forbidden by the Code; not only must the creditor return it, but his illegal action forfeited his claim altogether. An unwarranted seizure for debt was fined, as was the distraint of a working ox.\nIf a debtor were seized for debt, he could nominate as \"mancipium\", or hostage to work off the debt, his wife, child, or slave. The creditor could only hold a wife or child three years as \"mancipium\". If the \"mancipium\" died a natural death while in the creditor's possession, no claim could lie against the latter; but if he was the cause of death by cruelty, he had to give son for son, or pay for a slave. He could sell a slave-hostage, but not a slave-girl who had borne her master children; she had to be redeemed by her owner.\nThe debtor could also pledge his property and in contracts, often pledged a field, house or crop. The Code stipulated, however, that the debtor must take the crop himself and pay the creditor from its yield. If the crop failed, payment was deferred, and no interest could be charged for that year. If the debtor did not cultivate the field himself, he had to pay for its cultivation, but if the field was already cultivated, he must harvest it himself and pay his debt from the crop. If the cultivator did not get a crop, this would not cancel his contract.\nPledges were often made where the intrinsic value of the article was equivalent to the amount of the debt; but antichretic pledge was more common, where the profit of the pledge was a set-off against the interest of the debt. The whole property of a debtor might be pledged as collateral for payment of a debt, without any of it passing through the hands of the creditor. Personal guarantees were often given in Babylon that the debtor would repay, or the guarantor become liable himself.\nTrade.\nTrade was very extensive. A common procedure was for a merchant to entrust his goods or money to a traveling agent, who sought a market for his goods. The caravans travelled far beyond the limits of the empire.\nThe Code insisted that the agent should inventory and give a receipt for all that he received. No claim could be made for anything not so entered. Even if the agent made no profit, he was bound to return double what he had received; if he made poor profit, he had to make up the deficiency; but he was not responsible for loss by robbery or extortion on his travels. On his return, the lending merchant must give him a receipt for what was handed over to him. Any false entry or claim on the agent's part was penalised threefold; on the lending merchant's part, sixfold. In normal cases, profits were divided according to contract, usually equally.\nA considerable amount of forwarding (advancing wares to the agent up front) was done by the caravans. The carrier gave a receipt for the consignment, took all responsibility, and exacted a receipt upon delivery. If he defaulted, he paid fivefold. He was usually paid in advance. Deposit, especially warehousing of grain, was charged for at one-sixtieth. The warehouse man took all risks and paid double for all shortage, but no claim could be made unless he had given a properly witnessed receipt.\nWater traffic on the Euphrates and canal system was early on, quite considerable. Ships, whose tonnage was estimated by the amount of grain they could carry, were continually hired for the transport of all kinds of goods. The Code fixes the price for shipbuilding and insists on the builder's giving a year's guarantee of seaworthiness. It also fixes the rate of hire for ship and crew. The captain was responsible for the freight and the ship; he had to replace all loss. Even if he refloated the ship, he had to pay a fine of half its value for sinking it. In the case of collision, the boat under way was responsible for damages to the boat at anchor.\nThe Code also regulated the liquor traffic\u2014fixing a fair price for beer and forbidding the connivance of the tavern keeper (a female) at disorderly conduct or treasonable assembly, under pain of death. She was required to take the offenders to the palace\u2014implying an efficient and accessible police system.\nPayment through a banker or by written draft against deposit was frequent. Bonds to pay were treated as negotiable. Interest was rarely charged on advances by the temple or wealthy landowners for pressing needs, but this may have been part of the metayer system. The borrowers may have been tenants. Interest was charged at very high rates for overdue loans of this kind. Merchants (and even temples in some cases) made ordinary business loans, charging from 20% to 30%.\nFamily law.\nMarriage.\nMarriage retained the form of purchase, but was essentially a contract to be husband and wife together. The marriage of young people was usually arranged between their relatives\u2014the groom's father\nthe bride-price, which, with other gifts, the suitor ceremonially presented to the bride's father. This bride-price was usually then handed over by her father to the bride upon her marriage, and so returned into the bridegroom's possession, along with her dowry, which was her portion of the family's inheritance as a daughter.\nThe bride-price varied greatly, according to the status of the parties, but surpassed the price of a slave. The Code stipulated that if the father did not give the suitor his daughter after accepting the suitor's gifts, he must return the gifts. The bride-price had to be returned even if the father reneged on the marriage contract because of slander of the suitor on the part of the suitor's friend, and the Code stipulated that the slanderer should not marry the girl (and thus would not profit from his slander). Conversely, if a suitor changed his mind, he forfeited the presents.\nThe dowry might include real estate, but generally consisted of personal effects and household furniture. It remained the wife's for life, descending to her children, if any; otherwise returning to her family, when the husband could deduct the bride-price if it had not been given to her, or return it if it had.\nThe marriage ceremony included joining hands and the bridegroom uttering a formula of acceptance, such as, \"I am the son of nobles, silver and gold shall fill thy lap, thou shalt be my wife, I will be thy husband. Like the fruit of a garden I will give thee offspring.\" The ceremony must be performed by a freeman.\nThe marriage contract\u2014without which, the Code ruled that the woman was no wife\u2014usually stated the consequences to which each party was liable for repudiating the other. These by no means necessarily agree with the Code. Many other conditions might also be inserted: such as that the wife should act as maidservant to her mother-in-law or to a first wife.\nThe married couple formed a single unit in terms of external responsibility, especially for debt. The man was responsible for debts contracted by his wife, even before her marriage, as well as for his own; but he could use her as a \"mancipium\" (see above). Hence the Code allowed a proviso to be inserted in the marriage contract, that the wife should not be seized for her husband's pre-nuptial debts; but stipulated that then he was not responsible for her pre-nuptial debts, and, in any case, that both together were responsible for all debts contracted after marriage. A man might make his wife a settlement by deed of gift, which gave her a life interest in part of his property, and he might reserve to her the right to bequeath it to a favorite child; but she could in no case leave it to her family. Although married, she always remained a member of her father's house\u2014she is rarely named wife of A, but usually daughter of B, or mother of C.\nDivorce.\nDivorce was the husband's option, but he had to restore the dowry, and if the wife had borne him children, she had custody of them. He then had to assign her the income from property, as well as goods to maintain herself and their children until they grew up. She shared equally with their children in the allowance (and apparently in his estate at his death) and was free to marry again. If she had no children, he returned her dowry to her and paid her a sum equivalent to the bride-price, or a mina of silver if there had been none. The latter is the forfeit usually named in the contract for his repudiation of her.\nIf the husband could show that his wife had been a bad wife, the Code allowed him to send her away, while he kept the children as well as her dowry; or he could degrade her to the position of a slave in his own house, where she would have food and clothing. The wife might bring an action against her husband for cruelty and neglect and, if she proved her case, obtain a judicial separation, taking her dowry with her. No other punishment fell on the man. If she did not prove her case, but was proved to be a bad wife, she was drowned.\nIf the wife was left without maintenance during an involuntary absence of her husband (called to war, etc.), she could cohabit with another man, but must return to her husband when he came back, the children of the second union remaining with their own father. If she had maintenance, a breach of the marriage tie was adultery. Willful desertion by, or exile of, the husband dissolved the marriage without penalty to the wife. If he returned, she was not required or even permitted to return to him.\nWidowhood.\nA widow took her husband's place in the family\u2014living in his house and bringing up the children. She could only remarry with judicial consent, where the judge inventoried the deceased's estate and handed it over to her and her new husband in trust for the children. They could not alienate a single utensil.\nIf she did not remarry, she lived on in her husband's house and, when the children had grown up, took a child's share in the division of his estate. She retained her dowry and any settlement deeded to her by her husband. This property would come down to her children on her death. If she had remarried, all her children would share equally in her dowry, but the first husband's estate fell only to his children, or to her selection among them, if so empowered.\nChildbearing.\nMonogamy was the rule, and a childless wife might give her husband a maid to bear him children, who were then reckoned hers. She remained mistress of her maid, and might degrade her to slavery again for insolence, but could not sell her if she had borne her husband children. If the wife did this, the Code did not allow the husband to take a concubine; but if she did not, he could do so. The concubine was a co-wife, though not of the same rank; the first wife had no power over her. A concubine was a free woman, often dowered for marriage, and her children were legitimate and lawful heirs. She could only be divorced on the same conditions as a wife.\nIf a wife became a chronic invalid, the husband was bound to maintain her in the home they had made together, unless she preferred to take her dowry and return to her father's house; but he was free to remarry. Again, the children of the new wife were legitimate and lawful heirs.\nThere was no hindrance to a man having children by a slave girl. These children were free, and their mother then could not be sold, though she might be pledged, and she became free upon her master's death. Her children could be legitimized by their father's acknowledgment before witnesses and were often adopted. They then ranked equally in sharing their father's estate; but if not adopted, the wife's children divided and took first choice.\nTemple priests were not supposed to have children, yet they could marry and often did. The Code contemplated that such a wife would give a husband a maid, as above.\nFree women might marry slaves and still be dowered for the marriage. The children were free, and at the slave's death, the wife took her dowry and half of what she and her husband had acquired in wedlock for self and children; the master taking the other half, as his slave's heir.\nA father had control over his children until their marriage. He had a right to their labor in return for their keep. He might hire them out and receive their wages, pledge them for debt, or even sell them outright. Mothers had the same rights in the absence of the father; elder brothers, when both parents were dead. A father had no claim on his married children for support, but they retained the right to inherit on his death.\nThe daughter was not only in her father's power to be given in marriage, but he might dedicate her to the service of a god as a vestal or a hierodule or give her as a concubine. She had no choice in these matters, often decided in her childhood. An adult daughter might wish to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial marriage, and it seems that her father could not refuse her wish.\nIn all these cases, the father might dower her. If he did not, on his death the brothers were obligated to do so, giving her a full child's share if a wife, a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child's share if she were a hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter had the privilege of exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her property. All other daughters had only a life interest in their dowry, which reverted to their family if childless or went to their children if they had any. A father might, however, execute a deed granting a daughter power to leave her property to a favorite brother or sister.\nA daughter's estate was usually managed for her by her brothers, but if they dissatisfied her, she could appoint a steward. If she married, her husband then managed it. Sons also appear to have received their share on marriage, but then did not always leave their father's house; they might bring their wives there. This was usual in child marriages.\nAdoption.\nAdoption was very common, especially when the father (or mother) was childless or had seen all his children grow up and marry away. The child was then adopted to care for the parents' old age. This was done by contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what maintenance was expected. The natural children, if any, were usually consenting parties to an arrangement that cut off their expectations. In some cases they even acquired the estate for the adopted child who was to relieve them of care. If the adopted child failed to carry out the filial duty, the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were often adopted, and if they proved unfilial, were reduced to slavery again.\nA craftsman often adopted a son to learn the craft. He profited by the son's labour. If he failed to teach his son the craft, that son could prosecute him and get the contract annulled. This was a form of apprenticeship, and it is not clear whether the apprentice had any filial relation.\nA man who had adopted a child, and afterwards married and had a family of his own, could dissolve the contract and must give the adopted child one-third of a child's share in goods, but no real estate. Property could only descend through his legitimate family. Vestals frequently adopted daughters, usually other vestals, to care for them in their old age.\nAdoption had to be with consent of the natural parents, who usually executed a deed making over the child, who thus ceased to have any claim upon them. But vestals, hierodules, certain palace officials and slaves had no rights over their children and could raise no objection. Orphans and illegitimate children had no parents to object. Ingratitude by adopted children was severely frowned on by the law: if the adopted child of a prostitute abandoned his foster parents and returned to his biological father's house, his eye was torn out. If an adopted child rejected his foster parents, claiming they were not his mother and father, his tongue was torn out. An adopted child was a full heir; the contract might even assign him the position of eldest son. Usually, he was residuary legatee.\nInheritance.\nAll legitimate children shared equally in the father's estate on his death, reservation being made of a bride-price for an unmarried son, dower for a daughter, or property deeded to favourite children by the father. There was no birthright attaching to the position of eldest son, but he usually acted as executor and, after considering what each had already received, equalized the shares. He even made grants in excess to the others from his own share. If there were two widows with legitimate issue, both families shared equally in the father's estate, until later times, when the first family took two-thirds. Daughters, in the absence of sons, had sons' rights. Children also shared their own mother's property, but had no share in that of a stepmother.\nA father could disinherit a son in early times without restriction, but the Code insisted upon judicial consent, and that only for repeated unfilial conduct. In early times, the son who denied his father had his front hair shorn and a slave-mark put on him and could be sold as a slave; while the son who denied his mother had his front hair shorn, was driven round the city as an example and expelled from his home, but not degraded to slavery.\nAdultery.\nAdultery was punished with the death of both parties by drowning; but if the husband was willing to pardon his wife, the king might intervene to pardon the paramour. For incest between mother and son, both were burned to death; with a stepmother, the man was disinherited; with a daughter, the man was exiled; with a daughter-in-law, he was drowned; with a son's fianc\u00e9e, he was fined. A wife who for her lover's sake procured her husband's death was gibbeted. A betrothed girl seduced by her prospective father-in-law took her dowry and returned to her family and was free to marry as she chose.\nPunishment.\nIn the criminal code, the ruling vice-principle was the \"lex talionis\". Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, limb for limb was the penalty for assault upon an \"amelu\". A sort of symbolic retaliation was the punishment for the offender, seen in cutting off the hand that struck a father or stole a trust; in cutting off the breast of a wet nurse who switched the child entrusted to her for another; in the loss of the tongue that denied father or mother (in Elamite contracts, the same penalty was inflicted for perjury); in the loss of the eye that pried into forbidden secrets. The loss of the surgeon's hand that caused loss of life or limb, or the brander's hand that obliterated a slave's identification mark, are very similar. The slave who struck a freeman or denied his master lost an ear, the organ of hearing and symbol of obedience. A person who brought another into danger of death by false accusation was punished by death. A perjurer was punished by the same penalty the perjurer sought to bring upon another.\nThe death penalty was freely rendered for theft and other crimes in this section of the Code: for theft involving entering a palace or temple treasury, for illegal purchase from a minor or slave, for selling stolen goods or receiving the same, for common theft in the open (in lieu of multiple-fold restoration) or receiving the same, for false claim to goods, for kidnapping, for assisting or harbouring fugitive slaves, for detaining or appropriating the same, for brigandage, for fraudulent sale of drink, for not reporting criminal conspiracy in one's tavern, for delegation of personal service and refusing to pay the delegate or not sending the delegate, for misappropriating the levy, for harming or robbing one of the king's captains, for causing the death of a house owner through bad construction. The manner of death is not specified for these cases.\nThis death penalty was also set for conduct that placed another in danger of death. The form of death penalty was specified for the following cases: gibbeting: for burglary (on the spot where crime was committed), later also for encroaching on the king's highway, for getting a slave-brand obliterated, for procuring a husband's death; burning: for incest with own mother, for a vestal entering or opening a tavern, for looting a house on fire (thrown into the fire); drowning: for adultery, rape of a betrothed maiden, bigamy, bad conduct as a wife, seduction of a daughter-in-law.\nA curious extension of the \"lex talionis\" is the death of a creditor's son for his father's having caused the death of a debtor's son as \"mancipium\"; of a builder's son for his father's causing the death of a house owner's son by bad construction; the death of a man's daughter because her father caused the death of another man's daughter.\nContracts naturally do not usually touch on criminal matters as the above, but marriage contracts do specify death by strangling, drowning, precipitation from a tower or pinnacle of the temple, or by the iron sword, for a wife's repudiation of her husband. We are quite without evidence as to the executioner in all these cases.\nExile was inflicted for incest with a daughter; disinheritance for incest with a stepmother, or for repeated unfilial conduct. Sixty strokes of an ox-hide scourge were awarded for a brutal assault on a superior, both being \"amelu\". Branding (perhaps the equivalent of degradation to slavery) was the penalty for slander of a married woman or vestal. Permanent deprivation of office fell upon the corrupt judge. Enslavement befell the extravagant wife and unfilial children. Imprisonment was common, but is not mentioned in the Code.\nThe commonest of all penalties was a fine. This is awarded by the Code for corporal injuries to a \"mushkenu\" or to a slave (paid to his master), for damages done to property, or for breach of contract. The restoration of goods appropriated, illegally bought, or damaged by neglect, was usually accompanied by a fine, giving it the form of multiple restoration. This might be double, treble, fourfold, fivefold, sixfold, tenfold, twelvefold, or even thirtyfold, according to the enormity of the offence.\nThe Code recognized the importance of intent. A man who killed another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally and was then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does not say what would be the penalty of murder, but death is so often awarded where death is caused, that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional, the assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor's fees. A brander, induced to remove a slave's identification mark, could swear to his ignorance and was free. The owner of an ox that gored a man on the street was only responsible for damages if the ox was known by him to be vicious\u2014even if it caused death. If the \"mancipium\" died a natural death under the creditor's hand, the creditor was free. In ordinary cases, a person was not responsible for accident or if they exercised more than proper care. Poverty excused bigamy on the part of a deserted wife.\nOn the other hand, carelessness and neglect were severely punished, as in the case of the unskillful physician, if it led to loss of life or limb, his hands were cut off; a slave had to be replaced, the loss of his eye paid for by half his value; a veterinary surgeon who caused the death of an ox or donkey paid quarter value; a builder whose careless workmanship caused death died or paid for it by the death of his child, replaced slave or goods and in any case, had to rebuild the house or make good any damages due to defective building and repair the defect as well. The boat builder had to make good any defect of construction or damage due to it for a year's warranty.\nThroughout the Code, respect is paid to evidence. Suspicion was not enough. The criminal must be taken in the act, e.g. the adulterer, etc. A man could not be convicted of theft unless the goods were found in his possession.\nIn the case of a lawsuit, the plaintiff proffered his own plea. There is no trace of professional advocates, but the plea had to be in writing, and the notary doubtlessly assisted in the drafting of it. The judge saw the plea, called the other parties before him, and sent for the witnesses. If these were not at hand, he might adjourn the case for their subpoena, specifying a time for up to six months. Pledges might be made to produce the witnesses on a fixed day.\nThe more important cases, especially those involving life and death, were tried by a bench of judges. With the judges were associated a body of elders who shared in the decision, but whose exact function is not yet clear. Agreements, declarations and non-contentious cases were usually witnessed by one judge and twelve elders.\nParties and witnesses were put on oath. The penalty for false witness was usually the punishment that would have been awarded the victim if convicted. In matters beyond human knowledge, such as the guilt or innocence of an alleged practitioner of magic or a suspected wife, the ordeal by water was used. The accused jumped into the sacred river, and the innocent swam while the guilty drowned. The accused could clear himself by taking an oath if the only knowledge available was his own. The plaintiff could swear to his loss by brigands, the price paid for a slave purchased abroad, or the sum due to him; but great stress was laid on the production of written evidence. It was a serious thing to lose a document. The judges might be satisfied of its existence and terms by the affidavit of the witnesses to it and then issue an order that whenever found, it should be submitted. The clay tablets of contracts that were annulled were broken. The court might even travel to view the property and take with them the sacred symbols with which oaths were made.\nCourt decisions were set in writing, sealed and witnessed by the judges, the elders, witnesses, and a scribe. Women might act in all these capacities. The parties swore an oath, included in the document, to observe its stipulations. Each party received a copy, and one was kept by the scribe to be stored in the archives.\nAppeal to the king was allowed and is well attested. The judges at Babylon seem to have formed a superior court to those of provincial towns, but a defendant might elect to answer the charge before the local court and refuse to plead at Babylon.\nFinally, it may be noted that many immoral acts, such as the use of false weights, lying, etc., that could not be brought into court are severely denounced in the Omen Tablets as likely to bring the offender into \"the hand of God\" as opposed to \"the hand of the king\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Greek mythology, it was the home of the god Pan.\nGeography.\nArcadia is a rural, mountainous regional unit comprising about 18% of the land area of the Peloponnese peninsula. It is the peninsula's largest regional unit. According to the 2021 census, it has 77,592 inhabitants; its capital, Tripoli, has about 30,400 residents in the city proper, and about 44,000 total in the greater metropolitan area.\nArcadia consists partly of farmland, and to a larger extent grassland and degenerated shrubland. It also has three mountain ranges, with forestation mainly at altitudes above 1000 meters: Mainalo, a winter ski resort, situated in the central north; Parnon in the central south; and Mount Lykaion, famous for the ancient history and myths associated with it, in the southwest.\nIts climate features hot summers and mild winters in the east, the south, and those parts of the central area that are less than 1000 meters above sea level. Fall and winter are mostly rainy, except in the mountains to the west and north, Taygetus and Mainalo, which are snowy in winter.\nGeology and Hydrogeology.\nArcadia is almost totally mountainous and part of the \"carbonate platform\" (calcareous or limestone deposits) of the Peloponnese. The whole peninsula was formed by intense tectonics (faults, overthrusts and regional metamorphism). In Arcadia's central part around the Tripoli region developed a special form of topography, a geologically fascinating phenomenon: There are several plains and \"intra mountainous basins\", even \"closed basins\": The 30\u00a0km long \"Tripoli-Plateau\", \"Argon Pedion\", Basin of Levidi, Basin of Vlacherna Arcadia/Hotoussa/Kandila.\nThe peculiarity of the plains and basins is a result of intensive karstification: Water seeps into the underground, rather than eroding and draining the topography by surface waterways. All drainage runs through ponors (in Greek: \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03cc\u03b8\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2) and subterranean waterways. The additional problem for rural activities in the basins: When winter rains are heavy, the ground is flooded or temporary lakes arise, even today, as drainage through katavothres is often too slow to start cultivation in due time.\nHistory.\nMedieval history.\nAfter the collapse of the Roman Empire in the west, Arcadia remained as part of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire. Arcadia remained a beautiful, secluded area, and its inhabitants became proverbial as herdsmen leading simple pastoral unsophisticated yet happy lives, to the point that \"Arcadia\" may refer to some imaginary idyllic paradise, immortalized by Virgil's Eclogues, and later by Jacopo Sannazaro in his pastoral masterpiece, \"Arcadia\" (1504); see also Arcadia (utopia).\nAfter the Fourth Crusade, the area became a part of the Principality of Achaea, but was progressively recovered by the Byzantine Greeks of the Despotate of the Morea from the 1260s on, a process that was completed in 1320. The region fell into the hands of the Ottoman Turks along with the rest of the Despotate in 1460. With the exception of a period of Venetian rule in 1687\u20131715, the region remained under Turkish control until 1821.\nThe Latin phrase \"Et in Arcadia ego\", which is usually interpreted to mean \"Even in Arcadia there am I\", is an example of \"memento mori\", a cautionary reminder of the transitory nature of life and the inevitability of death. The phrase is most often associated with a 1647 painting by Nicolas Poussin, also known as \"The Arcadian Shepherds\". In the painting the phrase appears as an inscription on a tomb discovered by youthful figures in classical garb.\nModern history.\nArcadia was one of the centres of the Greek War of Independence which saw victories in their battles including one in Tripoli. After a victorious revolutionary war, Arcadia was finally incorporated into the newly created Greek state. Arcadia saw economic growth and small emigration.\nIn the 20th century, Arcadia experienced extensive population loss through emigration, mostly to the Americas. Many Arcadian villages lost half their inhabitants, and fears arose that they would turn into ghost towns. Arcadia now has a smaller population than Corinthia. Demographers expected that its population would halve between 1951 and the early 21st century. The population has fallen to 87,000 in 2011.\nAn earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter magnitude scale shook Megalopoli and the surrounding area in 1965. Large numbers of buildings were destroyed, leaving people homeless. Within a couple of years, the buildings were rebuilt anti-seismically. This earthquake revealed an underground source of lignite in the area, and in 1967 construction began on the Megalopoli Power Plant, which began operating in 1970. The mining area south of the plant is the largest mining area in the peninsula and continues to the present day with one settlement moved.\nIn July and August 2007 forest fires caused damage in Arcadia, notably in the mountains.\nIn 2008, a theory proposed by classicist Christos Mergoupis suggested that the mummified remains of Alexander the Great (not his actual tomb), may in fact be located in Gortynia-Arkadia, in the Peloponnese of Greece. Since 2008, this research is ongoing and currently being conducted in Greece. The research was first mentioned on CNN International in May 2008.\nLanguage.\nWhen, during the Greek Dark Ages (c. 1200 BC\u2013800 BC), Doric Greek was introduced to the Peloponnese, the older Arcadocypriot Greek language apparently survived in Arcadia. Arcadocypriot never became a literary dialect, but it is known from inscriptions. Tsan is a letter of the Greek alphabet occurring only in Arcadia, shaped like Cyrillic \u0418; it represents an affricate that developed from labiovelars in context where they became \"t\" in other dialects.\nThe Tsakonian language, still spoken on the coast of modern Arcadia (but in the Classical period considered the southern Argolid coast immediately adjoining Arcadia), is a descendant of Doric Greek, and as such is an exceptional example of a surviving regional dialect of archaic Greek. The principal cities of Tsakonia are the Arcadian coastal towns of Leonidio and Tyros.\nAdministration.\nThe regional unit Arcadia is subdivided into five municipalities. (Numbered as on map in infobox):\nPrefecture.\nAs a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Arcadia was created out of the former prefecture Arcadia (). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.\nProvinces.\nArcadia was divided into four provinces:\n\"Note:\" Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece.\nAncient and modern towns and cities.\nThe main towns in modern Arcadia are Tripoli, Astros, Vytina, Dimitsana, Lagkadia, Tyros, Leonidio, Levidi, Megalopoli and Stemnitsa.\nAncient cities include Acacesium, Asea, Astros, Athinaio, Daseae, Falaisia (Phalesia), Gortys, Hypsus (Stemnitsa), Heraia, Lusi, Lykaio, Lycosura, Mantineia, Megalopolis, Orchomenus (Orchomenos), Tegea, Thoknia, Trapezus, Trikolonoi, Tropaia, Tripoli, Tyros, other cities includes Basilis, Caphyae, Charisia, Ellison, Enispe, Kaous, Karyes, Methydrio, Melangeia, Oryx, Paroria, Pelagos, Rhipe, Stratia, Teuthis and several more. Cities which once belonged in Arcadia include Alea (now in Argolis), Amilos (now in Achaia), and Phigalia (now in Elis).\nEconomy.\nA thermoelectric power station which produces electricity for most of southern Greece, operates to the south of Megalopolis, along with a coal mine.\nIn agriculture, potato farms (dominant in central and northcentral Arcadia), mixed farming, olive groves, and pasture dominate the plains of Arcadia, especially in the area around Megalopolis and between Tripoli and Levidi.\nTransportation.\nThe A7 motorway (E65) highway connects Tripoli with Corinth and Athens. It is being extended further southwest to Megalopoli and Kalamata.\nArcadia has two tunnels. The Artemisio Tunnel opened first, followed by the tunnel east of Megalopolis; both serve traffic flowing between Messenia and Athens.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58229", "revid": "18953942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58229", "title": "Bacchanalia", "text": "Roman cults of the wine god and seer Bacchus\nThe Bacchanalia were unofficial, privately funded popular Roman festivals of Bacchus, based on various ecstatic elements of the Greek Dionysia. They were almost certainly associated with Rome's native cult of Liber, and probably arrived in Rome itself around 200 BC. Like all mystery religions of the ancient world, very little is known of their rites. They seem to have been popular and well-organised throughout the central and southern Italian peninsula.\nLivy, writing some 200 years after the event, offers a scandalized and extremely colourful account of the Bacchanalia, with frenzied rites, sexually violent initiations of both sexes, all ages and all social classes; he represents the cult as a murderous instrument of conspiracy against the state. Livy claims that seven thousand cult leaders and followers were arrested, and that most were executed. Livy believed the Bacchanalia scandal to be one of several indications of Rome's inexorable moral decay. Modern scholars take a skeptical approach to Livy's allegations.\nThe cult was not banned. Senatorial legislation to reform the Bacchanalia in 186 BC attempted to control their size, organisation, and priesthoods, under threat of the death penalty. This may have been motivated less by the kind of lurid and dramatic rumours that Livy describes than by the Senate's determination to assert its civil, moral and religious authority over Rome and its allies, after the prolonged social, political and military crisis of the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC). The reformed Bacchanalia rites may have been merged with the Liberalia festival. Bacchus, Liber and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable from the late Republican era (133 BC and onward), and their mystery cults persisted well into the Principate of the Roman Imperial era.\nBackground and development.\nThe Bacchanalia were Roman festivals of Bacchus, the Greco-Roman god of wine, freedom, intoxication and ecstasy. They were based on the Greek Dionysia and the Dionysian Mysteries, and probably arrived in Rome c. 200 BC via the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and from Etruria, Rome's northern neighbour. Tenney Frank suggests that some form of Dionysian worship may have been introduced to Rome by captives from the formerly Greek city of Tarentum in southern Italy, captured from the Carthaginians in 209 BC. Like all mystery cults, the Bacchanalia were held in strict privacy, and initiates were bound to secrecy; what little is known of the cult and its rites derives from Greek and Roman literature, plays, statuary and paintings. One of the earliest sources is Greek playwright Euripides's \"The Bacchae\", which won the Athenian Dionysia competition in 405 BC. The Bacchanalia may have had mystery elements and public elements; religious dramas which were performed in public, and private rites performed by acolytes and priests of the deity.\nLivy, the principal Roman literary source on the early Bacchanalia, names Paculla Annia, a Campanian priestess of Bacchus, as the founder of a private, unofficial Bacchanalia cult in Rome, based at the grove of Stimula, where the western slope of the Aventine Hill descends to the Tiber. The Aventine was an ethnically mixed district, strongly identified with Rome's plebeian class and the ingress of new and foreign cults. The wine and fertility god Liber Pater (\"The Free Father\"), divine patron of plebeian rights, freedoms and augury, had a long-established official cult in the nearby temple he shared with Ceres and Libera. Most Roman sources describe him as Rome's equivalent to Dionysus and Bacchus, both of whom were sometimes titled \"Eleutherios\" (liberator).\nBacchanalia scandal.\nLivy claims the earliest version of the Bacchanalia was open to women only, and held on three days of the year, in daylight; while in nearby Etruria, north of Rome, a \"Greek of humble origin, versed in sacrifices and soothsaying\" had established a nocturnal version, added wine and feasting to the mix, and thus acquired an enthusiastic following of women and men. The nocturnal version of the Bacchanalia involved wine-drinking to excess drunkenness and the free mingling of the sexes and classes; the rites also involved loud music.\nAccording to Livy's account, Publius Aebutius of the gens Aebutia was warned against the cult and its excesses by a courtesan, Hispala Faecenia. The Senate appointed Spurius Postumius Albinus and Quintus Marcius Philippus to investigate the cult. The inquiry claimed that under the cover of religion, priests and acolytes broke civil, moral and religious laws with impunity; weak-minded individuals could be persuaded to commit ritual or political murders undetected, at the behest of those who secretly controlled the cult, right in the heart of Rome. Livy claims that the cult held particular appeal to those of uneducated and fickle mind (\"levitas animi\"), such as the young, plebeians, women and \"men most like women\", and that most of the city's population was involved, even some members of Rome's highest class.\nReform.\nThe Legislation of 186 survives in the form of an inscription. Known as the \"Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus\", it brought the Bacchanalia under control of the Senate, and thus of the Roman pontifices. The existing cult chapters and colleges were dismantled. Congregations of mixed gender were permitted, but were limited to no more than two men and three women, and any Bacchanalia gathering must seek prior permission from the Senate. Men were forbidden Bacchus's priesthood.\nDespite their official suppression, illicit Bacchanals persisted covertly for many years, particularly in Southern Italy, their likely place of origin. The reformed, officially approved Bacchic cults would have borne little resemblance to the earlier crowded, ecstatic and uninhibited Bacchanalia. Similar attrition may have been imposed on Liber's cults; his perceived or actual association with the Bacchanalia may be the reason that his Liberalia \"ludi\" of 17 March were temporarily moved to Ceres' Cerealia of 12\u201319 April. They were restored when the ferocity of reaction eased, but in approved, much modified form.\nInterpretations.\nLivy's account of the Bacchanalia has been described as \"tendentious to say the least\". As a political and social conservative, he had a deep mistrust of mystery religions, and probably understood any form of Bacchanalia as a sign of Roman degeneracy. Though most of his \"dramatis personae\" are known historical figures, their speeches are implausibly circumstantial, and his characters, tropes and plot developments draw more from Roman satyr plays than from the Bacchanalia themselves. Paculla Annia is unlikely to have introduced all the changes he attributes to her.\nFor Livy, the cult's greatest offences arose from indiscriminate mixing of freeborn Romans of both sexes and all ages at night, a time when passions are easily aroused, especially given wine and unrestricted opportunity. Women at these gatherings, he says, outnumbered men; and his account has the consul Postumius stress the overwhelmingly female nature and organization of the cult. Yet the \"Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus\" itself allows women to outnumber men, by three to two, at any permitted gathering; and it expressly forbids Bacchic priesthoods to men. Livy's own narrative names all but one of the offending cult leaders as male, which seems to eliminate any perceived \"conspiracy of women\". Gender seems to have motivated the Senate's response no more than any other cause.\nLivy's consistent negative description of the cult's Greek origins and low moral character\u2014not even Bacchus is exempt from this judgment\u2014may have sought to justify its suppression as a sudden \"infiltration of too many Greek elements into Roman worship\". The cult had, however, been active in Rome for many years before its supposedly abrupt discovery, and Bacchic and Dionysiac cults had been part of life in Roman and allied, Greek-speaking Italy for many decades. Greek cults and Greek influences had been part of Rome's religious life since the 5th century BC, and Rome's acquisition of foreign cults\u2014Greek or otherwise\u2014through the alliance, treaty, capture or conquest was a cornerstone of its foreign policy, and an essential feature of its eventual hegemony. While the pace of such introductions had gathered rapidly during the 3rd century, contemporary evidence of the Bacchanalia reform betrays no anti-Greek or anti-foreign policy or sentiment.\nGruen interprets the \"Senatus consultum\" as a piece of \"Realpolitik\", a display of the Roman senate's authority to its Italian allies after the Second Punic War, and a reminder to any Roman politician, populist and would-be generalissimo that the Senate's collective authority trumped all personal ambition. Nevertheless, the extent and ferocity of the official response to the Bacchanalia was probably unprecedented, and betrays some form of moral panic on the part of Roman authorities; Burkert finds \"nothing comparable in religious history before the persecutions of Christians\".\nModern usage.\nIn modern usage, \"bacchanalia\" can mean any uninhibited or drunken revelry. The bacchanal in art describes any small group of revelers, often including satyrs and perhaps Bacchus or Silenus, usually in a landscape setting. The subject was popular from the Renaissance onwards, and usually included a large degree of nudity among the figures.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58230", "revid": "23512014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58230", "title": "Solon", "text": "Athenian statesman (c. 630 \u2013 c. 560 BC)\nSolon (; ; c.\u2009630\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009560\u00a0BC) was an archaic Athenian statesman, lawmaker, political philosopher, and poet. He was one of the Seven Sages of Greece and is credited with laying the foundations for Athenian democracy. Solon's efforts to legislate against political, economic and moral decline resulted in his constitutional reform overturning most of Draco's laws. \nSolon's reforms included debt relief later known and celebrated among Athenians as the (shaking off of burdens). He is described by Aristotle in the \"Athenian Constitution\" as \"the first people's champion\". Demosthenes credited Solon's reforms with starting a golden age.\nModern knowledge of Solon is limited by the fact that his works only survive in fragments and appear to feature interpolations by later authors. It is further limited by the general scarcity of documentary and archaeological evidence covering Athens in the early 6th century BC. \nAncient authors such as Philo of Alexandria, Herodotus, and Plutarch are the main sources, but wrote about Solon long after his death. Fourth-century BC orators, such as Aeschines, tended to attribute to Solon all the laws of their own, much later times.\nBiography.\nEarly life and ancestry.\nSolon was born in Athens around 630 BC. His family was distinguished in Attica because they belonged to a noble or Eupatrid clan. Solon's father was probably Execestides. If so, his lineage could be traced back to Codrus, the last King of Athens. According to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, he had a brother named Dropides, who was an ancestor (six generations removed) of Plato. According to Plutarch, Solon was related to the tyrant Pisistratus, for their mothers were cousins. Solon was eventually drawn into the unaristocratic pursuit of commerce.\nDefeat of Megara.\nWhen Athens and its neighbor and rival in the Saronic Gulf, Megara, were contesting the possession of Salamis, Solon was made leader of the Athenian forces. After repeated disasters, Solon was able to improve the morale of his troops through a nationalist poem he wrote about the island. Supported by Pisistratus, he defeated the Megarians either by means of a cunning trick or more directly through heroic battle around 595 BC. The Megarians, however, refused to give up their claim. The dispute was referred to the Spartans, who eventually awarded possession of the island to Athens on the strength of the case that Solon put to them. Plutarch professes admiration of Solon's elegy. The same poem was said by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius to have stirred Athenians more than any other verses that Solon wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne fragment describes assorted breads and cakes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They drink and some nibble honey and sesame cakes (), others their bread, other mixed with lentils. In that place, not one cake was unavailable of all those that the black earth bears for human beings, and all were present unstintingly.\nArchonship.\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, in 594 BC, Solon was chosen archon, or chief magistrate. Solon repealed all of Draco's laws except those relating to homicide. \nDuring Solon's time, many Greek city-states had seen the emergence of tyrants, opportunistic noblemen who had taken power on behalf of sectional interests. Solon was described by Plutarch as having been temporarily awarded autocratic powers by Athenian citizens on the grounds that he had the wisdom to sort out their differences for them in a peaceful and equitable manner. Some modern scholars believe these powers were in fact granted some years after Solon had been archon, when he would have been a member of the Areopagus and probably a more respected statesman by his peers. \nAs archon, Solon discussed his intended reforms with some friends. Knowing that he was about to cancel all debts, these friends took out loans and promptly bought some land. Suspected of complicity, Solon complied with his own law and released his own debtors, amounting to five talents (or 15 according to some sources). His friends never repaid their debts.\nTravels.\nAfter completing his work of reform, Solon surrendered his extraordinary authority and traveled abroad for ten years, so that the Athenians could not induce him to repeal any of his laws.\nWithin four years of Solon's departure, the old social rifts re-appeared, but with some new complications. There were irregularities in the new governmental procedures, elected officials sometimes refused to stand down from their posts and occasionally important posts were left vacant. It has even been said that some people blamed Solon for their troubles. Eventually one of Solon's relatives, Pisistratus, ended the factionalism by force, thus instituting an unconstitutionally gained tyranny. In Plutarch's account, Solon accused Athenians of stupidity and cowardice for allowing this to happen.\nSolon's first stop in his travels was Egypt. There, according to Herodotus, he visited the Pharaoh of Egypt, Amasis II. According to Plutarch, he spent some time and discussed philosophy with two Egyptian priests, Psenophis of Heliopolis and Sonchis of Sais. A character in two of Plato's dialogues, \"Timaeus\" and \"Critias\", claims Solon visited Neith's temple at Sais and received from the priests there an account of the history of Atlantis. Next, Solon sailed to Cyprus, where he oversaw the construction of a new capital for a local king, in gratitude for which the king named it Soloi.\nSolon's travels finally brought him to Sardis, capital of Lydia. According to Herodotus and Plutarch, he met with Croesus and gave the Lydian king advice, which Croesus failed to appreciate until it was too late. Croesus had considered himself to be the happiest man alive and Solon had advised him, \"Count no man happy until he be dead.\" The reasoning was that at any minute, fortune might turn on even the happiest man and make his life miserable. It was only after he had lost his kingdom to the Persian king Cyrus, while awaiting execution, that Croesus acknowledged the wisdom of Solon's advice.\nDeath and legacy.\nAfter his return to Athens, Solon became a staunch opponent of Pisistratus. In protest, and as an example to others, Solon stood outside his own home in full armour, urging all who passed to resist the machinations of the would-be tyrant. His efforts were in vain. Solon died shortly after Pisistratus usurped by force the autocratic power that Athens had once freely bestowed upon him. Solon died in Cyprus around the age of 70 and, in accordance with his will, his ashes were scattered around Salamis, the island where he was born.\nPausanias listed Solon among the Seven Sages, whose aphorisms adorned Apollo's temple in Delphi. Stobaeus in the Florilegium relates a story about a symposium where Solon's young nephew was singing a poem of Sappho's: Solon, upon hearing the song, asked the boy to teach him to sing it. When someone asked, \"Why should you waste your time on it?\", Solon replied, \"\", \"So that I may learn it before I die.\" Ammianus Marcellinus, however, told a similar story about Socrates and the poet Stesichorus, quoting the philosopher's rapture in almost identical terms: , meaning \"in order to leave life knowing a little more\".\nHistorical rivalries.\nThe social and political upheavals that characterized Athens in Solon's time have been variously interpreted by historians from ancient times to the present day. The historical account of Solon's Athens has evolved over many centuries into a set of contradictory stories or a complex story that might be interpreted in a variety of ways. As further evidence accumulates, and as historians continue to debate the issues, Solon's motivations and the intentions behind his reforms will continue to attract speculation.\nTwo contemporary historians have identified three distinct historical accounts of Solon's Athens, emphasizing quite different rivalries: economic and/or ideological rivalry, regional rivalry, and rivalry between aristocratic clans. These different accounts provide a convenient basis for an overview of the issues involved.\nEconomic and ideological.\nEconomic and ideological rivalry is a common theme in ancient sources. This sort of account emerges from Solon's poems, in which he casts himself in the role of a noble mediator between two intemperate and unruly factions. This same account is substantially taken up about three centuries later by the author of the Aristotelian \"Athenaion Politeia\" but with an interesting variation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0there was conflict between the nobles and the common people for an extended period. For the constitution they were under was oligarchic in every respect and especially in that the poor, along with their wives and children, were in slavery to the rich...All the land was in the hands of a few. And if men did not pay their rents, they themselves and their children were liable to be seized as slaves. The security for all loans was the debtor's prison up to the time of Solon. He was the first people's champion.\nHere Solon is presented as a partisan in a democratic cause whereas, judged from the viewpoint of his own poems, he was instead a mediator between rival factions. A still more significant variation in the ancient historical account appears in the writing of Plutarch in the late 1st \u2013 early 2nd century AD:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Athens was torn by recurrent conflict about the constitution. The city was divided into as many parties as there were geographical divisions in its territory. For the party of the people of the hills was most in favour of democracy, that of the people of the plain was most in favour of oligarchy, while the third group, the people of the coast, which preferred a mixed form of constitution somewhat between the other two, formed an obstruction and prevented the other groups from gaining control.\nRegional.\nRegional rivalry is a theme commonly found among modern scholars. \"The new picture which emerged was one of strife between regional groups, united by local loyalties and led by wealthy landowners. Their goal was to take control of the central government at Athens and with it dominate over their rivals from other districts of Attica.\"&lt;br&gt;Regional factionalism was inevitable in a relatively large territory such as Athens possessed. In most Greek city states, a farmer could conveniently reside in a town and travel to and from his fields every day. According to Thucydides, on the other hand, most Athenians continued to live in rural settlements right up until the Peloponnesian War. The effects of regionalism in a large territory could be seen in Laconia, where Sparta had gained control through intimidation and resettlement of some of its neighbours and enslavement of the rest. Attika in Solon's time seemed to be moving towards a similarly ugly solution with many citizens in danger of being reduced to the status of helots.\nClan.\nRivalry between clans is a theme recently developed by some scholars, based on an appreciation of the political significance of kinship groupings. According to this account, bonds of kinship rather than local loyalties were the decisive influence on events in archaic Athens. An Athenian belonged not only to a phyle or tribe and one of its subdivisions, the phratry or brotherhood, but also to an extended family, clan or genos. It has been argued that these interconnecting units of kinship reinforced a hierarchic structure with aristocratic clans at the top. Thus rivalries between aristocratic clans could engage all levels of society irrespective of any regional ties. In that case, the struggle between rich and poor was the struggle between powerful aristocrats and the weaker affiliates of their rivals or perhaps even with their own rebellious affiliates.\nSolon's reforms.\nSolon's laws were inscribed on , large wooden slabs or cylinders attached to a series of axles that stood upright in the Prytaneion. Originally the axones recorded laws enacted by Draco in the late 7th century (traditionally 621 BC). Nothing of Draco's codification has survived except for a law relating to homicide, yet there is consensus among scholars that it did not amount to anything like a constitution. \nDuring his visit to Athens, Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer reported that the inscribed laws of Solon were still displayed by the Prytaneion. Fragments of the axones were still visible in Plutarch's time but today the only records we have of Solon's laws are fragmentary quotes and comments in literary sources such as those written by Plutarch himself. Moreover, the language of his laws was archaic even by the standards of the fifth century and this caused interpretation problems for ancient commentators. Modern scholars doubt the reliability of these sources and our knowledge of Solon's legislation is therefore actually very limited in its details.\nGenerally, Solon's reforms appear to have been constitutional, economic, moral, and sexual in their scope. This distinction, though somewhat artificial, does at least provide a convenient framework within which to consider the laws that have been attributed to Solon. Some short-term consequences of his reforms are considered at the end of the section. \nConstitutional.\nDepending on how we interpret the historical facts known to us, Solon's constitutional reforms were either a radical anticipation of democratic government, or they merely provided a plutocratic flavour to a stubbornly aristocratic regime, or else the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. \nBefore Solon's reforms, the Athenian state was administered by nine archons appointed or elected annually by the Areopagus on the basis of noble birth and wealth. There was an assembly of Athenian citizens (the Ekklesia) but the lowest class (the Thetes) was not admitted and its deliberative procedures were controlled by the nobles. There therefore seemed to be no means by which an archon could be called to account for breach of oath unless the Areopagus favoured his prosecution. \nAccording to the \"Athenian Constitution\", Solon legislated for all citizens to be admitted into the Ekklesia and for a court (the Heliaia) to be formed from all the citizens. The Heliaia appears to have been the Ekklesia, or some representative portion of it, sitting as a jury. By giving common people the power not only to elect officials but also to call them to account, Solon appears to have established the foundations of a true republic.\nClasses.\nThere is consensus among scholars that Solon lowered the requirements \u2013 those that existed in terms of financial and social qualifications \u2013 which applied to election to public office. The Solonian constitution divided citizens into four political classes defined according to assessable property a classification that might previously have served the state for military or taxation purposes only. The standard unit for this assessment was one \"medimnos\" (approximately 12 gallons) of cereals and yet the kind of classification set out below might be considered too simplistic to be historically accurate.\nAccording to the \"Athenian Constitution\", only the were eligible for election to high office as archons and therefore only they gained admission into the Areopagus. A modern view affords the same privilege to the . The top three classes were eligible for a variety of lesser posts and only the were excluded from all public office.\nEconomic.\nThe real motives behind Solon's economic reforms are as questionable as his real motives for constitutional reform. Were the poor being forced to serve the needs of a changing economy, was the economy being reformed to serve the needs of the poor, or were Solon's policies the manifestation of a struggle taking place between poorer citizens and the aristocrats?\nSolon's economic reforms need to be understood in the context of the primitive, subsistence economy that prevailed both before and after his time. Most Athenians were still living in rural settlements right up to the Peloponnesian War. Opportunities for trade even within the Athenian borders were limited. The typical farming family, even in classical times, barely produced enough to satisfy its own needs. Opportunities for international trade were minimal. It has been estimated that, even in Roman times, goods rose 40% in value for every 100 miles they were carried over land, but only 1.3% for the same distance were they carried by ship and yet there is no evidence that Athens possessed any merchant ships until around 525 BC. Until then, the narrow warship doubled as a cargo vessel. Athens, like other Greek city states in the 7th century BC, was faced with increasing population pressures and by about 525 BC it was able to feed itself only in good years.\nSolon's reforms can thus be seen to have taken place at a crucial period of economic transition, when a subsistence rural economy increasingly required the support of a nascent commercial sector. The specific economic reforms credited to Solon are these:\nCoinage.\nIt is generally assumed, on the authority of ancient commentators, that Solon also reformed the Athenian coinage. However, recent numismatic studies now lead to the conclusion that Athens probably had no coinage until around 560 BC, well after Solon's reforms. Nevertheless, there are now reasons to suggest that monetization had already begun before Solon's reforms. By the early sixth century the Athenians were using silver in the form of a variety of bullion silver pieces for monetary payments. Drachma and obol as a term of bullion value had already been adopted, although the corresponding standard weights were probably unstable.\nForeign trade.\nSolon's economic reforms succeeded in stimulating foreign trade. Athenian black-figure pottery was exported in increasing quantities and good quality throughout the Aegean between 600 BC and 560 BC, a success story that coincided with a decline in trade in Corinthian pottery. The ban on the export of grain might be understood as a relief measure for the benefit of the poor. However, the encouragement of olive production for export could actually have led to increased hardship for many Athenians to the extent that it led to a reduction in the amount of land dedicated to grain. Moreover, an olive tree produces no fruit for the first six years (but farmers' difficulty of lasting until payback may also give rise to a mercantilist argument in favour of supporting them through that, since the British case illustrates that \"One domestic policy that had a lasting impact was the conversion of 'waste lands' to agricultural use. Mercantilists felt that to maximize a nation's power all land and resources had to be used to their utmost\").\nMoral.\nIn his poems, Solon portrays Athens as being under threat from the unrestrained greed and arrogance of its citizens. Even the earth (Gaia), the mighty mother of the gods, had been enslaved. The visible symbol of this perversion of the natural and social order was a boundary marker called a , a wooden or stone pillar indicating that a farmer was in debt or under contractual obligation to someone else, either a noble patron or a creditor.\nUp until Solon's time, land was the inalienable property of a family or clan and it could not be sold or mortgaged. This was no disadvantage to a clan with large landholdings since it could always rent out farms in a sharecropping system. A family struggling on a small farm however could not use the farm as security for a loan even if it owned the farm. Instead the farmer would have to offer himself and his family as security, providing some form of slave labour in lieu of repayment. Equally, a family might voluntarily pledge part of its farm income or labour to a powerful clan in return for its protection. Farmers subject to these sorts of arrangements were loosely known as indicating that they either paid or kept a sixth of a farm's annual yield. In the event of 'bankruptcy', or failure to honour the contract stipulated by the , farmers and their families could in fact be sold into slavery.\nSolon's reform of these injustices was later known and celebrated among Athenians as the (shaking off of burdens). As with all his reforms, there is considerable scholarly debate about its real significance. Many scholars are content to accept the account given by the ancient sources, interpreting it as a cancellation of debts, while others interpret it as the abolition of a type of feudal relationship, and some prefer to explore new possibilities for interpretation. The reforms included:\nThe removal of the clearly provided immediate economic relief for the most oppressed group in Attica, and it also brought an immediate end to the enslavement of Athenians by their countrymen. Some Athenians had already been sold into slavery abroad and some had fled abroad to escape enslavement \u2013 Solon proudly records in verse the return of this diaspora. It has been cynically observed, however, that few of these unfortunates were likely to have been recovered. It has been observed also that the not only removed slavery and accumulated debt but may also have removed the ordinary farmer's only means of obtaining further credit.\nThe however was merely one set of reforms within a broader agenda of moral reformation. Other reforms included:\nDemosthenes claimed that the city's subsequent golden age included \"personal modesty and frugality\" among the Athenian aristocracy.\nSexual.\nAs a regulator of Athenian society, Solon, according to some authors, also formalized its sexual mores. According to a surviving fragment from a work (\"Brothers\") by the comic playwright Philemon, Solon established publicly funded brothels at Athens in order to \"democratize\" the availability of sexual pleasure. While the veracity of this comic account is open to doubt, at least one modern author considers it significant that in Classical Athens, three hundred or so years after the death of Solon, there existed a discourse that associated his reforms with an increased availability of heterosexual contacts.\nAncient authors also say that Solon regulated pederastic relationships in Athens; this has been presented as an adaptation of custom to the new structure of the . According to various authors, ancient lawgivers (and therefore Solon by implication) drew up a set of laws that were intended to promote and safeguard the institution of pederasty and to control abuses against freeborn boys. In particular, the orator Aeschines cites laws excluding slaves from wrestling halls and forbidding them to enter pederastic relationships with the sons of citizens. Accounts of Solon's laws by 4th-century orators like Aeschines, however, are considered unreliable for a number of reasons:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Attic pleaders did not hesitate to attribute to him (Solon) any law which suited their case, and later writers had no criterion by which to distinguish earlier from later works. Nor can any complete and authentic collection of his statutes have survived for ancient scholars to consult.\nBesides the alleged legislative aspect of Solon's involvement with pederasty, there were also suggestions of personal involvement. Ancient readers concluded, based on his own erotic poetry, that Solon himself had a preference for boys. According to some ancient authors Solon had taken the future tyrant Pisistratus as his . Aristotle, writing around 330 BC, attempted to refute that belief, claiming that \"those are manifestly talking nonsense who pretend that Solon was the lover of Pisistratus, for their ages do not admit of it\", as Solon was about thirty years older than Pisistratus. Nevertheless, the tradition persisted. Four centuries later Plutarch ignored Aristotle's skepticism and recorded the following anecdote, supplemented with his own conjectures:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And they say Solon loved [Pisistratus]; and that is the reason, I suppose, that when afterwards they differed about the government, their enmity never produced any hot and violent passion, they remembered their old kindnesses, and retained \"Still in its embers living the strong fire\" of their love and dear affection.\nA century after Plutarch, Aelian also said that Pisistratus had been Solon's . Despite its persistence, however, it is not known whether the account is historical or fabricated. It has been suggested that the tradition presenting a peaceful and happy coexistence between Solon and Pisistratus was cultivated during the latter's dominion, in order to legitimize his own rule, as well as that of his sons. Whatever its source, later generations lent credence to the narrative. Solon's presumed pederastic desire was thought in antiquity to have found expression also in his poetry, which is today represented only in a few surviving fragments. The authenticity of all the poetic fragments attributed to Solon is however uncertain \u2013 in particular, pederastic aphorisms ascribed by some ancient sources to Solon have been ascribed by other sources to Theognis instead.\nPoems.\nIt is recorded that Solon wrote poetry for pleasure, as patriotic propaganda, and in defence of his constitutional reform. Solon's verses have come down to us in fragmentary quotations by ancient authors such as Plutarch and Demosthenes, who used them to illustrate their own arguments. It is possible that some fragments have been wrongly attributed to him and some scholars have detected interpolations by later authors. He was also the first citizen of Athens to reference the goddess Athena (fr. 4.1\u20134).\nThe literary merit of Solon's verse is generally considered unexceptional. Solon's poetry can be said to appear 'self-righteous' and 'pompous' at times and he once composed an elegy with moral advice for a more gifted elegiac poet, Mimnermus. Most of the extant verses show him writing in the role of a political activist determined to assert personal authority and leadership. They have been described by the German classicist Wilamowitz as a \"versified harangue\" (). According to Plutarch, however, Solon originally wrote poetry for amusement, discussing pleasure in a popular rather than philosophical way. Solon's elegiac style is said to have been influenced by the example of Tyrtaeus. He also wrote iambic and trochaic verses, which, according to one modern scholar, are livelier and more direct than his elegies and possibly paved the way for the iambics of Athenian drama.\nSolon's verses are mainly significant for historical rather than aesthetic reasons, as a personal record of his reforms and attitudes. However, poetry is not an ideal genre for communicating facts and very little detailed information can be derived from the surviving fragments. According to Solon the poet, Solon the reformer was a voice for political moderation in Athens at a time when his fellow citizens were increasingly polarized by social and economic differences:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nHere translated by the English poet John Dryden, Solon's words define a 'moral high ground' where differences between rich and poor can be reconciled or maybe just ignored. His poetry indicates that he attempted to use his extraordinary legislative powers to establish a peaceful settlement between the country's rival factions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nHis attempts evidently were misunderstood:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58231", "revid": "14457240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58231", "title": "Bacchylides", "text": "Greek lyric poet (c. 518 \u2013 c. 451 BC)\nBacchylides (; \"Bakkhulides\"; c.\u2009518 \u2013 c.\u2009451 BC) was a Greek lyric poet. Later Greeks included him in the canonical list of Nine Lyric Poets, which included his uncle Simonides. The elegance and polished style of his lyrics have been noted in Bacchylidean scholarship since at least Longinus. Some scholars have characterized these qualities as superficial charm. He has often been compared unfavourably with his contemporary, Pindar, as \"a kind of Boccherini to Pindar's Haydn\". However, the differences in their styles do not allow for easy comparison, and translator Robert Fagles has written that \"to blame Bacchylides for not being Pindar is as childish a judgement as to condemn ... Marvell for missing the grandeur of Milton\". His career coincided with the ascendency of dramatic styles of poetry, as embodied in the works of Aeschylus or Sophocles, and he is in fact considered one of the last poets of major significance within the more ancient tradition of purely lyric poetry. The most notable features of his lyrics are their clarity in expression and simplicity of thought, making them an ideal introduction to the study of Greek lyric poetry in general and to Pindar's verse in particular.\nLife.\nThis precept, from one of Bacchylides' extant fragments, was considered by his modern editor, Richard Claverhouse Jebb, to be typical of the poet's temperament: \"If the utterances scattered throughout the poems warrant a conjecture, Bacchylides was of placid temper; amiably tolerant; satisfied with a modest lot; not free from some tinge of that pensive melancholy which was peculiarly Ionian; but with good sense...\"\nBacchylides' lyrics do not seem to have been popular in his own lifetime. Lyrics by his uncle, Simonides, and his rival, Pindar, were known in Athens and were sung at parties, they were parodied by Aristophanes and quoted by Plato, but no trace of Bacchylides' work can be found until the Hellenistic age, when Callimachus began writing some commentaries on them. Like Simonides and Pindar, however, Bacchylides composed lyrics to appeal to the sophisticated tastes of a social elite and his patrons, though relatively few in number, covered a wide geographical area around the Mediterranean, including for example Delos in the Aegean Sea, Thessaly in the north of the Greek mainland, and Sicily or Magna Graecia in the west. It has been inferred from the elegance and quiet charm of his lyrics that he only gradually acquired fame towards the end of his life.\nBeing drawn from sources compiled long after his death, the details of Bacchylides's life are sketchy and sometimes contradictory. According to Strabo, he was born in Ioulis, on the island of Keos, and his mother was the sister of Simonides. According to Suda, his father's name was Meidon and his grandfather, also named Bacchylides, was a famous athlete, yet according to Etymologicum Magnum his father's name was Meidylus. There is an ancient tradition, upheld for example by Eustathius and Thomas Magister, that he was younger than Pindar and some modern scholars have endorsed it, such as Jebb, who assigns his birth to around 507 BC, whereas Bowra, for example, opted for a much earlier date, around 524\u20131 BC. Most modern scholars however treat Bacchylides as an exact contemporary of Pindar, placing his birth around 518 BC. According to one account, Bacchylides was banished for a time from his native Keos and spent this period as an exile in Peloponnesus, where his genius ripened and he did the work which established his fame. Plutarch is the only ancient source for this account and yet it is considered credible on the basis of some literary evidence (Pindar wrote a paean celebrating Keos, in which he says on behalf of the island \"I am renowned for my athletic achievements among Greeks\" [Paean 4, epode 1], a circumstance that suggests that Bacchylides himself was unavailable at the time.) Observations by Eusebius and Georgius Syncellus can be taken to indicate that Bacchylides might have been still alive at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, but modern scholars have differed widely in estimates of the year of his death \u2013 Jebb, for example sets it at 428 BC and yet a date around 451 BC is more favoured.\nKeos, where Bacchylides was born and raised, had long had a history of poetical and musical culture, especially in its association with Delos, the focal point of the Cyclades and the principal sanctuary of the Ionian race, where the people of Keos annually sent choirs to celebrate festivals of Apollo. There was a thriving cult of Apollo on Keos too, including a temple at Carthaea, a training ground for choruses where, according to Athenaeus, Bacchylides's uncle, Simonides, had been a teacher in his early years. Ceans had a strong sense of their national identity, characterized by their own exotic legends, national folklore and a successful tradition of athletic competition, especially in running and boxing \u2013 making the island a congenial home for a boy of quick imagination. Athletic victories achieved by Ceans in panhellenic festivals were recorded at Ioulis on slabs of stone and thus Bacchylides could readily announce, in an ode celebrating one such victory (Ode 2), a total of twenty-seven victories won by his countrymen at the Isthmian Games. Ceans had participated in the defeat of the Persians at the Battle of Salamis and they could take pride in the fact that an elegy composed by Bacchylides's uncle was chosen by Athens to commemorate the Athenians who fell at the Battle of Marathon. Being only thirteen miles from the Athenian cape Sunium, Keos was in fact necessarily responsive to Athenian influences.\nBacchylides's career as a poet probably benefited from the high reputation of his uncle, Simonides, whose patrons, when Bacchylides was born, already included Hipparchus, brother of Hippias the tyrant of Athens (527\u201310 BC) and cultural coordinator of the city at that time. Simonides later introduced his nephew to ruling families in Thessaly and to the Sicilian tyrant, Hieron of Syracuse, whose glittering court attracted artists of the calibre of Pindar and Aeschylus. Bacchylides's first notable success came sometime after 500 BC with commissions from Athens for the great Delian festival (Ode 17) and from Macedonia for a song to be sung at a symposium for the young prince, Alexander I (fr. 20B). Soon he was competing with Pindar for commissions from the leading families of Aegina and, in 476 BC, their rivalry seems to have reached the highest levels when Bacchylides composed an ode celebrating Hieron's first victory at the Olympian Games (Ode 5). Pindar celebrated the same victory but used the occasion to advise the tyrant of the need for moderation in one's personal conduct (Pindar's Olympian Ode 1), whereas Bacchylides probably offered his own ode as a free sample of his skill in the hope of attracting future commissions. Bacchylides was commissioned by Hieron in 470 BC, this time to celebrate his triumph in the chariot race at the Pythian Games (Ode 4). Pindar also composed a celebratory ode for this victory (Pindar's Pythian Ode 1), including however stern, moral advice for the tyrant to rule wisely. Pindar was not commissioned to celebrate Hieron's subsequent victory in the chariot race at the Olympic Games in 468 BC \u2013 this, the most prestigious of Hieron's victories, was however celebrated by Bacchylides (Ode 3). The tyrant's apparent preference for Bacchylides over Pindar on this occasion might have been partly due to the Cean poet's simpler language and not just to his less moralizing posture, and yet it is also possible that Bacchylides and his uncle were simply better suited to palace politics than was their more high-minded rival. Alexandrian scholars in fact interpreted a number of passages in Pindar as hostile allusions to Bacchylides and Simonides and this interpretation has been endorsed by modern scholars also.\nAs a composer of choral lyrics, Bacchylides was probably responsible also for the performance, involving him in frequent travel to venues where musicians and choirs awaited instruction. Ancient authorities testify to his visit to the court of Hieron (478\u2013467) and this is indeed indicated by his fifth Ode (476 BC), where the word \"xenos\" (V.11) implies that he had already been Hieron's guest, (probably accompanied by his uncle). Verses 15 and 16 of his third ode (468 BC), also for Hieron, indicate that he might have composed that work at Syracuse.\nWork.\nHistory.\nThe poems were collected into critical editions sometime in the late 3rd century BC by the Alexandrian scholar, Aristophanes of Byzantium, who probably restored them to their appropriate metres after finding them written in prose form. They were arranged in nine 'books', exemplifying the following genres (Bacchylides in fact composed in a greater variety of genres than any of the other lyric poets who comprise the canonic nine, with the exception of Pindar, who composed in ten):\nThe Alexandrian grammarian Didymus (circa 30 BC) wrote commentaries on the work of Bacchylides and the poems appear, from the finding of papyri fragments, to have been popular reading in the first three centuries AD. Their popularity seems to have continued into the 4th century also: Ammianus Marcellinus (xxv. 4) observed that the emperor Julian enjoyed reading Bacchylides, and the largest collection of quotations that survived up until the modern era was assembled by Stobaeus (early 5th century). All that remained of Bacchylides's poetry by 1896, however, were sixty-nine fragments, totalling 107 lines. These few remains of his writings were collected by Brunck, Bergk, Bland, Hartung, and Neue. The oldest sources on Bacchylides and his work are scholia on Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Aristophanes, Apollonius Rhodius and Callimachus. Other fragments and 'notices' are sprinkled through the surviving works of ancient authors, which they used to illustrate various points they were making, as for example:\nFortunately for Bacchylidean scholarship, a papyrus came to light in Egypt at the end of the 19th century with a text of Greek uncials, which a local claimed to have found in a ransacked tomb, between the feet of a mummy. It was snapped up for a \"preposterous\" price by the Egyptologist Wallis Budge, of the British Museum. Budge's plan to return to the museum with the papyrus was unacceptable to the British Consul and to the Egyptian Service of Antiquities so he resorted to desperate measures. In an elaborate plan involving a crate of oranges, switched trains and covert embarkations including a midnight rendezvous with a P&amp;O steamship, he eventually sailed from the Suez with the papyrus dismembered and disguised as a packet of photographs. He presented his find in 1896 to Frederic Kenyon in the British Museum's Department of Manuscripts. Kenyon reassembled 1382 lines, of which 1070 were perfect or easily restored and, the following year, he published an edition of twenty poems, six of them nearly complete. Some more pieces of the Egyptian fragments were fitted together by Friedrich Blass in Germany and then followed the authoritative edition of Bacchylides' poetry by Richard Claverhouse Jebb \u2013 a combination of scholars that inspired one academic to comment: \"we almost had the Renaissance back again\".\nAs noted by Frederic Kenyon, the papyrus was originally a roll probably about seventeen feet long and about ten inches high, written in the Ptolemaic period, with some Roman characteristics that indicate a transition between styles, somewhere around 50 BC. It reached England in about two hundred torn fragments, the largest about twenty inches in length and containing four and a half columns of writing, the smallest being scraps with barely enough space for one or two letters. The beginning and end sections were missing and the damage done to the roll was not entirely the result of its recent discovery. Kenyon gradually pieced the fragments together, making three independent sections: the first, nine feet long with twenty-two columns of writing; the next section, a little over two feet long with six columns; the third, three and a half feet long with ten columns \u2013 a total length of almost fifteen feet and thirty-nine columns, in which form the papyrus remains in the British Library. Friedrich Blass later pieced together some of the still detached fragments and concluded that two of the poems on the restored roll (Odes vi. and vii., as numbered by Kenyon in the \"editio princeps\") must be parts of a single ode (for Lachon of Keos) \u2013 hence even today the poems can be found numbered differently, with Jebb for example one of those following Blass's lead and numbering the poems differently from Kenyon from poem 8 onwards (Kenyon 9 = Jebb 8 and so on).\nBacchylides had become, almost overnight, among the best represented poets of the canonic nine, with about half as many extant verses as Pindar, adding about a hundred new words to Greek lexicons. Ironically, his newly discovered poems sparked a renewed interest in Pindar's work, with whom he was compared so unfavourably that \"the students of Pindaric poetry almost succeeded in burying Bacchylides all over again.\"\nStyle.\nMuch of Bacchylides's poetry was commissioned by proud and ambitious aristocrats, a dominant force in Greek political and cultural life in the 6th and early part of the 5th centuries, yet such patrons were gradually losing influence in an increasingly democratic Greek world. The kind of lofty and stately poetry that celebrated the achievements of these archaic aristocrats was within the reach of 'The Cean nightingale', yet he seems to have been more at home in verses of a humbler and lighter strain, even venturing on folksiness and humour.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The distinctive merits of Bacchylides, his transparent clearness, his gift of narrative, his felicity in detail, the easy flow of his elegant verse, rather fitted him to become a favourite with readers... he was a poet who gave pleasure without demanding effort, a poet with whom the reader could at once feel at home. \u2013 Richard Claverhouse Jebb\nLyric poetry was still a vigorous art-form and its genres were already fully developed when Bacchylides started out on his career. From the time of the Peloponnesian War, around the end of his life, the art-form was in decline, as exemplified by the inferior dithyrambs of Philoxenos of Cythera. Meanwhile, tragedy, as developed by Athenian dramatists of the calibre of Aeschylus and Sophocles, had begun to emerge as the leading poetic genre, borrowing the literary dialect, the metres and poetic devices of lyric poetry in general and the dithyramb in particular (Aristotle \"Poetics\" IV 1449a). The debt however was mutual and Bacchylides borrowed from tragedy for some of his effects \u2013 thus Ode 16, with its myth of Deianeira, seems to assume audience knowledge of Sophocles's play, \"Women of Trachis\", and Ode 18 echoes three plays \u2013 Aeschylus's \"Persians\" and \"Suppliants\" and Sophocles's \"Oedipus Rex\". His vocabulary shows the influence of Aeschylus with several words being common to both poets and found nowhere else. The use of gripping and exciting narrative and the immediacy gained from the frequent use of direct speech are thought to be among Bacchylides's best qualities, influencing later poets such as Horace (who imitated him, according to Pomponius Porphyrion, in \"Carmen\" I. 15, where Nereus predicts the destruction of Troy). These narrative qualities were modelled largely on the work of Stesichorus, whose lyrical treatment of heroic myth influenced, for instance, Ode 5. Whereas however Stesichorus developed graphic images in his poetry that subsequently became established in vase painting, Bacchylides merely employed images already current in his own day. \nSimonides, the uncle of Bacchylides, was another strong influence on his poetry, as for example in his metrical range, mostly dactylo-epitrite in form, with some Aeolic rhythms and a few iambics. The surviving poems in fact are not metrically difficult, with the exception of two odes (Odes XV and XVI, Jebb). He shared Simonides's approach to vocabulary, employing a very mild form of the traditional, literary Doric dialect, with some Aeolic words and some traditional epithets borrowed from epic. Like Simonides, he followed the lyric tradition of coining compound adjectives \u2013 a tradition in which the poet was expected to be both innovative and tasteful \u2013 but the results are thought by some modern scholars to be uneven. Many of his epithets however serve a thematic and not just a decorative function, as for instance in Ode 3, where the \"bronze-walled court\" and \"well-built halls\" of Croesus (Ode 3.30\u201331 and 3.46) contrast architecturally with the \"wooden house\" of his funeral pyre (Ode 3.49), in an effect that aims at pathos and which underscores the moral of the ode.\nBacchylides is renowned for his use of picturesque detail, giving life and colour to descriptions with small but skilful touches, often demonstrating a keen sense of beauty or splendour in external nature: a radiance, \"as of fire,\" streams from the forms of the Nereids (XVI. 103 if. Jebb); an athlete shines out among his fellows like \"the bright moon of the mid-month night\" among the stars (VIII. 27 if.); the sudden gleam of hope which comes to the Trojans by the withdrawal of Achilles is like a ray of sunshine \"from beneath the edge of a storm-cloud\" (XII \u2013 105 if.); the shades of the departed, as seen by Heracles on the banks of the Cocytus, resemble countless leaves fluttering in the wind on \"the gleaming headlands of Ida\" (V. 65 if ). Imagery is employed sparingly but often with impressive and beautiful results, such as in the simile of the eagle in Ode 5 below.\nOde 5.\nBacchylides has often been compared unflatteringly with Pindar, as for example by the French critic, Henri Weil: \"There is no doubt that he fails of the elevation, and also of the depth, of Pindar. The soaring wing was refused him, and he should never have compared himself, as he does somewhere, to an eagle.\"\nThe image of the eagle occurs in Ode 5, which was composed for Hieron of Syracuse in celebration of his Olympic victory with the race-horse Pherenicus in 476 BC. Pindar's \"Olympian Ode 1\" celebrates the same race and the two poems allow for some interesting comparisons. Bacchylides's Ode 5 includes, in addition to a brief reference to the victory itself, a long mythical episode on a related theme, and a gnomic or philosophical reflection \u2013 elements that occur also in Pindar's ode and that seem typical of the victory ode genre. Whereas however Pindar's ode focuses on the myth of Pelops and Tantalus and demonstrates a stern moral about the need for moderation in personal conduct (a reflection on Hieron's political excesses), Bacchylides's ode focuses on the myths of Meleager and Hercules, demonstrating the moral that nobody is fortunate or happy in all things (possibly a reflection on Hieron's chronic illness). This difference in moral posturing was typical of the two poets, with Bacchylides adopting a quieter, simpler and less forceful manner than Pindar. Frederic G. Kenyon, who edited the papyrus poems, took an unsympathetic view of Bacchylides's treatment of myth in general:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The myths are introduced mechanically, with little attempt to connect them with the subject of the ode. In some cases they appear to have no special appropriateness but to be introduced merely at the poet's pleasure. There is no originality of structure; the poet's art is shown in craftsmanship rather than in invention. \u2013 Frederic G. Kenyon\nBacchylides however might be better understood as an heir to Stesichorus, being more concerned with story-telling per se, than as a rival of Pindar. But irrespective of any scruples about his treatment of myth, Bacchylides is thought to demonstrate in Ode 5 some of his finest work and the description of the eagle's flight, near the beginning of the poem, has been called by one modern scholar \"the most impressive passage in his extant poetry.\"\n...Quickly\ncutting the depth of air\non high with tawny wings\nthe eagle, messenger of Zeus\nwho thunders in wide lordship,\nis bold, relying on his mighty\nstrength, while other birds\ncower, shrill-voiced, in fear.\nThe great earth's mountain peaks do not hold him back,\nnor the tireless sea's\nrough-tossing waves, but in\nthe limitless expanse\nhe guides his fine sleek plumage\nalong the West Wind's breezes,\nmanifest to men's sight.\nSo now for me too countless paths extend in all directions\nby which to praise your [i.e. Hieron's] prowess...(Ode 5.16\u201333)\nBacchylides's image of the poet as an eagle winging across the sea was not original \u2013 Pindar had already used it earlier (\"Nemean Odes\" 5.20\u201321). In fact, in the same year that both poets celebrated Pherenicus's Olympic victory, Pindar also composed an ode for Theron of Acragas (\"Olympian\" 2), in which he likens himself to an eagle confronted with chattering ravens \u2013 possibly a reference to Bacchylides and his uncle. It is possible in that case that Bacchylides's image of himself as an eagle in Ode 5 was a retort to Pindar. Moreover, Bacchylides's line \"So now for me too countless paths extend in all directions\" has a close resemblance to lines in one of Pindar's Isthmian Odes (1.1\u20132), \"A thousand ways\u00a0... open on every side widespread before me\" but, as the date of Pindar's Isthmian Ode is uncertain, it is not clear in this case who was imitating whom. According to Kenyon, Pindar's idiosyncratic genius entitles him to the benefit of a doubt in all such cases: \"... if there be actual imitation at all, it is fairly safe to conclude that it is on the part of Bacchylides.\" In fact one modern scholar has observed in Bacchylides a general tendency towards imitation, sometimes approaching the level of quotation: in this case, the eagle simile in Ode 5 may be thought to imitate a passage in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (375\u201383), and the countless leaves fluttering in the wind on \"the gleaming headlands of Ida\", mentioned later in the ode, recall a passage in \"Iliad\" (6.146\u20139). A tendency to imitate other poets is not peculiar to Bacchylides, however \u2013 it was common in ancient poetry, as for example in a poem by Alcaeus (fragment 347), which virtually quotes a passage from Hesiod (\"Works and Days\" 582\u20138).\nPindar's Olympian Ode 1 and Bacchylides's Ode 5 differ also in their description of the race \u2013 while Pindar's reference to Pherenicus is slight and general (\"...speeding / by Alpheus' bank, / His lovely limbs ungoaded on the course...\": \"Olympian\" I.20\u201321), Bacchylides describes the running of the winner more vividly and in rather more detail \u2013 a difference that is characteristic of the two poets:\nWhen Pherenicos with his auburn mane\nran like the wind\nbeside the eddies of broad Alpheios,\nEos, with her arms all golden, saw his victory,\nand so too at most holy Pytho.\nCalling the earth to witness, I declare\nthat never yet has any horse outstripped him\nin competition, sprinkling him with dust\nas he rushed forward to the goal.\nFor like the North Wind's blast,\nkeeping the man who steers him safe,\nhe hurtles onward, bringing to Hieron,\nthat generous host, victory with its fresh applause.(Ode 5.37\u201349)\nUltimately, however, Bacchylides and Pindar share many of the same goals and techniques \u2013 the difference is largely one of temperament:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They share a common repertory of motifs, images, conventions, diction; and they affirm and celebrate the heroic values of an ancient aristocracy. Both seek to bridge the gap between the fleeting present in its glorious display of beauty and energy and the eternal world of the gods. Pindar however grasps the contrasts between the extremes of mortality and divinity with greater intensity than Bacchylides and for this reason seems the more philosophical and meditative, more concerned with ultimate questions of life and death, transience and permanence. Bacchylides prefers to observe the gentler play of shadow and sadness over the sensuous surface of his brilliant world. \u2013 Charles Segal\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You, Pindar, holy mouth of the Muses, and you, talkative Siren, Bacchylides\u00a0...-anon. in Palatine Anthology\nOde 13.\nOde 13 of the Bacchylides is a Nemean ode performed to honor the athlete Pytheas of Aegina for winning the pancration event of the Nemean games. Bacchylides begins his ode with the tale of Heracles fighting the Nemean lion, employing the battle to explain why pancration tournaments are now held during the Nemean games. The allusion to Heracles\u2019 fight with the lion is also meant to incite why it is that Pytheas fights for the wreaths of the games: to obtain the undying glory that the heroes of old now possess for their deeds. Bacchylides then sings the praises of Pytheas' home, the island Aegina, and how \"her fame excites a dancer\u2019s praise.\" Bacchylides continues this dancer allusion in praise of Aegina, and ends it by listing some famous men who were born on the island, namely Peleus and Telamon. Bacchylides then tells of the greatness of these men\u2019s sons, Achilles and Ajax, alluding to a second myth, the tale of Ajax repelling Hector on the beaches of Troy, keeping the Trojans from burning the Greek ships. Bacchylides relates how Achilles\u2019 inaction spurred the Trojans to false hope, and how their swollen pride led them to be destroyed at the hands of the men they thought they had vanquished. The ode plays upon the fact that those who are listening to Bacchylides have also read the epics of Homer, and understand the whole story behind this scene that would speak poorly of Achilles if people did not know the role he played in the Trojan war. With this tale complete Bacchylides proclaims once again that the actions he has just told will be forever remembered thanks to the muses, leading once again into his praise of Pytheas and his trainer Menander, who shall be remembered for their great victories in the Pan-Hellenic games, even if an envious rival slights them.\nOde 15.\nThe Sons of Antenor, or Helen Demanded Back, is the first of Bacchylides\u2019s dithyrambs in the text restored in 1896. The opening is incomplete, as part of the papyrus was damaged. The dithyramb treats a moment in myth before the Trojan war, when Menelaus, Antenor, and Antenor\u2019s sons go to King Priam to demand the return of Helen. As is often the case with ancient Greek literature, Bacchylides plays of the audience\u2019s knowledge of Homer without repeating a scene told by Homer. He instead describes a scene which is new to the audience, but which is given context by knowledge of the Iliad and Odyssey. The story of this embassy was known to Homer, who merely alludes to it at \"Iliad\" 3.205ff., but it was fully related in the cyclic epic poem \"Cypria\", according to the \"Chrestomathy\" of Proclus.\nThe style also plays off of Homer. Characters are almost always named with their fathers, i.e. Odysseus, son of Laertes (as reconstructed). They are also given epithets, though these are not the traditional Homeric epithets: godly Antenor, upright Justice, reckless Outrage.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAttribution:"}

He was the son of a hosier turned woodworker. He started as a wood-carver, and between 1491 and 1502 did much of the decorative carving in the church of Santa Maria Novella and the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. The wooden structure of Santissima Annunziata, an elaborate double-sided altarpiece, was \"begun in 1500 on a design by Baccio D'Agnolo\". Having made his reputation as a sculptor he appears to have turned his attention to architecture, and to have studied at Rome, though the precise date is uncertain; but at the beginning of the sixteenth century he was engaged with the architect Simone del Pollaiolo in restoring the Palazzo Vecchio, and in 1506 he was commissioned to complete the drum of the cupola of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. The latter work, however, was interrupted on account of adverse criticisms from Michelangelo, and it remained unexecuted. \nIn 1496 he began a long association with the Palazzo della Signoria for the fabric and decoration works. He gradually assumed a dominant role. In 1499 he became the head of the office of the works, a position he occupied until the end of his life. During this time, he designed many projects including a private apartment for Piero Soderini when he was Gonfalonier.\nBaccio d'Agnolo also designed, among others, the Palazzo Borgherini-Rosselli del Turco and the Palazzo Bartolini Salimbeni. The Bartolini palace was the first house to be given frontispieces of columns to the door and windows, previously confined to churches. This is \"the oldest example of the explicit use of window frames in secular architecture\". He was ridiculed by the Florentines for this innovation. Another much-admired work of his was the campanile of the church of Santo Spirito. His studio was the resort of some of the most celebrated artists of the day: Michelangelo, Andrea Sansovino, the brothers Antonio da Sangallo the Elder and Giuliano da Sangallo, and the young Raphael. He died at Florence in 1543, leaving three sons, all architects, the best-known being Giuliano d'Agnolo.\nGiorgio Vasari included Baccio in volume IV of his \"Vite\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is headed by the secretary of transportation, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president's Cabinet.\nThe department's fiscal year 2022\u20132026 strategic plan states that its mission is \"to deliver the world's leading transportation system, serving the American people and economy through the safe, efficient, sustainable, and equitable movement of people and goods.\"\nHistory.\nIn 1965, Najeeb Halaby, the chief of the independent Federal Aviation Agency strongly urged President Lyndon Johnson to set up a cabinet-level Department of Transportation. Halaby proposed merging the responsibilities of the undersecretary of commerce for transportation and the Federal Aviation Agency to achieve this goal. While the federal government was granted authority over aviation and railroads through the commerce clause of the Constitution, the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration primarily provided funding for state and local projects, without significant influence over road construction and operation. Halaby emphasized the need for improved coordination and expressed frustration at the lack of an overall plan. \"One looks in vain\", he told Johnson, \"for a point of responsibility below the President capable of taking an evenhanded, comprehensive, authoritarian approach to the development of transportation policies or even able to assure reasonable coordination and balance among the various transportation programs of the government.\" Johnson convinced Congress to act and The Department of Transportation was authorized in October 1966 and launched on 1 April 1967, with a mission to ensure that federal funds were effectively used to support the national transportation program. Johnson proclaimed upon signing the act: \"Transportation has truly emerged as a significant part of our national life. As a basic force in our society, its progress must be accelerated so that the quality of our life can be improved.\"\nBudget.\nIn 2012, the DOT awarded $742.5 million in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to 11 transit projects. The awardees include light rail projects. Other projects include both a commuter rail extension and a subway project in New York City, and a bus rapid transit system in Springfield, Oregon. The funds subsidize a heavy rail project in northern Virginia, completing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Metro Silver Line to connect Washington, D.C., and the Washington Dulles International Airport (DOT had previously agreed to subsidize the Silver Line construction to Reston, Virginia).\nPresident Barack Obama's budget request for 2010 also included $1.83 billion in funding for major transit projects. More than $600 million went towards ten new or expanding transit projects. The budget provided additional funding for all of the projects currently receiving Recovery Act funding, except for the bus rapid transit project. It also continued funding for another 18 transit projects that are either currently under construction or soon will be. Following the same, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 delegated $600 million for Infrastructure Investments, referred to as Discretionary Grants.\nThe Department of Transportation was authorized a budget for Fiscal Year 2016 of $75.1 billion. The budget authorization is broken down as follows:\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

{"id": "58236", "revid": "50332181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58236", "title": "United States Department of Homeland Security", "text": "United States federal executive department\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the U.S. federal executive department responsible for public security, roughly comparable to the interior, home, or public security ministries in other countries. Its missions involve anti-terrorism, civil defense, immigration and customs, border control, cybersecurity, transportation security, maritime security and sea rescue, and the mitigation of weapons of mass destruction.\nIt began operations on March 1, 2003, after being formed as a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, enacted in response to the September 11 attacks. With more than 240,000 employees, DHS is the third-largest Cabinet department, after the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nIn response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) to coordinate \"homeland security\" efforts. The office was headed by former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. The official announcement states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The mission of the Office will be to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks. The Office will coordinate the executive branch's efforts to detect, prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States.\nRidge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001. On November 25, 2002, the Homeland Security Act established the Department of Homeland Security to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to \"homeland security\" into a single Cabinet agency. In January 2003, the office was superseded, but not replaced by the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council, both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Council, similar in nature to the National Security Council, retains a policy coordination and advisory role and is led by the assistant to the president for homeland security. The Gilmore Commission, supported by much of Congress and John Bolton, helped to solidify further the need for the department. The DHS incorporated the following 22 agencies.\nList of incorporated agencies.\nAccording to political scientist Peter Andreas, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947 (which had placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency). Creation of DHS constitutes the most diverse merger ever of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization. The founding of the DHS marked a change in American thought towards threats.\nIntroducing the term \"homeland\" centers attention on a population that needs to be protected not only against emergencies such as natural disasters but also against diffuse threats from individuals who are non-native to the United States.\nPrior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption was focused on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither was included). The bill was also controversial for the presence of unrelated \"riders\", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives. The plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights. In 2002, Bush officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.\nIn an August 5, 2002, speech, President Bush said: \"We are fighting ... to secure freedom in the homeland.\" Prior to the creation of DHS, U.S. Presidents had referred to the U.S. as \"the nation\" or \"the republic\" and to its internal policies as \"domestic\". Also unprecedented was the use, from 2002, of the phrase \"the homeland\" by White House spokespeople.\nCongress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years since the United States Department of Defense was created.\nTom Ridge was named secretary on January 24, 2003, and began naming his chief deputies. DHS officially began operations on January 24, 2003, but most of the department's component agencies were not transferred into the new department until March 1.\nAfter establishing the basic structure of DHS and working to integrate its components, Ridge announced his resignation on November 30, 2004, following the re-election of President Bush. Bush initially nominated former New York City Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik as his successor, but on December 10, Kerik withdrew his nomination, citing personal reasons and saying it \"would not be in the best interests\" of the country for him to pursue the post.\nChanges under Secretary Chertoff.\nOn January 11, 2005, President Bush nominated federal judge Michael Chertoff to succeed Ridge. Chertoff was confirmed on February 15, 2005, by a vote of 98\u20130 in the U.S. Senate and was sworn in the same day.\nIn February 2005, DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR. \"The Washington Post\" said that the rules would allow DHS \"to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department-wide directive\" and would make it \"difficult, if not impossible, for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing, deployments, technology and other workplace matters\". In August 2005, U.S. District judge Rosemary M. Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective-bargaining rights for DHS employees. A federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006; pending a final resolution to the litigation, Congress's fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system.\nDHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name \"MaxHR\". In a February 2008 court filing, DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules, and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor-management procedures. A federal court issued an order closing the case. Chertoff\u2019s successor, Secretary Janet Napolitano deployed full body scanners to assist the United States Secret Service in 2012.\nFirst Trump administration.\nA 2017 memo by Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly directed DHS to disregard \"age as a basis for determining when to collect biometrics.\"\nOn November 16, 2018, President Donald Trump signed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 into law, which elevated the mission of the former DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate and established the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. In fiscal year 2018, DHS was allocated a net discretionary budget of $47.716 billion.\nBiden administration.\nIn 2021, the Department of Justice began carrying out an investigation into white supremacy and extremism in the DHS ranks.\nDHS also halted large-scale immigration raids at job sites, saying in October 2021 that the administration was planning \"a new enforcement strategy to more effectively target employers who pay substandard wages and engage in exploitative labor practices.\"\nIn 2023, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol began using an app which requires asylum seekers to submit biometric information before they enter the country.\nIn June 2024, John Boyd, the head of the DHS Office of Biometric Identity Management, announced at a conference that the agency \"is looking into ways it might use facial recognition technology to track the identities of migrant children.\" According to Boyd, the initiative is intended to advance the development of facial recognition algorithms. A former DHS official said that every migrant processing center he visited engaged in biometric identity collection, and that children were not separated out during processing. DHS denied collecting the biometric data of children under 14.\nFunction.\nWhereas the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad, the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within, at, and outside its borders. Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism. On March 1, 2003, the DHS absorbed the U.S. Customs Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations, the primary investigative arm of DHS. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service falls under the Management Directorate.\nOrganizational structure.\nThe Department of Homeland Security is headed by the secretary of homeland security with the assistance of the deputy secretary. DHS contains operational components, executing specific missions under the purview of the DHS; support components, supporting the mission of the DHS and operational components; and components in the Office of the Secretary, supporting department leadership, DHS components, and the secretary by overseeing and establishing policy.\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) oversees lawful immigration into the United States. Note that Passports for U.S. citizens are issued by the U.S. Department of State, not the Department of Homeland Security.\nU.S. Coast Guard.\nThe United States Coast Guard (USCG) is the maritime security, search and rescue, and law enforcement service branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. It is under the Department of Homeland Security during times of peace, and under the U.S. Department of the Navy during wartime.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is a law enforcement agency responsible for protecting the U.S. border against illegal entry, illicit activity, and other threats; combatting transnational crime and terrorism that's a threat to the economic and national security of the United States; and facilitating lawful trade and lawful entry into the United States.\nU.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\nThe United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is the leading entity of the U.S. federal government in understanding, managing, and reducing risk to cyber and physical infrastructure across the United States.\nU.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nThe United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) invests in, improves, and supports capabilities to respond to, mitigate, protect against, recover from, and to prepare for all hazards that may threaten the security of the United States and its citizens, such as natural disasters.\nU.S. Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers.\nThe United States Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) provides training services to U.S. law enforcement.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nUnited States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforces federal laws governing border control, customs, immigration and trade.\nU.S. Secret Service.\nThe United States Secret Service (USSS) is charged with the protection of the President of the United States and other government officials and persons designated by law. It also safeguards U.S. financial infrastructure and fights against counterfeiting.\nU.S. Transportation Security Administration.\nThe United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) protects U.S. transportation systems (e.g. airport security) and ensures freedom of movement for people and commerce. It was created as a result of the September 11 attacks in the United States by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001.\nDHS Management Directorate.\nThe Department of Homeland Security Management Directorate (MGMT) manages department finance, appropriations, accounting, budgeting, expenditures, procurement, human resources and personnel, information technology systems, biometric identification services, facilities, property, equipment, other material resources, protection of department personnel, information and resources, performance metrics, and the security of federal infrastructure.\nExecutives\nDHS Science and Technology Directorate.\nThe Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) is the department's research and development arm.\nExecutives\nDHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.\nThe Department of Homeland Security Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD) works to prevent chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological attacks against the United States.\nDHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis.\nThe Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence &amp; Analysis (I&amp;A) is the department's intelligence arm, and disseminates timely information across the DHS enterprise and to local, state, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners.\nDHS Office of Homeland Security Situational Awareness.\nThe Office of Homeland Security Situational Awareness (OSA) provides operations coordination, information sharing, situational awareness, common operating picture, and executes the Secretary's responsibilities across the homeland security enterprise.\nDHS Office of Health Security.\nThe Department of Homeland Security Office of Health Security (OHS) is the principal medical, workforce health and safety, and public health authority for DHS.\nDHS Office of Inspector General.\nThe Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) provides independent oversight and promotes excellence, integrity, and accountability within DHS.\nDHS Office of the Secretary.\nThe Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security oversees the Department of Homeland Security's execution of its mission to safeguard the nation.\nDHS Advisory Panels.\nDHS advisory panels and committees provide advice and recommendations on mission-related topics from academic engagement to privacy.\nNational Terrorism Advisory System.\nIn 2011, the Department of Homeland Security phased out the old Homeland Security Advisory System, replacing it with a two-level National Terrorism Advisory System. The system has two types of advisories: alerts and bulletins. NTAS bulletins permit the secretary to communicate critical terrorism information that, while not necessarily indicative of a specific threat against the United States, can reach homeland security partners or the public quickly, thereby allowing recipients to implement necessary protective measures. Alerts are issued when there is specific and credible information of a terrorist threat against the United States. Alerts have two levels: elevated and imminent. An elevated alert is issued when there is credible information about an attack but only general information about timing or a target. An Imminent Alert is issued when the threat is very specific and impending in the very near term.\nOn March 12, 2002, the Homeland Security Advisory System, a color-coded terrorism risk advisory scale, was created as the result of a Presidential Directive to provide a \"comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal, State, and local authorities and to the American people\". Many procedures at government facilities are tied into the alert level; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level. Since January 2003, it has been administered in coordination with DHS; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration's detractors about its ineffectiveness. After resigning, Tom Ridge said he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies.\nSeal.\nThe seal was developed with input from senior DHS leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The Ad Council \u2013 which partners with DHS on its Ready.gov campaign \u2013 and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The seal is symbolic of the Department's mission \u2013 to prevent attacks and protect Americans \u2013 on the land, in the sea and in the air. In the center of the seal, a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field. The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words \"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF\" in the top half and \"HOMELAND SECURITY\" in the bottom half in a circular placement. The eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows.\nCentered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland \u2013 air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department. The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky. The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines.\n- DHS June 6, 2003\nHeadquarters.\nSince its inception, the department's temporary headquarters had been in Washington, D.C.'s Nebraska Avenue Complex, a former naval facility. The site, across from American University, has 32 buildings comprising of administrative space. In early 2007, the department submitted a $4.1 billion plan to Congress to consolidate its 60-plus Washington-area offices into a single headquarters complex at the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Anacostia, Southeast Washington, D.C.\nThe move was championed by District of Columbia officials because of the positive economic impact it would have on historically depressed Anacostia. The move was criticized by historic preservationists, who claimed the revitalization plans would destroy dozens of historic buildings on the campus. Community activists criticized the plans because the facility would remain walled off and have little interaction with the surrounding area.\nIn February 2015 the General Services Administration said that the site would open in 2021. DHS headquarters staff began moving to St. Elizabeths in April 2019 after the completion of the Center Building renovation.\nDisaster preparedness and response.\nCongressional budgeting effects.\nDuring a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the reauthorization of DHS, Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke said there is a weariness and anxiety within DHS about the repeated congressional efforts to agree to a long-term spending plan, which had resulted in several threats to shut down the federal government. \"Shutdowns are disruptive\", Duke said. She said the \"repeated failure on a longtime spending plan resulting in short-term continuing resolutions (CRs) has caused \"angst\" among the department's 240,000 employees in the weeks leading up to the CRs.\" The uncertainty about funding hampers DHS's ability to pursue major projects and takes away attention and manpower from important priorities. Seventy percent of DHS employees are considered essential and are not furloughed during government shutdowns.\nReady.gov.\nSoon after formation, the department worked with the Ad Council to launch the Ready Campaign, a national public service advertising (PSA) campaign to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. With pro bono creative support from the Martin Agency of Richmond, Virginia, the campaign website \"Ready.gov\" and materials were conceived in March 2002 and launched in February 2003, just before the launch of the Iraq War. One of the first announcements that garnered widespread public attention to this campaign was one by Tom Ridge in which he stated that in the case of a chemical attack, citizens should use duct tape and plastic sheeting to build a homemade bunker, or \"sheltering in place\" to protect themselves. As a result, the sales of duct tape skyrocketed, and DHS was criticized for being too alarmist.\nOn March 1, 2003, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was absorbed into the DHS and in the fall of 2008 took over coordination of the campaign. The Ready Campaign and its Spanish-language version Listo.gov asks individuals to build an emergency supply kit, make a family emergency plan and be informed about the different types of emergencies that can occur and how to respond. The campaign messages have been promoted through television, radio, print, outdoor and web PSAs, as well as brochures, toll-free phone lines and the English and Spanish language websites Ready.gov and Listo.gov.\nThe general campaign aims to reach all Americans, but targeted resources are also available via \"Ready Business\" for small- to medium-sized business and \"Ready Kids\" for parents and teachers of children ages 8\u201312. In 2015, the campaign also launched a series of PSAs to help the whole community, people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs prepare for emergencies, which included open captioning, a certified deaf interpreter and audio descriptions for viewers who are blind or have low vision.\nNational Incident Management System.\nOn March 1, 2004, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) was created. The stated purpose was to provide a consistent incident management approach for federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5, all federal departments were required to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation program and activities.\nNational Response Framework.\nIn December 2004, the National Response Plan (NRP) was created, in an attempt to align federal coordination structures, capabilities, and resources into a unified, all-discipline, and all-hazards approach to domestic incident management. The NRP was built on the template of the NIMS and fully went into effect in April 2005 after a 4 month transitional period.\nOn January 22, 2008, the National Response Framework was published in the Federal Register as an updated replacement of the NRP, effective March 22, 2008.\nSurge Capacity Force.\nThe Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act directs the DHS Secretary to designate employees from throughout the department to staff a Surge Capacity Force (SCF). During a declared disaster, the DHS Secretary will determine if SCF support is necessary. The secretary will then authorize FEMA to task and deploy designated personnel from DHS components and other Federal Executive Agencies to respond to extraordinary disasters.\nImmigration Enforcement.\nImmigration raids:.\nNew York City Canal Street raid:.\nA homeland security spokesperson said, \"ICE and its federal partners, including FBI, DEA, ATF, IRS-CI, and CBP, conducted a targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City, focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods.\"On October 21, 2025, Canal Street in New York City had a major immigration raid. On that day, around 50 federal agents raided the streets, where African and Chinese descendants would illegally sell counterfeit luxury items to tourists. The Department of Homeland Security said that their agents arrested nine men, mostly from West Africa, who were accused of living in the United States illegally and had prior arrests since they were \"targeted in an operation 'focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods,' \".Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that ICE arrested nine illegal aliens who had previous criminal histories, including \"robbery, burglary, domestic violence, assaulting law enforcement, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, drug possession, and forgery\".\"\u201dDue to the raid, several hundred people rallied at 26 Plaza, the New York City headquarters of ICE, to protest the raid. According to reporters Li and Silva, \"the raid also showed how public resistance to ICE\u2019s action is building. Protesters gathered at nearby Foley Square on Wednesday to draw attention to the raid.\" Protesters attempted to block immigration agents from carrying out the operations, and hundreds of angry New Yorkers \"clashed with federal agents.\" During the protest, five protesters were taken into custody, as they were accused of assaulting law enforcement and obstructing.\nBorder Enforcement.\n\"Smart Plan\".\nTrump's new \"Smart Wall\" plan has border walls and new surveillance technology to be placed on the Big Bend region and the remainder of Texas's southern border. On October 15, 2025, in a published notice, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote \"that the department had determined there is an 'acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads' in the U.S. Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector.\" The many illegal crossings and smuggling activities in the Big Bend have caused the Trump administration to crack down on border security.\nOn October 10, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security reveals its \"Smart Plan\" for the US-Mexico border, which includes:\nAdditionally, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has issued $4.5 billion to initiate construction.The first installment of President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" was used to fund tens of billions of dollars, including \"230 miles of new fencing and 400 miles of new roads and technology.\" - Washington Times. \nCyber-security.\nThe DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) is responsible for the response system, risk management program, and requirements for cyber-security in the U.S. The division is home to US-CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate helps government and private end-users transition to new cyber-security capabilities. This directorate also funds the Cyber Security Research and Development Center, which identifies and prioritizes research and development for NCSD. The center works on the Internet's routing infrastructure (the SPRI program) and Domain Name System (DNSSEC), identity theft and other online criminal activity (ITTC), Internet traffic and networks research (PREDICT datasets and the DETER testbed), Department of Defense and HSARPA exercises (Livewire and Determined Promise), and wireless security in cooperation with Canada.\nOn October 30, 2009, DHS opened the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. The center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure.\nIn January 2017, DHS officially designated state-run election systems as critical infrastructure. The designation made it easier for state and local election officials to get cybersecurity help from the federal government. In October 2017, DHS convened a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) for the Election Infrastructure Subsection with representatives from various state and federal agencies such as the Election Assistance Commission and National Association of Secretaries of State.\nSecretaries.\nTo date there have been eight confirmed secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security:\nCriticism.\nExcess, waste, and ineffectiveness.\nThe department has been dogged by persistent criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. Congress estimates that the department has wasted roughly $15 billion in failed contracts (as of \u00a02008[ [update]]). In 2003, the department came under fire after the media revealed that Laura Callahan, Deputy Chief Information Officer at DHS with responsibilities for sensitive national security databases, had obtained her bachelor, masters, and doctorate computer science degrees through Hamilton University, a diploma mill in a small town in Wyoming. The department was blamed for up to $2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the Government Accountability Office revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees, with purchases including beer brewing kits, $70,000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable, boats purchased at double the retail price (many of which later could not be found), and iPods ostensibly for use in \"data storage\".\nA 2015 inspection of IT infrastructure found that the department was running over a hundred computer systems whose owners were unknown, including Secret and Top Secret databases, many with out-of-date security or weak passwords. Basic security reviews were absent, and the department had apparently made deliberate attempts to delay publication of information about the flaws.\nData mining.\nOn September 5, 2007, the Associated Press reported that the DHS had scrapped an anti-terrorism data mining tool called ADVISE (Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight and Semantic Enhancement) after the agency's internal inspector general found that pilot testing of the system had been performed using data on real people without required privacy safeguards in place. The system, in development at Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 2003, has cost the agency $42 million to date. Controversy over the program is not new; in March 2007, the Government Accountability Office stated that \"the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud, crime or terrorism.\" Homeland Security's Inspector General later said that ADVISE was poorly planned, time-consuming for analysts to use, and lacked adequate justifications.\nFusion centers.\nFusion centers are terrorism prevention and response centers, many of which were created under a joint project between the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs between 2003 and 2007. The fusion centers gather information from government sources as well as their partners in the private sector.\nThey are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, U.S. military and state and local level government. As of \u00a02009[ [update]], DHS recognized at least seventy-two fusion centers. Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster.\nThere are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others.\nDavid Rittgers of the Cato Institute notes:\nA long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security. The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti-abortion activists were worrisome; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists, Tea Party groups, and a Second Amendment rally; the Maryland State Police put anti-death penalty and anti-war activists in a federal terrorism database; a fusion center in Missouri thought that all third-party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat ...\nMail interception.\nIn 2006, MSNBC reported that Grant Goodman, \"an 81-year-old retired University of Kansas history professor, received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and resealed with a strip of dark green tape bearing the words \"by Border Protection\" and carrying the official Homeland Security seal.\" The letter was sent by a devout Catholic Filipino woman with no history of supporting Islamic terrorism. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection \"acknowledged that the agency can, will and does open mail coming to U.S. citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it's deemed necessary\":\nAll mail originating outside the United States Customs territory that is to be delivered inside the U.S. Customs territory is subject to Customs examination,\" says the CBP Web site. That includes personal correspondence. \"All mail means 'all mail,'\" said John Mohan, a CBP spokesman, emphasizing the point.\nThe department declined to outline what criteria are used to determine when a piece of personal correspondence should be opened or to say how often or in what volume Customs might be opening mail.\nGoodman's story provoked outrage in the blogosphere, as well as in the more established media. Reacting to the incident, \"Mother Jones\" remarked \"unlike other prying government agencies, Homeland Security wants you to know it is watching you.\" CNN observed \"on the heels of the NSA wiretapping controversy, Goodman's letter raises more concern over the balance between privacy and security.\"\nEmployee morale.\nIn July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS was last or near to last in every category including;\nThe low scores were attributed to concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within the agency. Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization.\nDHS is the only large federal agency to score below 50% in overall survey rankings. It was last of large federal agencies in 2014 with 44.0% and fell even lower in 2015 at 43.1%, again last place. DHS continued to rank at the bottom in 2019, prompting congressional inquiries into the problem. High work load resulting from chronic staff shortage, particularly in Customs and Border Protection, has contributed to low morale, as have scandals and intense negative public opinion heightened by immigration policies of the Obama administration.\nDHS has struggled to retain women, who complain of overt and subtle misogyny.\nMIAC report.\nIn 2009, the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) made news for targeting supporters of third party candidates (such as Ron Paul), anti-abortion activists, and conspiracy theorists as potential militia members. Anti-war activists and Islamic lobby groups were targeted in Texas, drawing criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union.\nAccording to DHS:\nThe Privacy Office has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the fusion center program:\nFreedom of Information Act processing performance.\nIn the Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data), the Department of Homeland Security earned a D+ by scoring 69 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade. It also had not updated its policies since the 2007 FOIA amendments.\nFourteen Words slogan and \"88\" reference.\nIn 2018, the DHS was accused of referencing the white nationalist Fourteen Words slogan in an official document, by using a similar fourteen-worded title, in relation to unlawful immigration and border control:\nWe Must Secure The Border And Build The Wall To Make America Safe Again.\nAlthough dismissed by the DHS as a coincidence, both the use of \"88\" in a document and the similarity to the slogan's phrasing (\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\"), drew criticism and controversy from several media outlets.\nCalls for abolition.\nWhile abolishing the DHS has been proposed since 2011, the idea was popularized when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested abolishing the DHS in light of the abuses against detained migrants by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies.\nIn 2020, the DHS was criticized for detaining protesters in Portland, Oregon. It even drew rebuke from the department's first secretary Tom Ridge who said, \"It would be a cold day in hell before I would consent to an uninvited, unilateral intervention into one of my cities\".\nOn August 10, 2020, in an opinion article for \"USA Today\" by Anthony D. Romero, the ACLU called for the dismantling of DHS over the deployment of federal forces in July 2020 during the Portland protests.\nACLU lawsuit.\nIn December 2020, ACLU filed a lawsuit against the DHS, U.S. CBP and U.S. ICE, seeking the release of their records of purchasing cellphone location data. ACLU alleges that this data was used to track U.S. citizens and immigrants and is seeking to discover the full extent of the alleged surveillance.\nNejwa Ali controversy.\nThe DHS came under fire from pro-Israel politicians in October 2023 for employing Nejwa Ali, who supported Hamas following its deadly terror attack against Israel. Her social media posts were first reported on by the \"Daily Wire\" and the \"Washington Examiner\" reported on Ali being placed on administrative leave.\nSurveillance.\nICE.\nAmerican Dragnet, a report, from the Center on Privacy and Technology documents the scope of ICE's surveillance capabilities. The report found that ICE has access to the driver\u2019s license data of 3 in 4 adults, could locate 3 in 4 adults through their utility records and tracks the movements of drivers in cities home to 3 in 4 adults. The report also claimed \"the agency spent approximately $2.8 billion between 2008 and 2021 on new surveillance, data collection and data-sharing initiatives\". ICE has also used data brokers to circumvent laws restricting government bodies sharing information with ICE. ICE has reportedly been a customer of Paragon Solutions and confirmed its use of Clearview AI. Additionally, ICE has reportedly used Mobile Fortify, ShadowDragon, the network of Flock Safety, Magnetic Forensics, and products from Pen-Link, LexisNexis and Booz Allen Hamilton.\nThe Second Trump administration reportedly worked to obtain and centralize data on Americans as outlined in Executive Order 14243 relying heavily on products from Palantir Technologies. This data has been desired to support expanded deportation efforts carried out by DHS. The administration has sought data from the IRS, Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nOffice of Intelligence and Analysis.\nThe office of intelligence and analysis (I&amp;A) has a history of problematic surveillance. In 2020, the I&amp;A authorized \"collecting and reporting on various activities in the context of elevated threats targeting monuments, memorials, and statues\". The office surveilled protestors at the George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon In September 2023, Congress considered revoking some of the agency\u2019s collection authorities over concerns about overreach. According to Politico, \"a key theme that emerges from internal documents is that in recent years, many people working at I&amp;A have said they fear they are breaking the law\". In 2025, sexual orientation and gender identity were removed from I&amp;A's list of characteristics that \"personnel are prohibited from engaging in intelligence activities based solely on\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

P. E. Bach, was a German composer and musician of the Baroque and Classical eras. He was the fifth child and second surviving son of Johann Sebastian Bach and Maria Barbara Bach.\nBach was an influential composer working at a time of transition between his father's Baroque style and the Classical style that followed it. He was the principal representative of the \"\" or 'sensitive style'. The qualities of his keyboard music are forerunners of the expressiveness of Romantic music, in deliberate contrast to the statuesque forms of Baroque music. His organ sonatas mainly come from the galant style.\nTo distinguish him from his brother Johann Christian, the \"London Bach\", who at this time was music master to Queen Charlotte of Great Britain, Bach was known as the \"Berlin Bach\" during his residence in that city, and later as the \"Hamburg Bach\" when he succeeded [[[[Georg Philipp Telemann]] as [[Kapellmeister]] there. To his contemporaries, he was known simply as Emanuel. His second name was in honour of his [[godparent|godfather]] Telemann, a friend of his father J. S. Bach.\nBach was an influential [[Pedagogy|pedagogue]], writing the influential \"Essay on the true art of playing keyboard instruments\", which would be studied by [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], among others.\nLife.\nEarly years: 1714\u20131738.\nC. P. E. Bach was born on 8 March 1714 in [[Weimar]] to Johann Sebastian Bach and his first wife, Maria Barbara. He was their fifth child and third son. The composer Telemann was his godfather. When he was ten years old, he entered the [[St. Thomas School, Leipzig]], which his father directed as [[Thomaskantor]] since 1723. He was one of four Bach children to become professional musicians; all four were trained in music almost entirely by their father. In an age of royal patronage, father and son alike knew that a university education helped prevent a professional musician from being treated as a servant. Carl, like his brothers, pursued advanced studies in [[jurisprudence]] at [[Leipzig University]] in 1731 and at [[European University Viadrina|Frankfurt an der Oder]] in 1735. In 1738, at the age of 24, he obtained his degree but never practised law, instead immediately turning his attention to music.\nBerlin years: 1738\u20131768.\n[[File:Adolph Menzel - Fl\u00f6tenkonzert Friedrichs des Gro\u00dfen in Sanssouci - Google Art Project.jpg|350px|thumb|\"\" (\"Frederick the Great's Flute Concert in Sanssouci\") by [[Adolph von Menzel]], 1852, depicts [[Frederick the Great]] playing the flute as C. P. E. Bach accompanies on the keyboard. The audience (invented by Menzel, and not based on any actual occasion) includes Bach's colleagues as well as nobles.]][[File:CPEB with Frederick the Great.jpg|thumb|Detail from previous image]]\nA few months after graduation, with a recommendation by the Graun brothers ([[Johann Gottlieb Graun|Johann Gottlieb]] and [[Carl Heinrich Graun|Carl Heinrich]]) and [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]], Bach obtained an appointment at Berlin in the service of Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, the future Frederick the Great. Upon Frederick's accession in 1740, Bach became a member of the royal orchestra. He was by this time one of the foremost [[keyboard instrument|clavier]] players in Europe, and his compositions, which date from 1731, include about thirty [[sonata]]s and concert pieces for [[harpsichord]] and [[clavichord]]. During his time there, Berlin was a rich artistic environment, where Bach mixed with many accomplished musicians, including several notable former students of his father, and important literary figures, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], with whom the composer would become close friends.\nIn Berlin, Bach continued to write numerous pieces for solo keyboard, including a series of character pieces, the so-called \"Berlin Portraits\", including \"[[La Caroline (C. P. E. Bach)|La Caroline]]\". His reputation was established by the two sets of sonatas which he published with dedications to Frederick the Great (1742) and [[Charles Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (1744). In 1746, he was promoted to the post of chamber musician (\"\") and served the king alongside colleagues like [[Carl Heinrich Graun]], [[Johann Joachim Quantz]], and [[Franz Benda]].\nThe composer who most influenced Bach's maturing style was unquestionably his father. He drew creative inspiration from his godfather Georg Philipp Telemann, then working in Hamburg, and from contemporaries like [[George Frideric Handel]], Carl Heinrich Graun, Haydn, and Mozart later. Bach's interest in all types of art led to influence from poets, playwrights and philosophers such as [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]], [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing | Lessing]]. Bach's work itself influenced the work of, among others, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and [[Felix Mendelssohn]].\nDuring his residence in Berlin, Bach composed a [[Magnificat (C. P. E. Bach)|Magnificat]] (1749), in which he shows more traces than usual of his father's influence; a [[cantata]] for [[Easter]] (1756); several [[symphony|symphonies]] and concert works; at least three volumes of songs, including the celebrated \"[[Gellert Odes and Songs|Gellert Songs]]\"; and a few secular cantatas and other occasional pieces. But his main work was concentrated on the clavier, for which he composed, at this time, nearly two hundred sonatas and other solos, including the set \"\" (\"With Varied [[Reprise]]s\", 1760\u20131768).\nWhile in Berlin, Bach placed himself in the forefront of European music with a treatise, \"\" (\"An Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments\"), immediately recognised as a definitive work on keyboard technique. \"Both Haydn and Beethoven swore by it.\" By 1780, the book was in its third edition and laid the foundation for the keyboard methods of [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]] and [[Johann Baptist Cramer|Cramer]]. The essay lays out the fingering for each chord and some chord sequences. Bach's techniques continue to be employed today. The first part of the \"Essay\" contains a chapter explaining the various embellishments in work of the period, e.g., [[trill (music)|trills]], [[turn (music)|turns]], [[mordent]]s, etc. The second part presents Bach's ideas on the art of [[figured bass]] and [[counterpoint]], as well as performance suggestions and a brief section on [[Improvisation|extemporization]], mainly focusing on the [[Fantasia (music)|Fantasia]].\nBach used for his performances instruments (clavichord and fortepiano) made by [[Gottfried Silbermann]], at that time a well-known builder of keyboard instruments. In the recent years one of the models of pianos that Bach was playing, the Gottfried Silbermann 1749, was used as a model for making modern piano copies.\nHamburg: 1768\u20131788.\nIn 1768, after protracted negotiations, Bach was permitted to relinquish his position in order to succeed his godfather Telemann as director of music (\"\") at Hamburg. Upon his release from service at the court, he was named court composer for Frederick's sister, Princess [[Anna Amalia, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Anna Amalia]]. The title was honorary, but her patronage and interest in the [[oratorio]] genre may have played a role in nurturing the ambitious choral works that followed.\nBach began to turn more of his energy to ecclesiastical and choral music in his new position. The job required the steady production of music for [[Protestant]] church services at the [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|Michaeliskirche]] (Church of St. Michael) and elsewhere in Hamburg. The following year he produced his most ambitious work, the oratorio \"[[Die Israeliten in der W\u00fcste]]\" (\"The Israelites in the Desert\"), a composition remarkable not only for its \"great beauty\" but for the resemblance of its plan to that of Mendelssohn's \"[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]\". Between 1768 and 1788, he wrote [[Passions (C. P. E. Bach)|twenty-one settings]] of the [[Passion (music)|Passion]], and some seventy cantatas, [[litany|litanies]], [[motet]]s, and other liturgical pieces. In 1773, Bach wrote an autobiography: he was one of the first composers to write such an account of his life. In Hamburg he also presented a number of works by contemporaries, including his father, Telemann, Graun, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]] and Johann David Holland (1746\u20131827). Bach's choral output reached its apex in two works: the double chorus \"Heilig\" (\"Holy\") of 1776, a setting of the [[seraph|seraph song]] from the throne scene in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], and an[[oratorio]] known as \"[[Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt Jesu]]\" (\"The [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] of Jesus\") of 1774\u20131782, which sets a poetic [[Gospel harmony|Gospel harmonization]] by the poet [[Karl Wilhelm Ramler]]. Widespread admiration of \"Auferstehung\" led to three 1788 performances in Vienna sponsored by the Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]] and conducted by Mozart.\nBach married Johanna Maria Dannemann (1724\u20131795) in 1744. Only three of their children lived to adulthood: Johann Adam (1745\u20131789), Anna Carolina Philippina (1747\u20131804), and [[Johann Sebastian Bach (painter)|Johann Sebastian]] \"the Younger\" (1748\u20131778). None became musicians, and Johann Sebastian, a promising painter, died at the age of 29 during a 1778 trip to Italy. Emanuel Bach died in Hamburg on 14 December 1788. He was buried in the Michaeliskirche in Hamburg.\nWorks.\nIn the \"Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach\".\nWorks C. P. E. Bach wrote in the \"[[Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach]]\" are: March in D major, BWV Anh. 122; Polonaise in G minor, BWV Anh. 123; March in G major, BWV Anh. 124; Polonaise in G minor, BWV Anh. 125; and \"Solo per il cembalo\", BWV Anh. 129.\nSymphonies.\nAmong Bach's most popular and frequently recorded works are his symphonies. While in Berlin, he wrote several string symphonies ([[Alfred Wotquenne|Wq.]] 173\u2013181), most of which were later revised to add parts for wind instruments. Of these, the E minor symphony, Wq. 178, has been particularly popular.\nIn Hamburg, Bach wrote a major set of six string symphonies for Gottfried van Swieten, Wq. 182 of 1773. These works were not published in his lifetime (van Swieten, who had commissioned them to be written in a more \"difficult\" style, preferred to retain them for private use), but since their rediscovery, have become increasingly popular.\nHowever, Bach's best works in the form (by his own estimation) are assuredly the four \"Orchester-Sinfonien mit zw\u00f6lf obligaten Stimmen\", Wq. 183, which, as their title suggests, were written with obbligato wind parts that are integral to the texture, rather than being added on to an older string symphony. The first symphony (D major) in the set has been particularly popular, seeing a continuous performance and publication tradition all the way through the 19th century, which makes it the earliest such symphony. Some of its more unusual features have been taken as characteristic of Bach's style: the work, although it is in D major, begins \"on\" a D major chord, which then turns into a D dominant-seventh chord, outlining \"G\" major. In fact, there is no cadence on D major (D major is not \"confirmed\" as the key of the piece) until the beginning of the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], quite late in the piece.\nConcertos.\nBach was a prolific writer of concertos, especially for keyboard. Like his father, he would often transcribe a concerto for various instruments, leading to problems determining which came first. For instance, the three cello concertos (Wq. 170\u2013172), which are cornerstones of that instrument's repertoire, have often been considered to be transcriptions of the harpsichord versions, but recent research has suggested that they might be originally for cello.\nAccording to Bach, his finest keyboard concertos were the \"Sei concerti per il cembalo concertato\", Wq. 43, which were written to be somewhat more appealing, and somewhat easier to play. His other concertos were written for [[Oboe Concerto (Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach)|oboe]], flute, and organ. Bach also wrote for more unusual combinations, including an E-flat major concerto for harpsichord and piano. Additionally, he wrote several sonatinas for one or more keyboards and orchestra.\nChamber music.\nBach's chamber music forms something of a bridge between stereotypically Baroque and Classical forms. On the one hand, he wrote trio sonatas and solo sonatas with basso continuo (including ones for harp and viola da gamba); on the other, he wrote several accompanied sonatas for piano, violin, and cello, which are more or less early [[piano trio]]s, and three very popular quartets for keyboard, flute, and viola. Bach also wrote one of the earliest pieces for solo flute, a sonata that is clearly influenced by his father's [[Partita in A minor for solo flute]], [[BWV]] 1013.\nKeyboard sonatas.\nBach was a prolific writer of keyboard sonatas, many of which were intended for his favored instrument, the clavichord. During his lifetime, he published more collections of keyboard music than anything else, in the following collections:\nMuch of Bach's energy during his last years was dedicated to the publication of the \"Kenner und Liebhaber\" collections (which also include fantasias and rondos, see below).\nWq. 64:1\u20136 are six [[sonatina]]s for keyboard, and Wq. 65:1\u201350 are fifty further keyboard sonatas. The Sonata in E-flat major, Wq.\u00a065:7, is based on \"Solo per il cembalo\", BWV Anh. III 129, No. 27 in [[List of pieces in the second Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach|the second Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach]].\nOther keyboard works.\nBach's best-known piece is the \"[[Solfeggietto]]\", Wq. 117/2, to the point that the introduction to \"The Essential C. P. E. Bach\" is subtitled \"Beyond the Solfeggio in C Minor\". Several of Bach's other miscellaneous keyboard works have gained fame, including the character piece \"[[La Caroline (Bach)|La Caroline]]\" and the Fantasia in F-sharp minor, Wq. 67. Bach's fantasias, in particular, have been considered to show him at his most characteristic: they are full of dramatic silences, harmonic surprises, and perpetually varied figuration.\nBach published three major collections of miscellaneous keyboard works during his lifetime: the \"Clavierst\u00fccke verschiedener Art\", Wq. 112 of 1765, and the \"Kurze und Leichte Clavierst\u00fccke\" collections, Wq. 113\u2013114 of 1766. The former includes songs, fantasias, dances, sonatas, fugues, and even a symphony and concerto for solo piano (Bach later published an entire collection of keyboard versions of his symphonies).\nHe also wrote a set of six sonatas for the organ of Frederick the Great's sister Anna Amalia.\nMusic for mechanical instruments.\nMechanical instruments such as the [[music box]] and [[musical clock]] were popular at the Prussian court, and C. P. E. Bach wrote thirty original compositions for these instruments, grouped together as Wq. 193. At that time, Bach was court musician to King Frederick the Great at Potsdam; the King, who was intrigued by mechanically reproduced music, had mechanical organ clocks built for the City Castle of Potsdam and for the [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palais]].\nChoral works.\nThroughout his lifetime, Bach worked on the \"[[Magnificat (C. P. E. Bach)|Magnificat in D]]\", Wq. 215. J. S. Bach was alive to hear it in 1749, and C. P. E. continued to revise and perform it as late as 1786. The work clearly shows the influence of J.S. Bach's own [[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]], including the striking resemblance of the \"Deposuit\" movements in both works.\nHis other important choral works include the \"Heilig\" (German Sanctus), Wq. 217, which he performed together with the \"Credo\" from his Father's [[Mass in B minor]], the oratorios \"Die Israeliten in der W\u00fcste\", Wq. 238 and \"[[Die Auferstehung und Himmelfahrt Jesu]]\", Wq. 240, and [[Passions (C. P. E. Bach)|21 Passions]].\nUnpublished works.\nMany of C. P. E. Bach's compositions and original manuscripts were stored in the archive of the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]] where Bach lived from 1738 to 1768. This archive was packed during the Second World War and hidden to preserve it from Allied bombing, captured and sequestered by USSR forces in 1945, thus long believed lost or destroyed during the war.\nThe archive was discovered in [[Kyiv]], Ukraine, in 1999, returned to Berlin in 2001, and deposited in the [[Berlin State Library]]. It contained 5,100 musical compositions, none ever printed for the public, including 500 by 12 different members of the Bach family.\nLegacy and musical style.\nThrough the later half of the 18th century, the reputation of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach stood very high, surpassing that of his father. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven admired him and \"avidly\" collected his music. Mozart said of him, \"Bach is the father, we are the children.\"\nHis work has been described as \"sincere in thought\" and \"polished and felicitous in phrase\". His keyboard sonatas, for example, \"mark an important epoch in the history of musical form\". \"Lucid in style, delicate and tender in expression, they are even more notable for the freedom and variety of their structural design\"; they break away altogether from the hardened conventions of the Italian school.\nHe was probably the first composer of eminence who made free use of harmonic color for its own sake. In this way, he compares well with the most important representatives of the [[First Viennese School]]. He exerted enormous influence on the North German School of composers, in particular [[Georg Anton Benda]], [[Bernhard Joachim Hagen]], [[Ernst Wilhelm Wolf]], [[Johann Gottfried M\u00fcthel]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Rust]]. His influence was not limited to his contemporaries and extended to Mendelssohn and [[Carl Maria von Weber]].\nHis name fell into neglect during the 19th century, with [[Robert Schumann]] notoriously opining that \"as a creative musician he remained very far behind his father\"; others opined that he was \"a somewhat feeble imitator of his father's style\". All the same, [[Johannes Brahms]] held him in high regard and edited some of his music. By the early 20th century, he was better regarded but the revival of C. P. E. Bach's works has been chiefly underway since Helmuth Koch's recordings of his symphonies and [[Hugo Ruf]]'s recordings of his keyboard sonatas in the 1960s. There is an ongoing project to record his complete works, led by [[Mikl\u00f3s Sp\u00e1nyi]] on the Swedish record label [[BIS Records|BIS]]. In 2014, the Croatian pianist [[Ana-Marija Markovina]], in cooperation with the [[Packard Humanities Institute]], the [[Bach-Archiv Leipzig]], the [[S\u00e4chsische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig]] and [[Harvard University]] released a 26-CD box set of the complete works for solo piano on the German record label [[H\u00e4nssler]] Classic, performed on a modern [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] grand piano.\nThe works of C. P. E. Bach are known by \"Wq\" numbers, from [[Alfred Wotquenne]]'s 1906 catalogue, and by \"H\" numbers from a catalogue by Eugene Helm (1989).\nHe was portrayed by [[Wolfgang Liebeneiner]] in the 1941 biopic of his brother \"[[Friedemann Bach (film)|Friedemann Bach]]\".\nThe street [[Carl-Philipp-Emanuel-Bach-Stra\u00dfe]] in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] is named after him.\nIn 2015 the [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Museum]] was opened in Hamburg.\n2014 marked the 300th anniversary of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's birth. All six German Bach cities\u2014Hamburg, Potsdam, Berlin, Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, Leipzig, and Weimar\u2014hosted concerts and other events to commemorate the anniversary.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\nAttribution\nExternal links.\n[[Category:1714 births]]\n[[Category:1788 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century German classical composers]]\n[[Category:18th-century German male musicians]]\n[[Category:18th-century German keyboardists]]\n[[Category:Bach family|Carl Philipp Emanuel]]\n[[Category:German classical composers of church music]]\n[[Category:Composers for pipe organ]]\n[[Category:European University Viadrina alumni]]\n[[Category:German classical pianists]]\n[[Category:German Baroque composers]]\n[[Category:German Classical-period composers]]\n[[Category:German harpsichordists]]\n[[Category:German Lutherans]]\n[[Category:German male classical composers]]\n[[Category:German male classical pianists]]\n[[Category:German music theorists]]\n[[Category:Leipzig University alumni]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Leipzig]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Weimar]]\n[[Category:Oratorio composers]]\n[[Category:People educated at the St. Thomas School, Leipzig]]\n[[Category:Pupils of Johann Sebastian Bach]]\n[[Category:Composers for flute]]"}

His grandmother Eva Bacharach was a granddaughter of the Maharal of Prague, and his father Moses Samson Bacharach, and grandfather had served as rabbis of Worms.\nLife.\nHe was born in Lipnik in 1638; according to another claim, he was born in Mahersbrod in 1628. His birth name was Hayim; the name Yair was added after an illness. At age 12 he moved to Worms along with his father, who was appointed rabbi of the city. After the second marriage of his father to Phega, Bacharach become step brother of the famous Jewish physician Tobias Cohn. At 22 he was ordained as a rabbi, and served for some time as rabbi of Mainz. In 1666 he was chosen as rabbi of nearby Koblenz, but in 1669 he returned to Worms. His father died in 1670 and although he left a will for the community to elect his son to replace him as chief rabbi they decided not to choose Bacharach but chose Aaron Teomim, a preacher from Prague.\nIn 1689 the Worms community was decimated by the French during the Nine Years' War, and Bacharach was forced to leave the city for a period of 10 years. Gradually, it was rebuilt. In 1699 he was appointed rabbi of Worms, where his father and grandfather had served before him. He served for only three years until his death in 1702. The inscription on his tombstone begins with the words: \u201cA great and dark horror befalls us from the hiding of the light of Rabbeinu...\u201d\nWorks.\nBacharach was the author of \"Chavos Yair\" (\"Villages of Yair\") a collection of responsa by the title of which is he commonly referred (first published in Frankfurt am Main, 1699); its title is a reference to his grandmother Chava as well as to a place mentioned in Numbers 32:41 and elsewhere in the Jewish Bible. Other work includes his \"Mekor Chayim\", which was intended as a principal commentary to \"Shulkhan Arukh\" but was withdrawn by Bacharach when he discovered that other commentaries, notably the Taz and the Magen Avraham, had appeared. It is still regarded as a prime source of material concerning \"minhagim\" (customs) of the area and epoch. Bacharach also wrote a work criticizing Rabbi Aharon Teomim-Frankels' \"Mateh Aharon\". Therein, Bacharach sharply criticizes the pilpulic methodology common among the rabbis of his time. \nBesides his Halakhic expertise he had complete mastery of all the sciences, music, history and wrote poetry. He compiled a 46 volume encyclopedia on many topics called \"Yair Nesiv\", which remains unpublished.\nIn 1982 his major work, \"Mekor Chaim\", was finally published posthumously by Machon Yerushalayim, and was reprinted in 2018.\nIn 1993, Machon Yerushalayim published the book \"Mar Kashisha\" from the manuscript pf Bacharach. This work contains a collection of the principles and expressions found in the Talmud and Aggadah.\nNotable Views.\nBacharachs' view of Kabbalah was nuanced. While he believed Kabbalah to be very holy, he maintained that it posed great theological danger, and should therefore only be studied by the extremely pious, and only with a teacher. In his responsa, Bacharach relates that a commoner asked him to explain the Kabbalistic formulas commonly printed in prayer books. Bacharach refused to answer, and when he was pressed, said only that he didn't know the explanation. Although he discouraged in-depth study of Kabbalah, he encouraged simple reading of the \"Zohar\", and many of his writings contain Kabbalistic references, especially to explain communal customs. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It belongs to the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Rhein-Nahe, whose seat is in Bingen am Rhein, although that town is not within its bounds.\nThe original name \"Baccaracus\" suggests a Celtic origin. Above the town stands Stahleck Castle (\"Burg Stahleck\"), now a youth hostel.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe town lies in the Rhine Gorge, 48\u00a0km south of Koblenz.\nConstituent communities.\nBacharach is divided into several \"Ortsteile\". The outlying centre of Steeg lies in the Steeg Valley (\"Steeger Tal\") off to the side, away from the Rhine. This glen lies between Medenscheid and Neurath to the south and Henschhausen to the north on the heights.\nHistory.\nIn the early 11th century, Bacharach had its first documentary mention. It may have been that as early as the 7th century, the kingly domain passed into Archbishop of Cologne Kunibert\u2019s ownership; pointing to this is a \"Kunibertskapelle\" (chapel) on the spot where now stands the \"Wernerkapelle\". The \"V\u00f6gte\" of the Cologne estate were the Elector of the Palatinate, who over time pushed back Cologne\u2019s influence. Count Palatine already had so much influence that he resided at Stahleck Castle. His successor Konrad von Staufen\u2019s daughter secretly wed at Stahleck Castle a son of the Welfs, who were family foes, leading to Bacharach\u2019s, and indeed the whole County Palatine\u2019s, falling for a short time to Henry of Brunswick. In 1214 the Wittelsbachs became Bacharach\u2019s new lords. Together with the \"Unteramt\" of Kaub they received here their most important toll and revenue source. In 1314 it was decided to choose Louis the Bavarian as the German king. Furthermore, Bacharach was the most important transfer point for the wine trade, as barrels were offloaded here from the smaller ships that were needed to get by the \"Binger Loch\" (a quartzite reef in the Rhine upstream near Bingen) and loaded onto bigger ones. From then on, the wine bore the designation \"Bacharacher\". The timber trade from the Hunsr\u00fcck also brought Bacharach importance, and in 1356, Bacharach was granted town rights.\nWidely visible is the \"Wernerkapelle\", a \"Rheinromantik\" landmark of the town, lying on the way up to Stahleck Castle from the town. It is the expanded \"Kunibertkapelle\", and is still an unfinished Gothic ruin today. Its namesake is Werner of Oberwesel, known in connection with pogroms triggered by his death. According to the Christian blood libel, which was typical of the times, a 16-year-old Werner was murdered on Maundy Thursday 1287 by members of the local Jewish community, who then used his blood for Passover observances. On the grounds of this alleged ritual murder, there arose an anti-Semitic mob who waged a pogrom, wiping out Jewish communities in the Middle and Lower Rhine and Moselle regions. In folk Christianity arose the cult of Werner, which was only stricken from the Bishopric of Trier calendar in 1963.\nIn 1344, building work began on the town wall, and was already finished about 1400. In 1545, the town, along with the Palatinate, became Protestant under Count Palatine Friedrich II. Stahleck Castle and the town wall could not stop Bacharach from undergoing eight changes in military occupation in the Thirty Years' War, nor the war\u2019s attendant sackings. Moreover, further destruction was wrought by several town fires. Then, in 1689, French troops fighting in the Nine Years' War blew Stahleck Castle and four of the town wall\u2019s towers up.\nIn 1794, French Revolutionary troops occupied the Rhine\u2019s left bank and in 1802, Bacharach became temporarily French. During the War of the Sixth Coalition the Prussian Field Marshal Bl\u00fccher, after crossing the Rhine near Kaub, came through Bacharach and the Steeg Valley on New Year\u2019s Night 1813-1814 with his troops on the way to France. Recalling this event is a monument stone somewhat downstream, across from Kaub. After the Congress of Vienna, the town went, along with the Rhine\u2019s left bank, up to and including Bingerbr\u00fcck, to Prussia. After the harbour silted up, Bacharach fell into a slumber from which it only awoke in the course of the \"Rheinromantik\". Among the first of the prominent visitors at this time was the French writer Victor Hugo.\nCaring for and maintaining Bacharach\u2019s building monuments, spurred on in the early 20th century by the Rhenish Association for Monument Care and Landscape Preservation (\"Rheinischer Verein f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege und Landschaftsschutz\") which took on the then highly endangered town wall and Stahleck Castle ruin jobs, and the great dedication of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to the \"Wernerkapelle\" have seen to it that Bacharach is still a jewel of the \"Rheinromantik\" and a multifaceted documentary site of mediaeval architecture on the Middle Rhine. The \"Wernerkapelle\" ruin is under monumental protection and before it a plaque has been placed recalling the inhuman crimes against Jewish residents and also containing a quotation from a prayer by Pope John XXIII for a change in Christians\u2019 thinking in their relationship with the Jews:\n\u201cWe recognize today that many centuries of blindness have shrouded our eyes, so that we no longer saw the goodliness of Thy Chosen People and no longer recognized our firstborn brother\u2019s traits. We discover now that a mark of Cain stands on our forehead. In the course of the centuries our brother Abel has lain in blood that we spilt, and he has wept tears that we brought forth, because we forgot Thy love. Forgive us the curse that we unrightfully affixed to the Jews\u2019 name. Forgive us for nailing Thee in their flesh for a second time to the Cross. For we knew not what we did...\"\nToday Bacharach thrives on tourism and wine from Bacharach is still enjoying international popularity. Not to be overlooked, however, are problems arising from a shrinking population, itself brought about by a lack of prospects.\nAmalgamations.\nOn 7 June 1969, the formerly self-administering municipality of Steeg was amalgamated with Bacharach.\nCoat of arms.\nThe town\u2019s arms might be described thus: Per fess at the nombril point sable a lion rampant Or armed, langued and crowned gules, and bendy lozengy argent and azure.\nPopulation development.\nThe number 1871-1987 are census results\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nTransport.\nBacharach lies on the Rhine\u2019s left bank and can be reached by \"Bundesstra\u00dfe\" 9 or the Rhine. Running regularly to and from Bacharach are the excursion ships of the \"K\u00f6ln-D\u00fcsseldorfer-Rheinschiffahrt\", or KD for short.\nTransport routes on the other side of the river can be reached by ferry from the \"Engelsburg\" (castle) over to Kaub.\nThe town belongs to the \"Rhein-Nahe-Nahverkehrsverbund\" \u2013 a local transport association. Bacharach lies on the West Rhine Railway and is served by Cologne - Koblenz\u2014Boppard\u2014Bacharach\u2014Bingen am Rhein\u2014Mainz Regionalbahn trains (as of August 2022).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A modern biography brought to general attention his other roles, as an arbiter of taste, an influential art critic and an \"urbaniste\".\nPetit de Bachaumont was of noble family and was brought up at the court of Versailles. He passed his whole life in Paris, however, as the centre of the salon of Marie Anne Doublet (1677\u20131771), where criticism of art and literature took the form of malicious gossip. A sort of register of news was kept in a journal of the salon, starting in 1762, which dealt largely in scandals and contained accounts of books suppressed by the censor. Bachaumont's name is commonly connected with the first volumes of this register, which was published anonymously, long after Petit de Bachaumont's death, under the title \"M\u00e9moires secrets pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la R\u00e9publique des Lettres\", but his exact share in the authorship of those years before his death in 1771 is a matter of controversy. The register was continued by Pidansat de Mairobert (1707\u20131779), who may have had a greater hand in it from the start, and by others, until it reached 36 volumes (covering the years 1774-1779). It is of some value as a historical source, especially for prohibited literature, and full of anecdotes, for which it was sieved by the brothers Goncourt, who revived interest in this obscure figure, whom they presented as the \"anecdotier parfait\", the reputation, as the \"perfect recounter of anecdote\" to the present time.\nPetit de Bachaumont's studied \"indolence\", remarked upon in his obituary, was a stylish pose. His major published writings are \"Essai sur la peinture, la sculpture et l'architecture\" (1751) and his surveys of the Paris salons of 1767 and 1769, in which aesthetics and cultural politics were inseparably entwined. Less noted is his published call in 1749 for the roofing-over of the classical colonnaded east front of the Palais du Louvre and the clearing away of the ramshackle structures, both those that had been built against it, in order to form a proper Palais du Louvre, and those in the centre of the Cour Carr\u00e9e itself Sections of the palace were in danger of collapse, scarcely touched by royal indifference after 1678; work did begin in 1755 to clear the facade of the Louvre, overseen by the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot and Marigny, supervisor of the B\u00e2timents du Roi.\nAs a critic of art, his recommendation of a young artist named Fran\u00e7ois Boucher appeared in a design memorandum Bachaumont presented the duc de Bouillon, who was occupied with renovating interiors at the Ch\u00e2teau de Navarre in Normandy, in 1730: \"he is very quick, works fast and is not expensive\". \nSee, in addition to the memoirs of the time, especially the \"\" of Grimm, Diderot, d'Alembert and others (new ed-, Paris, 1878); Ch.

{"id": "58244", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58244", "title": "Cordite", "text": "Smokeless propellant\nCordite is a family of smokeless propellants developed and produced in Britain since 1889 to replace black powder as a military firearm propellant. Cordite is a mixture of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, and is therefore a mixture of a chemical high explosive stabilized with a low explosive. These produce a subsonic deflagration wave rather than the supersonic detonation wave produced by brisants, or high explosives. The hot gases produced by burning gunpowder or cordite generate sufficient pressure to propel a bullet or shell to its target, but not so quickly as to routinely destroy the barrel of the gun.\nCordite was used initially in the .303 British, Mark I and II, standard rifle cartridge between 1891 and 1915. Shortages of cordite in World War I led to the creation of the \"Devil's Porridge\" munitions factory (HM Factory, Gretna) on the English\u2013Scottish border, which produced around 800 tonnes of cordite per week. The UK also imported some United States\u2013developed smokeless powders for use in rifle cartridges. Cordite was also used for large weapons, such as tank guns, artillery, and naval guns. It has been used mainly for this purpose since the late 19th century by the UK and British Commonwealth countries. Its use was further developed before World War II, and as Unrotated Projectiles for launching anti-aircraft weapons. Small cordite rocket charges were also developed for ejector seats made by the Martin-Baker Company. Cordite was also used in the detonation system of the Little Boy atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima in August 1945.\nThe term \"cordite\" generally disappeared from official publications between the wars. During World War II, double-base propellants were very widely used, and there was some use of triple-base propellants by artillery. Triple-base propellants were used in post-war ammunition designs and remain in production for UK weapons; most double-base propellants left service as World War II stocks were expended after the war. For small arms it has been replaced by other propellants, such as the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of extruded powder or the WC844 ball propellant currently in use in the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO. Production ceased in the United Kingdom around the end of the 20th century, with the closure of the last of the World War II cordite factories, ROF Bishopton. Triple-base propellant for UK service (for example, the 105\u00a0mm L118 Light Gun) is now manufactured in Germany.\nAdoption of smokeless powder by the British government.\nReplacements for gunpowder (black powder).\nGunpowder, a combustable mixture of sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate (also known as saltpetre), was the original propellant employed in firearms and fireworks. It was used from about the 10th or 11th century onward, but it had disadvantages, including the large amount of smoke it produced. With the 19th-century development of various \"nitro explosives\", based on the reaction of nitric acid mixtures on materials such as cellulose and glycerin, a search began for a replacement for gunpowder.\nEarly European smokeless powders.\nThe first smokeless powder was developed in 1865 by Johann Edward Schultze. At the time of this breakthrough, Schultze was a captain of Prussian artillery. Schultze eventually rose to the rank of colonel. His formulation (dubbed \"Schultze Powder\") was composed of nitrolignose derived from nitrated wood grains, impregnated with saltpetre or barium nitrate.\nIn 1882, the Explosive Company of Stowmarket introduced \"EC Powder\", which contained nitro-cotton and nitrates of potassium and barium in a grain gelatinised by ether alcohol. It had coarser grains than other nitrocellulose powders. It proved unsuitable for rifles, but it remained in long use for shotguns and was later used for grenades and fragmentation bombs.\nIn 1884, the French chemist Paul Vieille produced a smokeless propellant that had some success. It was made out of collodion (nitrocellulose dissolved in ethanol and ether), resulting in a plastic colloidal substance which was rolled into very thin sheets, then dried and cut up into small flakes. It was immediately adopted by the French military for their Mle 1886 infantry rifle and called \"Poudre B\" (for \"poudre blanche\", or \"white powder\") to distinguish it from \"black powder\" (gunpowder). The rifle and the cartridge developed to use this powder were known generically as the 8mm Lebel, after the officer who developed its 8\u00a0mm full metal jacket bullet.\nThe following year, 1887, Alfred Nobel invented and patented a smokeless propellant he called \"Ballistite\". It was composed of 10% camphor, 45% nitroglycerine and 45% collodion (nitrocellulose). Over time the camphor tended to evaporate, leaving an unstable explosive.\nDevelopment.\nA United Kingdom government committee, known as the \"Explosives Committee\", chaired by Sir Frederick Abel, monitored foreign developments in explosives and obtained samples of Poudre B and Ballistite; neither of these smokeless powders was recommended for adoption by the Explosives Committee.\nAbel, Sir James Dewar and W Kellner, who was also on the committee, developed and jointly patented (Nos 5,614 and 11,664 in the names of Abel and Dewar) in 1889 a new ballistite-like propellant in 1889. It consists of (by weight) 58% nitroglycerin, 37% guncotton (nitrocellulose) and 5% petroleum jelly. Using acetone as a solvent, it was extruded as spaghetti-like rods initially called \"cord powder\" or \"the Committee's modification of Ballistite\", but this was swiftly abbreviated to \"Cordite\".\nCordite began as a \"double-base\" propellant. In the 1930s, \"triple-base\" was developed by including a substantial proportion of nitroguanidine. Triple-base propellant reduced the disadvantages of double-base propellant \u2013 its relatively high temperature and significant flash. Imperial Chemical Industries's (ICI) World War II double-base \"AN\" formulation also had a much lower temperature, but it lacked the flash reduction properties of N and NQ triple-base propellants.\nWhilst cordite is classified as an explosive, it is not employed as a high explosive. It is designed to deflagrate, or burn, to produce high pressure gases.\nNobel and Abel patent dispute.\nAlfred Nobel sued Abel and Dewar over an alleged patent infringement. His patent specified that the nitrocellulose should be \"of the well-known soluble kind\". After losing the case, it went to the Court of Appeal. This dispute eventually reached the House of Lords, in 1895, but it was finally lost because the words \"of the well-known soluble kind\" in his patent were taken to mean the soluble collodion, and hence specifically excluded the insoluble guncotton. The ambiguous phrase was \"soluble nitro-cellulose\": soluble nitro-cellulose was known as \"Collodion\" and was soluble in alcohol. It was employed mainly for medical and photographic use. In contrast, insoluble in alcohol, nitrocellulose was known as \"gun cotton\" and was used as an explosive. Nobel's patent refers to the production of Celluloid using camphor and soluble nitrocellulose; and this was taken to imply that Nobel was specifically distinguishing between the use of soluble and insoluble nitrocellulose. For a forensic analysis of the case, see The History of Explosives Vol II; The Case for Cordite, John Williams (2014). However, in her comprehensive 2019 biography of Alfred Nobel Ingrid Carlberg notes how closely Abel and Dewar were allowed to follow Nobel's work in Paris, and how disappointed Nobel was with how this trust was betrayed. The book argues for Nobel as the original inventor and that the case was lost because of an unimportant technicality.\nFormulations.\nIt was quickly discovered that the rate of burning could be varied by altering the surface area of the cordite. Narrow rods were used in small-arms and were relatively fast burning, while thicker rods would burn more slowly and were used for longer barrels, such as those used in artillery and naval guns.\nCordite (Mk I) and Cordite MD.\nThe original Abel-Dewar formulation was soon superseded, as it caused excessive gun barrel erosion. It has since become known as \"Cordite Mk I\".\nThe composition of cordite was changed to 65% guncotton, 30% nitroglycerin (keeping 5% petroleum jelly), and 0.8% acetone shortly after the end of the Second Boer War. This was known as \"Cordite MD\" (modified).\nCordite MD cartridges typically weighed approximately 15% more than the cordite Mk I cartridges they replaced, to achieve the same muzzle velocity, due to the inherently less powerful nature of Cordite MD.\nCordite RDB.\nDuring World War I, acetone was in short supply in Great Britain, and a new experimental form was developed for use by the Royal Navy. This was \"Cordite RDB\" (= \"R\"esearch \"D\"epartment formula \"B\"); which was 52% collodion, 42% nitroglycerin and 6% petroleum jelly. It was produced at HM Factory, Gretna; and the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath.\nAcetone for the cordite industry during late World War I was eventually produced through the efforts of Dr. Chaim Weizmann, considered to be the father of industrial fermentation. While a lecturer at Manchester University Weizmann discovered how to use bacterial fermentation to produce large quantities of many desired substances. He used the bacterium \"Clostridium acetobutylicum\" (the so-called Weizmann organism) to produce acetone. Weizmann transferred the rights to the manufacture of acetone to the Commercial Solvents Corporation in exchange for royalties. After the Shell Crisis of 1915 during World War I, he was director of the British Admiralty Laboratories from 1916 until 1919.\nCordite RDB was later found to become unstable if stored too long.\nCordite SC.\nResearch on solvent-free Cordite RDB technologically extremely similar to ballistite continued primarily on the addition of stabilizers, which was based on German RP C/12 propellant featuring significant amounts of centralite (Called \"carbamite\" in British parlance) and led to the type commonly used in World War II as the main naval propellant. In Great Britain this was known as \"Cordite SC\" (= Solventless Cordite), and it required production facilities separate from classical cordite.\nCordite SC was produced in different shapes and sizes, so the particular geometry of Cordite SC was indicated by the use of letters or numbers, or both, after the SC. For example, SC followed by a number was rod-shaped cord, with the number representing the diameter in thousandths of an inch. \"SC T\" followed by two sets of numbers indicated tubular propellant, with the numbers representing the two diameters in thousandths.\nTwo-inch (approximately 50\u00a0mm) and three-inch (approximately 75\u00a0mm) diameter, rocket Cordite SC charges were developed in great secrecy before World War II for anti-aircraft purposes\u2014the so-called \"Z batteries\", using 'Unrotated Projectiles'.\nGreat Britain changed to metric units in the 1960s, so there was a discontinuity in the propellant geometry numbering system.\nCordite N.\nAn important development during World War II was the addition of another explosive, nitroguanidine, to the mixture to form \"triple-base\" propellant or \"Cordite N\" and \"NQ\". The formulations were slightly different for artillery and naval use. This solved two problems associated with the large naval guns fitted to British Navy's capital ships: gun flash and muzzle erosion. Nitroguanidine produces large amounts of nitrogen when heated, which had the benefit of reducing the muzzle flash, and its lower burning temperature greatly reduced the erosion of the gun barrel.\nN and NQ were also issued in limited amounts to ammunitions used by the British 25-pdr and 5.5-inch land-based artillery pieces.\nAfter World War II production of double-base propellants generally ended. Triple-base propellants, N and NQ, were the only ones used in new ammunition designs, such as the cartridges for 105\u00a0mm Field and for 155\u00a0mm FH70.\nManufacture.\nUK Government factories.\nIn Great Britain, cordite was developed for military use at the Royal Arsenal by Abel, Dewar and Kellner, Woolwich, and produced at the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills from 1889 onwards.\nAt the start of World War I, cordite was in production at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills and by seven other suppliers (British Explosives Syndicate Ltd, Chilworth Gunpowder Company Ltd, Cotton Powder Company Ltd, Messrs Curtis's and Harvey Ltd, National Explosives Company Ltd, New Explosives Company Ltd and Nobels Explosive Company Ltd). Existing factories were expanded and new ones built, notably by Nobel's at Ardeer, HM Factory, Gretna, which straddled the Scotland-England border at Gretna, and the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath. A factory was also established by the Indian Government at Nilgris. Both the Gretna and the Holton Heath cordite factories closed at the end of World War I.\nBy the start of World War II, Holton Heath had reopened, and an additional factory for the Royal Navy, The Royal Navy Propellant Factory, Caerwent, opened at Caerwent in Wales. A very large Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Bishopton, was opened in Scotland to manufacture cordite for the British Army and the Royal Air Force. A new cordite factory at Waltham Abbey and two additional ROF's\u2014ROF Ranskill and ROF Wrexham\u2014were also opened. Cordite produced in these factories was sent to filling factories for filling into ammunition.\nMoS Agency Factories and ICI Nobel in World War II.\nThe British Government set up additional cordite factories, not under Royal Ordnance Factory control but as Agency Factories run on behalf of the Ministry of Supply (MoS). The company of ICI Nobel, at Ardeer, was asked in 1939 to construct and operate six factories in southern Scotland. Four of these six were involved in cordite or firearm-propellant manufacture. The works at MoS Drungans (Dumfries) produced guncotton that was converted to cordite at MoS Dalbeattie (triple-base cordite) and at MoS Powfoot (monobase granulated guncotton for small-arms). A smaller site at Girvan, South Ayrshire, now occupied by Grant's distillery, produced cordite and TNT. The ICI Ardeer site also had a mothballed World War I Government-owned cordite factory.\n35% of British cordite produced between 1942 and 1945 came from Ardeer and these agency factories. ICI ran a similar works at Deer Park (which was also confusingly known as Ardeer after the adjacent suburb) near Melbourne in Australia and in South Africa.\nOverseas supplies.\nAdditional sources of propellant were also sought from the British Commonwealth in both World War I and World War II. Canada, South Africa, and Australia had ICI-owned factories that, in particular, supplied large quantities of cordite.\nWorld War I.\nCanadian Explosives Limited was formed in 1910 to produce rifle cordite, at its Beloeil factory, for the Quebec Arsenal. By November 1915 production had been expanded to produce 350,000\u00a0lb (159,000\u00a0kg) of cordite per month for the Imperial Munitions Board.\nThe Imperial Munitions Board set up a number of additional explosives factories in Canada. It built \"The British Cordite Ltd\" factory at Nobel, Ontario, in 1916/1917, to produce cordite. Production started in mid-1917.\nCanadian Explosives Limited built an additional cordite factory at Nobel, Ontario. Work started in February 1918 and was finished on 24 August 1918. It was designed to produce 1,500,000\u00a0lb (681,000\u00a0kg) of cordite per month.\nFactories, specifically \"heavy industry\" (Long, and Marland 2009) were important for the provision of munitions. Cordite factories typically employed women (Cook 2006) who put their lives at risk as they packed the shells.\nProduction quantities.\nLarge quantities of cordite were manufactured in both World Wars for use by the military.\nPre-World War I.\nPrior to World War I, most of the cordite used by the British Government was produced in its own factories. Immediately prior to World War I, between 6,000 and 8,000 tons per year of cordite were produced in the United Kingdom by private manufacturers; between 1,000 and 1,500 tons per year were made by Nobel's Explosives, at Ardeer. However, private industry had the capability to produce about 10,000 tons per year, with Ardeer able to produce some 3,000 tons of this total.\nWorld War I.\nAt the start of World War I, private industry in the UK was asked to produce 16,000 tons of cordite, and all the companies started to expand. HM Factory, Gretna, the largest propellant factory in the United Kingdom, which opened in 1916, was by 1917 producing 800 tons (812 tonne) of Cordite RDB per week (approximately 41,600 tons per year). The Royal Navy had its own factory at Holton Heath.\nIn 1910, Canadian Explosives Limited produced 3,000\u00a0lb (1,362\u00a0kg) of rifle cordite per month at its Beloeil factory, for the Quebec Arsenal. By November 1915 production had been expanded to 350,000\u00a0lb (159,000\u00a0kg) of cordite per month (approximately 1,900 tonnes per year). The Canadian Explosives Limited cordite factory at Nobel, Ontario, was designed to produce 1,500,000\u00a0lb (681 tonne) of cordite per month (approximately 8,170 tonnes per year).\nBetween wars.\nHM Factory, Gretna, and the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath, both closed after the end of the war and the Gretna factory was dismantled. This left the Waltham Abbey and Ardeer factories in production.\nWorld War II.\nAs noted above, in addition to its own facilities, the British Government had ICI Nobel set up a number of Agency Factories producing cordite in Scotland, Australia, Canada and South Africa.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Classical Chinese ethnography (like much premodern ethnography) was often sketchy, leaving it unclear as to whether Chinese-depicted names referred to a true ethnic group or a possibly multiethnic political entity. Even then, ethnonyms were sometimes assigned by geographic location or surrounding features, rather than by any features of the people themselves, and often carried little distinction of who the Han Chinese authors considered Chinese and non-Chinese for differences such as lifestyle, language, or governance. Many of the ethnonyms were historically used in such a way as to invite comparison with the word \"barbarian\".\nEnglish names.\nThe Chinese exonyms of various ethnic groups encountered in Chinese history can be rendered into English either by transliteration or translation; for instance, \"D\u00ed\" \u72c4 is transliterated as \"Di\" (or \"Ti\") or translated as \"Northern Barbarians\". In some cases authors prefer to transliterate specific exonyms as proper nouns, and in other cases to translate generic ones as English \"barbarian\" (for instance, \"Four Barbarians\"). The American sinologist Marc S. Abramson explains why \"barbarian\" is the appropriate translation for general terms like \"fan\" \u756a and \"hu\" \u80e1, but not specific ones like \"fancai\" \u756a\u83dc \"foreign-style food\".\nTranslations such as \"foreigner\" and \"alien,\" though possessing an air of scholarly neutrality, are inappropriate as a general translation because they primarily connote geographic and political outsiderness, implying that individuals and groups so designated were external to the Tang Empire and ineligible to become subjects of the empire. This was frequently not the case with many uses of \"fan\" and related terms \u2014 most common among them were \"hu\" (often used in the Tang to denote Central Asians) and four ethnonyms of great antiquity that, by the Tang, were mostly used generically with implicit geographic connotations: \"yi\" (east), \"man\" (south), \"rong\" (west), and \"di\" (north) \u2014 that largely connoted cultural and ethnic otherness but did not exclude the designated persons or groups from membership in the empire. Although the term \"barbarian\" has undergone many transformations from its Greek origins to its current English usage, not all of which are relevant to the Tang (such as its use in medieval Europe to denote religious difference, marking non-Christians of various ethnic, geographic, and political affiliations), its consistent association with inferiority, lack of civilization, and externality in the broadest sense often make it the most appropriate choice, including some cases when it is placed in the mouths of non-Han referring to themselves or others. However, its pejorative connotations make it inappropriate as a general translation. Thus, I have chosen not to translate these terms when they designate particular groups, individuals, or phenomena and do not refer to a specific ethnic group, language, geographic place, or cultural complex.\nList of ethnic groups.\nThe following table summarizes the various ethnic groups and/or other social groups of known historical significance to the history of China (any non clear-cut connection is denoted by a question mark):\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of its first major uses was as guncotton, a replacement for gunpowder as propellant in firearms. It was also used to replace gunpowder as a low-order explosive in mining and other applications. In the form of collodion, it was also a critical component in an early photographic emulsion, the use of which revolutionized photography in the 1860s. In the 20th century, it was adapted to automobile lacquer and adhesives.\nProduction.\nThe process uses a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid to convert cellulose into nitrocellulose. The quality of the cellulose is important. Hemicellulose, lignin, pentosans, and mineral salts give inferior nitrocelluloses. In organic chemistry, nitrocellulose is a nitrate ester, not a nitro compound. The glucose repeat unit (anhydroglucose) within the cellulose chain has three OH groups, each of which can form a nitrate ester. Thus, nitrocellulose can denote mononitrocellulose, dinitrocellulose, and trinitrocellulose, or a mixture thereof. With fewer OH groups than the parent cellulose, nitrocelluloses do not aggregate by hydrogen bonding. The overarching consequence is that the nitrocellulose is soluble in organic solvents such as acetone and esters; e.g., ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, ethyl carbonate. Most lacquers are prepared from the dinitrate, whereas explosives are mainly the trinitrate.\nThe chemical equation for the formation of the trinitrate is\nThe yields are about 85%, with losses attributed to complete oxidation of the cellulose to oxalic acid.\nUse.\nThe principal uses of cellulose nitrate is for the production of lacquers and coatings, explosives, and celluloid.\nIn terms of lacquers and coatings, nitrocellulose dissolves readily in organic solvents, which upon evaporation leave a colorless, transparent, flexible film. Nitrocellulose lacquers have been used as a finish on furniture and musical instruments.\nGuncotton, dissolved at about 25% in acetone, forms a lacquer used in preliminary stages of wood finishing to develop a hard finish with a deep lustre. It is normally the first coat applied, then it is sanded and followed by other coatings that bond to it.\nNail polish contains nitrocellulose, as it is inexpensive, dries quickly to a hard film, and does not damage skin.\nThe explosive applications are diverse and nitrate content is typically higher for propellant applications than for coatings. For space flight, nitrocellulose was used by Copenhagen Suborbitals on several missions as a means of jettisoning components of the rocket/space capsule and deploying recovery systems. However, after several missions and flights, it proved not to have the desired explosive properties in a near vacuum environment. In 2014, the Philae comet lander failed to deploy its harpoons because its 0.3 grams of nitrocellulose propulsion charges failed to fire during the landing.\nOther uses.\nCollodion, a solution of nitrocellulose, is used today in topical skin applications, such as liquid skin and in the application of salicylic acid, the active ingredient in Compound W wart remover.\nHistorical uses.\nEarly work on nitration of cellulose.\nIn 1832 Henri Braconnot discovered that nitric acid, when combined with starch or wood fibers, would produce a lightweight combustible explosive material, which he named \"xylo\u00efdine\". A few years later in 1838, another French chemist, Th\u00e9ophile-Jules Pelouze (teacher of Ascanio Sobrero and Alfred Nobel), treated paper and cardboard in the same way. Jean-Baptiste Dumas obtained a similar material, which he called \"nitramidine\".\nGuncotton.\nAround 1846 Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein, a German-Swiss chemist, discovered a more practical formulation. As he was working in the kitchen of his home in Basel, he spilled a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) on the kitchen table. He reached for the nearest cloth, a cotton apron, and wiped it up. He hung the apron on the stove door to dry, and as soon as it was dry, a flash occurred as the apron ignited. His preparation method was the first to be widely used. The method was to immerse one part of fine cotton in 15 parts of an equal blend of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. After two minutes, the cotton was removed and washed in cold water to set the esterification level and to remove all acid residue. The cotton was then slowly dried at a temperature below 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F). Sch\u00f6nbein collaborated with the Frankfurt professor Rudolf Christian B\u00f6ttger, who had discovered the process independently in the same year.\nBy coincidence, a third chemist, the Brunswick professor F. J. Otto had also produced guncotton in 1846 and was the first to publish the process, much to the disappointment of Sch\u00f6nbein and B\u00f6ttger.\nThe patent rights for the manufacture of guncotton were obtained by John Hall &amp; Son in 1846, and industrial manufacture of the explosive began at a purpose-built factory at Marsh Works in Faversham, Kent, a year later. The manufacturing process was not properly understood and few safety measures were put in place. A serious explosion in July that killed almost two dozen workers resulted in the immediate closure of the plant. Guncotton manufacture ceased for over 15 years until a safer procedure could be developed.\nThe British chemist Frederick Augustus Abel developed the first safe process for guncotton manufacture, which he patented in 1865. The washing and drying times of the nitrocellulose were both extended to 48 hours and repeated eight times over. The acid mixture was changed to two parts sulfuric acid to one part nitric. Nitration can be controlled by adjusting acid concentrations and reaction temperature. Nitrocellulose is soluble in a mixture of ethanol and ether until nitrogen concentration exceeds 12%. Soluble nitrocellulose, or a solution thereof, is sometimes called collodion.\nGuncotton containing more than 13% nitrogen (sometimes called insoluble nitrocellulose) was prepared by prolonged exposure to hot, concentrated acids for limited use as a blasting explosive or for warheads of underwater weapons such as naval mines and torpedoes. Safe and sustained production of guncotton began at the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills in the 1860s, and the material rapidly became the dominant explosive, becoming the standard for military warheads, although it remained too potent to be used as a propellant. More-stable and slower-burning collodion mixtures were eventually prepared using less concentrated acids at lower temperatures for smokeless powder in firearms. The first practical smokeless powder made from nitrocellulose, for firearms and artillery ammunition, was invented by French chemist Paul Vieille in 1884.\nJules Verne viewed the development of guncotton with optimism. He referred to the substance several times in his novels. His adventurers carried firearms employing this substance. In his \"From the Earth to the Moon\", guncotton was used to launch a projectile into space.\nBecause of their fluffy and nearly white appearance, nitrocellulose products are often referred to as cottons, e.g. lacquer cotton, celluloid cotton, and gun cotton.\nGuncotton was originally made from cotton (as the source of cellulose) but contemporary methods use highly processed cellulose from wood pulp. While guncotton is dangerous to store, the hazards it presents can be minimized by storing it dampened with various liquids, such as alcohol. For this reason, accounts of guncotton usage dating from the early 20th century refer to \"wet guncotton.\"\nThe power of guncotton made it suitable for blasting. As a projectile driver, it had around six times the gas generation of an equal volume of black powder and produced less smoke and less heating.\nArtillery shells filled with gun cotton were widely used during the American Civil War, and its use was one of the reasons the conflict was seen as the \"first modern war.\" Fired from breech-loading artillery, such high explosive shells could cause greater damage than previous solid round shot.\nDuring the first World War, British authorities were slow to introduce new grenades, with soldiers at the front improvising by filling ration tin cans with gun cotton, scrap and a basic fuse.\nFurther research indicated the importance of washing the acidified cotton. Unwashed nitrocellulose (sometimes called pyrocellulose) may spontaneously ignite and explode at room temperature, as the evaporation of water results in the concentration of unreacted acid.\nFilm.\nIn 1855, the first human-made plastic, nitrocellulose (branded Parkesine, patented in 1862), was created by Alexander Parkes from cellulose treated with nitric acid and a solvent. In 1868, American inventor John Wesley Hyatt developed a plastic material he named Celluloid, improving on Parkes' invention by plasticizing the nitrocellulose with camphor so that it could be processed into a photographic film. This was used commercially as \"celluloid\", a highly flammable plastic that until the mid-20th century formed the basis for lacquers and photographic film.\nOn May 2, 1887, Hannibal Goodwin filed a patent for \"a photographic pellicle and process of producing same\u00a0... especially in connection with roller cameras\", but the patent was not granted until September 13, 1898. In the meantime, George Eastman had already started production of roll-film using his own process.\nNitrocellulose was used as the first flexible film base, beginning with Eastman Kodak products in August 1889. Camphor is used as a plasticizer for nitrocellulose film, often called nitrate film. Goodwin's patent was sold to Ansco, which successfully sued Eastman Kodak for infringement of the patent and was awarded $5,000,000 in 1914 to Goodwin Film.\nNitrate film fires.\nDisastrous fires related to celluloid or \"nitrate film\" became regular occurrences in the motion picture industry throughout the silent era and for many years after the arrival of sound film. Projector fires and spontaneous combustion of nitrate footage stored in studio vaults and in other structures were often blamed during the early to mid 20th century for destroying or heavily damaging cinemas, inflicting many serious injuries and deaths, and for reducing to ashes the master negatives and original prints of tens of thousands of screen titles, turning many of them into lost films. Even when nitrate stock did not start the blaze, flames from other sources spread to large nearby film collections, producing intense and highly destructive fires.\nIn 1914\u2014the same year that Goodwin Film was awarded $5,000,000 from Kodak for patent infringement\u2014nitrate film fires incinerated a significant portion of the United States' early cinematic history. In that year alone, five very destructive fires occurred at four major studios and a film-processing plant. Millions of feet of film burned on March 19 at the Eclair Moving Picture Company in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Later that same month, many more reels and film cans of negatives and prints also burned at Edison Studios in New York City, in the Bronx. On May 13, a fire at Universal Pictures' Colonial Hall \"film factory\" in Manhattan consumed another extensive collection. Yet again, on June 13 in Philadelphia, a fire and a series of explosions ignited inside the 186-square-meter (2,000-square-foot) film vault of the Lubin Manufacturing Company and quickly wiped out virtually all of that studio's pre-1914 catalogue. Then a second fire hit the Edison Company at another location on December 9, at its film-processing complex in West Orange, New Jersey. That catastrophic fire started inside a film-inspection building and caused over $7,000,000 in property damages ($ today). Even after film technology changed, archives of older films remained vulnerable; the 1965 MGM vault fire burned many films that were decades old.\nThe use of volatile nitrocellulose film for motion pictures led many cinemas to fireproof their projection rooms with wall coverings made of asbestos. Those additions intended to prevent or at least delay the migration of flames beyond the projection areas. A training film for projectionists included footage of a controlled ignition of a reel of nitrate film, which continued to burn even when fully submerged in water. Once burning, it is extremely difficult to extinguish. Unlike most other flammable materials, nitrocellulose does not need a source of air to continue burning, since it contains sufficient oxygen within its molecular structure to sustain a flame. For this reason, immersing burning film in water may not extinguish it, and could actually increase the amount of smoke produced. Owing to public safety precautions, the United Kingdom's Health and Safety Executive to this day forbids transportation of nitrate film by post or public transit, or disposal with household refuse.\nCinema fires caused by the ignition of nitrocellulose film stock commonly occurred as well. In Ireland in 1926, it was blamed for the Dromcolliher cinema tragedy in County Limerick in which 48 people died. Then in 1929 at the Glen Cinema in Paisley, Scotland, a film-related fire killed 69 children. Today, nitrate film projection is rare and normally highly regulated and requires extensive precautions, including extra health-and-safety training for projectionists. A special projector certified to run nitrate films has many modifications, among them the chambering of the feed and takeup reels in thick metal covers with small slits to allow the film to run through them. The projector is additionally modified to accommodate several fire extinguishers with nozzles aimed at the film gate. The extinguishers automatically trigger if a piece of film near the gate starts to burn. While this triggering would likely damage or destroy a significant portion of the projector's components, it would contain a fire and prevent far greater damage. Projection rooms may also be required to have automatic metal covers for the projection windows, preventing the spread of fire to the auditorium. Today, the Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum is one of a few theaters in the world that is capable of safely projecting nitrate films and regularly screens them to the public. The BFI Southbank in London is the only cinema in the United Kingdom licensed to show Nitrate Film.\nThe use of nitrate film and its fiery potential were certainly not issues limited to the realm of motion pictures or to commercial still photography. The film was also used for many years in medicine, where its hazardous nature was most acute, especially in its application to X-ray photography. In 1929, several tons of stored X-ray film were ignited by steam from a broken heating pipe at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. That tragedy claimed 123 lives during the fire and additional fatalities several days later, when hospitalized victims died due to inhaling excessive amounts of smoke from the burning film, which was laced with toxic gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen cyanide. Related fires in other medical facilities prompted the growing disuse of nitrocellulose stock for X-rays by 1933, nearly two decades before its use was discontinued for motion-picture films in favour of cellulose acetate film, more commonly known as \"safety film\".\nNitrocellulose decomposition and new \"safety\" stocks.\nNitrocellulose was found to gradually decompose, releasing nitric acid and further catalyzing the decomposition (eventually into a flammable powder). Decades later, storage at low temperatures was discovered as a means of delaying these reactions indefinitely. Many films produced during the early 20th century were lost through this accelerating, self-catalyzed disintegration or through studio warehouse fires, and many others were deliberately destroyed specifically to avoid the fire risk. Salvaging old films is a major problem for film archivists (see film preservation).\nNitrocellulose film base manufactured by Kodak can be identified by the presence of the word \"nitrate\" in dark letters along one edge; the word only in clear letters on a dark background indicates derivation from a nitrate base original negative or projection print, but the film in hand itself may be a later print or copy negative, made on safety film. Acetate film manufactured during the era when nitrate films were still in use was marked \"Safety\" or \"Safety Film\" along one edge in dark letters. 8, 9.5, and 16\u00a0mm film stocks, intended for amateur and other nontheatrical use, were never manufactured with a nitrate base in the west, but rumors exist of 16\u00a0mm nitrate film having been produced in the former Soviet Union and China.\nNitrate dominated the market for professional-use 35\u00a0mm motion picture film from the industry's origins to the early 1950s. While cellulose acetate-based safety film, notably cellulose diacetate and cellulose acetate propionate, was produced in the gauge for small-scale use in niche applications (such as printing advertisements and other short films to enable them to be sent through the mails without the need for fire safety precautions), the early generations of safety film base had two major disadvantages relative to nitrate: it was much more expensive to manufacture, and considerably less durable in repeated projection. The cost of the safety precautions associated with the use of nitrate was significantly lower than the cost of using any of the safety bases available before 1948. These drawbacks were eventually overcome with the launch of cellulose triacetate base film by Eastman Kodak in 1948. Cellulose triacetate superseded nitrate as the film industry's mainstay base very quickly. While Kodak had discontinued some nitrate film stocks earlier, it stopped producing various nitrate roll films in 1950 and ceased production of nitrate 35\u00a0mm motion picture film in 1951.\nThe crucial advantage cellulose triacetate had over nitrate was that it was no more of a fire risk than paper (the stock is often referred to as \"non-flam\": this is true\u2014but it is combustible, just not in as volatile or as dangerous a way as nitrate), while it almost matched the cost and durability of nitrate. It remained in almost exclusive use in all film gauges until the 1980s, when polyester/PET film began to supersede it for intermediate and release printing.\nPolyester is much more resistant to polymer degradation than either nitrate or triacetate. Although triacetate does not decompose in as dangerous a way as nitrate does, it is still subject to a process known as deacetylation, often nicknamed \"vinegar syndrome\" (due to the acetic acid smell of decomposing film) by archivists, which causes the film to shrink, deform, become brittle and eventually unusable. PET, like cellulose mononitrate, is less prone to stretching than other available plastics. By the late 1990s, polyester had almost entirely superseded triacetate for the production of intermediate elements and release prints.\nTriacetate remains in use for most camera negative stocks because it can be \"invisibly\" spliced using solvents during negative assembly, while polyester film is usually spliced using adhesive tape patches, which leave visible marks in the frame area. However, ultrasonic splicing in the frame line area can be invisible. Also, polyester film is so strong, it will not break under tension and may cause serious damage to expensive camera or projector mechanisms in the event of a film jam, whereas triacetate film breaks easily, reducing the risk of damage. Many were opposed to the use of polyester for release prints for this reason, and because ultrasonic splicers are very expensive, beyond the budgets of many smaller theaters. In practice, though, this has not proved to be as much of a problem as was feared. Rather, with the increased use of automated long-play systems in cinemas, the greater strength of polyester has been a significant advantage in lessening the risk of a film performance being interrupted by a film break.\nDespite its self-oxidizing hazards, nitrate is still regarded highly as the stock is more transparent than replacement stocks, and older films used denser silver in the emulsion. The combination results in a notably more luminous image with a high contrast ratio.\nFabric.\nThe solubility of nitrocellulose was the basis for the first \"artificial silk\" by Georges Audemars in 1855, which he called \"Rayon\".. However, Hilaire de Chardonnet was the first to patent a nitrocellulose fiber marketed as \"artificial silk\" at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was flammable and more expensive than cellulose acetate or cuprammonium rayon. Because of this predicament, production ceased early in the 1900s. Nitrocellulose was briefly known as \"mother-in-law silk\".\nFrank Hastings Griffin invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing. Nathan Rosenstein invented the \"spunize process\" by which he turned rayon from a hard fiber to a fabric. This allowed rayon to become a popular raw material in textiles.\nCoatings.\nNitrocellulose lacquer manufactured by (among others) DuPont, was the primary material for painting automobiles for many years. Durability of finish, complexities of \"multiple stage\" modern finishes, and other factors including environmental regulation led manufacturers to choose newer technologies. It remained the favorite of hobbyists for both historical reasons and for the ease with which a professional finish can be obtained. Most automobile \"touch up\" paints are still made from lacquer because of its fast drying, easy application, and superior adhesion properties \u2013 regardless of the material used for the original finish. Guitars sometimes shared color codes with current automobiles. It fell out of favor for mass production use for a number of reasons including environmental regulation and the cost of application vs. polyurethane finishes. However, Gibson still uses nitrocellulose lacquers on all of their guitars, as well as Fender when reproducing historically accurate guitars. The nitrocellulose lacquer yellows and cracks over time, and custom shops will reproduce this aging to make instruments appear vintage. Guitars made by smaller shops (luthiers) also often use \"nitro\" as it has an almost mythical status among guitarists.\nHazards.\nBecause of its explosive nature, not all applications of nitrocellulose were successful. In 1869, with elephants having been poached to near extinction, the billiards industry offered a US$10,000 prize to whoever came up with the best replacement for ivory billiard balls. John Wesley Hyatt created the winning replacement, which he created with a new material he invented, called camphored nitrocellulose\u2014the first thermoplastic, better known as celluloid. The invention enjoyed a brief popularity, but the Hyatt balls were extremely flammable, and sometimes portions of the outer shell would explode upon impact. An owner of a billiard saloon in Colorado wrote to Hyatt about the explosive tendencies, saying that he did not mind very much personally but for the fact that every man in his saloon immediately pulled a gun at the sound. The process used by Hyatt to manufacture the billiard balls, patented in 1881, involved placing the mass of nitrocellulose in a rubber bag, which was then placed in a cylinder of liquid and heated. Pressure was applied to the liquid in the cylinder, which resulted in a uniform compression on the nitrocellulose mass, compressing it into a uniform sphere as the heat vaporized the solvents. The ball was then cooled and turned to make a uniform sphere. In light of the explosive results, this process was called the \"Hyatt gun method\".\nAn overheated container of dry nitrocellulose is believed to be the initial cause of the 2015 Tianjin explosions.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In modern Britain, an earl is a member of the peerage, ranking below a marquess and above a viscount. A feminine form of \"earl\" never developed; instead, \"countess\" is used.\nThe title originates in the Old English word , meaning \"a man of noble birth or rank\". The word is cognate with the Scandinavian form \"jarl\". After the Norman Conquest, it became the equivalent of the continental count. In Scotland, it assimilated the concept of mormaer. Since the 1960s, earldoms have typically been created only for members of the royal family. The last non-royal earldom, Earl of Stockton, was created in 1984 for Harold Macmillan, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.\nAlternative names for the rank equivalent to \"earl\" or \"count\" in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as the \"hakushaku\" (\u4f2f\u7235) of the post-restoration Japanese Imperial era.\nEtymology.\nIn the 7th century, the common Old English terms for nobility was or . However, this was later replaced by the term \"thegn\". In the 11th century, under Danish influence, the Old English title \"ealdorman\" became \"earl\", from the Old Norse word . Proto-Norse \"eril\", or the later Old Norse , came to signify the rank of a leader.\nThe Norman-derived equivalent \"count\" (from Latin ) was not introduced following the Norman Conquest of England though \"countess\" was and is used for the female title. Geoffrey Hughes writes, \"It is a likely speculation that the Norman French title 'Count' was abandoned in England in favour of the Germanic 'Earl' [...] precisely because of the uncomfortable phonetic proximity to cunt\".\nIn the other languages of Great Britain and Ireland, the term is translated as: Welsh , Irish and Scottish Gaelic , Scots , or , Cornish .\nEngland.\nAnglo-Saxon period.\nEaldorman.\nThe office of earl evolved from the ealdorman, an office within Anglo-Saxon government. The English king appointed the ealdorman to be the chief officer in a shire. He commanded the local fyrd and presided over the shire court alongside the bishop. As compensation, he received the third penny: one-third of the shire court's profits and the boroughs' revenues. Initially, the ealdorman governed a single shire. Starting with Edward the Elder (r.\u2009899\u00a0\u2013\u00a0924), it became customary for one ealdorman to administer three or four shires together as an ealdormanry.\nCnut the Great.\nDuring Cnut's reign (1016\u20131035), \"ealdorman\" changed to \"earl\" (related to Old English and Scandinavian ). Cnut's realm, the North Sea Empire, extended beyond England, forcing him to delegate power to earls. Earls were governors or viceroys, ruling in the king's name, keeping the peace, dispensing justice, and raising armies. Like the earlier ealdormen, they received the third penny from their jurisdictions. Earls ranked above thegns in precedence and were the chief counselors in the witan (king's council).\nThe office of earl was not hereditary. While sons of earls could expect to inherit their father's office, this was not automatic. Only the king could make someone an earl.\nInitially, Cnut kept Wessex for himself and divided the rest of England into three earldoms. He gave the earldom of East Anglia to Thorkell the Tall and the earldom of Northumbria to Eric. Eadric Streona retained the earldom of Mercia (having been unified with western Mercia in the tenure of earldorman \u00c6lfhere), which he had held since 1007. Cnut gave Godwin the earldom of Wessex in 1018. Eventually Godwin was also granted the earldom of Kent. Thorkell vanished from the records after 1023, and Godwin became the leading earl.\nEarldoms were not permanent territorial divisions; kings could transfer shires from one earldom to another. The fact that there was no local government administration beyond the shire also limited the autonomy of the earls. They could not raise taxation, mint coins, issue charters, or hold their own courts (the shire courts that earls presided over were held in the king's name).\nF. W. Maitland wrote, \"with the estates of the earls, we find it impossible to distinguish between private property and official property\". He noted the existence of \"manors of the shire\" and \"comital vills\" that belonged to the office rather than the officeholder. Stephen Baxter argued that given the evidence, it must be \"assumed that the 'comital manors' in each shire could be transferred by the king from one earl to another with relative ease\". However, not all scholars agree with the existence of such \"comital\" property.\nEdward the Confessor.\nDuring the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042\u20131066), the earls were still royal officers governing their earldoms in the king's name. However, they were developing more autonomy and becoming a threat to royal power. Three great aristocratic families had emerged: the Godwins of Wessex, Leofric of Mercia, and Siward of Northumbria. \nIn theory, earls could be removed by the king. Edward deliberately broke the hereditary succession to Northumbria when Earl Siward died in 1055. He ignored the claims of Siward's son, Waltheof, and appointed Tostig Godwinson as earl. The earldom of East Anglia appears to have been used as a training ground for new earls. Nevertheless, the earldoms of Wessex and Mercia were becoming hereditary. For four generations, Mercia was passed from father to son: Leofwine, Leofric, \u00c6lfgar, and Edwin. \nTo reward Godwin for his support, Edward made his eldest son, Sweyn, an earl in 1043. Harold, Godwin's second oldest son, was made the earl of East Anglia. In 1045, an earldom was created for Godwin's nephew, Beorn Estrithson. After Sweyn left England in disgrace in 1047, some of his estates were taken over by Harold and Beorn. Ralf of Mantes, Edward's Norman nephew, was made earl of Hereford, a territory formerly part of Sweyn's earldom. \nIn 1053, Harold succeeded his father, and \u00c6lfgar, son of Earl Leofric, became earl of East Anglia. A major reshuffle occurred after both Leofric and Ralf died in 1057. \u00c6lfgar succeeded his father in Mercia, and Gyrth Godwinson took East Anglia. An earldom was created for Leofwine Godwinson out of the south-eastern shires belonging to Harold. In exchange, Harold received Ralf's earldom. \nIn 1065, a rebellion deposed Tostig and recognised Morcar, the brother of Earl Edwin of Mercia, as Northumbria's new earl. The king accepted this, and Tostig was expelled from England.\nIn 1066, according to the Domesday Book, the Godwin family estates were valued at \u00a37,000, Earl Leofric of Mercia at \u00a32,400, and Earl Siward of Northumbria at \u00a3350. In comparison, the king's lands were valued at \u00a35,000. This concentration of land and wealth in the hands of the earls, and one family in particular, weakened the Crown's authority. The situation was reversed when Harold Godwinson became king, and he was able to restore the Crown's authority.\nNorman Conquest.\nThe Norman Conquest of 1066 introduced a new Anglo-Norman aristocracy that gradually replaced the old Anglo-Saxon elite. In Normandy, a duchy in the Kingdom of France, the equivalent of an earl was a count. The definition and powers of French counts varied widely. Some counts were nearly independent rulers who gave only nominal loyalty to the King of France. In Normandy, counts were junior members of the Norman dynasty with responsibility for guarding border regions. In 1066, there were three Norman counts: Richard of \u00c9vreux, Robert of Eu, and Robert of Mortain. \nWilliam the Conqueror (r.\u20091066\u00a0\u2013\u00a01087) reduced the size of earldoms; those created after 1071 had responsibility for one shire. Like Norman counts, earls became military governors assigned to vulnerable border or coastal areas. To protect the Welsh Marches, the king made Roger de Montgomery the earl of Shrewsbury and Hugh d'Avranches the earl of Chester &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Likewise, the king's half-brother Odo of Bayeux was made earl of Kent to guard the English Channel. \nAfter the Revolt of the Earls in 1075, only four earldoms remained, all held by Anglo-Normans: Kent, Shrewsbury, Chester, and Northumbria. This number was reduced to three after 1082 when Odo of Bayeux was arrested and deprived of Kent. At the death of William Rufus in 1100, there were five earldoms: Chester, Shrewsbury, Surrey (or Warrenne), Warwick, and Huntingdon\u2013Northampton. In 1122, Henry I made his illegitimate son Robert the earl of Gloucester.\nAfter the Conquest, new earldoms tended to be named for the city and castle in which they were based. Some titles became attached to the family name rather than location. For example, the holder of the earldom of Surrey was more commonly called \"Earl Warenne\". The same was true of the earldom of Buckingham, whose holder was called \"Earl Gifford\". These earls may have preferred to be known by family names that were older and more prestigious than their newer territorial designations.\nStephen and Matilda.\nThe number of earls rose from seven in 1135 to twenty in 1141 as King Stephen (r.\u20091135\u00a0\u2013\u00a01154) created twelve new earls to reward supporters during the Anarchy, the civil war fought with his cousin Empress Matilda for the English throne. In 1138, Stephen created eight new earldoms:\nIn 1140, Roumare was given the earldom of Lincoln in exchange for Cambridge, and William d'Aubigny received the earldom of Sussex (commonly known as Arundel). The same year, Geoffrey de Mandeville was made earl of Essex, and his is the oldest surviving charter of creation. Around the same time, Hugh Bigod was made earl of Norfolk.\nIn February 1141, Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln, and Empress Matilda elected \"Lady of the English\" in April. At this time, she created three earldoms for her own supporters. Her illegitimate brother Reginald de Dunstanville was made earl of Cornwall. Baldwin de Redvers was made earl of Devon, and William de Mohun, lord of Dunster, was made earl of Somerset. Aubrey de Vere was made earl of Oxford in 1142. Sometime around 1143, Matilda's constable Patrick of Salisbury was made earl of Salisbury.\nDuring the Anarchy, earls took advantage of the power vacuum to assume Crown rights. Robert of Gloucester, Patrick of Salisbury, Robert of Leicester, and Henry of Northumbria all minted their own coinage. Earls and barons had also built adulterine castles (castles built without royal permission).\nPlantagenets.\nIt fell to Stephen's successor Henry II (r.\u20091154\u00a0\u2013\u00a01189) to again curtail the power of earls. He confiscated or demolished illegal castles. He reduced the number of earldoms by allowing them to die with their holders and did not create new ones. During his reign, \"the title became a mark of rank, rather than a substantive office: the real power lay with the king's sheriffs and justices.\"\nThe real power possessed by any individual earl in this period depended on the amount of land and wealth he possessed that could be translated into patronage and influence. The more land and resources concentrated in a region, the more influence an earl had. The most powerful were the earls of Chester, who by the middle of the 13th century were described as earls palatine. Their power derived from owning most of the land in Cheshire. As a result, the shire court and the earl's honour court were identical, and the sheriff answered to the earl. The earl of Oxford possessed less than an acre of land in Oxfordshire (most of his land was in Essex), and therefore possessed no power in the county.\nAn earldom along with its land was inherited generally according to primogeniture. If the only heirs were female, then the land would be partitioned equally between co-heirs with the eldest co-heir receiving the title. In 1204, Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester, died without children. His heirs were his sisters, Amice and Margaret. Amice's son, Simon de Montfort, succeeded as earl of Leicester, and Margaret's husband, Saer de Quincy, was created the earl of Winchester in 1207. This was the first new hereditary earldom created since the reign of Stephen.\nAn earldom could be dramatically impacted upon by multiple partitions. In 1232, Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester died childless. His lands were divided between his four sisters with the title going to the eldest's son, John of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon. John died in 1237, and once again the estate had to be divided between five co-heirs (the two daughters of his eldest sister and his three surviving sisters). Before the land could be divided, King Alexander II of Scotland claimed the earldom of Huntingdon. While the king's council dismissed this claim, the Scottish king was granted the lands attached to Huntingdon but not the title. This reduced the land available to John's co-heirs and created the possibility of an earl who was virtually landless. Earl Ranulf had been the greatest landholder in England, but after two partitions in five years, the land granted to each co-heir was small. William de Forz, husband of the senior co-heir, argued that as a county palatine the earldom of Chester should not be partitioned, but this argument was rejected by the king's court. Ultimately, the king himself gained possession of all the lands attached to the Chester earldom through a series of land exchanges with the co-heirs.\nIn 1227, Henry III (r.\u20091216\u00a0\u2013\u00a01272) granted his justiciar and chief minister, Hubert de Burgh, the earldom of Kent. The terms of inheritance were unprecedented: the earldom was to pass to Hubert's son by his third wife Margaret of Scotland, thereby passing over his eldest son by his first wife. It may have been thought that Margaret's royal blood made her children more worthy of inheritance.\nBy the 13th century earls had a social rank just below the king and princes, but were not necessarily more powerful or wealthier than other noblemen. The only way to become an earl was to inherit the title or to marry into one\u2014and the king reserved a right to prevent the transfer of the title. By the 14th century, creating an earl included a special public ceremony where the king personally tied a sword belt around the waist of the new earl, emphasizing the fact that the earl's rights came from him.\nEarls still held influence and, as \"companions of the king\", generally acted in support of the king's power. They showed their own power prominently in 1327 when they deposed King Edward II. They would later do the same with other kings of whom they disapproved. In 1337 Edward III declared that he intended to create six new earldoms.\nIreland.\nThe first Irish earldom was the Earl of Ulster, granted to the Norman knight Hugh de Lacy in 1205 by John, King of England and Lord of Ireland. Other early earldoms were Earl of Carrick (1315), Earl of Kildare (1316), Earl of Desmond (1329) and Earl of Waterford (1446, extant).\nAfter the Tudor reconquest of Ireland (1530s\u20131603), native Irish kings and clan chiefs were encouraged to submit to the English king (now also King of Ireland) and were, in return, granted noble titles in the Peerage of Ireland. Notable among those who agreed to this policy of \"surrender and regrant\" were Ulick na gCeann Burke, 1st Earl of Clanricarde, Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond, Donald McCarthy, 1st Earl of Clancare, Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, Randal MacDonnell, 1st Earl of Antrim and Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. The earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell later rebelled against the crown and were forced to flee Ireland in 1607; their departure, along with about ninety followers, is famed in Irish history as the Flight of the Earls, seen as the ultimate demise of native Irish monarchy.\nIreland became part of the United Kingdom in 1801, and the last Irish earldom was created in 1824. The Republic of Ireland does not recognize titles of nobility.\nNotable later Irish earls include Jacobite leader Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan; Postmaster General Richard Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty; Prime Minister William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne (later made a marquess); and the (alleged) murderer John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan.\nScotland.\nThe oldest earldoms in Scotland (with the exception of the Earldom of Dunbar and March) originated from the office of mormaer, such as the Mormaer of Fife, of Strathearn, etc.; subsequent earldoms developed by analogy. The principal distinction between earldom and mormaer is that earldoms were granted as fiefs of the King, while mormaers were virtually independent. The \"earl\" is thought to have been introduced by the anglophile king David I. While the power attached to the office of earl was swept away in England by the Norman Conquest, in Scotland earldoms retained substantial powers, such as regality throughout the Middle Ages.\nIt is important to distinguish between the land controlled directly by the earl, in a landlord-like sense, and the region over which he could exercise his office. Scottish use of Latin terms and makes the difference clear. Initially these terms were synonymous, as in England, but by the 12th century they were seen as distinct concepts, with \"comitatus\" referring to the land under direct control of the earl, and referring to the province; hence, the \"comitatus\" might now only be a small region of the . Thus, unlike England, the term \"county\", which ultimately evolved from the Latin , was not historically used for Scotland's main political subdivisions.\nSheriffs were introduced at a similar time to earls, but unlike England, where sheriffs were officers who implemented the decisions of the shire court, in Scotland they were specifically charged with upholding the king's interests in the region, thus being more like a coroner. As such, a parallel system of justice arose, between that provided by magnates (represented by the earls), and that by the king (represented by sheriffs), in a similar way to England having both Courts Baron and Magistrates, respectively. Inevitably, this led to a degree of forum shopping, with the king's offering \u2013 the Sheriff \u2013 gradually winning.\nAs in England, as the centuries wore on, the term \"earl\" came to be disassociated from the office, and later kings started granting the title of \"earl\" without it, and gradually without even an associated \"comitatus\". By the 16th century there started to be earls of towns, of villages, and even of isolated houses; it had simply become a label for marking status, rather than an office of intrinsic power. In 1746, in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising, the Heritable Jurisdictions Act brought the powers of the remaining ancient earldoms under the control of the sheriffs; \"earl\" is now simply a noble rank.\nWales.\nSome of the most significant Earls (Welsh: \"ieirll\", singular \"iarll\") in Welsh history were those from the West of England. As Wales remained independent of any Norman jurisdiction, the more powerful Earls in England were encouraged to invade and establish effective \"buffer states\" to be run as autonomous lordships. These Marcher Lords included the earls of Chester, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Shrewsbury (see also English Earls of March).\nThe first Earldoms created within Wales were the Lordship of Glamorgan (a comital title) and the Earldom of Pembroke.\nTir Iarll (English: \"Earl's land\") is an area of Glamorgan, which has traditionally had a particular resonance in Welsh culture.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAn earldom became, with a few exceptions, the default rank of the peerage to which a former prime minister was elevated. The last prime minister to accept an earldom was Harold Macmillan, who became earl of Stockton in 1984.\nInsignia and forms of address.\nCoronet.\nA British earl is entitled to a coronet bearing eight strawberry leaves (four visible) and eight silver balls (or pearls) around the rim (five visible). The actual coronet is rarely, if ever, worn except at the coronation of a new monarch, but in heraldry an earl may bear his coronet of rank on his coat of arms above the shield.\nForms of address.\nAn earl has the title \"Earl of [X]\" when the title originates from a placename, or \"Earl [X]\" when the title comes from a surname. In either case, he is referred to as \"Lord [X]\", and his wife as \"Lady [X]\". A countess who holds an earldom in her own right also uses \"Lady [X]\", but her husband does not have a title (unless he has one in his own right).\nThe eldest son of an earl, though not himself a peer, is entitled to use a courtesy title, usually the highest of his father's lesser titles (if any). For instance, prior to his father's elevation to the Dukedom of Edinburgh, the eldest son of the Earl of Wessex was styled as James, Viscount Severn. The eldest son of the eldest son of an earl is entitled to use one of his grandfather's lesser titles, normally the second-highest of the lesser titles. Younger sons are styled \"The Honourable\" [\"Forename\"] [\"Surname\"], and daughters, \"The Lady\" [\"Forename\"] [\"Surname\"] (Lady Diana Spencer being a well-known example).\nThere is no difference between the courtesy titles given to the children of earls and the children of countesses in their own right, provided the husband of the countess has a lower rank than she does. If her husband has a higher rank, their children will be given titles according to his rank.\nIn the peerage of Scotland, when there are no courtesy titles involved, the heir to an earldom, and indeed any level of peerage, is styled \"Master of [X]\", and successive sons as \"The Honourable [Firstname Surname]\".\nList of earldoms.\nThere are many earldoms, extant, extinct, dormant, abeyant, or forfeit, in the peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.\nIn fiction.\nEarls have appeared in various works of fiction.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its motto is \"Improving the health, safety, and well-being of America\". Before the separate federal Department of Education was created in 1979, it was called the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).\nHHS is administered by the secretary of health and human services, who is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the United States Senate.\nThe United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the uniformed service of the PHS, is led by the surgeon general who is responsible for addressing matters concerning public health as authorized by the secretary or by the assistant secretary for health in addition to their primary mission of administering the Commissioned Corps.\nHistory.\nFederal Security Agency.\nThe Federal Security Agency (FSA) was established on July 1, 1939, under the Reorganization Act of 1939, P.L. 76\u201319. The objective was to bring together in one agency all federal programs in the fields of health, education, and social security. The first Federal Security Administrator was Paul V. McNutt. The new agency originally consisted of the following major components: (1) Office of the Administrator, (2) Public Health Service (PHS), (3) Office of Education, (4) Civilian Conservation Corps, and (5) Social Security Board.\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare.\nThe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) was created on April 11, 1953, when Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 became effective. HEW thus became the first new Cabinet-level department since the Department of Labor was created in 1913. The Reorganization Plan abolished the FSA and transferred all of its functions to the secretary of HEW and all components of the agency to the department. The first secretary of HEW was Oveta Culp Hobby, a native of Texas, who had served as commander of the Women's Army Corps in World War II and was editor and publisher of the \"Houston Post\". Sworn in on April 11, 1953, as secretary, she had been FSA administrator since January 21, 1953.\nThe six major program-operating components of the new department were the Public Health Service, the Office of Education, the Food and Drug Administration, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, and St. Elizabeth's Hospital. The department was also responsible for three federally aided corporations: Howard University, the American Printing House for the Blind, and the Columbia Institution for the Deaf (Gallaudet College since 1954).\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\nThe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was renamed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on October 17, 1979, when its education functions were transferred to the newly created United States Department of Education under the Department of Education Organization Act. HHS was left in charge of the Social Security Administration, agencies constituting the Public Health Service, and Family Support Administration.\nIn 1995, the Social Security Administration was removed from the Department of Health and Human Services, and established as an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States government.\nThe 2010 United States federal budget established a reserve fund of more than $630 billion over 10 years to finance fundamental reform of the health care system.\nIn February 2025 it was reported that DHHS planned to \"eliminate public participation in many of the agency's policy decisions.\"\nPlanned changes as part of the announced 2025 HHS reorganization include merging five existing agencies into a new Administration for a Healthy America, reorienting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention towards infectious disease programs, and breaking up the Administration for Community Living. In addition, the plan proposes a reduction in workforce totaling about 20,000 full-time employees throughout HHS through multiple avenues, with the greatest relative reductions to the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are each expected to reduce their workforce by 20%.\nOrganization.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is led by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, a member of the United States Cabinet appointed by the President of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate. The secretary is assisted in managing the department by the Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is also appointed by the president. The secretary and deputy secretary are further assisted by seven assistant secretaries, who serve as top departmental administrators.\nThe following organizational structure is current as of the beginning of 2025. It is planned to be significantly changed by the announced 2025 HHS reorganization, which is planned to reduce the number of top-level HHS divisions from 28 to 15.\nU.S. Public Health Service.\nWithin HHS is a collection of agencies and offices that fall under the Public Health Service. The PHS also is home to the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC). The operating agencies that are part of PHS are:\nHuman Services agencies.\nThis list includes the HHS operating agencies that do not fall under PHS:\nOther staff offices.\nThe HHS staff offices outside of PHS are:\nBudget and finances.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services was authorized a budget for fiscal year 2020 of $1.293 trillion. The budget authorization is broken down as follows:\nThe FY2020 budget included a $1.276 billion budget decrease for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a $4.533 billion budget decrease for the National Institutes of Health. These budget cuts, along with other changes since 2019, comprised a total decrease of over $24 billion in revised discretionary budget authority across the entire Department of Health and Human Services for Fiscal Year 2020.\nAdditional details of the budgeted outlays, budget authority, and detailed budgets for other years, can be found at the HHS Budget website.\nPrograms.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services administers 115 programs across its 11 operating divisions. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) aims to \"protect the health of all Americans and provide essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves.\" These federal programs consist of social service programs, civil rights and healthcare privacy programs, disaster preparedness programs, and health-related research. HHS offers a variety of social service programs geared toward persons with low income, disabilities, military families, and senior citizens. Healthcare rights are defined under HHS in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which protect patient's privacy in regards to medical information, protects workers health insurance when unemployed, and sets guidelines surrounding some health insurance. HHS collaborates with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and Office of Emergency Management to prepare and respond to health emergencies. A broad array of health-related research is supported or completed under the HHS; secondarily under HHS, the Health Resources &amp; Service Administration houses data warehouses and makes health data available surrounding a multitude of topics. HHS also has vast offering of health-related resources and tools to help educate the public on health policies and pertinent population health information. Some examples of available resources include disease prevention, wellness, health insurance information, as well as links to healthcare providers and facilities, meaningful health-related materials, public health, and safety information.\nSome highlights include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nThis program is to ensure the accountability of medical professionals to respect and carry out basic human health rights, under the act of the same name. In the United States, the government feels that it is essential for the American people to understand their civil duty and rights to all of their medical information. That includes health insurance policies or medical records from every doctor or emergency visit in one's life. Through Health &amp; Human Services one can file a complaint that their HIPAA rights have been violated or a consultant will be able to decide if their rights were violated.\nSocial Services.\nThis branch has everything to do with the social justice, wellness, and care of all people throughout the United States. This includes but is not limited to people who need government assistance, foster care, unaccompanied alien children, daycares (headstart included), adoption, senior citizens, and disability programs. Social services is one of (if not) the largest branch of programs underneath it that has a wide variety throughout the United States at a state and local level.\nPrevention and Wellness.\nThe prevention and wellness program's main idea is to give the American people the ability to live the healthiest and best lifestyle physically that they can. They are the ones who deal with vaccines and immunizations, which fight from common diseases to deadly ones. The nutrition &amp; fitness program are the basics of healthy eating and regular exercise. Health screenings &amp; family health history are crucial in the knowledge of each individual's health and body. A severely important one especially in today's society is mental health and substance use where they help people with mental illness and drug abuse. Lastly, they help with environmental health where people are researching and studying how our environments both physical and metaphorical have short- and long-term effects on our health and wellness.\nStrengthening Communities Fund.\nIn June 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services created the Strengthening Communities Fund as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The fund was appropriated $50 million to be given as grants to organizations in the United States that were engaged in Capacity Building programs. The grants were given to two different types of capacity builders:\nBiodefense.\nHHS plays a role in protecting the United States against bioterrorism events. In 2018, HHS released a new National Biodefense Strategy required by the passage of the 2016 Biodefense Strategy Act. The Biodefense Strategy required the implementation of a biodefense strategy after a 2015 Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense report found that the 2009 National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats was inadequate in protecting the U.S. The strategy adopted these five central recommendations: creating a single centralized approach to biodefense; implementing an interdisciplinary approach to biodefense that brings together policymakers, scientists, health experts, and academics; drawing up a comprehensive strategy to address human, plant, and animal health; creating a defense against global and domestic biological threats; and creating a proactive policy to combat the misuse and abuse of advanced biotechnology.\nHHS also runs the Biodefense Steering Committee, which works with other federal agencies including the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Environmental Protection Agency. HHS specifically oversees Project BioShield, established in 2003 and operating since 2004, and its development and production of vaccines.\nCriticisms and controversies.\nIn 2016, a published US Senate report revealed that several dozen unaccompanied children from Central America, some as young as 14 years old, were released from custody to traffickers where they were sexually assaulted, starved, or forced to work for little or no pay. The HHS sub agency Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) released approximately 90,000 unaccompanied children during 2013\u20132015 but did not track their whereabouts or properly screen families accepting these children.\nTo prevent similar episodes, the Homeland Security and Health &amp; Human Services Departments signed a memorandum of understanding in 2016 and agreed to establish joint procedures within one year for dealing with unaccompanied migrant children. As of 2018, they have failed to do so. Between October and December 2017, officials from ORR tried to contact 7,635 children and their sponsors. From these calls, officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight had run away, five had been removed from the United States and fifty-two had relocated to live with a nonsponsor. However, officials have lost track of 1,475 children. ORR claims it is not legally liable for the safety and status of the children once released from custody.\nHHS is evidenced to be actively coercing and forcing substances such as antipsychotics on migrating children without consent, and under questionable medical supervision. Medical professionals state that wrongly prescribed antipsychotics are especially dangerous for children, and can cause permanent psychological damage. Medical professionals also state DHS and HHS incarceration and separation policies are likewise causing irreparable mental harm to the children.\nChildren are also dying in HHS custody. The forced drugging, deaths, and disappearances of migrating Mexican and Central American children might be related to DHS falsely labeling them and their families as 'terror threats' before HHS manages their incarcerations. Despite a federal court order, the DHS separation practices started by Obama and mandated by the Trump administration's \"zero-tolerance\" policy have not been halted, and HHS has not stopped forcing drugs on the children it incarcerates.\nIn August 2022, the Office of the Inspector General for Health and Human Services reported that NIH had failed in its oversight of clinical trials, with slightly over half of sample trial results either being tardy for publication or remaining unpublished on ClinicalTrials.gov after several years from the stated completion dates.\nFreedom of Information Act processing performance.\nIn the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the DHHS ranked second to last, earning an F by scoring 57 out of a possible 100 points, largely due to a low score on its particular disclosure rules. It had deteriorated from a D\u2212 in 2013.\nRelated legislation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The chemical reaction at the positive electrode is similar to that of the older nickel\u2013cadmium cell (NiCd), with both using nickel oxide hydroxide, NiO(OH). However, the negative electrodes use a hydrogen-absorbing alloy instead of cadmium. NiMH batteries typically have two to three times the capacity of NiCd batteries of the same size, with significantly higher energy density, although only about half that of lithium-ion batteries. NiMH batteries have almost entirely replaced NiCd.\nThese batteries are typically used as a substitute for similarly shaped non-rechargeable alkaline and other primary batteries. They provide a cell voltage of about 1.2V while fresh alkaline cells provide 1.5V; however devices designed for alkaline batteries operate until cell voltage gradually drops to around 1.0V, while the voltage of a fully-charged NiMH cell drops more slowly, giving good endurance for a 1.0V end point. NiMH batteries are less prone to leaking corrosive electrolyte than primary batteries.\nHistory.\nWork on NiMH batteries began at the Battelle-Geneva Research Center following the technology's invention in 1967. It was based on sintered Ti2Ni+TiNi+x alloys and NiOOH electrodes. Development was sponsored over nearly two decades by Daimler-Benz and by Volkswagen AG within Deutsche Automobilgesellschaft, now a subsidiary of Daimler AG. The batteries' specific energy reached 50\u00a0W\u00b7h/kg (180\u00a0kJ/kg), specific power up to 1000\u00a0W/kg and a life of 500 charge cycles (at 100% depth of discharge). Patent applications were filed in European countries (priority: Switzerland), the United States, and Japan. The patents transferred to Daimler-Benz.\nInterest grew in the 1970s with the commercialisation of the nickel\u2013hydrogen battery for satellite applications. Hydride technology promised an alternative, less bulky way to store the hydrogen. Research carried out by Philips Laboratories and France's CNRS developed new high-energy hybrid alloys incorporating rare-earth metals for the negative electrode. However, these suffered from alloy instability in alkaline electrolyte and consequently insufficient cycle life. In 1987, Willems and Buschow demonstrated a successful battery based on this approach (using a mixture of La0.8Nd0.2Ni2.5Co2.4Si0.1), which kept 84% of its charge capacity after 4000 charge-discharge cycles. More economically viable alloys using mischmetal instead of lanthanum were soon developed. Modern NiMH cells were based on this design. The first consumer-grade NiMH cells became commercially available in 1989.\nIn 1998, Stanford Ovshinsky at Ovonic Battery Co., which had been working on MH-NiOOH batteries since mid-1980, improved the Ti\u2013Ni alloy structure and composition and patented its innovations.\nIn 2008, more than two million hybrid cars worldwide were manufactured with NiMH batteries.\nIn the European Union due to its Battery Directive, nickel\u2013metal hydride batteries replaced Ni\u2013Cd batteries for portable consumer use.\nIn Switzerland in 2009, approximately 60% of portable rechargeable batteries were NiMH. In 2000, almost half of all portable rechargeable batteries sold in Japan were NiMH, compared to 22% in 2010. This percentage has fallen over time due to the increase in manufacture of lithium-ion batteries.\nIn 2015 BASF produced a modified microstructure that helped make NiMH batteries more durable, in turn allowing changes to the cell design that saved considerable weight, allowing the specific energy to reach 140 watt-hours per kilogram.\nElectrochemistry.\nThe negative electrode reaction occurring in a NiMH cell is\n H2O + M + e\u2212 \u21cc OH\u2212 + MH\nOn the positive electrode, nickel oxyhydroxide, NiO(OH), is formed:\n Ni(OH)2 + OH\u2212 \u21cc NiO(OH) + H2O + e\u2212\nThe reactions proceed left to right during charge and the opposite during discharge. The metal M in the negative electrode of a NiMH cell is an intermetallic compound. Many different compounds have been developed for this application, but those in current use fall into two classes. The most common is AB5, where A is a rare-earth mixture of lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, and B is nickel, cobalt, manganese, or aluminium. Some cells use higher-capacity negative electrode materials based on AB2 compounds, where A is titanium or vanadium, and B is zirconium or nickel, modified with chromium, cobalt, iron, or manganese.\nNiMH cells have an alkaline electrolyte, usually potassium hydroxide. The positive electrode is nickel hydroxide, and the negative electrode is hydrogen in the form of an interstitial metal hydride. Hydrophilic polyolefin nonwovens are used for separation.\nCharge.\nWhen fast-charging, it is advisable to charge the NiMH cells with a smart battery charger to avoid overcharging, which can damage cells.\nTrickle charging.\nThe simplest of the safe charging methods is with a fixed low current, with or without a timer. Most manufacturers claim that overcharging is safe at very low currents, below 0.1\u00a0\"C\" (\"C\"/10) (where \"C\" is the current equivalent to the capacity of the battery divided by one hour). The Panasonic NiMH charging manual warns that overcharging for long enough can damage a battery and suggests limiting the total charging time to 10\u201320 hours.\nDuracell suggests that a trickle charge at \"C\"/300 can be used for batteries that must be kept in a fully charged state. Some chargers do this after the charge cycle, to offset natural self-discharge. A similar approach is suggested by Energizer, which indicates that self-catalysis can recombine gas formed at the electrodes for charge rates up to C/10. This leads to cell heating. The company recommends \"C\"/30 or \"C\"/40 for indefinite applications where long life is important. This is the approach taken in emergency lighting applications, where the design remains essentially the same as in older NiCd units, except for an increase in the trickle-charging resistor value.\nPanasonic's handbook recommends that NiMH batteries on standby be charged by a lower duty cycle approach, where a pulse of a higher current is used whenever the battery's voltage drops below 1.3\u00a0V. This can extend battery life and use less energy.\n\u0394\"V\" charging method.\nTo prevent cell damage, fast chargers must terminate their charge cycle before overcharging occurs. One method is to monitor the change of voltage with time. When the battery is fully charged, the voltage across its terminals drops slightly. The charger can detect this and stop charging. This method is often used with nickel\u2013cadmium cells, which display a large voltage drop at full charge. However, the voltage drop is much less pronounced for NiMH and can be non-existent at low charge rates, which can make the approach unreliable.\nAnother option is to monitor the change of voltage with respect to time and stop when this becomes zero, but this risks premature cutoffs. With this method, a much higher charging rate can be used than with a trickle charge, up to 1\u00a0\"C\". At this charge rate, Panasonic recommends to terminate charging when the voltage drops 5\u201310\u00a0mV per cell from the peak voltage. Since this method measures the voltage across the battery, a constant-current (rather than a constant-voltage) charging circuit is used.\n\u0394\"T\" charging method.\nThe temperature-change method is similar in principle to the \u0394\"V\" method. Because the charging voltage is nearly constant, constant-current charging delivers energy at a near-constant rate. When the cell is not fully charged, most of this energy is converted to chemical energy. However, when the cell reaches full charge, most of the charging energy is converted to heat. This increases the rate of change of battery temperature, which can be detected by a sensor such as a thermistor. Both Panasonic and Duracell suggest a maximal rate of temperature increase of 1\u00a0\u00b0C per minute. Using a temperature sensor allows an absolute temperature cutoff, which Duracell suggests at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. With both the \u0394\"T\" and the \u0394\"V\" charging methods, both manufacturers recommend a further period of trickle charging to follow the initial rapid charge.\nSafety.\nA resettable fuse in series with the cell, particularly of the bimetallic strip type, increases safety. This fuse opens if either the current or the temperature gets too high.\nModern NiMH cells contain catalysts to handle gases produced by over-charging:\n &lt;chem&gt;2H2{} + O2 -&gt;[\\overset{}\\text{catalyst}] 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;\nHowever, this only works with overcharging currents of up to 0.1\u00a0\"C\" (that is, nominal capacity divided by ten hours). This reaction causes batteries to heat, ending the charging process.\nA method for very rapid charging called in-cell charge control involves an internal pressure switch in the cell, which disconnects the charging current in the event of overpressure.\nOne inherent risk with NiMH chemistry is that overcharging causes hydrogen gas to form, potentially rupturing the cell. Therefore, cells have a vent to release the gas in the event of serious overcharging.\nNiMH batteries are made of environmentally friendly materials. The batteries contain only mildly toxic substances and are recyclable.\nLoss of capacity.\nVoltage depression (often mistakenly attributed to the memory effect) from repeated partial discharge can occur, but is reversible with a few full discharge/charge cycles.\nDischarge.\nA fully charged cell supplies an average 1.25 V/cell during discharge, declining to about 1.0\u20131.1 V/cell (further discharge may cause permanent damage in the case of multi-cell packs, due to polarity reversal of the weakest cell). Under a light load (0.5 amperes), the starting voltage of a freshly charged AA NiMH cell in good condition is about 1.4 volts.\nOver-discharge.\nComplete discharge of multi-cell packs can cause reverse polarity in one or more cells, which can permanently damage them. This situation can occur in the common arrangement of four AA cells in series, where one cell completely discharges before the others due to small differences in capacity among the cells. When this happens, the good cells start to drive the discharged cell into reverse polarity (i.e. positive anode and negative cathode). Some cameras, GPS receivers and PDAs detect the safe end-of-discharge voltage of the series cells and perform an auto-shutdown, but devices such as flashlights/torches and some toys do not.\nIrreversible damage from polarity reversal is a particular danger, even when a low voltage-threshold cutout is employed, when the cells vary in temperature. This is because capacity significantly declines as the cells are cooled. This results in a lower voltage under load of the colder cells.\nSelf-discharge.\nHistorically, NiMH cells have had a somewhat higher self-discharge rate (equivalent to internal leakage) than NiCd cells. The self-discharge rate varies greatly with temperature, where lower storage temperature leads to slower discharge and longer battery life. The self-discharge is 5\u201320% on the first day and stabilizes around 0.5\u20134% per day at room temperature. But at it is approximately three times as high.\nLow self-discharge.\nThe low\u2013self-discharge nickel\u2013metal hydride battery (LSD NiMH) has a significantly lower rate of self-discharge. The innovation was introduced in 2005 by Sanyo, branded Eneloop. By using improvements to electrode separator, positive electrode, and other components, manufacturers claim the cells retain 70\u201385% of their capacity when stored for one year at , compared to about half for normal NiMH batteries. They are otherwise similar to standard NiMH batteries, and can be charged in standard NiMH chargers. These cells are marketed as \"hybrid\", \"ready-to-use\" or \"pre-charged\" rechargeables. Retention of charge depends in large part on the battery's resistance to leakage (the higher the better), and on its physical size and charge capacity.\nSeparators keep the two electrodes apart to slow electrical discharge while allowing the transport of ionic charge carriers that close the circuit during the passage of current. High-quality separators are critical for battery performance.\nThe self-discharge rate depends upon separator thickness; thicker separators reduce self-discharge, but also reduce capacity as they leave less space for active components, and thin separators lead to higher self-discharge. Some batteries may have overcome this tradeoff by using more precisely manufactured thin separators, and a sulfonated polyolefin separator, an improvement over the hydrophilic polyolefin based on ethylene vinyl alcohol.\nLow-self-discharge cells have somewhat lower capacity than otherwise equivalent NiMH cells because of the larger volume of the separator. The highest-capacity low-self-discharge AA cells have 2500\u00a0mAh capacity, compared to 2700\u00a0mAh for high-capacity AA NiMH cells.\nCommon methods to improve self-discharge include: use of a sulfonated separator (causing removal of N-containing compounds), use of an acrylic acid grafted PP separator (causing reduction in Al- and Mn-debris formation in separator), removal of Co and Mn in A2B7 MH alloy, (causing reduction in debris formation in separator), increase of the amount of electrolyte (causing reduction in the hydrogen diffusion in electrolyte), removal of Cu-containing components (causing reduction in micro-short), PTFE coating on positive electrode (causing suppression of reaction between NiOOH and H2), CMC solution dipping (causing suppression of oxygen evolution), micro-encapsulation of Cu on MH alloy (causing decrease in H2 released from MH alloy), Ni\u2013B alloy coating on MH alloy (causing formation of a protection layer), alkaline treatment of negative electrode (causing reduction of leach-out of Mn and Al), addition of LiOH and NaOH into electrolyte (causing reduction in electrolyte corrosion capabilities), and addition of Al2(SO4)3 into electrolyte (causing reduction in MH alloy corrosion). Most of these improvements have no or negligible effect on cost; some increase cost modestly.\nCompared to other battery types.\nAlkaline and other primary batteries.\nNiMH cells are often used in digital cameras and other high-drain devices, where they outperform primary batteries, usually using alkaline chemistry, but also inferior zinc-carbon and chloride.\nNiMH cells are better for high-current-drain applications than alkaline batteries due to their lower internal resistance. Typical alkaline AA-size batteries, which offer approximately 2.6\u00a0Ah capacity at low current demand (25\u00a0mA), provide only 1.3\u00a0Ah capacity with a 500\u00a0mA load. Digital cameras with LCDs and flashlights can draw over 1\u00a0A, quickly depleting them. NiMH cells can deliver these current levels without similar loss of capacity.\nAlkaline (and other technologies such as zinc-carbon or chloride) primary (disposable) batteries supply a voltage of 1.5V when fresh but gradually decreasing in use, and devices using them are usually designed to operate up to an end-point voltage of about 1.0V. NiMH batteries supply 1.2V initially, but the voltage does not decrease as rapidly until the battery is nearly depleted due to their low internal resistance, giving reasonable endurance for a 1.0V end point, so that NiMH batteries can replace primary batteries in almost all applications despite the lower initial voltage. Battery-level indicators designed for alkaline batteries are inaccurate with the lower initial voltage but slower decrease of NiMH. \nLithium-ion.\nLithium-ion batteries can deliver extremely high power and have a higher specific energy than nickel\u2013metal hydride batteries, but they were originally significantly more expensive. The cost of lithium batteries fell drastically during the 2010s and many small consumer devices now have non-consumer-replaceable lithium batteries as a result. \nLithium batteries produce a higher voltage (3.2\u20133.7\u00a0V nominal), and are thus not a drop-in replacement for AA (alkaline or NiMh) batteries without circuitry to reduce voltage. Although a single lithium cell will typically provide ideal power to replace 3 NiMH cells, the form factor means that the device still needs modification.\nLead.\nNiMH batteries can easily be made smaller and lighter than lead-acid batteries and have completely replaced them in small devices. However, lead-acid batteries can deliver huge current at low cost, making lead-acid batteries more suitable for starter motors in combustion vehicles.\nAs of 2005[ [update]], nickel\u2013metal hydride batteries constituted three percent of the battery market.\nApplications.\nConsumer electronics.\nNiMH batteries have replaced NiCd for many roles, notably small rechargeable batteries. NiMH batteries are commonly available in AA (penlight-size) batteries. These have nominal charge capacities (\"C\") of 1.1\u20132.8\u00a0Ah at 1.2\u00a0V, measured at the rate that discharges the cell in 5\u00a0hours. Useful discharge capacity is a decreasing function of the discharge rate, but up to a rate of around 1\u00d7\"C\" (full discharge in 1\u00a0hour), it does not differ significantly from the nominal capacity. Fully charged NiMH batteries nominally operate at 1.2\u00a0V per cell, somewhat lower than fresh 1.5\u00a0V disposable cells, but most devices are designed to continue operating until the voltage drops to about 1.0V, so NiMH batteries can replace alkaline batteries without loss of performance.\nElectric vehicles.\nNiMH batteries were frequently used in prior-generation electric and hybrid-electric vehicles; as of 2020 they have been superseded almost entirely by lithium-ion batteries in all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, but they remain in use in some hybrid vehicles (2020 Toyota Highlander, for example). Prior all-electric plug-in vehicles included the General Motors EV1, first-generation Toyota RAV4 EV, Honda EV Plus, Ford Ranger EV and Vectrix scooter. Every first generation hybrid vehicle used NIMH batteries, most notably the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, as well as later models including the Ford Escape Hybrid, Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid and Honda Civic Hybrid also use them.\nPatent issues.\nStanford R. Ovshinsky invented and patented a popular improvement of the NiMH battery and founded Ovonic Battery Company in 1982. General Motors purchased Ovonics' patent in 1994. By the late 1990s, NiMH batteries were being used successfully in many fully electric vehicles, such as the General Motors EV1 and Dodge Caravan EPIC minivan.\nThis generation of electric cars, although successful, was abruptly pulled off the market.\nIn October 2000, the patent was sold to Texaco, and a week later Texaco was acquired by Chevron. Chevron's Cobasys subsidiary provides these batteries only to large OEM orders. General Motors shut down production of the EV1, citing lack of battery availability as a chief obstacle. Cobasys control of NiMH batteries created a patent encumbrance for large automotive NiMH batteries.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The German-language equivalent is \"Markgraf\" (margrave) and the Italian-language equivalent \"Marchese\". A woman with the rank of a marquess or the wife (or widow) of a marquess is a marchioness () or marquise (). These titles are also used to translate equivalent Asian styles, as in Imperial China and Imperial Japan.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"marquess\" entered the English language from the Old French (\"ruler of a border area\") in the late 13th or early 14th century. The French word was derived from (\"frontier\"), itself descended from the Middle Latin (\"frontier\"), from which the modern English word \"march\" also descends. The distinction between governors of frontier territories and interior territories was made as early as the founding of the Roman Empire when some provinces were set aside for administration by the senate and more unpacified or vulnerable provinces were administered by the emperor. The titles \"duke\" and \"count\" were similarly distinguished as ranks in the Byzantine Empire, with (literally, \"leader\") being used for a provincial military governor and the rank of (literally \"companion\", that is, of the Emperor) given to the leader of an active army along the frontier.\nBelgium.\nThe title of marquess in Belgium predates the French Revolution and still exists today. See and .\nSpain.\nIn Spain, the rank of Marquess/Marchioness (/) still exists. One hundred and forty-two of them are Spanish grandees. Normally a is addressed as \"The Most Illustrious Lord\" (), or if he/she is a grandee as \"The Most Excellent Lord\" (). Examples include the Marquess of Carpio, Grandee of Spain.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn Great Britain and historically in Ireland, a marquess ranks below a duke and above an earl. A woman with the rank of a marquess, or the wife of a marquess, is a marchioness . The dignity, rank, or position of the title is a marquisate or marquessate.\nThe honorific prefix \"The Most Honourable\" precedes the name of a marquess or marchioness of the United Kingdom.\nIn Great Britain, and historically in Ireland, the spelling of this title is marquess. In Scotland, the French spelling marquis is sometimes used. \nThe theoretical distinction between a marquess and other titles has, since the Middle Ages, faded into obscurity. In times past, the distinction between a count and a marquess was that the land of a marquess, called a march, was on the border of the country, while a count's land, called a county, often was not. As a result of this, a marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbours and was thus more important and ranked higher than a count. The title is ranked below that of a duke, which was often largely restricted to the royal family.\nThe rank of marquess was a relatively late introduction to the British peerage: no marcher lords had the rank of marquess, though some were earls. On the evening of the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne explained to her why (from her journals):\nI spoke to [Lord Melbourne] about the numbers of Peers present at the Coronation, &amp; he said it was quite unprecedented. I observed that there were very few Viscounts, to which he replied \"There are very few Viscounts,\" that they were an old sort of title &amp; not really English; that they came from Vice-Comites; that Dukes &amp; Barons were the only real English titles; \u2013 that Marquises were likewise not English, &amp; that people were mere made Marquises, when it was not wished that they should be made Dukes.\nAnalogous non-Western titles.\nLike other major Western noble titles, marquess (or marquis) is sometimes used to translate certain titles from non-Western languages with their own traditions, even though they are, as a rule, historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered \"equivalent\" in relative rank.\nThis is the case with: \nIn fiction.\nMarquesses and marchionesses have occasionally appeared in works of fiction.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"peerage\" can be used both collectively to refer to this entire body of titled nobility (or a subdivision thereof), and individually to refer to a specific title (modern English language-style using an initial capital in the latter case but not the former). British peerage title holders are termed peers of the Realm. \"Lord\" is used as a generic term to denote members of the peerage; however, individuals who use the appellation \"Lord\" or \"Lady\" are not always necessarily peers (for example some judicial, ecclesiastic and others are often accorded the appellation \"Lord\" or \"Lady\" as a form of courtesy title as a product of their office). \nThe British monarch is considered the fount of honour and is notionally the only person who can grant peerages, though there are many conventions about how this power is used, especially at the request of the British government.\nThe peerage's fundamental roles are ones of lawmaking and governance, with peers being eligible (although formerly \"entitled\") to a seat in the House of Lords and having eligibility to serve in a ministerial role in the government if invited to do so by the monarch, or more conventionally in the modern era, by the prime minister.\nUntil the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009, the peerage also formed a constituent part of the British judicial system, via the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.\nThe peerage also has a ceremonial aspect, and serves a role as a system of honour or award, with the granting of a peerage title forming the highest rung of the modern British honours system.\nWithin the United Kingdom, due to the hereditary nature of most peerage titles historically, five peerage divisions currently co-exist, namely:\nBackground.\nCreation.\nAll peerages are created by the British monarch. The monarch, as the fount of honour, cannot hold a British peerage themselves. However, the monarch, in addition to their title of 'King' or 'Queen', whether male or female, is informally accorded the style of 'Duke of Lancaster' (a title linked to the historic Duchy of Lancaster, which became the private estate of the British sovereign when the holder, Henry IV of England, ascended the throne in 1399). Likewise in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man (which are not parts of the United Kingdom, but possessions of the British Crown) the informal titles Duke of Normandy (a title associated with William the Conqueror prior to his ascension to the throne in 1066) and Lord of Mann (the title acquired with the Crown purchase of the Isle of Man under George III in 1765) are used respectively.\nAll British subjects who were neither Royal nor Peers of the Realm were previously termed \"commoners\", regardless of ancestry, wealth or other social factors. Thus, all members of a peer's family, with the exception of their wife or unremarried widow, are (technically) commoners too; the British system therefore differs fundamentally from continental European versions, where entire families, rather than individuals, were ennobled. This idea that status as a 'commoner' is based on title rather than bloodline correspondingly means for example that Princess Anne, who enjoys royal status as the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, opted for her children (Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall) to be technically commoners (though functionally part of the untitled nobility) despite their being grandchildren of the then sovereign, when Anne and her husband, Mark Philips, declined the offer of peerage titles. Where children of peers use titles, these are accorded by courtesy, and they do not hold a peerage themselves. For example, the Duke of Norfolk holds other peerage titles including the Earl of Arundel and Baron Maltravers. A hypothetical eldest son of the Duke of Norfolk can therefore be styled by courtesy as \"Earl of Arundel\" (\"the\" does not precede it, as this would indicate a substantive title). In this example, only the Duke of Norfolk is actually a peer; his son is not.\nDivision and rank.\nMost peerages since 1801, and all subsequent peerages from 1898, are created within the division of the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Hereditary peerages are still extant in the other divisions: the Peerage of England, the Peerage of Scotland, the Peerage of Great Britain and the Peerage of Ireland.\nSince 2009 almost all life peerages are created, by convention, at the rank of baron, the sole exception being the royal life peerage of the Dukedom of Edinburgh in 2023. The reason for this is that the Life Peerages Act 1958 restricts the issuing of writs of summons to life peers (entitling the peer to sit in the House of Lords) to those created at the rank of baron only. While peerages remain part of the honours system, the main reason for creating new peers is for them to hold a seat in the House of Lords. A government could theoretically support the creation of a life peerage at a more senior rank as an honour for someone who displayed particularly meritorious service, who did not want to enter parliament, but so far no government has done so.\nEntitlement and Heritability.\nAll honours, including peerages, are granted at the discretion of the monarch as the fount of honour (though functionally and mostly on the advice of the government); there is, therefore, no entitlement to be granted a peerage. However, historic precedent means some individuals are granted peerages by convention. For example, since the Wars of the Three Kingdoms it has been convention for a retiring speaker of the House of Commons to be granted a hereditary viscountcy; however, the last to receive the honour was in 1983, and the convention is now accepted to have changed to a life peerage at the rank of baron instead. British prime ministers are also offered a peerage by convention when leaving office. This was previously a hereditary earldom. However, the last prime minister to receive this honour was Harold Macmillan in 1984. When she resigned in 1990 Margaret Thatcher, as the first female prime minister, was not offered a hereditary earldom or any other peerage, but instead a baronetcy (a hereditary knighthood and not a peerage) was awarded to her husband Denis Thatcher (this was the last non-royal hereditary honour of any variety created in the UK to date). Thatcher was later given a life peerage in her own right in 1992. The most recent prime minister to receive a peerage was Theresa May, who was given a life peerage in 2024.\nMost peerage nominations are 'political peers' or 'working peers', nominated by the prime minister of the governing party, or by other party leaders to \u2018top up\u2019 each of the party groups\u2019 strengths and on the expectation that they will attend parliament regularly and take on frontbench work. However, since 2001 any member of the public can make a nomination to the House of Lords Appointment Commission, to nominate someone to sit with the \"cross bench\" peers, as a non-party political peerage - sometimes called 'people's peers'. As of 2023, since 2001 67 'people's peers' have been appointed.\nHistorically monarchs sold peerage titles under limited circumstances. This was often done to raise funds. For example, in the early Stuart period, King James I sold peerages, adding sixty-two peers to a body that had included just fifty-nine members at the commencement of his reign. Some governments through history also sold peerages to fund government activities, or more controversially, party activities. The selling of peerages by a government was made illegal in 1925 with the \"Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925\". The act was the result of the administration of David Lloyd George selling a high number of controversial peerages. The Blair administration was later accused of trying to skirt this law in 2006 in the so called \"Cash-for-Honours scandal\", as was an aide of Prince Charles in the 2021 . Unlike the feudal titles they replaced, peerages are not a form of property and cannot be transferred, bought, or sold by the title holder.\nThe exact terms of the peerage are set out in the letters patent. All peerages are strictly personal and for life. However, historic peerages are often heritable, primarily by agnatic primogeniture with some exceptions of male-preference cognatic primogeniture. For most of their history, hereditary peerages were the norm. Today, the only new hereditary peerages granted are, by convention, to members of the royal family. The last non-royal awardees of hereditary titles were in the Thatcher era. Since then, ruling parties have instead exclusively created life peers and refrained from recommending any others to be elevated to a hereditary peerage, although this is simply present convention and there is nothing preventing future governments from doing so.\nConfirmation process.\nThe government of the United Kingdom makes recommendations to the sovereign concerning who should be elevated to the peerage, after external vetting by the House of Lords Appointments Commission for those peers who will be sitting in the House of Lords (which is now by convention almost all new creations, with the exception of royal peerages).\nIt is unclear in the present day whether the monarch would move to directly block a recommendation or a conventional ascension to the peerage, though they are constitutionally entitled to do so. It was reported in 2023 that members of the British security services had contacted Queen Elizabeth II to request she intervene and block the peerage of Evgeny Lebedev who had been nominated by then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Some media outlets have reported personal interventions with other honours: For example, former prime ministers are also by convention knighted, being raised to the Order of the Garter or the Order of the Thistle. However it was alleged in 2020 that due to a personal reluctance by Queen Elizabeth II to award the Garter to Tony Blair other living prime ministers would not be raised either. Tony Blair was later knighted by Queen Elizabeth II as a Knight Companion of the Garter in 2022.\nLike all Crown honours, peerages are affirmed by letters patent affixed with the Great Seal of the Realm. In addition to letters patent, peers who are to sit in Parliament are issued a Writ of summons. The Writ of Summons calls the member to the House. A new writ is issued for every member at the beginning of each Parliament (after a general election). A writ accompanies the letters patent for new members. The honour will also be recorded in \"The London Gazette\".\nHonours, including peerages, are usually awarded at new year and on the monarch's official birthday. They can also be awarded as part of a Prime Minister's resignation, or upon the dissolution of a Parliament. Monarchs may also make new peers upon their coronation, jubilee or upon the demise of the previous monarch. There are also \"ad hoc\" announcements and \"Special Honours\", issued at any time throughout the year at the pleasure of the monarch. This might be done to allow someone to serve in cabinet, or as an immediate reward for exemplary service.\nRecipients of new peerages are typically announced via the Crown Honours Lists. Formerly, new peers were presented with an investiture ceremony, but this has not taken place since 1621 (investiture ceremonies for other honours are mostly managed by the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood). New peers serving in parliament do receive an introduction ceremony at the House of Lords.\nAll peerages are recorded on the Roll of the Peerage maintained by the Crown Office within the United Kingdom's Ministry of Justice, and published by the College of Arms. The Secretary of State for Justice in their role as Lord Chancellor is the keeper of the Peerage Roll, and their duties in that regard are daily discharged by a Registrar of the Peerage and a Deputy Registrar, who work within the Crown Office under the supervision of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. Succession claims to existing hereditary peerages are regulated by the House of Lords Committee for Privileges and Conduct and administered by the Crown Office.\nDeclining, disclaiming, and revocation.\nPeerages can be declined by prospective recipients, and often have been throughout history for various different reasons. For instance, Winston Churchill declined the Dukedom of London so he could continue to sit in the House of Commons.\nSince the \"House of Lords Reform Act 2014\", peers may resign from the House of Lords, whilst keeping their title and style.\nThough there is no mechanism for life peers to fully disclaim their peerage, hereditary peers may fully disclaim their peerage for their lifetime under the \"Peerage Act 1963\". The peerage remains extant until the death of the peer who had made the disclaimer, when it descends to his or her heir in the usual manner.\nThe Crown does not have the power to cancel or revoke a peerage once it has been created. A peerage can only be removed from an individual by an act of parliament, an example of such being the \"Titles Deprivation Act 1917\".\nConstitutional functions.\nLegislative function.\nAny peer who receives a writ of summons (which is in practice all life peers except retired peers, and some hereditary peers) may sit in the House of Lords as the Lords Temporal. They sit alongside the Lords Spiritual, who do not hold peerages, but are bishops of the Church of England. Labour, elected to power in 1997, sought to remove all of the seats in the House of Lords reserved for hereditary peers via the \"House of Lords Act 1999\", but then Prime Minister Tony Blair relented by allowing 92 members to remain. 90 of these hereditary peers are elected to the House of Lords from within their own populace, while the other two sit \"ex officio\" holding the hereditary constitutional offices of Earl Marshal and the Lord Great Chamberlain.\nSince the \"Parliament Act 1911\" and \"Parliament Act 1949\" the House of Lords' purpose is now that of a revising legislative chamber, scrutinising and potentially changing proposed Parliamentary Bills before their enactment. Its membership for the most part comprises life peers, created under the \"Life Peerages Act 1958\", which includes those who can add value in specific areas of expertise in parliamentary debates, as well as former MPs and other political appointees from respective political parties. Those who do not sit with a political party, may sit in the house as a so called Crossbencher. Prior to July 2006 the Lord Chancellor \u2013 one of the Great Officers of State and government minister \u2013 served as the presiding officer of the peers in the House of Lords. Were a person not a peer to be appointed to the office of Lord Chancellor, they would traditionally be raised to the peerage upon appointment, though a scarcely used provision was made in 1539 for appointees who are great officers of state but not peers to sit in between the benches in the House, meaning commoners could execute the role without the need for elevation to the peerage. Since 2006 however, in an effort to separate powers, the role of presiding officer has been fulfilled by the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords elected by the peers from amongst their own number. The Lord Chancellor retained their role as a government minister however, and in June 2007 Jack Straw was the first commoner to be appointed as Lord Chancellor since 1587.\nAs the upper chamber, in contrast to the House of Commons, where proceedings are controlled by the speaker, proceedings in the Lords are controlled by peers themselves, under the rules set out in the Standing Orders. The Leader of the House of Lords has the responsibility of reminding the House of these rules and facilitating the Lords' self-regulation, though any member may draw attention to breaches of order or failure to observe customs. The Leader is often called upon to advise on procedures and points of order. However, neither the Lord Speaker nor the Leader of the House has the power to rule on points of order or to intervene during an inappropriate speech.\nParties within the House of Lords have whips, however Cross Bench peers elect from among themselves a Cross-bench Convenor for administrative purposes, and to keep them up to date with the business of the House.\nExecutive function.\nPeers in the House of Lords can serve in the British government, when invited to do so, as ministers including within the Great Offices of State (for example David Cameron who served as Foreign Secretary in the Premiership of Rishi Sunak). The only consistent role for a peer in the cabinet is that of Leader of the House of Lords, who must be a member of the House of Lords by nature of the appointment.\nHistorically the Lord Chancellor was by convention a peer, and a member of the cabinet (in addition to serving a judicial and legislative role). The ministerial department of the lord chancellor was known as the Lord Chancellor's Office between 1885 and 1971, and the Lord Chancellor's Department between 1971 and 2003. In 2003 the department was renamed the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and the lord chancellor was appointed Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. In 2007 the department became the Ministry of Justice and in June 2007 Jack Straw was the first commoner to be appointed as Lord Chancellor since 1587.\nPeers can even serve as prime minister, though this is no longer convention, and the last to do so was Alec Douglas-Home in 1963, who disclaimed his peerage within a few days of being appointed as prime minister to fight a by-election to sit in the Commons.\nPeers in the House of Lords are often appointed by the sovereign, on the advice of the government, to serve as a Privy Counsellor. The Privy Council is a formal body of advisers to the monarch, on matters such as the issuing of royal charters. Peers can serve as Lords Commissioners when appointed (privy councillors appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom to exercise, on his or her behalf, certain functions relating to Parliament which would otherwise require the monarch's attendance at the Palace of Westminster).\nIn theory all peers, life and hereditary, are also prospective members of the \"Magnum Concilium\" regardless of whether they sit in the House of Lords. This is a council summoned for nobles to discuss the affairs of the country with the monarch; however, it has not been convened since 1640, though nothing prevents it from being assembled in the future.\nPeers can also be appointed as Lords-in-waiting where they may be called upon periodically to represent the sovereign; for example, one of their number is regularly called upon to greet visiting heads of state on arrival at the start of a state visit.\nPrior to the \"Regency Act of 1937\", peers serving as Lord Chancellor, or in other senior political roles, could also be delegated royal functions to serve as Counsellors of State; however, this is now reserved to the monarch's spouse and the members of the Royal Family in the immediate line of succession.\nJudicial function.\nUntil 2009 the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords served as the highest appellate court within the United Kingdom's legal system. The \"Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876\" allowed for the appointment of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary \u2013 judges meeting specific criteria made peers for life \u2013 who formed the main body of the committee. On 1 October 2009, the \"Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876\" was repealed, owing to the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The House of Lords thus lost its judicial functions. At the time of creation, the 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (the Law Lords) became the first wave of justices to the Supreme Court but were simultaneously disqualified from sitting or voting in the House of Lords until they retired from the court. Judges appointed to the new Supreme Court are not automatically made peers, but those who have not previously been independently granted a peerage, are entitled to use a judicial courtesy title of \"Lord\" or \"Lady\", with a territorial designation, for their remainder of their lives. In addition to serving as Presiding Officer of the Peers in the Lords, the Lord Chancellor also served as the head of the English and Welsh judiciary and a \"de facto\" 'Justice Minister'. The judicial function of the Lord Chancellor was removed with the \"Constitutional Reform Act 2005\", and the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales became the new head of the judiciary, while the former Lord Chancellor's ministry/Department for Constitutional Affairs was merged into the newly created Ministry of Justice in May 2007. Since then all Lord Chancellors have also held the office of Minister of Justice (in much the same way all First Lords of the Treasury hold the office of Prime Minister). In 2012 Chris Grayling would be the first non-lawyer to serve as Lord Chancellor for at least 440 years. As the Head of the judiciary in England and Wales, the Lord Chancellor also served as a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; however, the last lord chancellor to preside as a judge of this court was Lord Irvine of Lairg (in office 1997\u20132003). This function was also removed from the Lord Chancellor following the \"Constitutional Reform Act 2005\".\nThe Earl Marshal is the only peer in England and Wales to retain a judicial function by right of office, as the sole judge of the High Court of Chivalry a civil law court with jurisdiction over matters of heraldry in England and Wales, though if not a professional lawyer, he normally appoints a professional lawyer as his lieutenant or surrogate. In Scotland the Duke of Hamilton is a hereditary assessor at the Court of the Lord Lyon, a standing court of law which regulates heraldry in Scotland.\nCeremonial function.\nThe Lord Great Chamberlain is entrusted by the Sovereign with custody of the Palace of Westminster, the seat of the British Parliament, and serves as his or her representative therein. They have jurisdiction within all areas of the palace excluding the House of Lords and House of Commons directly. The position is a hereditary one, held since 1780 in gross between three families descending from the 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Under an agreement made in 1912, the right to exercise the office for a given reign rotates among the three families (of the then three joint office holders) in proportion to the fraction of the office held. At any one time, no single person actually exercises the office of Lord Great Chamberlain. The various individuals who hold fractions of the office are properly each \"Joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain\". Their modern role is to serve as a \"de facto\" director of ceremonies for the Palace of Westminster. Though the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, the Act provided that a hereditary peer exercising the office of Lord Great Chamberlain be exempt from such a rule, in order to perform ceremonial functions. They help to organise the State Opening of Parliament and direct Black Rod to summon members of the House of Commons to attend the House of Lords for the speech from the throne.\nThe Lord Great Chamberlain and the Earl Marshal each have a role in the Coronation of the British monarch. Other invited peers also have a role in the coronation. Peers wear coronation robes and coronets during a specific part of the ceremony. However in 2023 peers were asked not to wear their coronets for the coronation of Charles III.\nPeers who are also Privy Councillors form part of the Accession Council upon the death of a monarch to make formal proclamation of the accession of the successor to the throne.\nWithin the Royal Households of the United Kingdom certain roles, such as Lord Steward and Lord Chamberlain, are by convention held by peers (since the 18th century), or in the case of Women of the Bedchamber (sometimes called ladies-in-waiting) the daughters of peers. Certain roles are informally attached hereditarily to certain peerages: for example, the Lord High Constable of Scotland is hereditarily held by the Earl of Erroll.\nWithin the honours system.\nThe peerage forms part of the British honours system, as the highest tier. This role dates back to the days when being ennobled by the monarch meant secure addition for someone and their heirs into the British aristocracy, and alongside it, political power and a theoretically raised status within the hierarchy of the British class system.\nThese days as most peerages are for life and not hereditary, addition for one's heirs into the 'titled' British nobility is no longer guaranteed with the granting of a peerage. Instead the granting of a peerage forms part of the honour system because it brings with it an honorific, title and style for life as a reward in overt recognition of the recipient's contributions to society, or some segment thereof.\nThis is in contrast to those who inherit hereditary peerages, which are not inherited in recognition of the merits of the heir to the title, but according to the rules laid out in the original letters patent. The 'honour' is in recognition of the actions of the initial grantee, remembered through their heirs. The UK now has a presumption against the creation of new hereditary peerages, on the understanding that honours should be reserved for the meritorious service of individuals. This has in turn led to calls from some segments of British government and society to change the inheritance rules for existing hereditary peerages, and in some instances for the abolition/revocation of existing hereditary peerages altogether.\nAlthough life peerages do not guarantee the entry of one's heirs into the 'titled' British nobility, the legitimate children of life peers appointed under the \"Life Peerages Act 1958\" are entitled to style themselves with the prefix \"The Honourable\". Peers are also entitled to apply for a coat of arms, from the heraldic authorities of the United Kingdom. A coat of arms can be inherited, with armigers forming part of the 'untitled' British nobility according to some sources.\nAs noted above, despite forming part of the honours system, nominations for peerages do not come from an Honours Committee but from the sovereign directly (though functionally on the advice of their government).\nGiven the political powers that come with a peerage title, some commentators have suggested the peerage should be separated from the Honours system. In 2016 Baron Lloyd-Webber for example wrote \"I was put in as an honour, not as a working peer. Not as lobby fodder. I\u2019m fed-up with the fact that I keep being asked now to go in and vote for things about which I don\u2019t have knowledge.\" Since the \"House of Lords Reform Act 2014\", peers may resign from the House of Lords, and thereby surrender their legislative power, whilst keeping their title and style.\nPrivileges.\nThe privilege of peerage is the body of privileges that belongs to peers, their wives and their unremarried widows. The privilege is distinct from parliamentary privilege, and applies to all peers, not just members of the House of Lords. It still exists, although \"occasions of its exercise have now diminished into obscurity.\"\nAlthough the extent of the privilege has been ill-defined, three features survived to the 20th century: the right to be tried by fellow peers in the Lord High Steward's Court and in the House of Lords (abolished in 1948); the personal right of access to the sovereign at any time, but this privilege has long been obsolete; and the right to be exempt from civil arrest (a privilege that has been used only twice since 1945). All privileges of a peerage are lost if a peer disclaims his or her peerage under the \"Peerage Act 1963\".\nJudicial Privilege.\nUnder the privilege of peerage, peers themselves had the right to be tried for impeachment, felonies or for high treason by other peers in the House of Lords (instead of commoners on juries). In such cases a Lord High Steward would be appointed to preside over the trial \u2013 functionally this was usually done by temporarily elevating the Lord Chancellor to this role. Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville was the last person to be tried in the House of Lords on impeachment in 1806. In December 1935 Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham was elevated from Lord Chancellor to Lord High Steward to preside over the last ever trial of a peer \u2018by his peers\u2019, with the trial of the 26th Baron de Clifford in the House of Lords for manslaughter. The right to be tried by other peers in the House of Lords was abolished at the request of the Lords in 1948 by Criminal Justice Act 1948.\nSalary, renumeration and land.\nThere is no automatic right to a salary for being a peer; this includes peers who serve in parliament, who (unlike MPs in the House of Commons) do not receive a salary for their role. However, peers who serve in the House of Lords are entitled to claim \u00a3342 allowance for each day they attend to help cover expenses. In an effort to ensure peers from outside the capital were not disadvantaged, peers whose registered home address is outside Greater London can also claim travel expenses and up to \u00a3100 towards the cost of a hotel or similar accommodation. Peers who serve in government as ministers are not entitled to claim these allowances, however, and thus their roles are often jointly given with sinecure roles, or they are appointed to salaried positions in the Royal Household. For example, the position of Leader of the House of Lords is usually appointed with the accompanying sinecure role of Lord Privy Seal, as the latter carries a salary. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords is appointed jointly to the role of Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, and the Government deputy chief whip is appointed jointly as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. This allows them to take a salary from the Royal Household as heads of the Sovereign's Bodyguard. The salaries of the Leader of the Opposition and Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords are paid out of public funds alongside the so called Cranborne Money, the annual payment to opposition parties in the House of Lords to help them with their costs.\nThough a small minority of peerages have associated hereditary royal offices \u2014 for example the office of Earl Marshal has been consistently and hereditarily held by the dukes of Norfolk since 1672 \u2014 peerages do not automatically grant the holders royal offices or privileges. The feudal titles (such as Lordship of the Manor titles) that peerages largely replaced often have associated royal offices because they were held via Grand serjeanty, e.g. the Lord of the Manor of Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire holds the office of King's Champion.\nPeerages do not automatically grant specific land rights or privileges (unlike the feudal titles they largely replaced) and the territorial designation of a peerage title does not indicate any land ownership nor entitle the holder to any benefit from the territory or land named. For example, the Marquess of Salisbury owns the mineral rights below Welwyn Garden City, not because of the peerage, but because he also owns the separate historic feudal title \"Lord of the Manor of Hatfield\" which granted these rights. The very limited historical exceptions to this are the County palatinate of Chester belonging to the Earl of Chester, which held some limited privileges until 1830, and the Duchy of Cornwall conferred on the Duke of Cornwall. Both of these titles are royal peerages traditionally held by the heir to the throne. The Duchy of Lancaster also exists, but is not associated with a peerage title, but rather the courtesy title of Duke of Lancaster held by the monarch. There were also palatine districts in Ireland, of which the most notable were those of the Earls of Desmond and the Earls of Ormond in County Tipperary in the Peerage of Ireland. The latter continued in existence until it was abolished by the County Palatine of Tipperary Act 1715. In Scotland, the earldom of Strathearn was identified as a county palatine in the 14th century, although the title of Earl of Strathearn has usually been merged with the Crown in subsequent centuries and there is little indication that the status of Strathearn differed in practice from other Scottish earldoms.\nThough peerages, particularly hereditary peerages, are associated with country houses set within large estates, there is no explicit formal link between the two, and many hereditary peers are now separated from the country estates their ancestors owned, while many life peers have never owned such estates. Through history, some peers inherited manor houses from the feudal era, while others built new prodigy houses, or later purchased country estates with wealth made in the empire or industry. Some country houses were gifted to peers \"by the nation\", such as Blenheim Palace for the 1st Duke of Marlborough and Trafalgar Park for the 1st Earl Nelson. Historically, some hereditary peers used an entail in an effort to prevent their estate from being separated from the peerage titles by their heirs and reinforcing the practice of primogeniture. The entail practice was essentially abolished by the early half of the 20th century, and many peers and members of the landed gentry had to sell their estates due to political and economic changes.\nAccess.\nPeers retain a theoretical right to an audience with the monarch at any time, though this privilege has long been obsolete. Peers who have served in the House of Lords (including those retired) have dining rights in the House of Lords dining halls, which also permit them to bring up to six guests. Peers may also use the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft at the Palace of Westminster for weddings and christenings for themselves and their families at the discretion of Black Rod.\nOfficial &amp; Heraldic Privileges.\nCertain specific personal privileges are afforded to many peers and peeresses. For example, the Duke of Atholl in Scotland is permitted the only legal private army in Europe, the Atholl Highlanders; a privilege granted by Queen Victoria. Also in Scotland, currently four peers are permitted to appoint private officers of arms recognised by the court of the Lord Lyon (though this is principally in their capacity as Clan Chiefs, an office nominally separate from their peerage).\nThere are a number of heraldic privileges which are either exclusive, or almost exclusive, to peers such as the granting of supporters and certain helmets.\nSocial Privileges.\nThere are formal and social clubs organised exclusively for peers, such as the House of Lords Yacht Club. Until 2015 peers in the House of Lords could join the parliamentary rifle club which was located in a rifle range in the basement of the House of Lords.\nThough not a formally recognised privilege, peers have often historically made up a significant percentage of Lord Lieutenancy appointments. These are the Monarch's representatives in a county. Though there has been greater diversity in recent years, a number of these appointments are still held by peers. Again, while not a formal privilege, peers are also frequently included on guest lists for Royal Garden Parties, Royal Weddings, and Royal Funerals. Peers also make up a significant number of appointments to the Orders of the Garter and Thistle as well as senior tiers of the Royal Victorian Order, all of which are appointed solely at the Sovereign's discretion. Peers often make up other high society social appointments; for example His Majesty's Representative at Ascot is a post usually held by a peer.\nThe main formal social distinction of a peerage nowadays, apart from access to the House of Lords for life peers and some hereditary peers, is the title and style thereby accorded.\nHistory of the Peerage.\nBaronage evolution.\nThe modern-day parliamentary peerage is a successor of the medieval baronage system which emerged in the English feudal era. Feudalism was introduced to England after 1066 by William the Conqueror and taken to Scotland by David I in 1124 when, after having lived in England as Earl of Huntingdon, he succeeded to the Scottish throne.\nA Barony was a form of feudal landholding, where individuals were appointed by the king, as his tenants-in-chief \u2013 that is to say people who held land by feudal tenure directly from the king as their sole overlord and were granted by him a legal jurisdiction (court baron) over said territory. The nation had been divided into many \"manors\", the owners of the manors came to be known as barons; those who held many manors were known as \"greater barons\", while those with fewer manors were the \"lesser barons\". Certain other office-holders such as senior clerics and Freemen of the Cinque Ports were also deemed \"Barons\". The baronage was the collectively inclusive term denoting all members of the feudal nobility. As the baronage were 'overlords' the term 'Lord' came to be used as an appellation.\nUnder the old system of feudalism, some Lords had the authority to effectively create titles of their own (through powers like Subinfeudation), such as the Barony of Halton which was created by the Earl of Chester, or the Irish hereditary Knight of Kerry which was created by the Earl of Desmond. Through acts like the \"Quia Emptores\" of 1290 these powers were stripped back, and the authority to create titles was entrenched as exclusive to the monarch.\nEarly Parliament.\nThe modern peerage system is a vestige of the custom of English kings in the 12th and 13th centuries to grant a right to Barons to attend parliament; in the late 14th century, this right (or \"title\") began to be granted by decree, and titles also became inherited with the rest of a manorial estate under the system of primogeniture.\nThe requirement to attend Parliament was both a liability and a privilege for those who held land as a tenant-in-chief from the King \"per baroniam\": that is to say, under the feudal contract wherein a King's Baron was responsible for raising knights and troops for the royal military service.\nWhen kings summoned their barons to Royal Councils, the greater barons were summoned individually by the sovereign, lesser barons through sheriffs, a local judicial office from the Anglo-Saxon era meaning 'shire-reeve' formerly selected from the thane class.\nIn England in 1254, the lesser barons ceased to be summoned, and this right, entitlement or \"title\" to attend parliament began to be granted by decree in the form of a Writ of summons from 1265. This body of greater barons evolved into the House of Lords. Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that \"No free man shall be seized, imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or ruined in any way, nor in any way proceeded against, except by the lawful judgement of his peers\", and thus this body of greater Barons were deemed to be \"peers\" of one another, and it became the norm to refer to these magnates as a \"peerage\" during the reign of Edward II.\nMeanwhile the holders of smaller fiefdoms \"per baroniam\" ceased to be summoned to parliament; thus the official political importance of ownership of manors declined, resulting in baronial status becoming a personal title rather than one linked to ownership of territory.\nEventually 'writs of summons' ceased to be issued, and Letters patent were used to create new lordships: new lords were summoned to parliament by Letters patent from 1388. The first baron to be created by patent was Lord Beauchamp of Holt in the reign of Richard II.\nFeudal baronies had always been hereditable by primogeniture, but on condition of payment of a fine, termed \"relief\", derived from the Latin verb \"levo\", to lift up, meaning a \"re-elevation\" to a former position of honour. By the beginning of the 14th century, the hereditary nature of the peerage was well developed. Since the Crown was itself a hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. Baronies and other titles of nobility became unconditionally hereditable on the abolition of feudal tenure by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660.\nTransition from feudalism.\nThus over time baronies by writ effectively became hereditary peerages, even if this had not been the intention of the original issuer of the writ. By the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, many remaining baronies by tenure who did not have an established inherited writ of summons were converted into baronies by writ, thereby bringing them into line with the other peerages.\nWhile non-heritable \"peerages for life\" were often created in the early days of the peerage, their regular creation was not provided for by Act of Parliament until the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 and in 1958 more generally.\nThe rank of earl dates to Anglo-Saxon times. The ranks of duke and marquess were introduced in the 14th century, and that of viscount in the 15th century.\nRanks.\nPeers are of five ranks, in descending order of hierarchy:\nBaronets, while holders of hereditary titles, are not peers, although socially they are regarded as part of the aristocracy.\nLords of the manor are also not peers, but are instead a remnant of the English feudal system. They have historically been associated with the English landed gentry and squirearchy within the context of the class structure of the United Kingdom and many peers may also be Lords of the Manor. The status of lord of the manor is today often associated with the rank of esquire by prescription. Likewise, in Scotland \"Lairds\" are not part of the peerage system, but a courtesy title applied to an owner of a large, long-established Scottish estate affording recognition of a territorial designation as a part of their name by the Lord Lyon.\nKnights, dames and holders of other British non-hereditary chivalric orders, decorations, and medals are likewise not peers; nor are the hereditary knights of Ireland (only three such titles were ever created).\nTypes of peers.\nHereditary peers.\nA hereditary peer is a peer of the realm whose dignity may be inherited; those able to inherit it are said to be \"in remainder\". Hereditary peerage dignities may be created with writs of summons or by letters patent; the former method is now obsolete. Writs of summons summon an individual to Parliament, in the old feudal tradition, and merely \"implied\" the existence or creation of a hereditary peerage dignity, which is automatically inherited, presumably according to the traditional medieval rules (male-preference primogeniture, like the succession of the British crown until 2011). Letters patent explicitly create a dignity and specify its course of inheritance (usually agnatic succession, like the Salic Law). Some hereditary titles can pass through and vest in female heirs in a system called coparcenary. Following the \"Succession to the Crown Act 2013\", which replaced male-preference primogeniture with absolute primogeniture in the line of succession to the throne, there were calls from some hereditary peers' daughters to change the rules for hereditary peerages to match. In 2018 five daughters of hereditary peers took the government to the European Court of Human Rights to challenge the laws that stop them from inheriting their fathers titles and thereby being elected to the House of Lords.\nOnce created, a peerage dignity continues to exist as long as there are surviving legitimate descendants (or legitimate agnatic descendants) of the first holder, unless a contrary method of descent is specified in the letters patent. Once the heirs of the original peer die out, the peerage dignity becomes extinct. In former times, peerage dignities were often \"forfeit\" by Acts of Parliament, usually when peers were found guilty of treason. Often, however, the felonious peer's descendants successfully petitioned the sovereign to restore the dignity to the family. Some dignities, such as the Dukedom of Norfolk, have been forfeit and restored several times. Under the \"Peerage Act 1963\" an individual can disclaim his peerage dignity for his own lifetime within one year of inheriting it.\nWhen the holder of a peerage succeeds to the throne, the dignity \"merges in the Crown\" and ceases to exist.\nAll hereditary peers in the Peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom were entitled to sit in the House of Lords, subject only to qualifications such as age and citizenship, but under section 1 of the \"House of Lords Act 1999\" they lost this right. The Act provided that 92 hereditary peers \u2014 the Lord Great Chamberlain and the Earl Marshal, along with 90 others exempted through standing orders of the House \u2014 would remain in the House of Lords in the interim, pending any reform of the membership to the House. Standing Order 9 provides that those exempted are 75 hereditary peers elected by other peers from and by respective party groups in the House in proportion to their numbers, and fifteen chosen by the whole House to serve as officers of the House.\nRepresentative peers.\nFrom 1707 until 1963, Scottish peers elected 16 Scottish representative peers to sit in the House of Lords. Since 1963, they have had the same rights as Peers of the United Kingdom. From 1801 until 1922, Irish peers elected 28 Irish representative peers to sit in the House of Lords. Since 1922, when the Irish Free State became a separate country, no Irish representative peers have been elected, though sitting members retained their seats for life.\nLife peers.\nApart from hereditary peerages, there exist peerages that may be held for life and whose title cannot be passed onto someone else by inheritance. The \"Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876\" and the \"Life Peerages Act 1958\" authorise the regular creation of life peerages, with the right to sit in the House of Lords. Life peers created under both acts are of baronial rank and are always created under letters patent.\nSince the loss of the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords as a result of the \"House of Lords Act 1999\", the majority of the House of Lords is made up of life peers. There is no limit on the number of peerages the sovereign may create under the \"Life Peerages Act\". Normally life peerages are granted to individuals nominated by political parties or by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, and in order to honour retiring politicians, current senior judges, and senior members of the armed forces.\nUntil the formal opening of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2009, life peers created under the \"Appellate Jurisdiction Act\" were known as \"Lords of Appeal in Ordinary\" or in common parlance \"Law Lords\". They performed the judicial functions of the House of Lords and served on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. They remained peers for life, but ceased to receive judicial salaries at the age of 75. Under the terms of the Act, there may be no more than 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary under the age of 75 at one time. However, after the transfer of the judicial functions of the Lords to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Act ceased to have meaningful effect.\nUnder the \"House of Lords Reform Act 2014\" and the \"House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015\" a life peer may lose membership of the House of Lords permanently in one of four ways:\nWhile these provide for non-membership of the House of Lords, they do not allow a life peer to disclaim their peerage in the same way that a hereditary peer can disclaim theirs.\nForm of title.\nThe titles of peers are in the form of \"(Rank) (TitleName)\" or \"(Rank) of (TitleName)\". The name of the title can either be a place name or a surname or a combination of both (e.g. The Duke of Norfolk or The Earl Spencer). The precise usage depends on the rank of the peerage and on certain other general considerations. For instance, Dukes always use \"of\". Marquesses and Earls whose titles are based on place names normally use \"of\" (e.g. The Marquess of Bute and The Marquess of Ailsa), while those whose titles are based on surnames normally do not (e.g. The Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and The Earl Alexander of Tunis). Viscounts, Barons and Lords of Parliament generally do not use \"of\". However, there are several exceptions to the rule. For instance, Scottish vicecomital titles theoretically include \"of\", though in practice it is usually dropped (e.g. \"The Viscount of Falkland\" is commonly known as the \"Viscount Falkland\".)\nMultiple, compound and other names.\nWhile surnames and place names have been commonly used for peerage titles, it is also possible to create other forms of title. For instance, existing double-barrelled surnames have been used for titles (e.g. The Baroness Burdett-Coutts and The Baroness Spencer-Churchill) and other double-barrelled surnames have been created for peerages themselves (e.g. The Lord George-Brown). In a similar way, some peerage titles have been invented by combining surnames (e.g. The Viscount Leverhulme was invented by William Lever by combining his and his wife's surname of Hulme) or combining other names (e.g. The Viscount Alanbrooke which was created by Alan Brooke by combining his first and last names).\n\"Multiple\" and \"compound\" peerage titles have also evolved. A single individual can accumulate, by achievements or by inheritance, more than one peerage (of the same rank) and be known by a 'compound' of these titles (e.g. \"The \"Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry'\" even though these peerages were originally created separately (i.e. the Dukedom of Buccleuch (created in 1663) and the Dukedom of Queensberry (created in 1684) but unified in the person of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch and 5th Duke of Queensberry and his descendants).\nOn the other hand, a \"compound\"\" peerage refers to a title \"specifically created\" as a compound of two or more names, such as Baron Saye and Sele (created in 1440) and Baron Brougham and Vaux (created in 1830). The last hereditary compound titles to be created (for each rank) were the Duke of Clarence and Avondale (created in 1890), the Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair (created in 1916), the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (created in 1937), the Viscount Newry and Mourne (created in 1822) and the Baron Dalling and Bulwer (created in 1871).\nGeographic association.\nA territorial designation is often added to the main peerage title, especially in the case of barons and viscounts: for instance, \"The Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire\", or \"The Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, of Hindhead in the County of Surrey\". Any designation after the comma does not form a part of the main title. Territorial designations in titles are not updated with local government reforms, but new creations do take them into account. Thus there is \"The Baron Knollys, of Caversham in the County of Oxford\" (created in 1902), and \"The Baroness Pitkeathley, of Caversham in the Royal County of Berkshire\" (created in 1997).\nIt was once the case that a peer administered the place associated with his title (such as an earl administering a county as high sheriff or main landowner), but lordships by tenure have not been commonplace since the early Norman period. The only remaining peerages with certain associated rights over land are the Duchy of Cornwall (place), which appertains to the Dukedom of Cornwall, held by the eldest son and heir to the sovereign, and the Duchy of Lancaster (place), which regular income (revenue) appertains to the Dukedom of Lancaster, held by the sovereign whose government owns the capital and all capital gains on disposals. In both cases due to the particular function of bona vacantia in these areas, these titles afford rights encompassing the whole territorial designation of the holder, donated by the holder now to registered charities. Separate estates, smaller than counties, form the bulk of the two duchies.\nStyles and forms of address.\nStyle.\nDukes use \"His Grace\", Marquesses use \"The Most Honourable\" and other peers use \"The Right Honourable\". Peeresses (whether they hold peerages in their own right or are wives of peers) use equivalent styles.\nHonorific.\nIndividuals who use the appellation \"Lord\" or \"Lady\" are not necessarily peers. There are judicial, ecclesiastic and holders of other crown offices who are often accorded the appellation \"Lord\" or \"Lady\" as a form of courtesy title as a product of their office. Those who hold feudal titles are, however, never accorded the honorific \"Lord\". The holder of a lordship of the manor for example can be styled as Charles S, Lord/Lady of the Manor of [Placename], but would not be referred to as Lord Charles S of [Placename].\nIn speech, any peer or peeress except a Duke or Duchess is referred to as \"Lord X\" or \"Lady X\". The exception is a \"suo jure\" baroness (that is, one holding the dignity in her own right, usually a life peeress), who may also be called \"Baroness X\" in normal speech, though \"Lady X\" is also common usage. Hence, The Baroness Thatcher, a \"suo jure\" life peeress, was referred to as either \"Baroness Thatcher\" or \"Lady Thatcher\". \"Baroness\" is incorrect for female holders of Scottish Lordships of Parliament, who are not Baronesses; for example, the 21st Lady Saltoun was known as \"Lady Saltoun\", not \"Baroness Saltoun\".\nA peer is referred to by his peerage even if it is the same as his surname, thus the Baron Owen is \"Lord Owen\" not \"Lord David Owen\", though such erroneous forms are commonly used.\nSome peers, particularly life peers who were well known before their ennoblement, do not use their peerage titles. Others use a combination: for example, the author John Julius Norwich was John Julius Cooper, 2nd Viscount Norwich.\nChildren of peers use special titles called courtesy titles. The heir apparent of a duke, a marquess, or an earl generally uses his father's highest lesser peerage dignity as his own. Hence, The Duke of Devonshire's son is called the Marquess of Hartington. Such an heir apparent is called a \"courtesy peer\", but is a commoner until such time as he inherits (unless summoned by a writ in acceleration).\nYounger sons of dukes and marquesses prefix \"Lord\" to their first names as courtesy titles while daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls use \"Lady\". Younger sons of earls and children of viscounts, barons and lords of Parliament use \"The Honourable\".\nDivorced peeresses \"cannot claim the privileges or status of Peeresses which they derived from their husbands\". While a divorced former wife of a duke is no longer a duchess, she may still use the title, styled with her forename prefixed to the title (without the definite article, \"the\"). Her forename is used primarily to differentiate her from any new wife of her former husband. However, should the former husband remain unmarried, the former wife may continue to use the title without her forename attached. Should a former wife of a peer remarry, she would lose the style of a divorced peeress and take on a style relating to her new husband. Examples include Louise Timpson, who during her marriage to The Duke of Argyll was known as \"Her Grace\" The Duchess of Argyll but became \"Louise, Duchess of Argyll\" following her divorce, a style which she eventually lost after her subsequent marriage upon which she became known as Mrs. Robert Timpson.\nVestments.\nRobes.\nPeerage robes are currently worn in the United Kingdom on ceremonial occasions. They are of two varieties: parliament robes, worn in the House of Lords on occasions such as at a peer's introduction or state opening of parliament, and coronation robes, worn at the coronations of monarchs. The details of the fur on these robes differs according to a peer's rank.\nSince the early Middle Ages, robes have been worn as a sign of nobility. At first, these seem to have been bestowed on individuals by the monarch or feudal lord as a sign of special recognition; but in the fifteenth century the use of robes became formalised with peers all wearing robes of the same basic design, though varied according to the rank of the wearer.\nCoronets and headgear.\nIn the United Kingdom, a peer wears his or her coronet on only one occasion: for the monarch's coronation, when it is worn along with coronation robes.\nThe robes and coronets used at Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 cost about \u00a31,250 (roughly \u00a3 in present-day terms). (Peers under the rank of an Earl, however, were allowed in 1953 to wear a cheaper \"cap of estate\" in place of a coronet, as were peeresses of the same rank, for whom a simpler robe was also permitted (a one-piece gown with wrap-around fur cape, designed by Norman Hartnell).\nWith the Parliament robe, a black hat was customarily worn. The Wriothesley Garter Book provides a contemporary illustration of the 1523 State Opening of Parliament: the two dukes present are shown wearing coronets with their parliament robes, but the other Lords Temporal are all wearing black hats. The Lords Spiritual are wearing mitres with their distinctive robes. Mitres ceased to be worn after the Reformation, and the wearing of hats in Parliament ceased, for the most part, when wigs came into fashion. They survive today only as part of the dress of Lords Commissioners, when they are worn with the parliamentary robe: a bicorn hat for men (of black beaver, edged with silk grosgrain ribbon) and a tricorne-like hat for women. (The use of these hats at introductions of peers to the House was discontinued in 1998.)\nPrecedence.\nPeers are entitled to a special precedence because of their ranks. Wives and children of peers are also entitled to a special precedence because of their station.\nThe sovereign may, as fount of honour, vary the precedence of the peers or of any other people. For example, Elizabeth II granted her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, precedence immediately following her; otherwise, he would have ranked along with the other dukes of the peerage of the United Kingdom.\nGeneral precedence.\nIn England and Wales, the sovereign ranks first, followed by the Royal Family. Then follow the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Great Officers of State and other important state functionaries such as the prime minister. Thereafter, dukes precede marquesses, who precede earls, who precede viscounts, who precede bishops, who precede barons and lords of Parliament.\nWithin the members of each rank of the peerage, peers of England precede peers of Scotland. English and Scottish peers together precede peers of Great Britain. All of the aforementioned precede peers of Ireland created before 1801. Last come peers of Ireland created after 1801 and peers of the United Kingdom. Among peers of the same rank and Peerage, precedence is based on the creation of the title: those whose titles were created earlier precede those whose titles were created later. But in no case would a peer of a lower rank precede one of a higher rank. For example, the Duke of Fife, the last non-royal to be created a duke, would come before the Marquess of Winchester, though the latter's title was created earlier and is in a more senior peerage (the peerage of England).\nThe place of a peer in the order for gentlemen is taken by his wife in the order for ladies, except that a dowager peeress of a particular title precedes the present holder of the same title. Children of peers (and \"suo jure\" peeresses) also obtain a special precedence. The following algorithm may be used to determine their ranks:\nOver time, however, various offices were inserted at different points in the order, thereby varying it.\nEldest sons of dukes rank after marquesses; eldest sons of marquesses and then younger sons of dukes rank after earls; eldest sons of earls and then younger sons of marquesses rank after viscounts. Eldest sons of viscounts, younger sons of earls, and then eldest sons of barons, in that order, follow barons, with the Treasurer of the Household, the Comptroller of the Household, the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household and Secretaries of State being interpolated between them and the barons. Younger sons of viscounts, and then younger sons of barons, come after the aforesaid eldest sons of barons, with Knights of the Order of the Garter and Order of the Thistle, Privy councillors and senior judges being intercalated between them and eldest sons of barons.\nChildren of the eldest son of a peer also obtain a special precedence. Generally, the eldest son of the eldest son of a peer comes immediately before his uncles, while the younger sons of the eldest son of a peer come after them. Therefore, eldest sons of eldest sons of dukes come before younger sons of dukes, and younger sons of eldest sons of dukes come after them, and so forth for all the ranks. Below the younger sons of barons are baronets, knights, circuit judges and companions of the various orders of Chivalry, followed by the eldest sons of younger sons of peers.\nWives of all of the aforementioned have precedence corresponding to their husbands', unless otherwise entitled to a higher precedence, for instance by virtue of holding a certain office. An individual's daughter takes precedence after the wife of that individual's eldest son and before the wives of that individual's younger sons. Therefore, daughters of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of peers; daughters of eldest sons of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of eldest sons of peers; daughters of younger sons of peers rank after wives of eldest sons of younger sons of peers. Such a daughter keeps her precedence if marrying a commoner (unless that marriage somehow confers a higher precedence), but rank as their husband if marrying a peer.\nPrecedence within Parliament.\nThe order of precedence used to determine seating in the House of Lords chamber is governed by the \"House of Lords Precedence Act 1539\". Precedence as provided by the Act is similar to, but not the same as, the order outside Parliament. The sovereign, however, does not have the authority to change the precedence assigned by the Act.\nLords Temporal assume precedence similar to precedence outside Parliament. One difference in the precedence of peers relates to the positions of the Great Officers of State and the officers of the sovereign's Household. Some Great Officers\u2014the Lord Chancellor, the Lord High Treasurer, the Lord President of the Council and the Lord Privy Seal\u2014provided they are peers, rank before all other peers except those who are of the Blood Royal (no precedence is accorded if they are not peers). The positions of the other Great Officers\u2014the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Lord High Constable, the Earl Marshal and the Lord High Admiral\u2014and the officers of the Household\u2014the Lord Steward and the Lord Chamberlain\u2014are based on their respective ranks. Thus, if the Lord Steward were a duke, he would precede all dukes, if a marquess, he would precede all marquesses, and so on. If two such officers are of the same rank, the precedence of the offices (reflected by the order in which they are mentioned above) is taken into account: if the Lord Great Chamberlain and Earl Marshal were both marquesses, for example, then the Great Chamberlain would precede the Earl Marshal, as the former office precedes the latter.\nIn practice, however, the Act is obsolete, as the Lords do not actually sit according to strict precedence; instead, peers sit with their political parties.\nHeraldry.\nPeers are generally entitled to use certain heraldic devices. Atop the arms, a peer may display a coronet. Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were engraved while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones. Generally, only peers may use the coronets corresponding to their ranks. The Bishop of Durham, however, may use a duke's coronet atop the arms as a reference to the historical temporal authority of the Prince-Bishops of Durham.\nPeers wear their coronets at coronations. Otherwise, coronets are seen only in heraldic representations, atop a peer's arms. Coronets include a silver gilt chaplet and a base of ermine fur. The coronet varies with the rank of the peer. A member of the Royal Family uses a royal coronet instead of the coronet he or she would use as a peer or peeress.\nDucal coronets include eight strawberry leaves atop the chaplet, five of which are displayed in heraldic representations. Marquesses have coronets with four strawberry leaves alternating with four silver balls, of which three leaves and two balls are displayed. Coronets for earls have eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight silver balls (called \"pearls\" even though they are not) raised on spikes, of which five silver balls and four leaves are displayed. Coronets for viscounts have 16 silver balls, of which seven are displayed. Finally, baronial coronets have six silver balls, of which four are displayed. Peeresses use equivalent designs, but in the form of a circlet, which encircles the head, rather than a coronet, which rests atop the head.\nPeers are entitled to the use of supporters in their achievements of arms. Hereditary supporters are normally limited to hereditary peers, certain members of the Royal Family, chiefs of Scottish Clans, Scottish feudal barons whose baronies predate 1587. Non-hereditary supporters are granted to life peers, Knights of the Garter, Knights of the Thistle, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Bath, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of St Michael and St George, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the British Empire, and knights banneret.\nPeers, like most other armigers, may display helms atop their arms. Helms of peers are depicted in silver and facing the viewer's left. The helm is garnished in gold and the closed visor has gold bars, normally numbering five. Along with the helm, peers use a mantling, one side of which is red and the other a representation of the heraldic fur ermine. The mantling of peers is emblazoned \"gules, doubled ermine\". Peeresses and other female armigers do not bear helms or mantlings.\nAttempted primogeniture reforms.\nSince the Parliament of the United Kingdom enacted a series of reforms (from the 1960s onward) to the honours system, few hereditary titles have been created (the last non-royal title being created in 1990), while life peerages have proliferated, allowing for more openly LGBT persons to be appointed to the House of Lords. However, despite the legalization of civil partnerships for same-sex couples in 2004 and marriage for same-sex couples in 2013, spouses of ennobled civil partners have not been allowed the extension of title and privilege from their spouses' ennoblements as those accorded to married opposite-sex spouses of ennobled persons. In July 2012, Conservative MP Oliver Colvile announced a private member's bill, titled \"Honours (Equality of Titles for Partners) Bill 2012-13\", to amend the honours system to both allow husbands of those made dames and for civil partners of recipients to receive honours by their relationship statuses. Another bill, the Equality (Titles) Bill, which would allow for both female first-born descendants to inherit hereditary titles as well as for \"husbands and civil partners\" of honours recipients \"to use equivalent honorary titles to those available to wives\", was introduced by Lord Lucas in the House of Lords on 13 May 2013, but did not progress past Committee stage. Similar legislation was introduced in 2015, 2016 and 2023.\nCounterparts.\nOther feudal monarchies equally held a similar system, grouping high nobility of different rank titles under one term, with common privileges and/or in an assembly, sometimes legislative and/or judicial.\nIt\u014d Hirobumi and the other Meiji leaders deliberately modeled the Japanese House of Peers on the House of Lords, as a counterweight to the popularly elected House of Representatives (\"Sh\u016bgiin\").\nIn France, the system of pairies (peerage) existed in two different versions: the exclusive 'old' in the French kingdom, in many respects an inspiration for the English and later British practice, and the very prolific Chambre des Pairs under the Bourbon Restoration (1814\u20131848).\nIn Spain and Portugal, the closest equivalent title was Grandee; in Hungary, Magnat.\nIn the Kingdom of Sicily a peerage was instituted in 1812 in connection with the abolition of feudalism: peers were nominated based on the taxable incomes of their formerly feudal estates.\nIn the Holy Roman Empire, instead of an exclusive aristocratic assembly, the legislative body was the Imperial Diet, membership of which, expressed by the title Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, was granted to allied princely families (and various minor ones), as well as to Princes of the Church (parallel to the Lords Spiritual) and in some cases was restricted to a collective 'curiate' vote in a 'bench', such as the Grafenbank.\nIn the medieval Irish nobility, Gaelic nobles were those presented with the White Wand or \"slat\" in a formal ceremony, and presented it by another noble. It was the primary symbol of lordship and effectively reserved only for the three tiers of kings (provincial, regional, local) and for those princely and comital families descending from them in control of significant territories. The total number was between 100 and 150 at any time.\nSee also.\nRelated\nPeerages in the British Isles\nPeerages in the Commonwealth\nLegal\nOther\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "58255", "revid": "169132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58255", "title": "Duke", "text": "Noble or royal title in some European countries and their colonies\nDuke is a male title either of a monarch ruling over a duchy, or of a member of royalty, or nobility. As rulers, dukes are ranked below emperors, kings, grand princes, grand dukes, and above sovereign princes. As royalty or nobility, they are ranked below grand dukes and above or below princes, depending on the country or specific title. The title comes from French \"duc\", itself from the Latin \"dux\", 'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province. In most countries, the word duchess is the female equivalent.\nFollowing the reforms of the emperor Diocletian (which separated the civilian and military administrations of the Roman provinces), a \"dux\" became the military commander in each province. The title \"dux\", Hellenised to \"doux\", survived in the Eastern Roman Empire where it continued in several contexts, signifying a rank equivalent to a captain or general. Later on, in the 11th century, the title \"Megas Doux\" was introduced for the post of commander-in-chief of the entire navy.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the title (as \"Herzog\") signified first among the Germanic monarchies. Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the king. A duke may or may not be, \"ipso facto\", a member of the nation's peerage: in the United Kingdom and Spain, all dukes are/were also peers of the realm, in France, some were and some were not, while the term is not applicable to dukedoms of other nations, even where an institution similar to the peerage (e.g. Grandeeship, Imperial Diet, Hungarian House of Magnates) existed.\nDuring the 19th century, many of the smaller German and Italian states were ruled by dukes or grand dukes. But at present, with the exception of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there are no dukes ruling as monarchs. Duke remains the highest hereditary title (aside from titles borne by a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty) in Portugal (though now a republic), Spain, and the United Kingdom. In Sweden, members of the royal family are given a personal dukedom at birth. The Pope, as a temporal sovereign, has also, though rarely, granted the title of duke or duchess to persons for services to the Holy See. In some realms the relative status of \"duke\" and \"prince\", as titles borne by the nobility rather than by members of reigning dynasties, varied\u2014e.g., in Italy and Germany.\nA woman who holds in her own right the title to such duchy or dukedom, or is married to a duke, is normally styled duchess. Queen Elizabeth II, however, was known by tradition as Duke of Normandy in the Channel Islands and Duke of Lancaster in Lancashire.\nDuchy and dukedom.\nA duchy is the territory or geopolitical entity ruled by a duke, whereas his title or area is often called a dukedom. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a fully independent state and its head, the Grand Duke, is a sovereign monarch reigning over his Luxembourgish subjects.\nThe Duke of Cornwall holds both the dukedom (title) and duchy (estate holdings), the latter being the source of his personal income; those living on the ducal estates are subjects of the British sovereign and owe neither fealty nor services to the duke \"per se\". In Scotland, the male heir apparent to the British crown is always the Duke of Rothesay as well, but this is a dukedom (title) without a duchy. Similarly, the British monarch rules and owns the Duchy of Lancaster as Duke of Lancaster, but it is held separately from the Crown, with the income of the duchy estates providing the sovereign's Privy Purse.\nThe Channel Islands are two of the three remaining Crown Dependencies, the last vestiges of the lands of the Duchy of Normandy. The Islanders in their loyal toast will say \"Le Roi, notre Duc\" (The King, Our Duke). Though the title was apparently renounced under the Treaty of Paris in 1259, the Crown still maintains that the title is retained: \"In 1106, William's youngest son Henry I seized the Duchy of Normandy from his brother Robert; since that time, the English sovereign has always held the title Duke of Normandy\", and that \"By 1205, England had lost most of its French lands, including Normandy. However, the Channel Islands, part of the lost Duchy, remained a self-governing possession of the English Crown. While the islands today retain autonomy in government, they owe allegiance to The King in his role as Duke of Normandy.\"\nMiddle Ages.\nDuring the Middle Ages, after Roman power in Western Europe collapsed, the title was still employed in the Germanic kingdoms, usually to refer to the rulers of old Roman provinces.\nAlbania.\nThe Venetians installed a \"Duke of Durazzo\" (today Durr\u00ebs) during their brief rule over the city and its environs in 1205\u20131213.\nIn 1332, Robert of Taranto succeeded his father, Philip. Robert's uncle, John, did not wish to do him homage for the Principality of Achaea, so Robert received Achaea from John in exchange for 5,000\u00a0ounces of gold and the rights to the diminished Kingdom of Albania. John took the style of Duke of Durazzo.\nIn 1368, Durazzo fell to Karl Thopia, who was recognized by Venice as \"Prince of Albania\".\nVisigoths.\nThe Visigoths retained the Roman divisions of their kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula and it seems that dukes ruled over these areas. They were the most powerful landowners and, along with the bishops, elected the king, usually from their own midst. They were the military commanders and in this capacity often acted independently from the king, most notably in the latter period before the Muslim invasions.\nThe army was structured decimally with the highest unit, the thiufa, probably corresponding to about 1,000 people from each \"civitas\" (city district). The cities were commanded by counts, who were in turn answerable to the dukes, who called up the \"thiufae\" when necessary.\nLombards.\nWhen the Lombards entered Italy, the Latin chroniclers called their war leaders \"duces\" in the old fashion. These leaders eventually became the provincial rulers, each with a recognized seat of government. Though nominally loyal to the king, the concept of kingship was new to the Lombards and the dukes were highly independent, especially in central and southern Italy, where the Duke of Spoleto and the Duke of Benevento were \"de facto\" sovereigns. In 575, when Cleph died, a period known as the Rule of the Dukes, in which the dukes governed without a king, commenced. It lasted only a decade before the disunited magnates, to defend the kingdom from external attacks, elected a new king and even diminished their own duchies to provide him with a handsome royal demesne.\nThe Lombard kings were usually drawn from the duke pool when the title was not hereditary. The dukes tried to make their own offices hereditary. Beneath them in the internal structure were the counts and gastalds, a uniquely Lombard title initially referring to judicial functions, similar to a count's, in provincial regions.\nFranks.\nThe Franks employed dukes as the governors of Roman provinces, though they also led military expeditions far from their duchies. The dukes were the highest-ranking officials in the realm, typically Frankish (whereas the counts were often Gallo-Roman), and formed the class from which the kings' generals were chosen in times of war. The dukes met with the king every May to discuss policy for the upcoming year, the so-called Mayfield.\nIn Burgundy and Provence, the titles of patrician and prefect were commonly employed instead of duke, probably for historical reasons relating to the greater Romanization of those provinces. But the titles were basically equivalent.\nIn late Merovingian Gaul, the mayors of the palace of the Arnulfing clan began to use the title \"dux et princeps Francorum\": 'duke and prince of the Franks'. In this title, \"duke\" implied supreme military control of the entire nation (\"Francorum\", the Franks) and it was thus used until the end of the Carolingian dynasty in France in 987.\nHoly Roman Empire.\nStem duchies.\nThe stem duchies were the constituent duchies of the kingdom of Germany at the time of the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty (the death of Louis the Child in 911) and the transitional period leading to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire later in the 10th century.\nEngland.\nAnglo-Saxon times.\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, where the Roman political divisions were largely abandoned, the highest political rank beneath that of king was ealdorman, and the first ealdormen were referred to as \"duces\" (the plural of the original Latin \"dux\") in the chronicles. The title ealdorman was replaced by the Danish \"eorl\" (later earl) over time. After the Norman conquest, their power and regional jurisdiction was limited to that of the Norman counts.\nLate medieval times.\nEdward III of England created the first English dukedom by naming his eldest son Edward, the Black Prince, as Duke of Cornwall in 1337. Upon the death of the Black Prince, the duchy of Cornwall passed to his nine-year-old son, who would eventually succeed his grandfather as Richard II.\nThe title of Duke of Lancaster was created by Edward III in 1351 for Henry of Grosmont, but became extinct upon the duke's death in 1361. The following year, Edward III bestowed the title (2nd creation) on his fourth son, John of Gaunt, who was also married to the first duke's daughter. On the same day Edward III also created his second son, Lionel of Antwerp, as Duke of Clarence.\nAll five of Edward III's surviving sons eventually became dukes. In 1385, ten years after their father's death, his heir Richard II created dukedoms for his last two uncles on the same day. Thomas of Woodstock was named Duke of Gloucester and Edmund of Langley became Duke of York, thereby founding the House of York, which later fought for the throne with John of Gaunt's Lancastrian descendants during the Wars of the Roses.\nBy 1483, a total of 16 ducal titles had been created: Cornwall, Lancaster, Clarence, Gloucester, York, Ireland, Hereford, Aumale, Exeter, Surrey, Norfolk, Bedford, Somerset, Buckingham, Warwick and Suffolk. Some became extinct, others had multiple creations, and some had merged with the crown upon the holder's accession to the throne. When the Plantagenet dynasty came to an end at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485, only four ducal titles remained extant, of which two were now permanently associated with the crown. John de la Pole was Duke of Suffolk and John Howard was Duke of Norfolk (2nd creation), while the duchy of Cornwall was reserved as a title and source of income for the eldest son of the sovereign, and the duchy of Lancaster was now held by the monarch.\nNorfolk perished alongside Richard III at Bosworth field, and the title was forfeit. It was restored to his son Thomas thirty years later by Henry VIII, as one of a number of dukes created or recreated by the Tudor dynasty over the ensuing century. England's premier ducal title, Norfolk, remains in the Howard family to this day.\nModern age.\nIn the 19th century, the sovereign dukes of Parma and Modena in Italy, and of Anhalt, Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, Nassau, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Altenburg in Germany survived Napoleon's reorganization.\nSince the unification of Italy in 1870 and the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918, there have no longer been any reigning dukes in Europe; Luxembourg is ruled by a grand duke, a higher title, just below king.\nIn the United Kingdom, the inherited position of a duke along with its dignities, privileges, and rights is a dukedom. However, the title of \"duke\" has never been associated with independent rule in the British Isles: they hold dukedoms, not duchies (excepting the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster). Dukes in the United Kingdom are addressed as \"Your Grace\" and referred to as \"His Grace\". Currently, there are thirty-five dukedoms in the Peerage of England, Peerage of Scotland, Peerage of Great Britain, Peerage of Ireland and Peerage of the United Kingdom, held by thirty different people, as three people hold two dukedoms and two hold three (see List of dukes in the peerages of Britain and Ireland).\nAll dukedoms in the UK apart from the Dukedom of Lancaster and the Dukedom of Edinburgh, which is held for life by the current duke, are inherited through the male line only, although dukedoms such as Marlborough and Fife (second creation) have passed through the female line for one generation under terms of a special remainder for lack of male heirs of the initial grantee. Henrietta, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough and Her Highness Princess Alexandra (HRH Princess Arthur of Connaught), 2nd Duchess of Fife were duchesses in their own right. Both were succeeded in their titles by nephews born by younger sisters of the duchesses. The word \"duchess\" is normally only used for the wife of a duke.\nDukes of Lancaster are called dukes even when they are female, and by tradition the monarch of the UK, whether male or female, is known in the Channel Islands as the Duke of Normandy.\nRoyal dukes.\nVarious royal houses traditionally awarded titles of nobility (mainly dukedoms) to the sons, and in some cases daughters, of their sovereigns; others include at least one dukedom in a wider list of similarly granted titles, nominal dukedoms without any actual authority, often even without an estate. Such titles are still conferred on royal princes or princesses in the current European monarchies of Belgium, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\nOther historical cases occurred for example in Denmark, Finland (as a part of Sweden) and France, Portugal and some former colonial possessions such as Brazil and Haiti.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, a royal duke is a duke who is a member of the British royal family, entitled to the style of \"His Royal Highness\". Ducal titles which have been given within the royal family include Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence, Duke of York, Duke of Gloucester, Duke of Bedford, Duke of Cumberland, Duke of Cambridge, Duke of Rothesay, Duke of Albany, Duke of Ross, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke of Kent, Duke of Sussex, and Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. Following his abdication in 1936 the former King Edward VIII was given the title Duke of Windsor.\nThere are also non-royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom.\nBelgium.\nIn Belgium, the title of Duke of Brabant (historically the most prestigious in the Low Countries, and containing the federal capital Brussels) is awarded to the heir apparent of the monarch, other dynasts receiving various lower historical titles (much older than Belgium, and in principle never fallen to the Belgian crown), such as Count of Flanders (King Leopold III's so-titled brother Charles held the title when he became the realm's temporary head of state as prince-regent) and Prince of Li\u00e8ge (a secularised version of the historical prince-bishopric; e.g. King Albert II until he succeeded his older brother Baudouin I).\nIberian peninsula.\nWhen the Christian Reconquista, sweeping the Moors from the former Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba and its taifa-remnants, transformed the territory of former Suevic and Visigothic realms into Catholic feudal principalities, none of these warlords was exactly styled duke. A few (as Portugal itself) started as count (even if the title of \"dux\" was sometimes added), but soon all politically relevant princes came to use the royal style of king.\nPortugal.\nIn Portugal, the title of duke was granted for the first time in 1415 to infante Peter and infante Henry, the second and third sons of king John I, following their participation in the successful Conquest of Ceuta. Pedro became the first Duke of Coimbra and Henry the first Duke of Viseu.\nFrom the reign of king Manuel I, the title of Duke of Beja was given to the second son of the monarch. This was changed during the Liberal regime in the 19th century (with Queen Maria II), when the first infante (second son of the monarch) got the title of Duke of Porto and the second infante (third son) was known as Duke of Beja.\nThere are examples of duke as a subsidiary title, granted to the most powerful noble houses:\nUsually, the title of duke was granted to relatives of the royal family, such as the infantes or natural sons of the monarch. There are exceptions, such as Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de \u00c1vila, who, although not having any relation to the royal family, was given the title of Duke of \u00c1vila and Bolama in the 19th century.\nSpain.\nSpanish infantes and infantas are usually given a royal dukedom upon marriage, excepting the heir apparent who is the Prince of Asturias. Those titles are nowadays not hereditary but carry a grandeeship of Spain. The current royal duchesses are Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria (although she inherited the title of Duchess of Hernani from her cousin and is the second holder of the title), and Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo. In Spain all dukes hold the court rank of grandee, which has precedence over all other noble titles.\nThe last non-royal hereditary dukedom created was the title of Duke of Su\u00e1rez in favour of former primer minister Adolfo Su\u00e1rez in 1981. Since the accession of King Felipe VI to the throne in 2014, no new noble title has been created.\nNordic countries.\nThe Northern European duchies of Halland, Jutland, Lolland, Osilia and Reval existed in the Middle Ages. The longest-surviving duchy was Schleswig, i.e., \"Sonderjylland\" (a portion of which later became part of Germany). Its southern neighbor, the duchy of Holstein, in personal union with the Danish crown, was nonetheless always a German principality. The two duchies jointly became a member of the German \"Bundesland\" as \"Schleswig-Holstein\" in the 19th century.\nDenmark.\nBeginning in the 11th century, Danish kings frequently awarded the title of \"jarl\" (earl) or duke of Schleswig to a younger son of the monarch. Short-lived dukedoms were created for the same purpose in Lolland and Halland.\nAfter the accession to the throne of Christian I, a complex system of appanages were created for male-line descendants of the king, being granted non-sovereign ducal titles in both Schleswig and Holstein, e.g. Duke of Gottorp, Duke of S\u00f8nderborg, Duke of Augustenborg, Duke of Franzhagen, Duke of Beck, Duke of Gl\u00fccksburg and Duke of Nordborg. This arrangement occurred in both territories despite Schleswig being a fief of Denmark and Holstein being a fief of the Holy Roman Empire.\nFinland.\nKey parts of Finland were sometimes under a Duke of Finland during the Swedish reign (until 1809). Some of the provinces are still considered duchies for the purposes of heraldry.\nNorway.\nIn Norway, Skule B\u00e5rdsson was first \"jarl\" in 1217, and as such got responsibility for the army, and then in 1237, as another attempt at compromise, Skule was given the first Norwegian title of duke (\"hertug\"). There is no indication that those two titles meant the same thing, or was mixed. He was first \"jarl\", and then also \"hertug\", but after he became \"hertug\" he kept the title \"jarl\".\nSweden.\nSweden has a history of making the sons of its kings ruling princes of vast duchies, but this ceased in 1622. Only one non-royal person was ever given a dukedom.\nIn 1772, King Gustav III reinstated the appointment of titular dukes but as a non-hereditary title for his brothers. Since then, all Swedish princes have been created dukes of a province at birth. When the 1810 Act of Succession was amended to allow female succession to the throne, King Carl XVI Gustaf's eldest daughter Victoria became Crown Princess (displacing her younger brother Carl Philip) and received the title of Duchess of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland. The practice of conferring ducal titles has since extended to Swedish princesses as well as princes. Currently, there are five dukes and four duchesses in their own right. The territorial designations of these dukedoms refer to ten of the Provinces of Sweden.\nFrance.\nThe highest precedence in the realm, attached to a feudal territory, was given to the twelve original pairies (en: \"peers\"), who also had a traditional function in the royal coronation, comparable to the German imperial archoffices.\nHalf of them were ducal: three ecclesiastical (the six prelates all ranked above the six secular peers of the realm) and three temporal, each time above three counts of the same social estate.\nThe \"Prince-Bishops\" with ducal territories among them were:\nLater, the Archbishop of Paris was given the title of \"duc de Saint-Cloud\" with the dignity of peerage, but it was debated if he was an ecclesiastical peer or merely a bishop holding a lay peerage.\nThe secular dukes in the peerage of the realm were, again in order of precedence:\nThe theory of the participation of the peers in the coronation was laid down in the late 13th century, when some of the peerage (the Duchy of Normandy and the County of Toulouse) had already been merged in the crown.\nAt the end of this same century, the king elevated some counties into duchies, a practice that increased up until the Revolution. Many of these duchies were also peerages (the so-called 'new peerages').\nItaly, Germany and Austria.\nIn Northern Italy, Germany and Austria the title of \"duke\" (\"duca\" in Italian, and \"Herzog\" in German) was quite common. As the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) was until its dissolution a feudal structure, most of its Dukes were actually reigning in their lands. As the titles from the HRE were taken over after its dissolution, or in Northern Italy after their territories became independent of the Empire, both countries also had a share of fully sovereign dukes. Also, in Germany in many ducal families every agnate would bear the ducal title of the family as a courtesy title.\nIn Northern Italy some important sovereign ducal families were the Visconti and the Sforza, who ruled Milan; the Savoy in Piedmont; the Medici of Florence; the Farnese of Parma and Piacenza; the Cybo-Malaspina of Massa; the Gonzaga of Mantua; the Este of Modena and Ferrara.\nIn Germany, important ducal families were the Wittelsbachs in Bavaria, the Welfs in Hannover, the ducal family of Cleves, the Wettins in Saxony (with its Ernestine branch divided into several duchies), the W\u00fcrttembergs and the Mecklenburgs. In the German Confederation the Nassaus, the Ascanians of Anhalt, the Welf branch of Brunswick and the Ernestine lines of the Saxon duchies were the sovereign ducal families.\nIn Austria, \"Archduke\" was the title borne from 1358 by the Habsburg rulers of the Archduchy of Austria, and later by all senior members of that dynasty.\nElsewhere in Europe.\nHungary.\nIn the Kingdom of Hungary no ducal principalities existed but duchies were often formed for members of the dynasty as appanages. During the rule of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty dukes held territorial powers, some of them even minted coins, but later this title became more often nominal.\nThese duchies usually were\nIn the Jagiellonian era (1490\u20131526) only two dukes did not belong to the royal dynasty: John Corvin (the illegitimate son of Matthias Corvinus) and L\u0151rinc \u00dajlaki (whose father was the titular king of Bosnia), and both bore the title as royal dukes.\nAfter the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs the Habsburg kings rewarded Hungarian aristocrats (like the Esterh\u00e1zys) with princely titles, but they created these titles as Holy Roman Emperors, not as kings of Hungary.\nGreece.\nThe Byzantines retained the title \"dux\", transcribed as \u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03be (\"doux\") in Medieval Greek. As in the later Roman Empire, it remained a military office and was not a feudal or hereditary rank. In the 10th century, it was given to the military commanders over several \"themata\" (also known as \"katepano\"), and in the late 11th century it became used for the governor of a \"thema\".\nWhen the Catholic crusaders overran the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade, they installed several crusader states (see Frankokratia), some of which were of ducal rank:\nIn Italy and other western countries, the later Byzantine appanages of the Palaiologan period were sometimes translated as duchies: the Morea, Mesembria, Selymbria and Thessaloniki. The Greek rank of their holders, however, was that of \"despotes\".\nIn the independent Kingdom of Greece, the style of Duke of Sparta was instituted in 1868 upon the birth of the future Constantine I as a distinct title for the Crown Prince of Greece.\nSlavic and nearby countries.\nGenerally, confusion reigns whether to translate the usual ruler titles, \"knyaz/ knez/ ksi\u0105\u017ce\" etc. as Prince (analogous to the German F\u00fcrst) or as Duke;\nNetherlands.\nAfter Belgium and the Netherlands separated in 1830, the title of duke no longer existed in the Netherlands. There is, however, one exception; the title \"Hertog van Limburg\" (\"Duke of Limburg\") still exists. This title, however, is an exclusive title for the head of state (the monarch, i.e., the king or queen of the Netherlands).\nGeorgia.\nIn Georgia, the title of \"eristavi\" is equivalent to duke. The word means \"head of the nation\" or \"head of the army\". A duke ruled a duchy (saeristavo); a duke of two or more duchies was called \"eristavt-eristavi\", duke of dukes.\nIn the 6th to 9th centuries, Iberia was ruled by Erismtavari, a title similar to grand duke. Erismtavari was the first among equal dukes.\nGeorgians use the title \"eristavi\" only for Georgian dukes. When talking about foreign dukes, they use the German word \"Herzog\", which is the German equivalent of \"duke\".\nIn the late 15th and early 16th century, the kingdom of Georgia collapsed and most of the western Georgian dukes became princes. In the 19th century the title of \"eristavi\" was abolished by the Russian conquerors and the former dukes took the word \"Eristavi\" as their last names.\nPost-colonial non-European states.\nEmpire of Brazil.\nIn the Empire of Brazil duke was the highest rank for people born outside the imperial house and only three dukedoms were created. Two of these titles were for relatives of Emperor Pedro I: an illegitimate daughter and a brother-in-law who received the title when married to Pedro I's daughter Maria II. The third, given to Lu\u00eds Alves de Lima e Silva, was the only dukedom created during the reign of Pedro II. None of these titles were hereditary, just like every other title in the Brazilian nobility system.\nHaiti.\nThe royal Christophe dynasty created eight hereditary dukedoms, in rank directly below the nominal princes. They were short-lived and only recognized in the country.\nAnalogues.\nLike other major Western noble titles, Duke is sometimes used to render (translate) certain titles in non-western languages. \"Duke\" is used even though those titles are generally etymologically and often historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered roughly equivalent, especially in hierarchic aristocracies such as feudal Japan, useful as an indication of relative rank.\nIndian Subcontinent.\nThe Indian feudal system cannot be fully translated to its European counterparts. The closest equivalent to the title of Sovereign Duke is Rao and Nawab to a feudal duchy, a large jagir. Thus, a Rao (in the ruling system) or a Jagirdar, Deshmukh, Patil, and Zamindar (in a feudal way) are closely equivalent to a Duke.\nTurkey, Afghanistan and Iran.\n\"Duke\" in Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iran after Mongolian war against them, was added as generals and kings of districts or states. In the Kingdom of Persians and Ottomans, the systems cannot be fully translated to its European counterparts so they called those generals and kings as Khan, a Mongolian royal and noble rank from the Turco-Mongol word for \"lord\", analogous to Duke. After revolutions and the falling Empire system in those countries (changing the ruling system to democratic and republic systems), those Khans and the other equal ranks titles added to the titleholder's surnames, and the ranking system, as usual, was disqualified as an official ranking.\nChina.\nDuring the era of \"fengjian\" in Ancient China (Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period), the title of \"g\u014dng\" (\u516c; sometimes translated as \"Duke\", sometimes as \"Lord\") was sparingly granted. Under the principle of \"Three Deferences and Two Royal Descendants\" (\u4e09\u606a\u4e8c\u738b\u5f8c), the three former royal houses were granted the title of \"g\u014dng\"; however, not all scholars recognize such a tradition in the Western Zhou dynasty. For that dynasty, this would be the descendants of the Xia dynasty and Shang dynasty; their dukedoms were respectively Qi (\u675e) and Song (\u5b8b). According to tradition, these states were considered the king's guests rather than subjects. However, recent scholarship has identified multiple other meanings for \"g\u014dng\", including the patriarch of a lineage, a non-inheritable title signifying a very broad and senior position within the court, or a respectful appellation for any regional ruler or deceased ancestor.\nIn works like \"Mencius\" and others that date to the Warring States period, \"g\u014dng\" was interpreted as the highest in the \"five ranks of nobles\" () attributed to the Western Zhou dynasty. However, the title was not in use until the end of the Western Han, granted to the descendants of the Shang and Zhou royal houses and the eventual usurper Wang Mang. It was also granted to Cao Cao. The title during the Han was inferior to that of prince (\u8af8\u4faf\u738b), which was only available to imperial princes. The \"five ranks of nobles\" were implemented as such during the Jin dynasty (\u6649\u671d). During the Southern dynasties, usurpers typically sought the title of duke, then prince, before compelling the monarch to abdicate.\nThe Duke of Yansheng noble title was granted to the descendants of Confucius. In 1935, the Nationalist Government changed the title to Sacrificial Official to Confucius (\u5927\u6210\u81f3\u8056\u5148\u5e2b\u5949\u7940\u5b98), which still exists as a hereditary office of the Republic of China.\nThe title \"g\u014dng\" and others were also awarded, sometimes posthumously, during the imperial period of Chinese history to recognize distinguished civil and military officials. These could include a taxable base for the official, or could be purely honorary. For example, Emperor Lizong of Song granted the posthumous title Duke of Hui (\u5fbd\u570b\u516c) to the Neo-Confucian thinker Zhu Xi.\nIndonesia.\nThe Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, which dominated eastern Java in the 14th and 15th centuries, was divided into \"nagara\" (provinces). The administration of these \"nagara\" was entrusted to members of the royal family, who bore the title of \"Bhre\"\u2014i.e., \"Bhra I\", \"lord of\" (the word \"bhra\" being akin to the Thai \"Phra\"), followed by the name of the land they were entrusted with: for example, a sister of the king Hayam Wuruk (r. 1350\u20131389) was \"Bhre Lasem\", \"lady of Lasem\". This system was similar to the Apanage system in Western Europe.\nSultan Agung, king of Mataram in Central Java (r. 1613\u20131645), would entrust the administration of territories he gradually conquered all over the island of Java, to officials bearing the title of \"Adipati\", this title is hereditary. Such territories were called \"Kadipaten\". Prior to the unification of Java by Sultan Agung, independent \"kadipaten\"s also exist, e.g. the Duchy of Surabaya which was conquered by Agung in 1625.\nThe VOC (Dutch East Indies Company), while gradually taking control of Javanese territory, would maintain the existing Mataram administrative structure. \"Adipati\" were called \"\"regenten\" in Dutch, and the territories they administered, \"regentschappen\"\".\nIn the 19th century, the Javanese term for 'regent' was \"bupati\". French traveller G\u00e9rard Louis Domeny de Rienzi mentions \"bapati\".\nThe \"bupati\" have been maintained in the modern Indonesian administrative subdivision structure, heading a \"kabupaten\", the subdivision of a \"provinsi\" or province.\nThe word \"Adipati\" is still found in the official title of the hereditary dukes Mangkunegara of Surakarta and Paku Alam of Yogyakarta\u2014i.e., \"Kanjeng Gusti Pangeran Adipati Arya\" (shortened into KGPAA).\nNigeria.\nIn the Kingdom of Benin, a viceroyal chieftain that is known as an \"Enogie\" in the Edo language is usually referred to as a duke in English. Often a cadet of the dynasty that produces the oba of Benin, the enogie is expected to rule his domain as he sees fit, subject to the approval of the oba.\nIn Ife, Oyo and the other kingdoms of Nigerian Yorubaland, a viceroyal chieftain is known as a \"Baale\" in the Yoruba language. He is barred from wearing a crown as a matter of tradition and is generally seen as the reigning representative of his oba, the monarch who has the right to wear one.\nMyanmar.\nIn Myanmar (Burma), since the Pagan era of 11th century, each and every single one of the royal family received the title of \"Myosa\" (also \"Myoza\"), literally means chief of town or territory, which is equivalent to the title of Duke. All royals were given the honor to possess at least one territory by the King. They all were mostly called by their possessions. For instance, Burma's last king, King Thibaw was called by his possession, when he was a prince, of a town Thibaw (Hsipaw in Shan State).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They include higher alkanes and lipids, typically with melting points above about 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), melting to give low viscosity liquids. Waxes are insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar organic solvents such as hexane, benzene and chloroform. Natural waxes of various types are produced by plants and animals and occur in petroleum.\nChemistry.\nWaxes are organic compounds that characteristically consist of long aliphatic alkyl chains, although aromatic compounds may also be present. Natural waxes may contain unsaturated bonds and include various functional groups such as fatty acids, primary and secondary alcohols, ketones, aldehydes and fatty acid esters. Synthetic waxes often consist of homologous series of long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes or paraffins) that lack functional groups.\nPlant and animal waxes.\nWaxes are synthesized by both plants and animals. Those of animal origin typically consist of wax esters derived from a variety of fatty acids and carboxylic alcohols. In waxes of plant origin, characteristic mixtures of unesterified hydrocarbons may predominate over esters. The composition depends not only on species, but also on geographic location of the organism.\nAnimal waxes.\nThe best-known animal wax is beeswax, used in constructing the honeycombs of beehives, but other insects also secrete waxes. A major component of beeswax is myricyl palmitate which is an ester of triacontanol and palmitic acid. Its melting point is . Spermaceti occurs in large amounts in the head oil of the sperm whale. One of its main constituents is cetyl palmitate, another ester of a fatty acid and a fatty alcohol. Lanolin is a wax obtained from wool, consisting of esters of sterols.\nPlant waxes.\nPlants secrete waxes into and on the surface of their cuticles as a way to control evaporation, wettability and hydration. The epicuticular waxes of plants are mixtures of substituted long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, alkyl esters, fatty acids, primary and secondary alcohols, diols, ketones and aldehydes. From the commercial perspective, the most important plant wax is carnauba wax, a hard wax obtained from the Brazilian palm \"Copernicia prunifera\". Containing the ester myricyl cerotate, its many applications include confectionery and other food coatings, car and furniture polish, floss coating, and surfboard wax. Other more specialized vegetable waxes include jojoba oil, candelilla wax and ouricury wax.\nModified plant and animal waxes.\nPlant and animal based waxes or oils can undergo selective chemical modifications to produce waxes with more desirable properties than are available in the unmodified starting material. This approach has relied on green chemistry approaches including olefin metathesis and enzymatic reactions and can be used to produce waxes from inexpensive starting materials like vegetable oils.\nPetroleum derived waxes.\nAlthough many natural waxes contain esters, paraffin waxes are hydrocarbons, mixtures of alkanes usually in a homologous series of chain lengths. These materials represent a significant fraction of petroleum. They are refined by vacuum distillation. Paraffin waxes are mixtures of saturated n- and iso- alkanes, naphthenes, and alkyl- and naphthene-substituted aromatic compounds. A typical alkane paraffin wax chemical composition comprises hydrocarbons with the general formula C\"n\"H2\"n\"+2, such as hentriacontane, C31H64. The degree of branching has an important influence on the properties. Microcrystalline wax is a lesser produced petroleum based wax that contains higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons.\nMillions of tons of paraffin waxes are produced annually. They are used in foods (such as chewing gum and cheese wrapping), in candles and cosmetics, as non-stick and waterproofing coatings and in polishes.\nMontan wax.\nMontan wax is a fossilized wax extracted from coal and lignite. It is very hard, reflecting the high concentration of saturated fatty acids and alcohols. Although dark brown and odorous, they can be purified and bleached to give commercially useful products.\nPolyethylene and related derivatives.\nAs of 1995[ [update]], about 200 million kilograms of polyethylene waxes were consumed annually.\nPolyethylene waxes are manufactured by one of three methods:\nEach production technique generates products with slightly different properties. Key properties of low molecular weight polyethylene waxes are viscosity, density and melt point.\nPolyethylene waxes produced by means of degradation or recovery from polyethylene resin streams contain very low molecular weight materials that must be removed to prevent volatilization and potential fire hazards during use. Polyethylene waxes manufactured by this method are usually stripped of low molecular weight fractions to yield a flash point &gt;500\u00a0\u00b0F (&gt;260\u00a0\u00b0C). Many polyethylene resin plants produce a low molecular weight stream often referred to as low polymer wax (LPW). LPW is unrefined and contains volatile oligomers, corrosive catalyst and may contain other foreign material and water. Refining of LPW to produce a polyethylene wax involves removal of oligomers and hazardous catalyst. Proper refining of LPW to produce polyethylene wax is especially important when being used in applications requiring FDA or other regulatory certification.\nUses.\nWaxes are mainly consumed industrially as components of complex formulations, often for coatings. The main use of polyethylene and polypropylene waxes is in the formulation of colourants for plastics. Waxes confer matting effects (i.e., to confer non-glossy finishes) and wear resistance to paints. Polyethylene waxes are incorporated into inks in the form of dispersions to decrease friction. They are employed as release agents, find use as slip agents in furniture, and confer corrosion resistance.\nAntiquity.\nWax can be used to make figurines, dolls, puppet heads, wax sculptures, etc. The Department of Egyptian Antiquities of the Louvre displays many human or animal or god figurines, pseudo-mummies (E 21) as well as wax figurine molds (N 1557); a bewitchment figurine depicting a dog devouring a man (E 27079); and a wax tablet (E 10498) known as the \"cahier de Papnoution\", covered in wax and used as a writing slate (MND 552), etc.\nCandles.\nWaxes such as paraffin wax or beeswax, and hard fats such as tallow are used to make candles, used for lighting and decoration. Another fuel type used in candle manufacturing includes soy. Soy wax is made by the hydrogenation process using soybean oil.\nWood products.\nWaxes are used as finishes and coatings for wood products. Beeswax is frequently used as a lubricant on drawer slides where wood to wood contact occurs.\nOther uses.\nSealing wax was used to close important documents in the Middle Ages. Wax tablets were used as writing surfaces. There were different types of wax in the Middle Ages, namely four kinds of wax (Ragusan, Montenegro, Byzantine, and Bulgarian), \"ordinary\" waxes from Spain, Poland, and Riga, unrefined waxes and colored waxes (red, white, and green). Waxes are used to make waxed paper, impregnating and coating paper and card to waterproof it or make it resistant to staining, or to modify its surface properties. Waxes are also used in shoe polishes, wood polishes, and automotive polishes, as mold release agents in mold making, as a coating for many cheeses, and to waterproof leather and fabric. Wax has been used since antiquity as a temporary, removable model in lost-wax casting of gold, silver and other materials.\nColorfully pigmented wax has been used as a medium in encaustic painting and is used today in the manufacture of crayons, china markers, and colored pencils. Carbon paper, used for making duplicate typewritten documents was coated with carbon black suspended in wax, typically montan wax, but has largely been superseded by photocopiers and computer printers. In another context, lipstick and mascara are blends of various fats and waxes colored with pigments, and both beeswax and lanolin are used in other cosmetics. Ski wax is used in skiing and snowboarding. Also, the sports of surfing and skateboarding often use wax to enhance the performance.\nSome waxes are considered food-safe and are used to coat wooden cutting boards and other items that come into contact with food. Beeswax or coloured synthetic wax is used to decorate Easter eggs in Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and the Czech Republic. Paraffin wax is used in making chocolate covered sweets.\nWax is also used in wax bullets, which are used as simulation aids, and for wax sculpturing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Honey bees consume about of honey to secrete of wax, and so beekeepers may return the wax to the hive after harvesting the honey to improve honey outputs. The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal honey extractor. If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused in a number of ways, including making sheets of comb foundation with a hexagonal pattern. Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells. Fresh, new comb is sometimes sold and used intact as comb honey, especially if the honey is being spread on bread rather than used in cooking or as a sweetener.\nBroodcomb becomes dark over time, due to empty cocoons and shed larval skins embedded in the cells, alongside being walked over constantly by other bees, resulting in what is referred to as a 'travel stain' by beekeepers when seen on frames of comb honey. Honeycomb in the \"supers\" that are not used for brood (e.g. by the placement of a queen excluder) stays light-colored.\nNumerous wasps, especially Polistinae and Vespinae, construct hexagonal prism-packed combs made of paper instead of wax; in some species (such as \"Brachygastra mellifica\"), honey is stored in the nest, thus technically forming a paper honeycomb. However, the term \"honeycomb\" is not often used for such structures.\nGeometry.\nThe axes of honeycomb cells are always nearly horizontal, with the open end higher than the back end. The open end of a cell is typically referred to as the top of the cell, while the opposite end is called the bottom. The cells slope slightly upwards, between 9 and 14\u00b0, towards the open ends.\nTwo possible explanations exist as to why honeycomb is composed of hexagons rather than any other shape. First, the hexagonal tiling creates a partition with equal-sized cells, while minimizing the total perimeter of the cells. Known in geometry as the honeycomb theorem, this was conjectured by Jan Bro\u017cek and mathematically proven much later by Thomas Hales. Thus, a hexagonal structure uses the least material to create a lattice of cells within a given volume. A second reason, given by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, is that the shape simply results from the process of individual bees putting cells together: somewhat analogous to the boundary shapes created in a field of soap bubbles. In support of this, he notes that queen cells, which are constructed singly, are irregular and lumpy with no apparent attempt at efficiency.\nThe closed ends of the honeycomb cells are also an example of geometric efficiency, though three-dimensional. The ends are trihedral (i.e., composed of three planes) sections of rhombic dodecahedra, with the dihedral angles of all adjacent surfaces measuring 120\u00b0, the angle that minimizes surface area for a given volume. (The angle formed by the edges at the pyramidal apex, known as the tetrahedral angle, is approximately 109\u00b0 28' 16\" (\n arccos(\u22121/3))\nThe shape of the cells is such that two opposing honeycomb layers nest into each other, with each facet of the closed ends being shared by opposing cells.\nIndividual cells do not show this geometric perfection: in a regular comb, deviations of a few percent from the \"perfect\" hexagonal shape occur. In transition zones between the larger cells of drone comb and the smaller cells of worker comb, or when the bees encounter obstacles, the shapes are often distorted. Cells are also angled up about 13\u00b0 from horizontal to prevent honey from dripping out.\nIn 1965, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes T\u00f3th discovered that the trihedral pyramidal shape (which is composed of three rhombi) used by the honeybee is not the theoretically optimal three-dimensional geometry. A cell end composed of two hexagons and two smaller rhombi would actually be .035% (or about one part per 2850) more efficient. This difference is too minute to measure on an actual honeycomb, and irrelevant to the hive economy in terms of efficient use of wax, considering wild comb varies considerably from any mathematical notion of \"ideal\" geometry.\nRole of wax temperature.\nBees use their antennae, mandibles and legs to manipulate the wax during comb construction, while actively warming the wax. During the construction of hexagonal cells, wax temperature is between , well below the temperature at which wax is assumed to be liquid for initiating new comb construction. The body temperature of bees is a factor for regulating an ideal wax temperature for building the comb.\nAs human food.\nHoneycomb can be consumed as human food.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Honey bees are known for their construction of perennial nests within cavities (i.e. beehives) containing hexagonal cells made of secreted wax, their large colony sizes, and their routine regurgitation of digested carbohydrates as surplus food storage in the form of honey, the lattermost of which distinguishes their hives as a prized foraging target of many mellivorous animals including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers. \nAlthough honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees, they are the bee clade most familiar to humans and are also the most valuable beneficial insects to agriculture and horticulture. The best-known honey bee species is the western honey bee (\"Apis mellifera\"), which was domesticated and farmed (i.e. beekeeping) for honey production and crop pollination. The only other domesticated species is the eastern honey bee (\"Apis cerana\"), which are raised in South, Southeast and East Asia. \nOnly members of the genus \"Apis\" are true honey bees, but some other bee species also produce and store honey and have been kept by humans for that purpose, including the stingless bees belonging to the genus \"Melipona\" and the Indian stingless or dammar bee \"Tetragonula iridipennis\". In addition to harvesting honey, modern humans also use beeswax in making candles, soap, lip balms and various cosmetics, as a lubricant and in mould-making using the lost wax process. Other honey bee secretions such as royal jelly and bee venom are used pharmaceutically, especially in alternative medicine.\nEtymology and name.\nThe genus name \"Apis\" is Latin for \"bee\". Although modern dictionaries may refer to \"Apis\" as either honey bee or honeybee, entomologist Robert Snodgrass asserts that correct usage requires two words, i.e., \"honey bee\", because it is a kind or type of bee. It is incorrect to run the two words together, as in \"dragonfly\" or \"butterfly\", which are appropriate because dragonflies and butterflies are not flies. Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project.\nOrigin, systematics, and distribution.\nAll honey bees are nectarivorous pollinators native to mainland Afro-Eurasia, but human migrations and colonizations to the New World since the Age of Discovery have been responsible for the introduction of multiple subspecies of the western honey bee into South America (early 16th century), North America (early 17th century) and Australia (early 19th century), resulting in the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees in all continents except Antarctica.\nHoney bees appear to have their center of origin in South and Southeast Asia (including the Philippines), as all the extant species except \"Apis mellifera\" are native to that region. Notably, living representatives of the earliest lineages to diverge (\"Apis florea\" and \"Apis andreniformis\") have their center of origin there.\nThe first \"Apis\" bees appear in the fossil record at the Eocene\u2013Oligocene boundary (34\u00a0mya), in European deposits. The origin of these prehistoric honey bees does not necessarily indicate Europe as the place of origin of the genus, only that the bees were present in Europe by that time. Few fossil deposits are known from South Asia, the suspected region of honey bee origin, and fewer still have been thoroughly studied.\nNo \"Apis\" species existed in the New World during human times before the introduction of \"A.\u00a0mellifera\" by Europeans. Only one fossil species is documented from the New World, \"Apis nearctica\", known from a single 14\u00a0million-year-old specimen from Nevada.\nThe close relatives of modern honey bees\u2014e.g., bumblebees and stingless bees\u2014are also social to some degree, and social behavior is considered to be a trait that predates the origin of the genus. Among the extant members of \"Apis\", the more basal species make single, exposed combs, while the more recently evolved species nest in cavities and have multiple combs, which has greatly facilitated their domestication.\nSpecies.\nWhile about 20,000 species of bees exist, only eight extant species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 43 subspecies, although historically seven to 11 species are recognized: \"Apis andreniformis\" (the black dwarf honey bee); \"Apis cerana\" (the eastern honey bee); \"Apis dorsata\" (the giant honey bee); \"Apis florea\" (the red dwarf honey bee); \"Apis koschevnikovi\" (Koschevnikov's honey bee); \"Apis laboriosa\" (the Himalayan giant honey bee); \"Apis mellifera\" (the western honey bee); and \"Apis nigrocincta\" (the Philippine honey bee).\nHoney bees are the only extant members of the tribe Apini. Today's honey bees constitute three clades: \"Micrapis\" (the dwarf honey bees), \"Megapis\" (the giant honey bees), and \"Apis\" (the western honey bee and its close relatives).\nMost species have historically been cultured or at least exploited for honey and beeswax by humans indigenous to their native ranges. Only two species have been truly domesticated: \"Apis mellifera\" and \"Apis cerana\". \"A.\u00a0mellifera\" has been cultivated at least since the time of the building of the Egyptian pyramids, and only that species has been moved extensively beyond its native range.\n\"Micrapis\".\n\"Apis florea\" and \"Apis andreniformis\" are small honey bees of southern and southeastern Asia. They make very small, exposed nests in trees and shrubs. Their stings are often incapable of penetrating human skin, so the hive and swarms can be handled with minimal protection. They occur largely sympatrically, though they are very distinct evolutionarily and are probably the result of allopatric speciation, their distribution later converging.\nGiven that \"A.\u00a0florea\" is more widely distributed and \"A.\u00a0andreniformis\" is considerably more aggressive, honey is, if at all, usually harvested from the former only. They are the earliest-diverging extant lineage of honey bees. \"Apis florea\" have smaller wing spans than its sister species. \"Apis florea\" are also completely yellow except the scutellum of workers, which is black.\n\"Megapis\".\nTwo species are recognized in the subgenus \"Megapis\". They usually build single or a few exposed combs on high tree limbs, on cliffs, and sometimes on buildings. They can be very fierce. Periodically robbed of their honey by human \"honey hunters\", colonies are easily capable of stinging a human being to death if provoked.\n\"Apis\".\nEastern \"Apis\" species include three or four\u00a0species, including \"A.\u00a0koschevnikovi\", \"A.\u00a0nigrocincta\", and \"A.\u00a0cerana\". The genetics of the western honey bee (\"A.\u00a0mellifera\") are unclear.\nKoschevnikov's honey bee.\nKoschevnikov's honey bee (\"Apis koschevnikovi\") is often referred to in the literature as the \"red bee of Sabah\"; however, \"A.\u00a0koschevnikovi\" is pale reddish in Sabah State, Borneo, Malaysia, but a dark, coppery colour in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, Indonesia. Its habitat is limited to the tropical evergreen forests of the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra and they do not live in tropical evergreen rain forests which extend into Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam.\nPhilippine honey bee.\n\"Apis nigrocincta\" is a cavity-nesting species. The species has rust-coloured scapes, legs, and clypeuses, with reddish-tan hair colour that covers most of the body.\nEastern honey bee.\n\"Apis cerana\", the eastern honey bee proper, is the traditional honey bee of southern and eastern Asia. One of its subspecies, the Indian honey bee (\"A.\u00a0c.\u00a0indica\"), was domesticated and kept in hives in a fashion similar to \"A.\u00a0mellifera\", though on a more limited, regional scale.\nIt has not been possible yet to resolve its relationship to the Bornean honey bee \"A.\u00a0c. nuluensis\" and \"Apis nigrocincta\" from the Philippines to satisfaction; some researchers argue that these are indeed distinct species, but that \"A.\u00a0cerana\" as defined is still paraphyletic, consisting of several separate species, though other researchers argue \"cerana\" is a single monophyletic species.\nWestern honey bee.\n\"A. mellifera\", the most common domesticated species, was first domesticated before 2600 BC and was the third insect to have its genome mapped. It seems to have originated in eastern tropical Africa and spread from there to Europe and eastwards into Asia to the Tian Shan range. It is variously called the European, western, or common honey bee in different parts of the world. Many subspecies have adapted to the local geographic and climatic environments; in addition, breeds such as the Buckfast bee have been bred. Behavior, colour, and anatomy can be quite different from one subspecies or even strain to another.\n\"A. mellifera\" phylogeny is the most enigmatic of all honey bee species. It seems to have diverged from its eastern relatives only during the Late Miocene. This would fit the hypothesis that the ancestral stock of cave-nesting honey bees was separated into the western group of East Africa and the eastern group of tropical Asia by desertification in the Middle East and adjacent regions, which caused declines of food plants and trees that provided nest sites, eventually causing gene flow to cease.\nThe diversity of \"A. mellifera\" subspecies is probably the product of a largely Early Pleistocene radiation aided by climate and habitat changes during the last ice age. That the western honey bee has been intensively managed by humans for many millennia\u2014including hybridization and introductions\u2014has apparently increased the speed of its evolution and confounded the DNA sequence data to a point where little of substance can be said about the exact relationships of many \"A.\u00a0mellifera\" subspecies.\n\"Apis mellifera\" is not native to the Americas, so it was not present when the European explorers and colonists arrived. However, other native bee species were kept and traded by indigenous peoples. In 1622, European colonists brought the German honey bee (\"A.\u00a0m. mellifera\") to the Americas first, followed later by the Italian honey bee (\"A.\u00a0m. ligustica\") and others. Many of the crops that depend on western honey bees for pollination have also been imported since colonial times. Escaped swarms (known as \"wild\" honey bees, but actually feral) spread rapidly as far as the Great Plains, usually preceding the colonists. Honey bees did not naturally cross the Rocky Mountains; they were transported by the Mormon pioneers to Utah in the late 1840s, and by ship to California in the early 1850s.\nAfricanized honey bee.\nAfricanized honey bees (known colloquially as \"killer bees\") are hybrids between European stock and the African subspecies \"A. m. scutellata\". They are often more aggressive than European honey bees and do not create as much of a honey surplus, but are more resistant to disease and are better foragers. Accidentally released from quarantine in Brazil, they have spread to North America and constitute a pest in some regions. However, these strains do not overwinter well, so they are not often found in the colder, more northern parts of North America. The original breeding experiment for which the African honey bees were brought to Brazil in the first place has continued (though not as originally intended). Novel hybrid strains of domestic and re-domesticated Africanized honey bees combine high resilience to tropical conditions and good yields. They are popular among beekeepers in Brazil.\nLiving and fossil honey bees (Apini: \"Apis\").\nTribe Apini Latreille\nGenus \"Apis\" Linnaeus (\"sensu lato\")\nLife cycle.\nAs in a few other types of eusocial bees, a colony generally contains one queen bee, a female; seasonally up to a few thousand drone bees, or males; and tens of thousands of female worker bees. Details vary among the different species of honey bees, but common features include:\nWinter survival.\nIn cold climates, honey bees stop flying when the temperature drops below about and crowd into the central area of the hive to form a \"winter cluster\". The worker bees huddle around the queen bee at the center of the cluster, shivering to keep the center between at the start of winter (during the broodless period) and once the queen resumes laying. The worker bees rotate through the cluster from the outside to the inside so that no bee gets too cold. The outside edges of the cluster stay at about . The colder the weather is outside, the more compact the cluster becomes. During winter, they consume their stored honey to produce body heat. The amount of honey consumed during the winter is a function of winter length and severity but ranges in temperate climates from . In addition, certain bees, including the western honey bee as well as \"Apis cerana\", are known to engage in effective methods of nest thermoregulation during periods of varying temperature in both summer and winter. During the summer, however, this is achieved through fanning and water evaporation from water collected in various fields.\nPollination.\nOf all the honey bee species, only \"A.\u00a0mellifera\" has been used extensively for commercial pollination of fruit and vegetable crops. The scale of these pollination services is commonly measured in the billions of dollars, credited with adding about 9% to the value of crops across the world. However, despite contributing substantially to crop pollination, there is debate about the potential spillover to natural landscapes and competition between managed honey bees and many of the ~20,000 species of wild pollinators.\nSpecies of \"Apis\" are generalist floral visitors, and pollinate many species of flowering plants, but because of their \"generalized\" nature, they often do so inefficiently. Without specialized adaptations for specific flowers, their ability to reach pollen and nectar is often limited. This combined with their behavioural flexibility may be why they are the most commonly documented pollen thieves. Indeed, for plant species with more specialized pollinators, experiments show that increased honeybee visitation can reduce pollination, both where honey bees are non-native and even where they are native. What is more, their tendency to visit all species in a given area means that the pollen they carry for any one species is often very diluted. As such, they can provide some pollination to many plants, but most plants have some native pollinator that is more effective at pollinating that species. When honey bees are present as an invasive species in an area, they compete for flowers with native pollinators, which can actually push out the native species.\nClaims of human dependency.\nWestern honey bees have been described as essential to human food production, leading to claims that without their pollination humanity would starve or die out. Apples, blueberries, and cherries, for example, are 90 percent dependent on honeybee pollination. Albert Einstein is sometimes misquoted as saying \"If bees disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live\"\".\" Einstein did not say this and there is no science to support this prediction.\nMany important crops need no insect pollination at all. The ten most important crops, comprising 60% of all human food energy, fall into this category: plantains are sterile and propagated by cuttings, as are cassava; potatoes, yams, and sweet potatoes are root vegetables propagated by tubers; soybeans are self-pollinated; and rice, wheat, sorghum, and maize, are wind-pollinated, as are most other grasses.\nNo crops originating in the New World depend on the western honey bee (\"Apis mellifera\") at all, as the bee is an invasive species brought over with colonists in the last few centuries. Tomatoes, peppers, squash, and all other New World crops evolved with native pollinators such as squash bees, bumble bees, and other native bees. The stingless bees mentioned by Jefferson are distant relatives of the honey bees, in the genus \"Melipona\".\nStill, honey bees are considered \"crucial to the food supply, pollinating more than 100 of the crops we eat, including nuts, vegetables, berries, citrus and melons.\" The USDA reports \"Three-fourths of the world's flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world's food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce\" and honey bees \"pollinate 80 percent of all flowering plants, including more than 130 types of fruits and vegetables.\"\nNutrition.\nHoney bees obtain all of their nutritional requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4\u20134.3\u00a0mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66\u201374% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5\u00a0mg pollen or 25\u201337.5\u00a0mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require the highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine; however, elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with the lowest concentrations found in May and the highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.\nPollen is also a lipid source for honey bees ranging from 0.8% to 18.9%. Lipids are metabolized during the brood stage for precursors required for future biosynthesis. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are not considered essential but have been shown to significantly improve the number of brood reared. Honey bees ingest phytosterols from pollen to produce 24-methylene cholesterol and other sterols as they cannot directly synthesize cholesterol from phytosterols. Nurse bees can selectively transfer sterols to larvae through brood food.\nNectar is collected by foraging worker bees as a source of water and carbohydrates in the form of sucrose. The dominant monosaccharides in honey bee diets are fructose and glucose but the most common circulating sugar in hemolymph is trehalose which is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules. Adult worker honey bees require 4\u00a0mg of utilizable sugars per day and larvae require about 59.4\u00a0mg of carbohydrates for proper development.\nHoney bees require water to maintain osmotic homeostasis, prepare liquid brood food, and cool the hive through evaporation. A colony's water needs can generally be met by nectar foraging as it has high water content. Occasionally on hot days or when nectar is limited, foragers will collect water from streams or ponds to meet the needs of the hive.\nBeekeeping.\nThe only domesticated species of honey bee are \"A. mellifera\" and \"A. cerana\", and they are often maintained, fed, and transported by beekeepers. In Japan, where \"A. mellifera\" is vulnerable to local hornets and disease, the Japanese honey bee \"A. cerana japonica\" is used in its place. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as the crop needs pollinating and allowing the beekeeper to charge for the pollination services they provide, revising the historical role of the self-employed beekeeper, and favoring large-scale commercial operations. Bees of various types other than honey bees are also domesticated and used for pollination or other means around the world, including \"Tetragonula iridipennis\" in India, the blue orchard bee for tree nut and fruit pollination in the United States, and several species of \"Bombus\" (bumblebees) for pollination in various regions globally, such as tomatoes, which are not effectively pollinated by honey bees.\nColony collapse disorder.\nPrimarily in places where western honey bees were imported by humans, periodic collapses in western honey bee populations have occurred at least since the late 19th century.\nHowever, as humans continued to manipulate the western honey bee and deliberately transferred them on a global scale, diseases simultaneously spread and harmed managed colonies. Colony losses have occurred periodically throughout history. Fungus, mites, and starvation have all been thought to be the cause of the deaths. Limited occurrences resembling CCD were documented as early as 1869. Colony collapses were called \"May Disease\" in Colorado in 1891 and 1896.\nStarting in the first decade of the 21st century, abnormally high die-offs (30\u201370% of hives) of western honey bee colonies have occurred in North America. This has been dubbed \"colony collapse disorder\" (CCD) and was at first unexplained. It seems to be caused by a combination of factors rather than a single pathogen or poison, possibly including neonicotinoid pesticides or Israeli acute paralysis virus.\nA survey by the University of Maryland and Auburn University published in 2023 found the number of United States honeybee colonies \"remained relatively stable\" although 48% of colonies were lost in the year that ended April 1, 2023, with a 12-year average annual mortality rate of 39.6%. The previous year (2021\u20132022) the loss was 39% and the 2020\u20132021 loss was 50.8%. Beekeepers told the surveying scientists that a 21% loss over the winter is acceptable and more than three-fifths of beekeepers surveyed said their losses were higher than that in 2022\u20132023.\nParasites.\nAcarapis woodi.\n\"Acarapis woodi\" (or \"tracheal mites\") are parasitic mites that live and reproduce in adult bees' tracheae, or respiratory tubes, piercing the tube walls with their mouthparts to feed on haemolymph. To infest new hosts, the mites must find newly emerged bees; after three days, the bristles (setae) guarding the spiracles are firm enough to prevent the mites' entry into the tracheae. Mite infestations are known as acarine and have been called \"Isle of Wight disease\".\n\"Galleria mellonella\".\nLarval stages of the moth \"Galleria mellonella\" parasitize both wild and cultivated honey bees, in particular \"Apis mellifera\" and \"Apis cerana\". Eggs are laid within the hive and the larvae that hatch tunnel through and destroy the honeycombs that contain bee larva and their honey stores. The tunnels they create are lined with silk, which entangles and starves emerging bees. Destruction of honeycombs also results in honey leaking and being wasted. Both \"G.\u00a0mellonella\" adults and larvae are possible vectors for pathogens that can infect bees, including the Israeli acute paralysis virus and the black queen cell virus.\nTo manage the mites, temperature treatments are possible, but also distort the wax of the honeycombs. Chemical fumigants, particularly CO2, are also used.\n\"Varroa\" mites.\n\"Varroa\" mites are arguably the biggest threat to honey bees in the United States. These mites invade hives and reproduce by laying eggs on the pupa. The hatching mites eat away at the pupa, causing deformities as well as spreading disease. If not detected and treated early on, the mite population may increase to such an extent that the hive will succumb to the diseases and deformities caused by the mites. It was widely believed that the mites drank the blood of bees. However, a 2018 study Article in PNAS: \"Linking pesticides and gut health in bees\" showed that they feed on the fat body tissue of live bees, not the blood.\nMite treatment is accomplished by several methods, including treatment strips and acid vaporization.\nBee products.\nHoney.\nHoney is a complex substance made when bees ingest nectar, process it, and store the substance in honeycombs. All living species of \"Apis\" have had their honey gathered by indigenous peoples for consumption. \"A.\u00a0mellifera\" and \"A.\u00a0cerana\" are the only species that have had their honey harvested for commercial purposes.\nBeeswax.\nWorker bees of a certain age secrete beeswax from a series of exocrine glands on their abdomens. They use the wax to form the walls and caps of the comb. As with honey, beeswax is gathered by humans for various purposes such as candle making, waterproofing, soap and cosmetics manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, art, furniture polish, and more.\nBee bread.\nBees collect pollen in their pollen baskets called corbiculae and carry it back to the hive.\nWorker bees combine pollen, honey, and glandular secretions and allow them to ferment in the comb to make bee bread. The fermentation process releases additional nutrients from the pollen and can produce antibiotics and fatty acids which inhibit spoilage. Bee bread is eaten by nurse bees (younger workers) which produce the protein-rich royal jelly needed by the queen and developing larvae in their hypopharyngeal glands.\nIn the hive, pollen is used as a protein source necessary during brood-rearing. In certain environments, excess pollen can be collected from the hives of \"A.\u00a0mellifera\" and \"A.\u00a0cerana\". The product is used as a health supplement. It has been used with moderate success as a source of pollen for hand pollination.\nBees as food.\nBee brood\u2014the eggs, larvae or pupae of honey bees\u2014is nutritious and seen as a delicacy in countries such as Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, and many African countries; it has been consumed since ancient times by the Chinese and Egyptians.\nAdult wild honeybees are also consumed as food in parts of China, including Yunnan. According to a worker at a Yunnan-based specialty restaurant, the bees are best served \"deep-fried with salt and pepper\", and they are \"naturally sweet and tasty\". Kellie Schmitt of CNN described the dish as one of \"Shanghai's weirdest foods\".\nPropolis.\nPropolis is a resinous mixture collected by honey bees from tree buds, sap flows, or other botanical sources, which is used as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Propolis may cause severe allergic reactions and have adverse interactions with prescription drugs in some individuals. Propolis is also used in wood finishes on string instruments.\nRoyal jelly.\nRoyal jelly is a honey bee secretion made in the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of nurse bees used to nourish larvae and queen bees. It is marketed for its alleged but unsupported claims of health benefits. On the other hand, it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals.\nSexes and castes.\nHoney bees have three castes: drones, workers, and queens. Drones are male, while workers and queens are female.\nDrones.\nDrones are typically haploid, having only one set of chromosomes, and primarily exist for reproduction. They are produced by the queen if she chooses not to fertilize an egg or by an unfertilized laying worker. There are rare instances of diploid drone larvae. This phenomenon usually arises when there are more than two generations of brother-sister mating. Sex determination in honey bees is initially due to a single locus, called the complementary sex determiner (\"csd\") gene. In developing bees, if the conditions are that the individual is heterozygous for the \"csd\" gene, they will develop into females. If the conditions are so that the individual is hemizygous or homozygous for the \"csd\" gene, they will develop into males. The instances where the individual is homozygous at this gene are the instances of diploid males. Drones take 24 days to develop and may be produced from summer through to autumn, numbering as many as 500 per hive. They are expelled from the hive during the winter months when the hive's primary focus is warmth and food conservation. Drones have large eyes used to locate queens during mating flights. They do not defend the hive or kill intruders and do not have a stinger.\nWorkers.\nWorkers have two sets of chromosomes. They are produced from an egg that the queen has selectively fertilized from stored sperm. Workers typically develop in 21 days. A typical colony may contain as many as 60,000 worker bees. Workers exhibit a wider range of behaviors than either queens or drones. Their duties change with age in the following order (beginning with cleaning out their cell after eating through their capped brood cell): feed brood, receive nectar, clean hive, guard duty, and forage. Some workers engage in other specialized behaviors, such as \"undertaking\" (removing corpses of their nestmates from inside the hive).\nWorkers have morphological specializations, including the pollen basket \"(corbicula)\", abdominal glands that produce beeswax, brood-feeding glands, and barbs on the sting. Under certain conditions (for example, if the colony becomes queenless), a worker may develop ovaries.\nWorker honey bees perform different behavioural tasks that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. The gut microbial composition of workers varies according to the landscape and plant species they forage, such as differences in rapeseed crops, and with different hive tasks, such as nursing or food processing.\nQueens.\nQueen honey bees are created when worker bees feed a single female larva an exclusive diet of a food called \"royal jelly\". Queens are produced in oversized cells and develop in only 16 days; they differ in physiology, morphology, and behavior from worker bees. In addition to the greater size of the queen, she has a functional set of ovaries, and a spermatheca, which stores and maintains sperm after she has mated. \"Apis\" queens practice polyandry, with one female mating with multiple males. The highest documented mating frequency for an \"Apis\" queen is in \"Apis nigrocincta\", where queens mate with an extremely high number of males with observed numbers of different matings ranging from 42 to 69 drones per queen. The sting of queens is not barbed like a worker's sting, and queens lack the glands that produce beeswax. Once mated, queens may lay up to 2,000 eggs per day. They produce a variety of pheromones that regulate the behavior of workers and help swarms track the queen's location during the swarming.\nQueen-worker conflict.\nWhen a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen. The worker shares half her genes with the drone and one-quarter with her brothers, favouring her offspring over those of the queen. The queen shares half her genes with her sons and one-quarter with the sons of fertile female workers. This pits the worker against the queen and other workers, who try to maximize their reproductive fitness by rearing the offspring most related to them. This relationship leads to a phenomenon known as \"worker policing\". In these rare situations, other worker bees in the hive who are genetically more related to the queen's sons than those of the fertile workers will patrol the hive and remove worker-laid eggs. Another form of worker-based policing is aggression toward fertile females. Some studies have suggested a queen pheromone which may help workers distinguish worker- and queen-laid eggs, but others indicate egg viability as the key factor in eliciting the behavior. Worker policing is an example of forced altruism, where the benefits of worker reproduction are minimized and that of rearing the queen's offspring maximized.\nIn very rare instances workers subvert the policing mechanisms of the hive, laying eggs which are removed at a lower rate by other workers; this is known as anarchic syndrome. Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones would decrease the overall productivity of the hive, the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother would increase. The anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the individual and group levels for the stability of the hive.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, the death (or removal) of a queen increases reproduction in workers, and a significant proportion of workers will have active ovaries in the absence of a queen. The workers of the hive produce the last batch of drones before the hive eventually collapses. Although during this period worker policing is usually absent, in certain groups of bees it continues.\nAccording to the strategy of kin selection, worker policing is not favored if a queen does not mate multiple times. Workers would be related by three-quarters of their genes, and the difference in relationship between the sons of the queen and those of the other workers would decrease. The benefit of policing is negated, and policing is less favored. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social hymenoptera.\nTimeline of reproduction.\nFor \"Apis mellifera\", queens are the central reproducers among their colonies. Although reproduction may occur around the calendar, it may stop in the late fall due to falling temperatures. If a colony does not have a queen or she is unable to reproduce, workers can lay unfertilized eggs that may develop into males. The queens, however, do not reach this point immediately. Typically, it takes a queen 16 days to reach adulthood, with an additional week to begin developing and laying eggs. To begin the process of reproduction in a honeybee colony, workers begin to produce queen larvae while simultaneously finding a place to create a new hive. The queen larvae will then hatch at the old hive, and the queens will fight one another until there is only a single queen left to begin reproducing.\nReproductive strategies.\nOnce a queen matures and is ready to begin reproducing, she will begin making flights to orient to mating in free flight and finding mates before actually beginning to mate. Queens that are ready to mate take between 1 and 6 flights across multiple consecutive days, called nuptial flights. Throughout their nuptial flights, queens engage with multiple mates and have little control over the number of times they do so.\nThe process of queens engaging with their mates is not widely understood because the process takes place in free flight, so it is difficult to observe despite various advances in technology and observation techniques. It begins with drones flying in the same area where they know the queen will soon arrive, waiting for her to join them. When the queen arrives, she is crowded immediately by the drones who are eager to mate with her. The drones receive a signal from the queen that her \"sting chamber\" is open, which induces the drones to mate with her and bring forward their physical contact which warrants reproduction. A successful drone clasps onto the queen and releases seminal fluid and spermatozoa into the queen. After this process is complete, the drone typically remains inside of the queen, which is indicative of the drone's desire to deter other drones from engaging with the queen and reproducing. This behavior also indicates that if the drone blocks other drones from mating with the queen, it will allow the mating drone to fertilize a greater number of the queen's eggs. If the drone does not remain within the queen and removes itself from her, the drone can reproduce again with slim chances. Finally, the drone will die after mating with the queen within minutes or hours after reproduction is complete.\nDefense.\nAll honey bees live in colonies where the workers sting intruders as a form of defense, and alarmed bees release a pheromone that stimulates the attack response in other bees. The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees.\nThe sting apparatus, including the barbs, may have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of \"Apis cerana japonica\", defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. Asian giant hornet) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level (\"balling\"). Previously, heat alone was thought to be responsible for killing intruding wasps, but recent experiments have demonstrated the increased temperature in combination with increased carbon dioxide levels within the ball produce the lethal effect. This phenomenon is also used to kill a queen perceived as intruding or defective, an action known to beekeepers as 'balling the queen', named for the ball of bees formed.\nDefense can vary based on the habitat of the bee. In the case of those honey bee species with open combs (e.g., \"A.\u00a0dorsata\"), would-be predators are given a warning signal that takes the form of a \"wave\" that spreads as a ripple across a layer of bees densely packed on the surface of the comb when a threat is perceived and consists of bees momentarily arching their bodies and flicking their wings. In cavity dwelling species such as \"Apis cerana\", \"Apis mellifera\", and \"Apis nigrocincta\", entrances to these cavities are guarded and checked for intruders in incoming traffic. Another act of defense against nest invaders, particularly wasps, is \"body shaking\", a violent and pendulum-like swaying of the abdomen, performed by worker bees.\nA 2020 study of \"Apis cerana\" in Vietnam found that they use feces and even human urine to defend their hives against raids by hornets (\"Vespa soror\"), a strategy not replicated by their European and North American counterparts, though collection and use of feces in nest construction is well-known in stingless bees.\nVenom.\nThe stings of honey bees are barbed and therefore embed themselves into the sting site, and the sting apparatus has its own musculature and ganglion which keep delivering venom even after detachment. The gland which produces the alarm pheromone is also associated with the sting apparatus. The embedded stinger continues to emit additional alarm pheromones after it has torn loose; other defensive workers are thereby attracted to the sting site. The worker dies after the sting becomes lodged and is subsequently torn loose from the bee's abdomen. The honey bee's venom, known as apitoxin, carries several active components, the most abundant of which is melittin, and the most biologically active are enzymes, particularly phospholipase A2.\nHoney bee venom is under laboratory and clinical research for its potential properties and uses in reducing risks for adverse events from bee venom therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, and use as an immunotherapy for protection against allergies from insect stings. Bee venom products are marketed in many countries, but, as of 2018, there are no approved clinical uses for these products which carry various warnings for potential allergic reactions.\nCompetition.\nWith an increasing population of honey bees in specific areas due to beekeeping, Western honey bees (as an invasive species) and native wild bees often have to compete for the limited habitat and food sources available, and Western honey bees may become defensive in response to the seasonal arrival of competition from other colonies, particularly Africanized bees which may be on the offence and defence year round due to their tropical origin.\nCommunication.\nHoney bees are known to communicate through many different chemicals and odors, as is common in insects. They also rely on a sophisticated dance language that conveys information about the distance and direction to a specific location (typically a nutritional source, e.g., flowers or water). The dance language is also used during the process of colony fission, or swarming, when scouts communicate the location and quality of nesting sites.\nThe details of the signalling being used vary from species to species; for example, the two smallest species, \"Apis andreniformis\" and \"A.\u00a0florea\", dance on the upper surface of the comb, which is horizontal (not vertical, as in other species), and worker bees orient the dance in the actual compass direction of the resource to which they are recruiting.\nCarniolan honey bees (\"Apis mellifera carnica\") use their antennae asymmetrically for social interactions, with a strong lateral preference to use their right antennae.\nThere has been speculation as to honey bee consciousness. While honey bees lack the parts of the brain that a human being uses for consciousness like the cerebral cortex or even the cerebrum itself, when those parts of a human brain are damaged, the midbrain seems able to provide a small amount of consciousness. Honey bees have a tiny structure that appears similar to a human midbrain, so if it functions the same way they may be able to achieve a small amount of simple awareness of their bodies.\nSymbolism.\nThe bee was used as a symbol of government by Emperor Napoleon I of France. Both the Hindu \"Atharva Veda\" and the ancient Greeks associated lips anointed with honey with the gift of eloquence and even of prescience. The priestess at Delphi was the \"Delphic Bee\".\nThe \"Quran\" has a Sura (chapter) titled \"The Bee\". It is named after honey bees and contains a comparison of the industry and adaptability of honey bees to the industry of man.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And your Lord inspired the bees: \"Make [your] homes in the mountains, the trees, and in what people construct, and feed from [the flower of] any fruit [you please] and follow the ways your Lord has made easy for you.\" From their bellies comes forth liquid of varying colours, in which there is healing for people. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect.\nIn ancient Egyptian mythology, honey bees were believed to be born from the tears of the Sun god, Ra. Because of their divine origin, they were used to represent the Pharaoh. They were also used as a symbol of Lower Egypt in conjunction with the sedge, which represented Upper Egypt.\nIn Joseph and Asenath, a work composed by ancient Egyptian Jews who may have been affiliated with the Leontopolis temple, bee and honey imagery appears when Asenath converts and is visited by an angel. If the work was indeed connected to the Leontopolis temple, the bees likely represent Levite priests, and the imagery intends to signify the legitimacy of a Jewish temple in Egypt.\nA community of honey bees has often been employed by political theorists as a model of human society, from Aristotle and Plato to Virgil. Honey bees, signifying immortality and resurrection, were royal emblems of the Merovingians. The U.S. state of Utah is called the \"Beehive State\", the state emblem is the beehive, the state insect is the honey bee, and a beehive and the word \"industry\" appear on both the state flag and seal.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Each county serves as the local level of Alabama government within its borders. The land enclosed by the present state borders was joined to the United States of America gradually. Following the American Revolutionary War, West Florida was ceded to Spain by treaty while the remainder was organized primarily as the Mississippi Territory, and later the Alabama Territory. The territorial assembly established some of the earliest county divisions that have survived to the present, including the earliest county formation, that of Washington County, created on June 4, 1800. In 1814, the Treaty of Fort Jackson opened the territory to American settlers, which in turn led to a more rapid rate of county creation. Alabama was admitted to the Union as the 22nd state in 1819. The Alabama state legislature formed additional counties from former native lands as the Indian Removal Act took effect and settlers populated different areas of Alabama. In 1820, Alabama had 29 counties. By 1830 there were 36 and Native Americans still occupied large areas of land in northeast and far western Alabama. By 1840, 49 counties had been created; 52 by 1850; 65 by 1870; and the present 67 counties by 1903. Houston County was the last county created in the state, on February 9, 1903.\nAccording to 2024 U.S. Census data, the average population of Alabama's 67 counties is 76,981, with Jefferson County as the most populous (664,744), and Greene County (7,127) the least. The average land area is 756 sq mi (1,958\u00a0km2). The largest county is Baldwin (1,590 sq mi, 4,118\u00a0km2) and the smallest is Etowah (535 sq mi, 1,386\u00a0km2). The Constitution of Alabama requires that any new county in Alabama cover at least in area, effectively limiting the creation of new counties in the state.\nThe Alabama Department of Revenue's Motor Vehicle Division issues standard automobile license plates that bear a one- or two-digit number identifying the county in which the vehicle is registered. This number is given in the fourth column in the table below. The first three prefixes are reserved for the state's historically most populous counties, and thereafter proceed alphabetically. Individual license plate numbers are assigned sequentially in each licensing office. The numbers are in the format \"XAA1111\" or \"XXAA111\", depending on whether the prefix is one or two digits. Overflow registrations are accommodated by substituting a letter for one of the registration numbers, such that XXZ999Z is followed by XXA0A0A.\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry.

{"id": "58264", "revid": "3138265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58264", "title": "Fig wasp", "text": "Group of mostly pollinating insects whose larvae live in figs\nFig wasps are wasps of the superfamily Chalcidoidea which spend their larval stage inside fig syconia. Some are pollinators but others simply feed off the plant. The non-pollinators belong to several groups within the superfamily Chalcidoidea, while the pollinators are in the family Agaonidae. Pollinating fig wasps are all gall-makers, while non-pollinating fig wasps either make their own galls or usurp the galls of other fig wasps. The lifestyles of these fig wasps rely on the fruit of fig trees to reproduce, with pollinating fig wasps acting as mutualists, and non-pollinating fig wasps as parasitoids.\nHistory.\nAristotle recorded in his \"History of Animals\" that the fruits of the wild fig (the caprifig) contain \"psenes\" (fig wasps); these begin life as grubs (larvae), and the adult \"psen\" splits its \"skin\" (pupa) and flies out of the fig to find and enter a cultivated fig, saving it from dropping. He believed that the \"psen\" was generated spontaneously; he did not recognise that the fig was reproducing sexually and that the \"psen\" was assisting in that process.\nTaxonomy.\nThe fig wasps are a polyphyletic group, including several lineages whose similarities are based upon their shared association with figs. In 2022, family Agaonidae was updated to include only the pollinating fig wasps under a single monophyletic clade. Other fig wasps are now included in the families Epichrysomallidae, Eurytomidae, Melanosomellidae, Ormyridae, Pteromalidae, and Torymidae. Non-pollinating fig wasps represent a much more diverse taxon, distantly related from their pollinating cousins.\nMorphological adaptations.\nIn the Agaonidae, the female (as in most Hymenoptera) has four wings, whereas the males are wingless. The primary functions of agaonid males are to mate with the females while still within the fig syconium (inverted flower) and to chew a hole for the females to escape from the fig interior. This is the reverse of sex-linked functions in Strepsiptera and bagworms, where the male has wings and the female never leaves the host.\nThe non-pollinating fig wasps have developed several impressive morphological adaptations in order to oviposit eggs within the fig syconium. Many species have extremely long ovipositors, so that they can deposit eggs from the outside of the syconium (Subtribe Sycoryctina of Otitesellini and Subfamily Sycophaginae). Others have evolved to enter the syconium in the same way as the Agaonidae, and now resemble the pollinators morphologically (Subtribe Sycoecina of Otitesellini). Less is known about the evolution of non-pollinating fig wasps who form different clades from various lineages, each independently colonized the syconium. These wasps work around the mutualistic relationship, exploiting fig fruits as parasitoids.\nMost figs (more than 600 species) have syconia that contain three types of flowers: male, short female, and long female. Female fig wasps can reach the ovaries of short female flowers with their ovipositors, but not long female flowers. Thus, the short female flowers grow wasps, and the long flowers only seeds. Contrary to popular belief, ripe figs are not full of dead wasps and the \"crunchy bits\" in the fruit are only seeds. The fig actually produces an enzyme called ficain (also known as ficin) which digests the dead wasps and the fig absorbs the nutrients to create the ripe fruits and seeds. Several commercial and ornamental varieties of fig are parthenocarpic and do not require pollination to produce (sterile) fruits; these varieties need not be visited by fig wasps to bear fruit.\nLife cycle.\nThe life cycle of the fig wasp is closely intertwined with that of the fig tree it inhabits. The wasps that inhabit a particular tree can be divided into two groups; pollinating and non-pollinating. The pollinating wasps are part of an obligate nursery pollination mutualism with the fig tree, while the non-pollinating wasps feed off the plant without benefiting it. The life cycles of the two groups, however, are similar.\nThough the lives of individual species differ, a typical pollinating fig wasp life cycle is as follows. At the beginning of the cycle, a mated mature female pollinator wasp enters the immature \"fruit\" (actually a stem-like structure known as a syconium) through a small natural opening (the ostiole) and deposits her eggs in the cavity.\nForcing her way through the ostiole, the mated mature female often loses her wings and most of her antennae. To facilitate her passage through the ostiole, the underside of the female's head is covered with short spines that provide purchase on the walls of the ostiole.\nIn depositing her eggs, the female also deposits pollen she picked up from her original host fig. This pollinates some of the female flowers on the inside surface of the fig and allows them to mature. After the female wasp lays her eggs and follows through with pollination, she dies.\nAfter pollination, there are several species of non-pollinating wasps that deposit their eggs before the figs harden. These wasps act as parasites to either the fig or possibly the pollinating wasps.\nAs the fig develops, the wasp eggs hatch and develop into larvae. After going through the pupal stage, the mature male\u2019s first act is to mate with a female - before the female hatches. Consequently, the female will emerge pregnant. The males of many species lack wings and cannot survive outside the fig for a sustained period of time. After mating, a male wasp begins to dig out of the fig, creating a tunnel through which the females escape.\nOnce out of the fig, the male wasps quickly die. The females find their way out, picking up pollen as they do. They then fly to another tree of the same species, where they deposit their eggs and allow the cycle to begin again.\nCoevolution.\nThe fig\u2013wasp mutualism originated between 70 and 90 million years ago as the product of a unique evolutionary event. Since then, cocladogenesis and coadaptation on a coarse scale between wasp genera and fig sections have been demonstrated by both morphological and molecular studies. This illustrates the tendency towards coradiation of figs and wasps. Such strict cospeciation should result in identical phylogenetic trees for the two lineages and recent work mapping fig sections onto molecular phylogenies of wasp genera and performing statistical comparisons has provided strong evidence for cospeciation at that scale.\nGroups of genetically well-defined pollinator wasp species coevolve in association with groups of genetically poorly defined figs. The constant hybridization of the figs promotes the constant evolution of new pollinator wasp species. Host switching and pollinator host sharing may contribute to the incredible diversity of figs and fig wasp species like \"Pegoscapus\" as they result in hybridization and introgression\".\"\nConservation.\nConservation efforts aim to control the populations often times targeting figs and fig wasps separately in order to develop strategies that are distinct for each species. Because many of these mutualist interactions are species specific it makes it difficult for conservationists to focus on the group at large, rather tackling individual populations with high concern. There is already heavily studied control mechanisms in figs that control for wasp populations. The current focus in the field is the conservation of fig wasp species as the role of pollinators is steadily declining with climate change. Because many of these species have coevolved together through generations the main aim of conservation strategies is that protection of one species in the mutualism in turn affects the other, so by developing strategies to protect threatened wasp populations, the species of fig associated with it will also be impacted.\nMany figs are also keystone species in their environment, being food sources and homes for a wide range of species. Fig wasps are obligate mutualists with their respective fig species, not being able to survive without each other. The loss of a pollinator wasp would result in the decline of a fig species, resulting in the general decline in the habitat. These reasons are why fig wasps have become a main focus among conservationists with the aim of protecting crucial keystone fig species.\nGenera.\nFig wasp genera and classification:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMuseum collections.\nOne of the world's major fig wasp collections resides in Leeds Museums and Galleries' Discovery Centre, and was collected by Dr. Steve Compton.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The origin of the county boundaries goes back to their former court districts.\nPolitics and government.\nEach county elects a legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as the \"County Council\", and in Kent County as the \"Levy Court\"). The counties are able to raise taxes and borrow money. They also have control over garbage disposal, water supply, sewerage, zoning, development, and building codes.\nMost functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states\u2014such as court and law enforcement\u2014have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s. However, the hundreds now serve no administrative role; their only current official legal use is in real-estate title descriptions.\nHistory.\nFollowing the English conquest of 1664, all of the land on the western side of the Delaware River and Delaware Bay was governed as part of the New York Colony and administered from the town of New Castle. During the brief recapture of the colony by the Dutch in 1673, additional court districts were created around Upland and Whorekill. The latter was also known as Hoornkill, and is now the town of Lewes. The court at New Castle was left with the central portion of the colony. The jurisdiction left to the court at became New Castle County, and the county seat remained at New Castle until 1881 when it was moved to Wilmington. In 1680, Whorekill District was divided into Deale County and St. Jones County. After this division, Lewes became the county seat of Deale, which was later renamed \"Sussex County\". The former Upland District was named after the New Sweden settlement of Upland, and was renamed Chester County in 1682. Chester County is now located within the present boundaries of Pennsylvania.\nLord Baltimore, the Proprietor of Maryland, claimed all present-day Delaware, and organized its northern and eastern portions as Durham County, Maryland. However, this county existed only on paper. The southern and western portions of present-day Sussex County were organized as portions of several adjacent Maryland counties and were not recognized as part of Delaware until the Mason-Dixon Survey was run in 1767. In 1791, with the expansion of Sussex County to the south and west, the county seat was moved to Georgetown. The county seat of St. Jones (renamed \"Kent County\" in 1681) is at Dover.\nAfter 2000, a fourth \"Appoquinimink County\" was proposed to be carved out of New Castle County. The effort intended to end the zoning restrictions of the Unified Development Code on the undeveloped farmland.\nCounty list.\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry.

It typically includes only the core concepts and the main relationships among them. This is a high-level model with insufficient detail to build a complete, functional database. It describes the structure of the whole database for a group of users. The conceptual model is also known as the data model that can be used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented. It hides the internal details of physical storage and targets the description of entities, datatypes, relationships and constraints.\nOverview.\nA conceptual schema is a map of concepts and their relationships used for databases. This describes the semantics of an organization and represents a series of assertions about its nature. Specifically, it describes the things of significance to an organization (\"entity classes\"), about which it is inclined to collect information, and their characteristics (\"attributes\") and the associations between pairs of those things of significance (\"relationships\").\nBecause a conceptual schema represents the semantics of an organization, and not a database design, it may exist on various levels of abstraction. The original ANSI four-schema architecture began with the set of \"external schemata\" that each represents one person's view of the world around him or her. These are consolidated into a single \"conceptual schema\" that is the superset of all of those external views. A data model can be as concrete as each person's perspective, but this tends to make it inflexible. If that person's world changes, the model must change. Conceptual data models take a more abstract perspective, identifying the fundamental things, of which the things an individual deals with are just examples.\nThe model does allow for what is called inheritance in object oriented terms. The set of instances of an entity class may be subdivided into entity classes in their own right. Thus, each instance of a \"sub-type\" entity class is also an instance of the entity class's \"super-type\". Each instance of the super-type entity class, then is also an instance of one of the sub-type entity classes.\nSuper-type/sub-type relationships may be \"exclusive\" or not. A methodology may require that each instance of a super-type may \"only\" be an instance of \"one\" sub-type. Similarly, a super-type/sub-type relationship may be \"exhaustive\" or not. It is exhaustive if the methodology requires that each instance of a super-type \"must be\" an instance of a sub-type. A sub-type named \"Other\" is often necessary.\nData structure diagram.\nA data structure diagram (DSD) is a data model or diagram used to describe conceptual data models by providing graphical notations which document entities and their relationships, and the constraints that bind them.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58268", "revid": "40727880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58268", "title": "Sydney, Nova Scotia", "text": "Sydney is a former city and urban community on the east coast of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada within the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British, was incorporated as a city in 1904, and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional municipality.\nSydney served as Cape Breton Island's colonial capital until 1820, when the colony merged with Nova Scotia and the capital moved to Halifax.\nA rapid population expansion occurred just after the turn of the 20th century, when Sydney became home to one of North America's main steel mills. During both the First and Second World Wars, it was a major staging area for England-bound convoys. The post-war period witnessed a major decline in the number of people employed at the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation steel mill, and the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments had to nationalize it in 1967 to save the region's biggest employer, forming the new crown corporation called the Sydney Steel Corporation. The city's population has steadily decreased since the early 1970s due to the plant's fortunes, and SYSCO was finally closed in 2001. Today, the main industries are in customer support call centres and tourism. Together with Sydney Mines, North Sydney, New Waterford, and Glace Bay, Sydney forms the region traditionally referred to as Industrial Cape Breton.\nHistory.\nEarly history 1700s to 1899.\nPrior to a permanent settlement being established, there was significant activity along the shore. \nDuring the American Revolution, on 1 November 1776, John Paul Jones \u2013 the father of the American Navy \u2013 set sail in command of \"Alfred\" to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the coal mines in eastern Cape Breton. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of the \"Mellish\", a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for John Burgoyne's troops in Canada.\nA few years into the war (1781) there was a naval engagement between two French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River, Cape Breton. The convoy, which consisted of 18 merchant vessels, including nine colliers and four supply ships, was bound for Spanish River on Cape Breton Island to pick up coal for delivery to Halifax. The British convoy escorts suffered considerable damage with one ship, \"Jack\" captured. The French ships also suffered damage. In the end the convoy was still able to load coal and transport it to Halifax. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.\nSydney was founded after the war by Colonel Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres, and named in honour of Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, who was serving as the Home Secretary in the British cabinet. Lord Sydney appointed Col. DesBarres lieutenant-governor of the new colony of Cape Breton Island. In November 1784 the 600-ton ship \"Blenheim\" landed a group that consisted primarily of English citizens and disbanded soldiers. A group of Loyalists from the state of New York (which included David Mathews, the former mayor of New York City under the British), fleeing the aftermath of the American Revolution, were added to the immigrants upon their arrival in the neighbouring colony of Nova Scotia. DesBarres arrived at Sydney on 7 January 1785. He held the first meeting of his executive council on 21 February 1785, where he was proclaimed lieutenant-governor in a formal manner and the first minutes of the new colony were taken. The site DesBarres chose for the new settlement was along the Southwest Arm of Sydney Harbour, a drowned valley of the Sydney River, which forms part of Spanish Bay. Between 1784 and 1820, Sydney was the capital of the British colony of Cape Breton Island. The vice regal residence was located to the east of military grounds along DesBarres Street (and since re-developed as a residential area). The colony was disbanded and merged with neighbouring Nova Scotia as part of the British government's desire to develop the abundant coal fields surrounding Sydney Harbour; the leases being held by the Duke of York. In 1826, the leases were transferred to the General Mining Association and industrial development around Sydney began to take shape.\nSydney was incorporated as a town in 1885.\nSteel city 1900\u20131945.\nBy the early 20th century Sydney became home to one of the world's largest steel plants, fed by the numerous coal mines in the area under the ownership of the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation. Sydney's economy was a significant part of Industrial Cape Breton with its steel plant and harbour and railway connections adjoining the coal mining towns of Glace Bay, New Waterford, Sydney Mines and Reserve Mines. The economic boom brought about by industrialization saw the community incorporate as a city in 1904. The growth continued until the 1930s, with the Great Depression causing a slowdown in production and growth. World War II brought prosperity again for the plant, and the coal mines.\nSydney Harbour played an important role during World War II. Once a Royal Canadian Navy base, , was established to stage supply convoys bound for Europe. These convoys tended to be slower and had the prefix SC for Slow Convoy. Convoy SC 7 typified the dangers inherent with the Nazi U-boats off the coast of Cape Breton and Newfoundland during the Battle of the Atlantic, when 20 of the 35 merchant cargo vessels were sunk on their journey to England. Sydney Harbour was one of the hotspots of the Battle of the St. Lawrence. Two notable shipping attacks occurred during this battle: the sinking of the train ferry in October 1942 on its way from North Sydney to Port aux Basques, Newfoundland; and the sinking of the Sydney-based HMCS \"Shawinigan\" on 24 November 1944 in the Cabot Strait, near Cape North, on Cape Breton Island. Sydney's coal shipping and steel manufacturing made a significant contribution to the Allied war effort, however federal Minister of Industry, C. D. Howe favoured Central Canada's steel industry given its proximity to a larger workforce and less exposure to coastal attack.\nPost-war years 1950\u20132014.\nBy the late 1960s the coal and steel industries had fallen on hard times. Friday, 13 October 1967, became known as \"Black Friday\", so named after Hawker Siddeley Canada, the plant's owners, announced they were closing it in April 1968. Both the provincial and federal government were involved in negotiating with the steel plant's owners, when Cape Breton's citizens held the largest protest in the city's history on 19 November 1967: \"The Parade of Concern.\" Around 20,000 people marched about a mile from the plant's gates to a horse racetrack to show their support for the steel plant. Newly appointed Nova Scotia premier G.I. Smith and federal Health Minister, and Cape Breton MP, Allan J. MacEachen spoke to the crowd and assured them that their respective governments were going to help. Four days later the Smith government announced that they were taking over the plant starting in 1968.\nBoth the steel and coal industries continued under government ownership for the rest of the 20th century. By the early 1990s, both industries were in trouble again, and were permanently closed by the end of 2001.\nForced to diversify its economy after the closures of the steel plant and coal industries, Sydney has examined a variety of economic development possibilities including tourism and culture, light manufacturing and information technology. Cleaning up the former steel plant, and the toxic Sydney Tar Ponds it left behind in Muggah's Creek, were a source of controversy due to its health effects on residents, although it has provided some employment since SYSCO closed. The tar pond cleanup was completed in 2013 with the opening of Open Hearth Park, which sits on the direct site of the former steel plant and has hosted events such as an Aerosmith concert in September 2014.\nGeography.\nSydney is on the east bank of the Sydney River where it discharges into South Arm of Sydney Harbour. Elevation ranges from sea level to above sea level.\nThe majority of properties within the former city limits have been impacted by development and an extensive urban road network. The central business district is located on a peninsula extending into South Arm formed by Sydney River on the west side and Muggah Creek on the east side. The largest park within the former city limits is Open Hearth Park.\nDistinctive neighbourhoods include Whitney Pier in the north east end next to the former steel plant site, Ashby in the east end, Hardwood Hill in the south end and the \"North End\" located on the peninsula which contains the Holy Angels convent and the Sydney Garrison known as Victoria Park, headquarters of the Cape Breton Highlanders reserve infantry regiment. The former city completely encircles the Membertou First Nation (First Nations Reserve 28A and 28B).\nClimate.\nSydney experiences a cool summer, and windy, wet and stormy winter, version of a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfb\") that is significantly moderated by the community's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The highest temperature ever recorded in Sydney was on 18 August 1935. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 31 January 1873, 29 January 1877 and 15 February 1916.\nDue to the relatively strong influence from large bodies of water, Sydney experiences strong seasonal lag, meaning February is the year's coldest month on average, and August is the year's warmest month on average. By contrast, in most continental climates in the Northern Hemisphere, January is the coldest month, July the warmest.\nIn other respects, too, Sydney's climate varies significantly from that of other areas with humid continental climates. The most significant variations are that Sydney experiences unusually cool summers, and relatively windy, wet and stormy winters, relative to other humid-continental areas such as in the interior of North America. Annual temperatures are instead rather similar to areas around the Baltic Sea in north-eastern Europe at much higher latitudes, although Sydney's seasonal lag is stronger. Although Sydney has some maritime influence, similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic have significantly milder climates in all seasons except summer. Sydney is in the direct path of fall and winter storms (in the U.S., called nor'easters) migrating from the U.S. Northeastern and New England states; these storms can attain tremendous intensity by the time they approach Sydney, with high winds, heavy snow, ice and/or rain events common, primarily from October to February. Summer thunderstorms are rare in Sydney, because nearby bodies of cool water sharply inhibit the combination of heat and humidity that fuels summer-season thunderstorms elsewhere (for example, the United States' central and southeastern states, and east-central and northern China). In recent years, possibly due to a warming climate, this has changed. In 2013 and 2016 Sydney was under a tornado watch as a result of unusually powerful thunderstorms. On 8 August 2014, a funnel cloud appeared near the Sydney Airport although no tornado warning or tornado watch was issued and the funnel did not actually touch down.\nWhile occasional thunderstorms and other rains can occur in summer, June through August are Sydney's driest months on average. Sydney's average annual precipitation cycle reflects these realities; the year's driest month, on average, is July; its wettest month, on average, is December. Average annual precipitation in Sydney is 1481.4\u00a0mm, virtually the highest found anywhere in Canada outside coastal British Columbia. Snowfall is heavy, averaging 281.1\u00a0cm per winter season. However, winter-season storms are variable, and can bring changing precipitation types, commonly from ice/snow to rain and possibly back to ice/snow. As such, actual snow accumulation is variable. A winter storm can bring accumulating snow, followed by heavy rain, then a brief return to snow or ice, resulting in no or minimal additional snow accumulation. Overall, Sydney's climate is moderately cold and strikingly variable, wet, stormy and windy from fall to early spring (October to March), and more stable and drier in summer (June to August).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStatistics Canada classifies Sydney as a medium population centre, which for census purposes includes the neighbouring communities of Westmount, a significant portion of Sydney River, and other portions of the former Cape Breton County. The 2011 population of the Sydney census area, was 31,597, making it the largest population centre on Cape Breton Island.\nEconomy.\nSydney suffered an economic decline for several decades in the later part of the 20th century as local coal and steel industries underwent significant changes. The closure of the Sydney Steel Corporation's steel mill and the Cape Breton Development Corporation's coal mines in 2000\u20132001 have resulted in attempts by the municipal, provincial and federal governments to diversify the area economy.\nAt the start of the 21st century, Sydney faced a significant challenge in the cleanup of the Sydney Tar Ponds, a tidal estuary contaminated with a variety of coal-based wastes from coke ovens that supplied the steel industry. After extensive public consultation and technical study, a $400 million CAD cleanup plan jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments has been completed and the Open Hearth Park opened in its place.\nIn one part of Whitney Pier, residents of Frederick St. discovered contamination within several homes and in surrounding soil, including a toxic orange substance oozing into local basements. Testing of the substance lasted over a year and many were outraged by delays, although some residents were subsequently relocated to a safer residential area nearby.\nHigh unemployment and lack of opportunities have resulted in many educated young people leaving the community for jobs in other parts of Canada and the US. Demographic changes, including an aging population and decrease in the birth rate, have affected the area's economic outlook. Specifically, many residents have opted to seek work in Alberta and Ontario.\nSydney's economy was buoyed by the 2011 announcement of funding for the Sydney Harbour dredging project, which was completed in 2012. The dredge, which is expected to lead to commercialization of the port, is purported to create hundreds of jobs in the area, and position Sydney as a world-class harbour facility. Other important investments that have helped position Sydney as an eastern hub of Nova Scotia include the twinning of Highway 125 and the creation of the Centre for Sustainability in the Environment at nearby Cape Breton University, which draws hundreds of international students each year.\nTourism.\nCape Breton Island has become home to a significant tourism industry, with Sydney (as the island's largest urban centre) being a prime beneficiary. With its economy being dominated by the steel industry until the early 2000s, Sydney had been overlooked as a tourist destination, with the more centrally located scenic village of Baddeck being a preferred location for tourists transiting the Cabot Trail. However, Sydney has witnessed a revival as a result of significant government investment in cruise ship facilities and a waterfront revitalization plan which has seen a boardwalk and marinas constructed, and the world's largest fiddle. This funding is part of the post-industrial adjustment package offered by the federal and provincial governments.\nSydney's tourism draw is increasingly linked to its cultural asset as being the urban heart of Cape Breton Island. Its population is a diverse mixture of nationalities which contributes to various Scottish, Acadian, African Canadian and eastern European cultural events being held throughout the year. Sydney's accommodation sector is centrally located to attractions in Louisbourg (home of the Fortress of Louisbourg), Glace Bay (home of the Glace Bay Miners Museum), Baddeck (home of the Alexander Graham Bell Museum), as well as popular touring destinations such as the Cabot Trail, Cape Breton Highlands National Park, and Bras d'Or Lake.\nArts and culture.\nMusic.\nThe annual Celtic Colours International Festival is held throughout Cape Breton Island in October, with some of the concerts taking place in Sydney.\nSydney was selected to host the 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016 ECMA Galas.\nSports.\nSemi-professional hockey has a long tradition in Sydney. In December 1912, a group formed a professional hockey club to challenge for the Stanley Cup. The short-lived Sydney Millionaires, who received that nickname because the players were the highest paid in the Maritimes, won the 1913 Maritime Professional Hockey League championship. Their victory allowed them to challenge the Quebec Bulldogs, the then current cup holder, in Quebec City. On 10 March 1913, the Millionaires lost the second and final game of the Stanley Cup, and folded shortly thereafter.\nFrom 1988 to 1996, Sydney was home to the Cape Breton Oilers of the American Hockey League, the primary farm team of the National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers. They won that league's championship, the Calder Cup, in 1993. The franchise moved to Hamilton, Ontario, after the 1995\u201396 season, becoming the Hamilton Bulldogs.\nFounded in 1997, the Cape Breton Eagles of the QMJHL play their home games at Centre 200. Eagles alumni include three-time Stanley Cup champion Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury.\nThe Cape Breton Highlanders of the National Basketball League of Canada played from 2016 to 2019.\nSydney hosted events for the 1987 Canada Winter Games, held throughout Cape Breton County.\nThe 2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships were co-hosted by Sydney and Halifax.\nTennis has a long history in Sydney. The Sydney Lawn Tennis Club (now the Cromarty Tennis Club) was incorporated by an Act of the Nova Scotia Legislature on 28 April 1893. The Cape Breton Junior Regionals, Masters Championships, and the Cape Breton Open tennis tournaments are held annually.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nSydney is served by Highway 125 which connects to Highway 105 and encircles the former city limits to its eastern terminus. Trunk 4 forms an important secondary road in Sydney running along the Sydney River, connecting to Glace Bay. Trunk 22, connecting to Louisbourg, and Trunk 28, connecting Whitney Pier through to New Waterford, form minor secondary roads.\nPublic transportation.\nTransit Cape Breton is owned and operated by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and provides bus services in the eastern part of the municipality, which includes Sydney.\nTransit Cape Breton also operates \"Handi-Trans\" for passengers whose disabilities restrict them from using regular bus services.\nTransit fares are $1.25 per zone travelled, or $1.00 for seniors 55 &amp; up and children 5\u201312. Depending on the number of zones travelled, the cost of riding the bus can range from $1.00 to $5.00.\nRail.\nSydney is home to two private freight railway companies. The Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway makes Sydney its eastern terminus and provides rail connections to CN in Truro via Port Hawkesbury. The Sydney Coal Railway connects a bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier with the Lingan Generating Station in Lingan. Daily passenger rail service was provided by Via Rail Canada until budget cuts on 15 January 1990. A weekly tourist train, the \"Bras d'Or\" was operated by Via Rail Canada from 2000 to 2004 until being discontinued.\nSea.\nSydney's port facilities include the privately owned bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier as well as the publicly owned Sydney Marine Terminal at the northern edge of the central business district. A recently opened cruise ship pavilion welcomes several dozen cruise ships every year, with the majority visiting in late summer or early fall to take in fall foliage tours. Other port facilities on Sydney Harbour are located outside the former city limits in Point Edward (Sydport) and North Sydney (Marine Atlantic ferry terminal).\nAirport.\nThe JA Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport is located several kilometres outside the former city limits in the neighbouring community of Reserve Mines. The regional airport is served by Air Canada and Pascan Aviation.\nOccasionally, travellers intending to go to Sydney, Australia mistakenly arrived in Sydney, Nova Scotia. This mistake is usually due to confusion of the two destinations in flight ticket bookings.\nHealth care.\nThe Cape Breton Regional Hospital is located in Sydney.\nEducation.\nSydney is part of the Cape Breton \u2013 Victoria Regional School Board and is home to one public English language secondary school: Sydney Academy, which is linked to several elementary and intermediate schools. Holy Angels, a female-only Catholic high school founded in the late 1800s, closed at the end of the 2011 school year. A French language school, \u00c9toile de l'Acadie, is also located in Sydney and is part of the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial school board.\nIn 1951, the original campus of what became Cape Breton University was founded as the Xavier Junior College, affiliated with St. Francis Xavier University and was located in Sydney.\nSydney also has other post secondary and private career colleges, including the Cape Breton Business College founded in 1958 and the Canadian Coast Guard College founded in 1965.\nIn 2024, Nova Scotia Community College opened a 305,000 sq. ft. waterfront campus.\nMedia.\nSydney is the island's largest commercial centre and home to the \"Cape Breton Post\" daily newspaper, as well as one television station, CJCB-TV, a member of the CTV Television Network. CJCB was the first television station in Nova Scotia, going on air on 9 October 1954. It was also the eastern terminus of the original country-wide microwave network that went live on 1 July 1958, with the Canada's first coast to coast television broadcast. From its beginnings until 1972, CJCB-TV was the area's CBC affiliate.\nSydney's first radio station was CJCB-AM, founded by Nate Nathanson, and went on the air on 14 February 1929. The Nathanson family would go on to open an FM radio station in 1957, CJCB-FM, and the above-mentioned television station. CBC began operating its own station, CBI (AM), in November 1948. It was part of the CBC's Trans-Canada Network, while CJCB became a CBC affiliate for its Dominion Network. In 1962, the CBC combined the two networks, making CBI the only CBC station, and CJCB became an independent. In 1978, the CBC opened CBI-FM, which belonged to the CBC Stereo network. Since 1997, CBI-AM belongs to CBC Radio One and CBI-FM belongs to CBC Music. In addition to the CBC and CJCB stations, there are other FM radio stations serving the area, most coming into the market in the early 21st century.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
