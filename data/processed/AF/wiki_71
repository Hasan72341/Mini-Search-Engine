Due to its location, several battles were fought in its vicinity. The Hebrew Bible gives the valley its name from Ayalon, a city that the Tribe of Dan possessed before their migration to the north. In the modern period, ancient Ayalon was identified with the former village of Yalo at the base of the Bethoron pass, which preserved the ancient, biblical name.\nToday, the Ayalon Valley is home to several \"kibbutzim\" and \"moshavim\", including Sha'alvim, Mishmar Ayalon, Nahshon, and Kfar Bin Nun. The valley is also home to Canada Park, a national park, the Yad La-Shiryon (Armored Corps Museum), Mini Israel, the Latrun Monastery and Emmaus Nicopolis, an archeological site commonly identified with Emmaus of the New Testament.\nHistory.\nLate Bronze Age.\nEgyptian period.\nIn the Tell el-Amarna letters, written during the last twelve years of Pharaoh Akhenaten and the first regnal year of Tutankhamun (14th century BCE), Abdi-Heba speaks of the destruction of the \"city of Ajalon\" by the invaders, and describes himself as \"afflicted, greatly afflicted\" by the calamities that had come on the land, urging the king of Egypt to hasten to his help. This event may have been connected to an attack of the Amorites, before the arrival of the Israelites under Joshua. But since the valley stretches as far to the west as to a point halfway between Sha'alvim and Latrun, the city referenced in these letters may have been any settlement in the valley.\nIron Age.\nIn the 10th century BCE, Ajalon is mentioned in the accounts of an invasion of Canaan by the Egyptian king Sheshonk I.\nKingdom of Judah.\nAfter the kingdom divided, Ajalon became the boundary between the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Rehoboam, the first king of Judah, fortified the city of Aijalon, supplying officers, weapons and food provisions ().\nThe Bible.\nJoshua's battle.\nThe Valley of Ayalon was first mentioned in the \"Book of Joshua\" as where Joshua defeated five Amorite kings. Following his midnight march to rescue the city of Gibeon from the coalition led by the King of Jebus (Jerusalem), Joshua pursued the coalition eastward, down through the descent of Beth-horon, and then southward across the Valley of Ajalon. To allow the Israelites to complete the rout before nightfall, Joshua asked the Lord to lengthen the day by uttering the command: \"Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon\". records that God cooperated with Joshua's request.\nTribe of Dan.\nFollowing the conquest, the city of Ajalon was apportioned to the Tribe of Dan () and was designated as one of the Levitical cities given to the Kohathites ( and ). In spite of Joshua's initial victory in the Valley of Ajalon, the Amorites continued to live in the city of Ajalon (). Constant Philistine pressure to control the valleys of the Shephelah forced the tribe of Dan to retreat westward, reducing the extent of their territory. Eventually, the Danites abandoned their initial inheritance in the Aijalon area and moved to the extreme northern part of Israel, settling in the city of Laish, which they renamed Dan ().\nThe location was also the site of a great victory over the Philistines by King Saul and his son Jonathan. After a daring attack by Jonathan on the Philistine garrison at Michmash, they pursued the Philistines to Aijalon, a distance of fifteen miles (). In later years, Aijalon was inhabited by Ephraimites and Benjamites ( and ).\nIdentification.\nAjalon's identification with Yalo was made by Edward Robinson during his travels in Palestine in 1838. Using the works of Jerome and Eusebius of Caesarea, who describe Aijalon as being two Roman miles from Nicopolis, while also drawing upon descriptions of Aijalon in the Old Testament and noting the philological similarities between the Arabic name and its Hebrew root, Robinson concluded that the Yalo was indeed Aijalon.\nSites.\nCanada Park, Yad La-Shiryon, the International Center for the Study of Bird Migration and the Latrun Monastery are located in the Ayalon Valley.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was sometimes used as a call to arms in the stage directions of Elizabethan dramas. The term comes from the Italian \"all'armi\" and appears 89 times in Shakespeare's First Folio. Often explained as the off-stage sounds of conflict or disturbance, recent research suggests a bell or drum may have been used to rouse soldiers from sleep.\nHistory and development.\nEarly alarm devices were often bells, drums, other musical instruments, or any items which made unusual loud noises that attracted the attention of the surrounding population.\nWhistles were used by police in the 19th century. Steam whistles have been used on locomotives, ships, and in factories as alarm devices.\nWith the advent of electricity, a variety of other alerting devices have been invented, such as buzzers, klaxons, sirens, horns, flashing and coloured lights, and other all-purpose alarms.\nAlarm devices can be fitted to buildings as well as vehicles. Many buildings are fitted with fire alarms, ranging from a self-contained domestic smoke detector to a sophisticated alarm system that can operate building fire fighting systems automatically to extinguish fires with water or inert gases.\nMany industries have developed standards for alarm devices, and the colours red, blue and amber are generally recognized as alarm device-related colours, with flashing lights often indicating urgent conditions.\nResponses to an alarm.\nHuman reactions to an alarm will often depend on upbringing, psychological training, or the behavior of others in the environment. Consequently, the ability to test an alarm and hold regular drills to practice an appropriate response may be provided as part of an alarm system.\nAlarm devices that are intended to cause the evacuation of an occupied building, such as fire alarms, may be deliberately designed to make remaining in the space difficult or even painful in order to encourage occupants to leave.\nSome alarms may startle and cause a fight-or-flight response in humans; a person under this mindset will panic and either flee the perceived danger or attempt to eliminate it, often ignoring rational thought in either case. A person in such a state can be characterized as \"alarmed\".\nFalse alarms.\nWith any kind of alarm, you must balance between the danger of false alarms (called \"false positives\") \u2014 the signal going off in the absence of a problem \u2014 or an alarm failing to signal an actual problem (called a \"false negative\"). False alarms can waste resources expensively and can even be dangerous. For example, false alarms of a fire can waste firefighter manpower, making them unavailable for a real fire, and risk injury to firefighters and others as the fire engines race to the alleged fire's location. In addition, false alarms may acclimatise people to ignore alarm signals, and thus possibly to ignore an actual emergency: Aesop's fable of \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\" exemplifies this problem.\nA false alarm is one of the most significant issues with conventional alarm systems. They can be triggered for several reasons, such as the movement of pets, typing in the wrong security codes, or loud sounds from windows or doors. In the case of fire alarms, aerosol sprays, smoking, or burning food can all lead to a false alarm.\nMany avoid the risk of false alarms by ensuring their alarms are secured in an appropriate location, such as placing a smoke detector or fire alarm away from the kitchen where smoke from burned food or large quantities of steam which may trigger a false alarm are common occurrences. In the case of a security alarm, an additional monitoring station which assesses whether there is a legitimate need for help can reduce false alarms.\nDevices.\nThere are many kinds of alarm devices. The most common types include: \nAlarm devices, by category, include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Providing alms is often considered an act of charity. The act of providing alms is called almsgiving.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"alms\" comes from the Old English ', ', which comes from Late Latin ', from Greek ' (\"pity, alms\"), from , ' (\"merciful\"), from , ', meaning \"pity or mercy\".\nBuddhism.\n\"D\u0101na\" in Buddhism.\nIn Buddhism, both \"almsgiving\" and \"giving\" are called \"d\u0101na\" (P\u0101li). Such giving is one of the three elements of the path of practice as formulated by the Buddha for laypeople. This path of practice for laypeople is d\u0101na, s\u012bla, and bh\u0101van\u0101.\nGenerosity towards other sentient beings is also emphasized in Mahayana as one of the perfections (paramita). As shown in Lama Tsong Khapa's 'The Abbreviated Points of the Graded Path' ( Wylie: \"lam-rim bsdus-don\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe giving of alms is the beginning of one's journey to Nirvana (). In practice, one can give anything with or without thought for Nibbana. This would lead to faith (), one key power () that one should generate within oneself for the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.\nAccording to the Pali canon:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of all gifts [alms], the gift of Dhamma is the highest.\u2014\u200a\nIntentions for giving.\nThe intentions behind giving play an important role in developing spiritual qualities. The suttas record various motives for exercising generosity. For example, the Anguttara Nikaya (A.iv, 236) enumerates the following eight motives:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn support of Buddhist monks.\nIn Buddhism, alms or almsgiving is the respect given by a lay Buddhist to a Buddhist monk, nun, spiritually-developed person or other sentient being. It is not charity as presumed by Western interpreters. It is closer to a symbolic connection to the spiritual realm and to show humbleness and respect in the presence of the secular society. The act of almsgiving connects the human to the monk or nun and what he/she represents. As the Buddha has stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nIn Theravada Buddhism, nuns (P\u0101li: \"bhikkhunis\") and monks (P\u0101li: \"bhikkhus\") practice \"Takuhatsu\" (') where they collect food ('). This is often perceived as allowing the laypeople to make merit (P\u0101li: \"pu\u00f1\u00f1a\"). Money cannot be accepted by a Theravadan Buddhist monk or nun in place of or in addition to food, as the Patimokkha training rules make it an offense worth forfeiture and confession.\nIn countries that follow Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of \"Takuhatsu\" has mostly died out. In China, Korea, and Japan, local cultures resisted the idea of giving food to 'begging' clerics, and there was no tradition of gaining 'merit' by donating to practitioners. After periods of persecution, monasteries were situated in remote mountain areas; the distance between the monastery and the nearest towns made this practice impossible. In Japan, the practice of a weekly or monthly Takuhatsu replaced the daily round. In the Himalayan countries, the large number of \"bhikkhus\" would have made an alms round a heavy burden on families. Competition with other religions for support also made daily practice difficult and even dangerous; the first Buddhist monks in the Silla dynasty of Korea were said to be beaten due to their minority at the time.\nChristianity.\nIn Christianity, the giving of alms is viewed as an act of charity. In the Apostolic age, Christians were taught that giving alms was an expression of love. Such care for the poor was to be understood as love for God, who, in the person of Jesus Christ, sacrificed himself for the salvation of believers.\nIn nearly all Christian denominations, money is donated to support the church's financial needs and its ministry to the less fortunate. In some churches, the alms are placed near to the altar to symbolize that the offering belongs to God and to represent the unity of the congregation.\nIn Western Christianity.\nThe offertory is the traditional moment in the Roman Catholic Mass, Lutheran Divine Service, and Anglican Eucharist, when alms are collected. Baptists and Methodists, among other denominations, collect tithes and offerings (alms) during the offertory in church services. A tithe, the first tenth of one's income, is seen as what is owed to God, while an offering (alms) includes anything contributed beyond that. Some fellowships practice regular giving for special purposes called \"love offerings\" for the poor, destitute or victims of catastrophic loss such as home fires or medical expenses. Traditionally, deacons and deaconesses are responsible for distributing these gifts among widows, orphans, and others in need. Many Christians support a plethora of charitable organizations, not all of which claim a Christian religious affiliation. Many American educational and medical institutions were founded by Christian fellowships giving alms.\nFor Roman Catholics, alm is a \"mandatory\" work of mercy.\nIn Eastern Christianity.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the collection of alms and tithes has not been formally united to the offertory in any liturgical action. However, either having a collection plate in the narthex or passing it unobtrusively during the service is not uncommon. In Eastern Orthodox theology, almsgiving is an important part of the spiritual life, and fasting should always be accompanied by increased prayer and almsgiving. Almsgiving in the name of the deceased also frequently accompanies prayer for the dead. Those whose financial circumstances do not permit the giving of monetary alms may give alms in other ways, such as intercessory prayer and acts of mercy such as visiting people in prison, clothing the poor or volunteering in soup kitchens.\nIn the New Testament.\nIn addition, private acts of charity are a duty and considered virtuous only if not done for others to admire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' in front of others, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.\nJesus places the primary focus on the motives behind the outward and inward giving of alms, which should be love:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rather, give as alms what is inside, and then everything will be clean for you!\nJesus contrasts the giving of the rich and the poor:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury. And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins. And He said, 'Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them; for they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on.'\nGiving should be out of love and not out of duty:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'\nSharing possessions was practised in the church:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;..there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles\u2019 feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need. Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means \"son of encouragement\"), sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles\u2019 feet.\nHinduism.\n\"D\u0101na\" in Hinduism.\nIn Hinduism, ' () is an ancient concept of almsgiving dating to the Vedic period of Hinduism. ' has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return. While \"\" is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, which is sometimes called \"utsarga\". This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, investing in drinking water or an irrigation well, planting trees, and building care facilities, among others. The practice of begging for alms is called \"bhiksha\" ().\nThe 11th century Persian historian Ab\u016b Ray\u1e25\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, who visited and lived in India for 16 years beginning in about 1017 CE, mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, \"It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;After the taxes, there are different opinions on how to spend their income. Some destine one-ninth of it for alms. Others divide this income (after taxes) into four portions. One fourth is destined for common expenses, the second for liberal works of a noble mind, the third for alms, and the fourth for being kept in reserve.\nAlmsgiving in Hinduism is considered a noble deed to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity. Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the reciprocity principle. Other Hindu texts, such as \"Vyasa Samhita\", state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but d\u0101na is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives. The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. ' is thus a dharmic act, requires an idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context. Some medieval era authors state that ' is best done with \"\u015braddh\u0101\" (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without \"anasuya\" (finding faults in the recipient). Kohler states that these scholars of Hinduism suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of \"unquestioning hospitality\", where the \"d\u0101na\" ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long-term view.\nInstitutional \"d\u0101na\".\n\"Satrams\", also called \"Dharamsala\" or \"Chathrams\" in parts of India, have been one means of almsgiving in Hinduism. \"Satrams\" are shelters (rest houses) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major Hindu temple sites in south Asia, as well as near major temples. Hindu temples have also served as institutions for almsgiving. The \"d\u0101na\" the temples received from Hindus were used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.\nForms of \"d\u0101na\".\nForms of almsgiving in Hinduism include:\nBetween giving food and giving knowledge, Hindu texts suggest the gift of knowledge is superior.\nIn the Vedas.\nThe Rigveda has the earliest discussion of \"\" in the Vedas and offers reasons for the virtue of almsgiving.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the Upanishads.\nThe early Upanishads, those composed before 500 BCE, discuss the virtue of almsgiving. For example, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states in verse 5.2.3 that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (\"dama\"), compassion or love for all sentient life (\"daya\"), and charity (\"\"). Chandogya Upanishad, similarly, states in Book III that a virtuous life requires \"tapas\" (meditation, asceticism), \"d\u0101na\" (charity), \"arjava\" (straightforwardness, non-hypocrisy), \"ahimsa\" (non-violence, non-injury to all sentient beings) and \"satyavacana\" (truthfulness).\nIn Mahabharata and Puranas.\nBhagavad Gita describes the right and wrong forms of in verses 17.20 through 17.22. The \"Adi Parva\" of the Hindu Epic \"Mahabharata\" states in Chapter 91 that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes. In the \"Vana Parva\", Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must \"conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty\".\nThe \"Bhagavata Purana\" discusses when is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36, it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one's biological dependents or of one's own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the Puranas.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, the concept of Muhsi or Muhsin alms-giver or charitable giving is generally divided into voluntary giving, \"\u1e63adaqah\" (), and an obligatory practice, the \"zak\u0101h\" (). \"Zak\u0101h\" is governed by a specific set of rules within Islamic jurisprudence and is intended to fulfill a well-defined set of theological and social requirements. \"\u1e62adaqah\" is possibly a better translation of Christian influenced formulations of the notion of \"alms\" for that reason, though \"zak\u0101h\" plays a much larger role within Islamic charity.\n\"Zakat\".\n\"Zak\u0101h\" is the third of the five pillars of Islam. The literal meaning of the word \"zak\u0101h\" is \"to purify\", \"to develop\" and \"cause to grow\". \"Zak\u0101h\" is the amount of money that every Muslim, male or female, who is an adult, mentally stable, free, and financially able, has to pay to support specific categories of people. According to \"shariah\", it is an act of worship. Possessions are purified by setting aside a proportion for those in need. This cutting back, like the pruning of plants, balances and encourages new growth. Various rules are attached but, in general terms, it is obligatory to give 2.5% of one's savings and business revenue and 5\u201310% of one's harvest to the poor. Possible recipients include the destitute, the working poor, those who are unable to pay off their own debts, stranded travelers and others who need assistance, with the general principle of \"zakat\" always being that the rich should pay it to the poor. One of the most important principles of Islam is that all things belong to God and wealth is therefore held by human beings in trust.\nThis category of people is defined in At-Tawbah:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them, and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the captives and the debtors, and for the cause of Allah, and (for) the wayfarers; a duty imposed by Allah. Allah is knower, Wise.\"\u2014\u200a\nThe obligatory nature of \"zakat\" is firmly established in the Qur'an, the \"sunnah\" (or \"hadith\"), and the consensus of the companions and the Muslim scholars. Allah states in At-Tawbah:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites, who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder (them) from the way of Allah. And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah. announce unto them a most grievous penalty \u2013 On the Day when heat will be produced out of that (wealth) in the fire of Hell, and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs.- \"This is the (treasure) which ye buried for yourselves: taste ye, then, the (treasures) ye buried!\"\u2014\u200a\nMuslims of each era have agreed upon the obligatory nature of paying \"zakat\" from their gold and silver, and from other kinds of currency.\n\"Nisab\".\n\"Zakat\" is obligatory when a certain amount of money, called the \"nisab\" (or minimum amount), is reached or exceeded. Zakat is not obligatory if the amount owned is less than this \"nisab\". The \"nisab\" of gold and golden currency is 20 \"mithqal\", or approximately 85\u00a0grams of pure gold. One \"mithqal\" is approximately 4.25\u00a0grams. The \"nisab\" of silver and silver currency is 200 dirhams, which is approximately 595\u00a0grams of pure silver. The \"nisab\" of other kinds of money and currency is to be scaled to that of gold; the \"nisab\" of money is equivalent to the price of 85\u00a0grams of 999-type (pure) gold on the day in which \"zakat\" is paid.\n\"Zakat\" is obligatory after the money has been in the control of its owner for the span of one lunar year; a lunar year is approximately 355 days. The owner then needs to pay 2.5% (or 1/40) of the money as \"zakat\". The owner should deduct any amount of money he or she borrowed from others, check if the rest reaches the necessary \"nisab\", then pay \"zakat\" for it.\nIf the owner had enough money to satisfy the \"nisab\" at the beginning of the year, but his wealth in any form increased, the owner needs to add the increase to the \"nisab\" amount owned at the beginning of the year and then pay \"zakat\", 2.5%, of the total at the end of the lunar year. There are minor differences between \"fiqh\" schools on how this is to be calculated. Each Muslim calculates his or her own \"zakat\" individually. For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half percent of one's capital.\n\"Sadaqah\".\nA pious person may also give alms as much as he or she pleases as \"\u1e63adaqah\", and does so preferably in secret. Although this word can be translated as 'voluntary charity', it has a wider meaning, as illustrated in the hadiths:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Messenger of Allah said: \"Every good is charity. Indeed among the good is to meet your brother with a smiling face, and to pour what is left in your bucket into the vessel of your brother.\"\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Prophet said: \"Charity is a necessity for every Muslim.\" He was asked: \"What if a person has nothing?\" The Prophet replied: \"He should work with his own hands for his benefit and then give something out of such earnings in charity.\" The Companions asked: \"What if he is not able to work?\"\nThe Prophet said: \"He should help poor and needy persons.\" The Companions further asked \"What if he cannot do even that?\" The Prophet said \"He should urge others to do good.\" The Companions said \"What if he lacks that also?\" The Prophet said \"He should check himself from doing evil. That is also charity.\"\u2014\u200a\nJudaism.\n\"Tzedakah\".\nIn Judaism, \"tzedakah\", a Hebrew term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify \"charity\", refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just. In the Greek Septuagint \"tzedakah\" was sometimes translated as , \"almsgiving\".\nIn Judaism, \"tzedakah\" is seen as one of the greatest deeds that a person can do. \"Tzedakah\", along with prayer and repentance, is regarded as ameliorating the consequences of bad acts. Contemporary \"tzedakah\" is regarded as a continuation of the Biblical \"Maaser Ani\", or poor-tithe, as well as Biblical practices including permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field, harvest during the \"Shmita\" (sabbatical year), and other practices. Jewish farmers are commanded to leave the corners of their fields for the starving to harvest for food and are forbidden to pick up any grain that has been dropped during harvesting, as such food shall be left for the starving as well.\nIn the Mishneh Torah, Chapter 10:7\u201314, Maimonides lists eight \"laws about giving to poor people\" (\"\"), listed in order from most to least righteous, with the most righteous form being allowing an individual to become self-sustaining and capable of giving others charity:\nMandaeism.\n\"Zidqa\".\nIn Mandaeism, \"zidqa\" refers to alms or almsgiving. Mandaean priests receive regular financial contributions from laypeople.\nThe Mandaic term \"zidqa brika\" (literally \"blessed oblation\") refers to a ritual meal blessed by priests. An early self-appellation for Mandaeans is \"bhiri zidqa\", meaning \"elect of righteousness\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Altars are found at shrines, temples, churches, and other places of worship. They are used particularly in Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and modern paganism. Many historical-medieval faiths also made use of them, including the Roman, Greek, and Norse religions.\nEtymology.\nThe modern English word \"altar\" was derived from Middle English \"altar\", from Old English \"alter\", taken from Latin \"altare\" (\"altar\"), probably related to \"adolere\" (\"burn\"); thus \"burning place\", influenced by \"altus\" (\"high\"). It displaced the native Old English word \"w\u0113ofod\".\nAltars in antiquity.\nIn antiquity, altars were used for making sacrifices to deities; this could include both libations and animal sacrifice. \nIn Ancient Roman religion, altars were often inscribed with the donor's name and the deity to whom the altar was dedicated. One of the most important surviving Roman altars is the Ara Pacis, dedicated by Augustus Caesar at the beginning of the Pax Romana to the goddess of peace, Pax.\nJudaism.\nAltars in the Hebrew Bible were typically made of earth or unwrought stone. Altars were generally erected in conspicuous places. The first altar recorded in the Hebrew Bible is that erected by Noah. Altars were erected by Abraham, by Isaac, by Jacob, and by Moses.\nAfter the theophany on Mount Sinai, in the Tabernacle\u2014and afterwards in the Temple\u2014only two altars were used: The Altar of Burnt Offering, and the Altar of Incense, both near where the Ark of the Covenant was located.\nThe remains of three rock-hewn altars were discovered in the Land of Israel: one below Tel Zorah, another at the foot of Sebastia (ancient Samaria), and a third near Shiloh.\nChristianity.\nThe word \"altar\", in Greek (\"see\":), appears twenty-four times in the New Testament. In Catholic and Orthodox Christian theology, the Eucharist is a re-presentation, in the literal sense of the one sacrifice of Christ on the cross being made \"present again\". Hence, the table upon which the Eucharist is consecrated is called an altar.\nThe altar plays a central role in the celebration of the Eucharist, which takes place at the altar on which the bread and the wine for consecration are placed. Altars occupy a prominent place in most Christian churches, both Eastern and Western branches. Commonly among these churches, altars are placed for permanent use within designated places of communal worship (often called \"sanctuaries\"). Less often, though nonetheless notable, altars are set in spaces occupied less regularly, such as outdoors in nature, in cemeteries, in mausoleums/crypts, and family dwellings. Personal altars are those placed in a private bedroom, closet, or other space usually occupied by one person. They are used for practices of piety intended for one person (often referred to as a \"private devotion\"). They are also found in a minority of Protestant worship places; in Reformed and Anabaptist churches, a table, often called a \"Communion table\", serves an analogous function.\nThe area around the altar is seen as endowed with greater holiness, and is usually physically distinguished from the rest of the church, whether by a permanent structure such as an iconostasis, a rood screen, altar rails, a curtain that can be closed at more solemn moments of the liturgy (as in the Armenian Apostolic Church and Armenian Catholic Church), or simply by the general architectural layout. The altar is often on a higher elevation than the rest of the church.\nChurches generally have a single altar, although in the Western branches of Christianity, as a result of the former abandonment of concelebration of Mass, so that priests always celebrated Mass individually, larger churches have had one or more side chapels, each with its own altar. The main altar was also referred to as the \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;high altar\". Since the revival of concelebration in the West, the Roman Missal recommends that in new churches there should be only one altar, \"which in the gathering of the faithful will signify the one Christ and the one Eucharist of the Church.\" This does not exclude altars in distinct side chapels, however, but only separate altars in the main body of the church. But most Western churches of an earlier period, whether Roman Catholic or Anglican, may have a high altar in the main body of the church, with one or more adjoining chapels, each with its own altar, at which the Eucharist may be celebrated on weekdays.\nArchitecturally, there are two types of altars: Those that are attached to the eastern wall of the chancel, and those that are free-standing and can be walked around, for instance when incensing the altar.\nIn the earliest days of the Church, the Eucharist appears to have been celebrated on portable altars set up for the purpose. Some historians hold that, during the persecutions, the Eucharist was celebrated among the tombs in the Catacombs of Rome, using the sarcophagi of martyrs as altars on which to celebrate. Other historians dispute this, but it is thought to be the origin of the tradition of placing relics beneath the altar.\nWhen Christianity was legalized under Constantine the Great and Licinius, formal church buildings were built in great numbers, normally with free-standing altars in the middle of the sanctuary, which in all the earliest churches built in Rome was at the west end of the church. \"When Christians in fourth-century Rome could first freely begin to build churches, they customarily located the sanctuary towards the west end of the building in imitation of the sanctuary of the Jerusalem Temple. Although in the days of the Jerusalem Temple the High Priest indeed faced east when sacrificing on Yom Kippur, the sanctuary within which he stood was located at the western end of the Temple. The Christian replication of the layout and the orientation of the Jerusalem Temple helped to dramatize the eschatological meaning attached to the sacrificial death of Jesus the High Priest in the Epistle to the Hebrews.\" The ministers (bishop, priests, deacons, subdeacons, acolytes), celebrated the Eucharist facing east, towards the entrance. Some hold that for the central part of the celebration the congregation faced the same way. After the sixth century the contrary orientation prevailed, with the entrance to the west and the altar at the east end. Then the ministers and congregation all faced east during the whole celebration; and in Western Europe altars began, in the Middle Ages, to be permanently placed against the east wall of the chancel.\nIn Western Christian churches.\nMost rubrics, even in books of the seventeenth century and later, such as the Pontificale Romanum, continued to envisage the altar as free-standing. The rite of the Dedication of the Church continued to presume that the officiating bishop could circle the altar during the consecration of the church and its altar. Despite this, with the increase in the size and importance of the reredos, most altars were built against the wall or barely separated from it.\nIn almost all cases, the eastward orientation for prayer was maintained, whether the altar was at the west end of the church, as in all the earliest churches in Rome, in which case the priest celebrating Mass faced the congregation and the church entrance, or whether it was at the east end of the church, in which case the priest faced the eastern apse and had his back to the congregation. This diversity was recognized in the rubrics of the Roman Missal from the 1604 typical edition of Pope Clement VIII to the 1962 edition of Pope John XXIII: \"\"\nWhen placed close to a wall or touching it, altars were often surmounted by a reredos or altarpiece. If free-standing, they could be placed, as also in Eastern Christianity, within a ciborium (sometimes called a baldachin).\nThe rules regarding the present-day form of the Roman Rite liturgy declare a free-standing main altar to be \"desirable wherever possible\". Similarly, in the Anglican Communion, the rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer assumed an altar fixed against the wall, until Prayer Book revision in the twentieth century removed language which assumed any particular form of altar.\nAs well as altars in the structural sense, it became customary in the West to have what in Latin were referred to as (portable altars), more commonly referred to in English as altar stones. When travelling, a priest could take one with him and place it on an ordinary table for saying Mass. They were also inserted into the centre of structural altars especially those made of wood. In that case, it was the altar stone that was considered liturgically to be the altar. The Pontificale Romanum contained a rite for blessing at the same time several of these altar stones. In the East the antimension served and continues to serve the same purpose.\nThe term \"movable altar\" or \"portable altar\" is now used of a full-scale structural altar, with or without an inserted altar stone, that can be moved.(298)\nMovable altars include the free-standing wooden tables without altar stone, placed in the choir away from the east wall, favoured by churches in the Reformed tradition. Altars that not only can be moved but are repeatedly moved are found in low church traditions that do not focus worship on the Eucharist, celebrating it rarely. Both Catholics and Protestants celebrate the Eucharist at such altars outside of churches and chapels, as outdoors or in an auditorium.\nCatholic Church.\nThe Eastern Catholic Churches each follow their own traditions, which in general correspond to those of similar Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox Churches. All Christian Churches see the altar on which the Eucharist is offered as the \"table of the Lord\" () mentioned by Saint Paul. The rules indicated here are those of the Latin Church.\nThe Latin Church distinguishes between fixed altars (those attached to the floor) and movable altars (those that can be displaced), and states: \"It is desirable that in every church there be a fixed altar, since this more clearly and permanently signifies Christ Jesus, the Living Stone. In other places set aside for sacred celebrations, the altar may be movable.\"(298)\nA fixed altar should in general be topped by a slab of natural stone, thus conforming to tradition and to the significance attributed to the altar, but in many places dignified, well-crafted solid wood is permitted; the supports or base of a fixed altar may be of any dignified solid material. A movable altar may be of any noble solid material suitable for liturgical use.(301)\nThe liturgical norms state:\nIt is fitting that the tradition of the Roman liturgy should be preserved of placing relics of martyrs or other saints beneath the altar. However, the following should be noted:\n(a) Relics intended for deposition should be large enough that they can be recognized as parts of human bodies. Hence excessively small relics of one or more saints must not be deposited.\n(b) The greatest care must be taken to determine whether relics intended for deposition are authentic. It is better for an altar to be dedicated without relics than to have relics of doubtful credibility placed beneath it.\n(c) A reliquary must not be placed on the altar, or in the table of the altar; it must be beneath the table of the altar, as the design of the altar may allow.\nThis last norm explicitly excludes the practice customary in recent centuries of inserting relics into a specially created cavity within the table of an altar or altar stone. Placing of relics even in the base of a movable altar is also excluded.\n\"In building new churches, it is preferable for a single altar to be erected, one that in the gathering of the faithful will signify the one Christ and the one Eucharist of the Church. In already existing churches, however, when the old altar is so positioned that it makes the people's participation difficult but cannot be moved without damage to artistic value, another fixed altar, skillfully made and properly dedicated, should be erected and the sacred rites celebrated on it alone. In order that the attention of the faithful not be distracted from the new altar the old altar should not be decorated in any special way.\"(303)\nThe altar, fixed or movable, should as a rule be separate from the wall so as to make it easy to walk around it and to celebrate Mass at it facing the people. It should be positioned so as to be the natural centre of attention of the whole congregation.(299)\nThe altar should be covered by at least one white cloth, and nothing else should be placed upon the altar table other than what is required for the liturgical celebration. Candlesticks and a crucifix, when required, can be either on the altar or near it, and it is desirable that the crucifix remain even outside of liturgical celebrations.(304-308)\nProtestant churches.\nA wide variety of altars exist in various Protestant denominations. Some Churches, such as the Lutheran, have altars very similar to Anglican or Catholic ones keeping with their more sacramental understanding of the Lord's Supper. Calvinist churches from Reformed, Baptist, Congregational, and Non-denominational backgrounds instead have a Communion Table adorned with a linen cloth, as well as an open Bible and a pair of candlesticks; it is not referred to as an altar because they do not see Holy Communion as sacrificial in any way. Such a table may be temporary: Moved into place only when there is a Communion Service. Some nondenominational churches have no altar or communion table, even if they retain the practice of the \"altar call\" that originated in the Methodist Church.\nSome Methodist and other evangelical churches practice what is referred to as an \"altar call\", whereby those who wish to make a new spiritual commitment to Jesus Christ are invited to come forward publicly.\nIt is so named because the supplicants, at the end of the sermon, kneel at the altar rails, which are located around the altar within chancel.\nThose that come forward will often recite a sinner's prayer, which, in evangelical understanding, if truly heart-felt indicates that they are now \"saved\". They may also be offered religious literature, counselling or other assistance. Many times it is said that those who come forth are going to \"be saved\". This is a ritual in which the supplicant makes a prayer of penitence (asking for his sins to be forgiven) and faith (called in evangelical Christianity \"accepting Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour\").\nLutheran churches.\nAltars in Lutheran churches are often similar to those in Roman Catholic and Anglican churches. Lutherans believe that the altar represents Christ and should only be used to consecrate and distribute the Eucharist. Lutheran altars are commonly made out of granite, but other materials are also used. A crucifix is to be put above the altar. Sometimes relics are also placed around the altar.\nAnglican churches.\nAltars in the Anglican Communion vary widely. In the Book of Common Prayer, the basis of doctrine and practice for the Church of England, there is no use of the specific word \"altar\"; the item in question is called the \"Lord's Table\" or \"Holy Table\". This remains the official terminology, though common usage may call the communion table an altar.\nAt the time of the Reformation, altars were fixed against the east end of the church, and the priests would celebrate the Mass standing at the front of the altar. Beginning with the rubrics of the Second Prayer Book of Edward VI published in 1552, and through the 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\" (which prevailed for almost 300\u00a0years and is still in occasional use), the priest is directed to stand \"at the north syde of the Table\". This was variously interpreted over the years to mean the north side of the front of a fixed communion table, the north end of a fixed table (i.e., facing south), the north side of a free-standing table (presumably facing those intending to receive the Elements who would be sitting in the quire stalls opposite), or at the north end of a free-standing table lengthwise in the chancel, facing a congregation seated in the nave.\nOften, where a celebrant chose to situate himself was meant to convey his churchmanship (that is, more Reformed or more Catholic). The use of candles or tabernacles was banned by canon law, with the only appointed adornment being a white linen cloth.\nBeginning with the Oxford Movement in the 19th century, the appearance of Anglican altars took a dramatic turn in many churches. Candles and, in some cases, tabernacles were re\u2011introduced. In some churches two candles, on each end of the altar, were used; in other cases six\u2014three on either side of a tabernacle, typically surmounted by a crucifix or some other image of Christ. When a stone altar was placed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge after rebuilding works in 1841, a case was brought in the Court of Arches which resulted in an order to remove it and replace it with a wooden communion table.\nIn Anglican practice, conformity to a given standard depends on the ecclesiastical province and/or the liturgical sensibilities of a given parish. In the \"Parson's Handbook\", an influential manual for priests popular in the early-to-mid-twentieth century, Percy Dearmer recommends that \"All altars should be 3\u00a0ft. 3\u00a0in. high, and \"at least\" deep enough to take a corporal [the square of linen placed underneath the Communion vessels] 20\u00a0in. square, with an inch or two to spare.\" He also recommends that the altar stand upon three steps for each of the three sacred ministers, and that it be decorated with a silk frontal in the seasonal colour. In some cases, other manuals suggest that a stone be set in the top of wooden altars, in the belief that the custom be maintained of consecrating the bread and wine on a stone surface. In many other Anglican parishes, the custom is considerably less rigorous, especially in those parishes which use free-standing altars. Typically, these altars are made of wood, and may or may not have a solid front, which may or may not be ornamented. In many Anglican parishes, the use of frontals has persisted.\nWhen altars are placed away from the wall of the chancel allowing a westward orientation, only two candles are placed on either end of it, since six would obscure the liturgical action, undermining the intent of a westward orientation (i.e., that it be visible to the congregation). In such an arrangement, a tabernacle may stand to one side of or behind the altar, or an aumbry may be used.\nSensibilities concerning the sanctity of the altar are widespread in Anglicanism. In some parishes, the notion that the surface of the altar should only be touched by those in holy orders is maintained. In others, there is considerably less strictness about the communion table. Nonetheless, the continued popularity of communion rails in Anglican church construction suggests that a sense of the sanctity of the altar and its surrounding area persists. In most cases, moreover, the practice of allowing only those items that have been blessed to be placed on the altar is maintained (that is, the linen cloth, candles, missal, and the Eucharistic vessels).\nEastern Christian Rites.\nByzantine Rite.\nIn Greek, the word \u03b2\u03c9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 () can mean an altar of any religion or, in a broader sense, the area surrounding it; that is to say, the entire sanctuary. In an Eastern Orthodox or a Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic church this sanctuary includes both the area behind the iconostasis, and the soleas (the elevated projection in front of the iconostasis), and the ambo. It is also called the \"\u03b2\u1fc6\u03bc\u03b1\" (bema). When one enters the sanctuary, one is said to be going into the or . The altar itself in such a church may be referred to as either the \u201cHoly Table\u201d (Greek: ) or the \u201cThrone\u201d (Church Slavonic: ).\nFor both Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Eastern Catholics, the Holy Table (altar) is normally free-standing, although in very small sanctuaries it might be flush against the back wall for reasons of space. They are typically about one meter high, and may be made of stone or more often, wood. The exact dimensions may vary, but it is generally square in plan and of reasonable proportion with respect to the size of the sanctuary. It has five legs: one at each corner plus a central pillar for holding the relics placed within it at its consecration.A plain linen covering (Greek: , Slavonic: ) is bound to the Holy Table with cords; this is never removed once the altar is consecrated, and is considered to be its \u201cbaptismal garment\u201d. The linen covering symbolizes the winding sheet which wrapped the body of Christ he was laid in the tomb. Since the altar is therefore never seen uncovered after this, it tends to be constructed more with sturdiness than aesthetics in mind. Above this first linen cover is a second, ornamented altar cloth (), often of a brocade in the liturgical color reflecting the feast or changing ecclesiastical season. This outer covering usually reaches the floor and represents the glory of God\u2019s Throne. Many churches place a dust cover on the Holy Table between use, and it is often a simple red cloth or richer material. Sometimes, the cloth covers only the Gospel Book or the front half of the Holy Table, but it may be large enough to cover the entire Holy Table and items on it, including liturgical candlesticks and the seven-branched candelabra.\nAtop the altar is the tabernacle (), a miniature shrine sometimes built in the form of a church, inside of which is a small ark containing the reserved sacrament for use in communing the sick. Also kept on the altar is the Gospel Book, under which is the \"antimension,\" a silken cloth imprinted with an icon of Christ being prepared for burial, with a relic sewn into it and the signature of the bishop. The Divine Liturgy must be served on an antimension, even if the altar is consecrated and contains relics. A simpler cloth called the is wrapped around the antimension to protect it, and symbolizes the \u201cnapkin\u201d tied around the face of Jesus when he was laid in the tomb (thus a companion to the ). When not in use, the antimension is left in the center of the Holy Table, and is never removed unless necessary.\nThe Holy Table may only be touched by ordained members of the higher clergy and nothing unconsecrated nor the object of veneration should be placed on it. Objects may also be placed on the altar as part of setting them aside for sacred use. For example, icons are usually blessed by laying them on the Holy Table for a period of time or for a certain number of Divine Liturgies before sprinkling them with holy water, and enshrining them wherever they will be venerated. The \"Epitaphios\" on Good Friday, and the Cross on the Feasts of the Cross, are also placed on the Holy Table before they are taken to the center of the church to be venerated by the faithful.\nIn place of a fabric outer covering, some altars have a permanent, solid cover which may be highly ornamented, richly carved, or even plated in precious metals. A smaller brocade cover is placed on this if the colour of the altar decoration is meant to reflect the liturgical season.\nThe Holy Table is the place for offering the Eucharist, where bread and wine are offered to God the Father and the Holy Spirit is invoked to make his Son Jesus Christ present in the Gifts. It is also where presiding clergy stand at any service, even when no Eucharist is being celebrated and no offering is made other than prayer. When the priest reads the Gospel during Matins (or an All-Night Vigil) on Sunday, he reads it standing in front of the Holy Table, because it represents the Tomb of Christ, and the Gospel lessons for Sunday Matins are always one of the Resurrection appearances of Jesus.\nOn the northern side of the sanctuary stands another, smaller altar, known as the Table of Oblation ( or ) at which the Liturgy of Preparation takes place. On it are prepared the bread and wine before the Divine Liturgy. The Prothesis symbolizes the cave at Bethlehem and also the Anointing Stone at which the Body of Christ was prepared after the Deposition from the Cross. A new Table of Oblation is also blessed, sprinkled with holy water, and vested at the consecration of a church, but no relics placed within. Nothing other than sacred vessels, veils, etc. used in the Liturgy of Preparation may be placed on the Table of Oblation. The Epitaphios and Cross are also placed on the Table of Oblation before the priest and deacon solemnly transfer these to the Holy Table. In addition to higher clergy, subdeacons are permitted to touch the Table of Oblation, but no one of lesser rank may do so. This is where a deacon will consume any remaining Gifts (Body and Blood of Christ) after the Divine Liturgy and perform the ablutions.\nSyro-Maronite Church.\nThe Syriac Maronite Church and other Syriac Churches have freestanding altars in most cases, so priests and deacons can circumambulate these with processions and incensations. Traditionally, the Maronite liturgy was offered with the priest and people facing East, but because of modern Liturgical Latinisation, it is common for Maronite liturgies to be offered with the priest on the other side of the altar and facing the people, in imitation of modern practices in the Latin Church.\nOriental Rites.\nArmenian Rite.\nIn the Armenian Rite the altar is placed against the eastern wall of the church, often in an apse. The shape of the altar is usually rectangular, similar to Latin altars, but is unusual in that it will normally have several steps on top of the table, on which are placed the tabernacle, candles, ceremonial fans, a cross, and the Gospel Book. The altar is often located upon a kind of stage above a row of icons.\nAlexandrian Rite.\nAltars in the Alexandrian (Coptic Orthodox Church) tradition must have a square face upon which to offer the sacrifice. As the standard Coptic liturgy requires the priest to encircle the altar, it is never attached to any wall. Most Coptic altars are located under a baldachin.\nEthiopic Rite.\nIn Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition an icon is placed upon but towards the rear of the altar. It is away from the wall as in the Coptic tradition.\nWest Syriac Rite.\nIn the West Syriac Tradition, churches have altars in the eastern part of the sanctuary.\nEast Syriac.\nAltars of East Syriac Rite are similar in appearance to Armenian altars only they are not placed on a stage.\nIndian Orthodox.\nThe Indian Orthodox Church or Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church follows the West Syriac rite combined with Indian traditions and culture, commonly referred to as the Malankara Rite and as such follows a tradition of placing the altar towards the eastern side of the sanctuary. Usually, the altars are paced underneath canopies called Beth' qudisho (transl. Holy House), has steps that houses the tabernacle, 3 to 12 candles (symbolising the 12 Apostles of Christ), a cross in the middle and adorned with exemplary decorations in the form of icons, wooden carvings, distinctly patterned fabrics etc. \nThe altar in this tradition is referred to as \"thronose\" (transl. throne) and the sanctuary is called the Madbaha (transl. sanctuary). \nWar altar.\nA war altar was a mobile altar on which Mass was celebrated before a battle. The ultimate example is the carroccio of the medieval Italian city states, which was a four-wheeled mobile shrine pulled by oxen and sporting a flagpole and a bell. The carroccio also served as the army standard.\nAltar stones were used by army chaplains of the Latin Church in the period leading up to the 20th century.\nHinduism.\nIn Hinduism, altars generally contain pictures or statues of deities. Large, ornate altars are found in Hindu temples, while smaller altars are found in homes and sometimes also in Hindu-run shops and restaurants. The word for temple is (), the altar as hypostatised temple.\nIn South Indian temples, often each deity will have a separate shrine, each contained in a miniature house (specifically, a \"mandir\"). These shrines are often scattered around the temple compound, with the three main ones being in the main area. The statue of the deity (murti) is placed on a stone pedestal in the shrine, and one or more lamps are hung in the shrine. There is usually a space to put the puja tray (tray with worship offerings). Directly outside the main shrine, there will be a statue of the deity's vahana or vehicle. The shrines have curtains hung over the entrances, and wooden doors which are shut when the deities are sleeping. Some South Indian temples have one main altar, with several statues placed upon it.\nNorth Indian temples generally have one main altar at the front of the temple room. In some temples, the front of the room is separated with walls and several altars are placed in the alcoves. The statues on the altars are usually in pairs, each deity with their consort (Radha-Krishna, Sita-Rama, Shiva-Parvati). However, some deities, such as Ganesha and Hanuman, are placed alone. Ritual items such as flowers or lamps may be placed on the altar.\nHome shrines can be as simple or as elaborate as the householder can afford. Large, ornate shrines can be purchased in India and countries with large Hindu minorities, like Malaysia and Singapore. They are usually made of wood and have tiled floors for statues to be placed upon. Pictures may be hung on the walls of the shrine. The top of the shrine may have a series of levels, like a gopuram tower on a temple. Each Hindu altar will have at least one oil lamp and may contain a tray with puja equipment as well. Hindus with large houses will set aside one room as their puja room, with the altar at one end of it. Some South Indians also place a shrine with pictures of their departed relatives on the right side of the room, and make offerings to them before making offerings to the gods.\nSee also: Vedi (altar) and Homa (ritual)\nTaoism.\nTaoist altars are erected to honor traditional deities and the spirits of ancestors. Taoist altars may be erected in temples or in private homes. Strict traditions and different sects describe the items offered and the ritual involved in the temples, but folk custom in the homes is much freer.\nImperial dynasties built huge altars called () to perform various offering ceremonies called (). The Temple of Heaven in Beijing is one of those.\nNearly all forms of Chinese traditional religion involve ()--bowing towards an altar, with a stick of incense in one's hand. (Some schools prescribe the use of three sticks of incense in the hand at one time.) This may be done at home, or in a temple, or outdoors; by an ordinary person, or a professional (such as a Taoist priest); and the altar may feature any number of deities or ancestral tablets. is usually done in accordance with certain dates of the lunar/solar calendar (see Chinese calendar).\nAt certain dates, food may be set out as a sacrifice to the gods or spirits of the departed. (See, for example, Qingming Festival and Ghost Festival.) This may include rice, slaughtered pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear\u2014not as a mere image, but as the actual item\u2014in the spirit world, and be available for the departed spirit to use. In Taoist folk religion, sometimes chickens, pigs' feet, and pig heads are given as offerings. But in orthodox Daoist practice, offerings should essentially be incense, candles and vegetarian offerings.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhist-following cultures, structures such as , butsudan, or spirit houses are found in temples or homes. In Japan, the butsudan is a wooden cabinet with doors that enclose and protect a religious image of the Buddha or the Bodhisattvas (typically in the form of a statue) or a mandala scroll, installed in the highest place of honor and centered. The doors are opened to display the image during religious observances. A butsudan usually contains subsidiary religious items\u2014called \"butsugu\"\u2014such as candlesticks, incense burners, bells, and platforms for placing offerings such as fruit. Some sects place \"ihai\", memorial tablets for deceased relatives, within or near the butsudan. Butsudans are often decorated with flowers.\nThe shrine is placed in the temple or home as a place of worship to the Buddha, the Law of the Universe, etc. Scrolls (\"honzon\") or statues are placed in the butsudan and prayed to morning and evening. Zen Buddhists also meditate before the butsudan.\nThe original design for the butsudan began in India, where people built altars as an offering-place to the Buddha. When Buddhism came to China and Korea statues of the Buddha were placed on pedestals or platforms. The Chinese and Koreans built walls and doors around the statues to shield them from the weather and also adapted elements of their respective indigenous religions. They could then safely offer their prayers, incense, etc. to the statue or scroll without it falling and breaking.\nShinto.\nIn Shinto, altars are found in shrines. Originating in ancient times, are temporarily erected sacred spaces or \"altars\" used as a locus of worship. A physical area is demarcated with branches of green bamboo or at the four corners, between which are strung sacred border ropes (). In the center of the area a large branch of festooned with sacred emblems () is erected as a \"yorishiro\", a physical representation of the presence of the kami and toward which rites of worship are performed.\nIn more elaborate cases, a may be constructed by placing a rough straw mat upon the ground, then erecting a ceremonial eight-legged stand () upon the mat, and decorating the stand with a frame festooned with sacred border ropes and sacred border emblems. Finally the branch is erected in the center of this stand as the focus of worship.\nNorse paganism.\nA basic altar, called a , was used for sacrifice in Norse paganism. The was constructed of piled stones, possibly in a wood (harrow), and would be used in sacrifices and perhaps other ceremonies as well.\nA possible use of the during a sacrifice would be to place upon it a bowl of the blood of an animal sacrificed to a Norse deity (e.g. a goat for Thor, a sow for Freyja, a boar for Freyr), then dipping a bundle of fir twigs into it and sprinkling the participants with the blood. This would consecrate the attendees to the ceremony, such as a wedding.\nAsatru.\nIn Nordic Modern Pagan practice, altars may be set up in the home or in wooded areas in imitation of the h\u00f6rgr of ancient times. They may be dedicated to Thor, Odin, or other Nordic deities.\nNeopaganism.\nIn neopaganism there is a wide variety of ritual practice, running the gamut from a very eclectic syncretism to strict polytheistic reconstructionism. Many of these groups make use of altars. Some are constructed merely of rough-hewn or stacked stone, and some are made of fine wood or other finished material.\nNeo-Druidism.\nModern Neo-Druidism may also make use of altars, often erected in groves. Though little is known of the specific religious beliefs and practices presided over by the ancient Druids, modern people who identify themselves as Druids are free to incorporate their imagination in developing ceremonies and the use of ritual objects in keeping with their belief system. The \"Order of Common Worship\" of the Reformed Druids of North America' \"Liturgy of the Druids\" calls for a fire to be started \"in or near the altar\" and makes use of various objects such as a chalice, staves, and a plant offering. If no altar is used, the objects may be placed on the ground.\nHigh places.\nHigh places are elevated areas on which altars have been erected for worship in the belief that, as they were nearer heaven than the plains and valleys, they are more favourable places for prayer. High places were prevalent in almost all ancient cultures as centers of cultic worship.\nHigh places in Israelite (Hebrew: \"Bamah\", or \"Bama\") or Canaanite culture were open-air shrines, usually erected on an elevated site. Prior to the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites in the 12th\u201311th century BCE, the high places served as shrines of the Canaanite fertility deities, the Baals (Lords) and the Asherot (Semitic goddesses). In addition to an altar, \"matzevot\" (stone pillars representing the presence of the divine) were erected.\nThe practice of worship on these spots became frequent among the Hebrews, though after the temple was built it was forbidden. Such worship was with difficulty abolished, though denounced time after time by the prophets as an affront to God. A closely related example is a \"backyard\" altar, so to speak. Before there was a set temple and an established altar people built their own altars. After the temple was built use of these altars was forbidden. Unlike the case of high places, \"backyard\" altar worship was quickly eradicated. In following years, the practice drastically decreased in popularity.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name \"Amalek\" can refer to the nation's founder, a grandson of Esau; his descendants, the Amalekites; or the territories of Amalek, which they inhabited.\nAccording to the Torah, there is a commandment to exterminate the memory of Amalek. However, most Jewish commentators maintain that this commandment is no longer applicable today - either because it could only be fulfilled during the period when there was a king in Israel, or because the biblical Amalek no longer exists, or because the commandment is understood as symbolic, representing the elimination of evil in the world or as a call for God to carry out this act.\nEtymology.\nMost scholars regard the origin of the term, \"Amalek\" to be unknown but in some rabbinical interpretations, it is etymologized as , 'a people who lick (blood)'.\nRichard C. Steiner has suggested that the name is derived from the Egyptian term \"*\ua725\ua723m rqj\" \"hostile Asiatic\", possibly referring to Shasu tribesmen from around Edom.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Amalek was the son of Eliphaz (himself the son of Esau, ancestor of the Edomites and the brother of Israel) and Eliphaz's concubine Timna. Timna was a Horite and sister of Lotan. According to a midrash, Timna was a princess who tried to convert. However, she was rejected by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. She replied she would rather be a handmaiden to the dregs of Israel than be a mistress of another gentile nation. To punish the Patriarchs for their attitudes, God caused Timna to give birth to Amalek, whose descendants would cause Israel much distress. Amalek was also the product of an incestuous union since Eliphaz was Timna's stepfather according to 1 Chronicles 1:36, after he committed adultery with the wife of Seir the Horite, who was Timna's biological father. First-century Roman Jewish scholar and historian Josephus refers to Amalek as a \"bastard\" (); the Hebrew equivalent, mamzer, is a specific category of persons born from a forbidden relationship.\nAmalekites.\nAmalek is described in Genesis 36:16 as the \"chief of Amalek\" among the \"chiefs of the sons of Esau\", from which it is surmised that he ruled a clan or territory named after him. In the oracle of Balaam, Amalek was called the \"first of the nations\". One modern scholar believes this attests to Amalek's high antiquity, while traditional commentator Rashi states: \"He came before all of them to make war with Israel\". The Amalekites () were claimed to be Amalek's descendants through the genealogy of Esau.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the Amalekites inhabited the Negev and Sinai Peninsula. They appear to have lived a nomadic or seminomadic lifestyle along the fringes of southern Canaan's agricultural zone. This is probably based on the association of this tribal group with the steppe region of ancient Israel and the area of Kadesh (Genesis 14:7).\nAs a people, the Amalekites are identified throughout the Hebrew Bible as a recurrent enemy of the Israelites:\nInterpretation.\nJudaism.\nIn the \"Mishneh Torah\", Maimonides derived three commandments, two positive and one negative, related to references to Amalek in the Torah:\nMany rabbinic authorities such as Maimonides ruled that the commandment only applies to a Jewish king or an organized community, and cannot be performed by an individual. According to Rashi, the Amalekites were sorcerers who could transform themselves to resemble animals, in order to avoid capture. Thus, in , it was considered necessary to destroy the livestock when destroying Amalek. According to \"Haggahot Maimuniyyot\", the commandment only applies to the Messianic Age and not present times; medieval authorities widely support this limitation. According to the Midrash, every nation on Earth has a guardian angel overseeing its destiny, except for two: Israel rejected archangel Michael as its guardian, in favor of God himself. The other is Amalek, whose guardian angel is the foremost angel of evil, Satan. The final war will be fought between the children of God and the children of Satan, between good and evil. This is possibly why the 188th commandment exists: to wipe out Amalek completely, male and female, young and old, sparing none, since evil has no future. However, one obscure prophecy states that all nations will eventually worship God alone, which raises the question of how there can be a Third Temple when Amalek is annihilated. The Midrash state there is no quandary, given the last Amalekite is a convert to Judaism.\nMaimonides elaborates that when the Jewish people wage war against Amalek, they must request the Amalekites to accept the Seven Laws of Noah and pay a tax to the Jewish kingdom. If they refuse, they are to be executed.\nThe Zohar interprets the concept of Amalek differently: not as a distinct ethnic nation, but as the evil inclination (\"yetzer hara\") present in every person, which must be eradicated and this interpretation became widespread among Sephardi Jewish commentators.\nOther Talmudic commentators argued that the calls to spare no Amalekite or \"blot out their memory\" were metaphorical and did not require the actual killing of Amalekites. Samson Raphael Hirsch said that the command was to destroy \"the remembrance of Amalek\" rather than actual Amalekites. Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter interpreted the command as thoroughly hating Amalek without performing any physical action. Yisrael Meir Kagan said that God would perform the elimination of Amalek and that Jews only need to remember what Amalek did to them.\nIsaac S.D. Sassoon believes that the \"\u1e25erem\" commands existed to prevent the Jewish community from being endangered but believes people should think twice before literally following them. Nathan Lopes Cardozo argues that the Torah's ethically questionable laws were intentional since they were a result of God working with an underdeveloped world. He believes that God appointed the Chazal to help humanity evolve in their understanding of the Torah.\nChristianity.\nTheologian Charles Ellicott explains that the Amalekites were subject to \"\u1e25erem\" in the Book of Samuel for incapacitation due to their 'accursed' nature and the threat they posed to the commonwealth of surrounding nations. Matthew Henry considers the \"\u1e25erem\" to be defensive warfare since the Amalekites were invaders. John Gill describes the \"\u1e25erem\" as the law of retaliation being carried out.\nAccording to Christian Hofreiter, almost all Christian authorities and theologians have historically interpreted the \"\u1e25erem\" passages literally. He states that \"there is practically no historical evidence that anyone in the Great Church\" viewed them as being purely an allegory. In particular, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin have defended a literal reading of these passages at length. Origen is sometimes cited as having viewed the \"\u1e25erem\" passages allegorically; Hofreiter argues that although Origen prioritized a spiritual interpretation of the Bible, he did not deny that the \"herem\" passages described historical events.\nModern academia.\nSome commentators have discussed the ethics of the commandment to exterminate all the Amalekites, including children, and the presumption of collective punishment. It has also been described as genocidal, according to genocide scholars like Norman Naimark.\nGili Kugler of the University of Haifa argues that the biblical tradition that commands Amalek\u2019s extermination cannot be explained simply by the nation\u2019s actions, since the Hebrew Bible often depicts Amalek in surprisingly neutral terms and does not give a clear justification for their unique fate. Instead, she suggests that the command to annihilate Amalek reflects political, theological, and psychological frameworks within Israelite society. In her view, the portrayal of Amalek developed as a \"mythical enemy\" used to negotiate Israel\u2019s self-understanding: from a political standpoint, the Amalek tradition was employed in struggles over kingship, particularly in shaping the Saul and David narratives; from a theological standpoint, Amalek functioned as Israel\u2019s rejected counterpart, a kin-people portrayed as the \"rejected son\" which ultimately reinforces Israel\u2019s chosenness; and from a psychological standpoint, Amalek served as a scapegoat for the Israelites\u2019 feelings of self-negation as well as their own existential fears of destruction. Kugler thus interprets the Amalek tradition as a projection of \"metaphysical hatred\", where hostility toward Amalek is rooted less in Amalek itself than in Israel\u2019s attempt to define and preserve its identity.\nAccording to Ada Taggar-Cohen of Doshisha University, \"\u1e25erem\" commands were not uncommon in the ancient Near East. These commands had a dual purpose: convey to an enemy that the aggressor's deity was on their side, and that the enemy deserved the deity's wrath as punishment for their \"sins\". They also allowed kings to pursue militarist policies without accepting moral responsibility. C. L. Crouch of Radboud University considers the \"\u1e25erem\" commands to be an exceptional component to Israelite and Judahite warfare. They were erratically applied, even in the early stages of national and ethnic identity formation, and were an extreme means to eradicate the threat of chaos, views shared by Assyrian rulers such as Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal.\nPaul Copan argues that the \"\u1e25erem\" commands were hyperbolic since the passages contain merisms such as \"man and woman\" and Near Easterners valued \"bravado and exaggeration\" when reporting warfare. Kluger believes this is an earnest attempt to absolve the Israelites, and their God, of moral responsibility. Nonetheless, she argues Copan's interpretation still \"normalizes mass violence\" and \"hostility towards targeted groups\". However, scholars such as John H. Walton and Kenneth Kitchen also concluded that such language in the Hebrew Bible was hyperbolic, based on comparisons to the language of other literary cultures.\nHistoricity.\nEgyptian and Assyrian monumental inscriptions and records lack any reference to Amalek or the Amalekites, even though both recorded various tribes and peoples of the Levant. This led archaeologist Hugo Winckler to conclude that the Amalekites and the Biblical stories about them were ahistorical. Although archaeological research has improved knowledge about nomadic Arabs, no specific findings definitively link to Amalek.\nHowever, some scholars propose a connection between Amalekites and certain fortified settlements in the Negev highlands, such as Tel Masos near Beer-sheba, which is possibly equivalent to ancient Hormah. If true, Saul's campaigns against the Amalekites may have been motivated by a strategic desire to control of copper production at Tel Masos, a valuable resource for the early Israelites and their theology and rituals.\nFurther archaeological evidence from sites in the Negev like Tell el-Qudeirat and Horvat Haluqim, dating to the late 11th to early 10th century BC, could corroborate with the Biblical Israelite-Amalekite confrontations during the reigns of Saul and David. Hendrik J. Bruins of Ben Gurion University of the Negev discovered that their inhabitants were semi-nomadic agro-pastoralists who lived in tents, rode camels, traded copper, and worshipped gods at masseboth shrines. Oval fortresses were built during the relevant timeframe. Still, other scholars attribute these settlements to the Edomites or Simeonites.\nAlternative theories of origin.\nIn , the \"field of the Amalekites\" is mentioned, but the person who is named Amalek was not born yet.\nSome commentators claim that this passage is a reference to the territory which was later inhabited by the Amalekites. C. Knight elaborates this concept by making a comparison: one might say \"Caesar went into France\", though Gaul only later became known as France.\nJohn Gill believes the Amalekites of were equivalent to the Hamite-Arabian Amalekites described by Muslim scholars. He argues the Amalekites were always allied with the Canaanites who descended from Ham, were conquered by the Shemite Chedorlaomer, existed before the Edomite Amalekites thus affirming , and that the Edomites never rescued these Amalekites from Saul's campaigns due to inter-tribal feuds.\nBy the 19th century, many Western theologians believed that the nation of Amalek could have flourished before the time of Abraham. Matthew George Easton theorized that the Amalekites were not the descendants of Amalek by taking a literal approach to . However, the modern biblical scholar Gerald L. Mattingly uses textual analysis to glean that the use of \"Amalekite\" in is actually an anachronism, and in the early 19th century, Richard Watson enumerated several speculative reasons for the existence of a \"more ancient Amalek\" than Abraham.\nIn his exegesis of , concerning Balaam's utterance: \"Amalek was the first one of the nations, but his end afterward will be even his perishing\", Richard Watson attempts to associate this passage to the \"first one of the nations\" that developed post-Flood. According to Samuel Cox, the Amalekites were the \"first\" in their hostility toward the Israelites.\nAbrahamic traditions.\nJewish traditions.\nAmalek is the archetypal enemy of the Jews and the symbol of evil in Jewish religion and folklore. Nur Masalha, Elliot Horowitz, and Josef Stern suggest that the Amalekites represent an \"eternally irreconciliable enemy\" that wants to murder Jews. In post-biblical times, Jews associated contemporary enemies with Amalek or Haman and, occasionally, believed pre-emptive violence is acceptable against such enemies. Groups identified with Amalek include the Romans, Nazis, Stalinists, Islamic State, and bellicose Iranian leaders such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. More metaphorically, to some Hasidic rabbis (particularly the Baal Shem Tov), Amalek represents atheism or the cynical rejection of God, which leads to unethical hedonism. This is sometimes known as the \"Amalekite doctrine\". In contemporary times, religious Jews associate Amalek with violent antisemites, nihilism and Jewish doubt in God.\nDuring the Purim festival, the Book of Esther is read in commemoration of the salvation of Jewish people from Haman, who plotted to kill all Jews in Persian Empire. It is customary for the audience to make noise and shout whenever \"Haman\" is mentioned, in order to desecrate his name, based on . It is also customary to recite on the Shabbat before Purim. This was because Haman was considered to be an Amalekite although this label is more likely to be symbolic rather than literal. Some Iranophilic Jews interpreted Haman's Amalekite background as being anathema to both Jews and 'pure-blooded Iranians'.\nIn the past, some Jews associated Amalek with the Roman Empire and medieval Christians.\nRabbis generally agree that Amalek no longer exist as a unified nation, based on the argument that Sennacherib deported and mixed the nations, so it is no longer possible to determine who is an Amalekite. Since the Holocaust, the phrase as it appears in is used as a call to witness. Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the Holocaust, features the phrase on a banner, and in letters between European Jews during the Holocaust, they plead with each other to \"bear witness\".\nChristian traditions.\nEarly Church fathers such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and Cyprian consider the defeat of Amalek in to be reminiscent of Jesus defeating the powers of the devil at the cross. Origen sees the battle as an allegory of the Law mysteriously invoking Christ, who recruits strong people (i.e. Christians) to defeat the demonic Strong Man, as described in .\nJohn Gill believes that Amalek is a type of antichrist that 'raises his hand against the throne of God, his tabernacle and his saints'. He believes the phrase \"from generation to generation\" in specifically refers to the Messianic Age, where Amalek and other antichristian states are exterminated by the Lamb. Likewise, Charles Ellicott notes that the Amalekites were collectively called 'the sinners' in , which was only used elsewhere for the Sodomites in .\nCarl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch state that the Amalekites were extinct by the second half of Hezekiah's reign.\nProfessor Philip Jenkins notes that Christian extremists have historically labelled enemies such as Native Americans, Protestants, Catholics and Tutsis as Amalekites to justify their genocides. Jews and victims of the Crusades were also called Amalekites. Because of this, modern Christian scholars have re-examined the Biblical narratives that inspired these atrocities using philology, literary analysis, archaeology and historical evidence.\nIslamic traditions.\nIslamic commentators believe that the Amalekites were an ancient Arabian tribe. The monotheistic Ishmaelites evangelized to them in Mecca and later, they supplanted their population. However, the paganism of the Amalekites and other Arabian tribes negatively influenced the Ishmaelites, including their approach to the Kaaba.\nIbn Khald\u016bn believed that God ordered Saul, the king of Israel, to depose the Amalekites, which caused Haman's hostility to the Jews in the Book of Esther.\nAdam J. Silverstein observes that most scholars who lived in the medieval Muslim world ignored the Book of Esther or they modified the details of it, despite their familiarity with the Persian Jewish community. This was caused by their attempt to reconcile the Biblical Esther with the Quranic Haman, who was the antagonist of the Exodus narrative, and Persian mythological historical traditions. Notable exceptions include Ibn Khald\u016bn, who affirmed the Amalekite origins of Haman and his antisemitic vendetta.\nHitler as an Amalekite.\nMany have identified Hitler as an Amalekite. According to the Hebrew Bible, Amalek lived in Canaan: \"Amalek dwells in the south land\" (Numbers 13:29). The Israelites were instructed to kill all those who dwelled in Canaan: \"thou shalt save alive nothing that breathes\" (Deuteronomy 19:16) otherwise \"I shall do to you, as I thought to do to them\" (Numbers 33:56). Amalek and Israel were archenemies, their enmity originating from the Battle of Refidim, where the Amalekites targeted and killed weak Israelites. As a result, God decreed Amalek to be obliterated \"from beneath the heavens\" (Deuteronomy 25:19). The Hebrew Bible connects \"Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite\" (Esther 3:1), the genocidal antagonist of the Book of Esther, to Agag, king of Amalek, whom the Israelites failed to kill (I Samuel 15:9). According to these verses Hitler may be seen as a result of this failure. However, Hitler could also be seen as a \"symbolic\" Amalekite.\nIn 1898, when the German Kaiser Wilhelm visited Jerusalem, all Jews wanted to see him pass. Other Rabbis asked why the revered Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld refused - especially as it would have given him the rare opportunity of reciting the blessing on seeing a major non-Jewish leader. Rabbi Sonnenfeld stated that he had a tradition from the Vilna Gaon that descendants of Amalek were in Germany and so it would be wrong to praise the Kaiser.\nThe idea of linking Germany with Amalek is based on a word in the Talmud (Megilla 6b). This word was interpreted by Vilna Gaon to mean the area of current Germany (although at his time there was no such country - Germany only became a nation with that name in 1871). This was identified as a nation including descendents of Amalek who would cause massive harm to Jews - as was the case during the Nazi era.\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nIn the Israel\u2013Palestine conflict, some Israeli politicians have compared Palestinians to Amalek, stated that the Palestinians are the Amalekites or accused Arabs of exhibiting \"behavior\" that is \"typical\" of Amalekites. Yasser Arafat was called \"the Amalek and Hitler of our generation\" by 200 rabbis. Many in the Gush Emunim movement see Arabs as the \"Amalek of today\". According to few rabbis from the radical wing of the National Religious camp, Amalek is any nation that prevents Jews from settling in the Land of Israel, which includes the Palestinians, as they refuse to leave their ancestral homeland.\nBaruch Goldstein, who killed 29 Palestinians at the Cave of Patriarchs, compared Palestinians to Amalekites, seeing both as desert-dwelling \"predators\" of the Jewish people. Goldstein's mass shooting itself happened shortly after the reading of the Amalek narrative on Shabbat Zachor prior to Purim in 1994. Meir Kahane tended to see all enemies of Israel as modern-day Amalek, while other Jewish scholars see this as a distortion of the Torah.\nGaza genocide.\nDuring the Gaza war Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible. And we do remember\". At an argument to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) about allegations of genocide in the 2023 Israeli attack on Gaza, South Africa presented the comments as inciting genocide against the Palestinian people. Netanyahu denied that was his intention, stating the South African accusation reflected a \"deep historical ignorance\" since he was referring to Hamas.\nMultiple members of the Israeli Knesset, including Avihai Boaron, Amihai Eliyahu, Tally Gotliv, and Bezalel Smotrich, have invoked the commandment to wipe out the memory of Amalek in reference to the war in Gaza.\nIn response to the accusations in the ICJ case, the Israel Democracy Institute issued a legal opinion stating that the references to Amalek in the context of the war were misunderstood. According to the opinion, the commandment to annihilate Amalek has effectively been erased from Jewish law; moreover, the indictment misquoted Netanyahu - he did not refer to the commandment to annihilate Amalek, but rather to the commandment to remember what Amalek did. In addition, statements made by Israeli speakers were directed against members of Hamas, not against the Palestinian population of Gaza as a whole.\nThere have been examples of secular Zionists also using the Amalek metaphor. For example, Ariel Porat, the president of Tel Aviv University, cited the example of Amalek to justify Israel's attack on Gaza.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His mother was Abigail (), a sister of King David (). Hence, Amasa was a nephew of David, and cousin of Joab, David's military commander, as well as a cousin of Absalom, David's son. David calls him \"my bone and my flesh\" (). Amasa's father was Jether (, ) who was also called Ithra (). Jether had dual-nationality, being an Ishmaelite and Israelite, although it might be a case of an assimilated Ishmaelite living in Israel. \nWhen Absalom rebelled against David and won over the tribes of Israel (), Absalom appointed Amasa as commander over the army (), in effect replacing Joab, who had served as commander for David.\nAfter the revolt was crushed and Absalom died (), David was invited back to Jerusalem and restored as king. David re-appointed Amasa as his military commander in Joab's stead \"from now on\" as his military commander (). Other versions translate this status differently: it is given as \"permanently\" in the Jewish Publication Society 1985 translation and \"for life\" in the New International Version.\nDavid's appointment of Amasa has been interpreted as \"a bold stroke of policy, to promise the post of commander-in chief to the general of the rebel army\".\nWhile being fiercely loyal to David, Joab was also suspicious of any potential rivals for Joab's power or threats to David's kingdom, and had no qualms about taking the lives of any who might stand in his way (e.g., Abner: , and Absalom: ). So it was not difficult for Joab to also decide to murder Amasa (, ). Joab's own justification for killing Amasa may have been because he believed Amasa to be conspiring with Sheba son of Bichri the Benjamite, due to Amasa's slowness to mobilize the army against Sheba's rebels ().\nConsequences of the murder for Joab.\nThe murder of Amasa is cited as one of the reasons (beside the murder of Abner, ) why David on his deathbed counsels his son Solomon to have Joab executed (). Solomon fulfills this wish () right after the execution of his own half-brother Adonijah (), a pretender to the throne whom Joab had supported (cf. ).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68651", "revid": "565799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68651", "title": "Ambassador", "text": "Diplomatic envoy\nAn ambassador is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment. The word is also used informally for people who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities, and fields of endeavor, such as sales.\nAn ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital or country. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy (which may include an official residence and an office, chancery, located together or separately, generally in the host nation's capital), whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a charg\u00e9 d'affaires in place of an ambassador.\nThe equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the Commonwealth of Nations are known as High Commissioners. The ambassadors of the Holy See are known as Apostolic Nuncios.\nEtymology.\nThe term is derived from Middle English \"ambassadour\", Anglo-French \"ambassateur\"; akin to Old High German \"ambaht\", \"service\". The first known usage of the term was recorded around the 14th century.\nPurposes.\nThe foreign government to which an ambassador is assigned must first approve the person. In some cases, the foreign government might reverse its approval by declaring the diplomat a \"persona non grata\", i.e. an unacceptable person. This kind of declaration usually results in recalling the ambassador to their home nation. In accordance with the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the ambassador and embassy staff are granted diplomatic immunity and personal safety while living abroad.\nProtect citizens.\nDue to the advent of modern technologies, today's world is a much smaller place in relative terms. With this in mind, it is considered important that the nations of the world have at least a small staff living in foreign capitals in order to aid travelers and visitors from their home nation. As an officer of the foreign service, an ambassador is expected to protect the citizens of their home country in the host country.\nSupport prosperity.\nAnother result of the increase in foreign travel is the growth of trade between nations. For most countries, the national economy is now part of the global economy. This means increased opportunities to sell and trade with other nations. When two nations are conducting a trade, it is usually advantageous to both parties to have an ambassador and perhaps a small staff living in the other land, where they act as an intermediary between cooperative businesses.\nWork for peace.\nOne of the cornerstones of foreign diplomatic missions is to work for peace. This task can grow into a fight against international terrorism, the drug trade, international bribery, and human trafficking. Ambassadors help stop these acts, helping people across the globe. These activities are important and sensitive and are usually carried out in coordination with the Defense Ministry of the state and the head of the nation.\nRise of modern diplomacy.\nBefore the rise of modern diplomatic relations, sovereign states - which traded with each other, went to war and made peace \u2013 had the need for diplomatic relations, which took various forms. For example, the city states of Classical Greece used the system of Proxeny, whereby a Proxenos \u2013 who was a citizen of the host city rather than of the city whose interests he promoted - fulfilled some of the functions given to modern Ambassadors and Consuls.\nThe rise of the modern diplomatic system was a product of the Italian Renaissance (from around AD 1300). The use of ambassadors became a political strategy in Italy during the 15th century. The political changes in Italy altered the role of ambassadors in diplomatic affairs. Because many of the states in Italy were small, they were particularly vulnerable to larger states. The ambassador system was used to disperse information and to protect the more vulnerable states.\nThis practice then spread to Europe during the Italian Wars. The use and creation of ambassadors during the 15th century in Italy has had long-term effects on Europe and, in turn, the world's diplomatic and political progression. Europe still uses the same terms of ambassador rights as they had established in the 16th century, concerning the rights of the ambassadors in host countries as well as the proper diplomatic procedures. An ambassador was used as a representative of the state in which they are from to negotiate and disseminate information in order to keep peace and establish relationships with other states. This attempt was employed in the effort to maintain peaceful relations with nations and make alliances during difficult times.\nThe use of ambassadors today is widespread. States and non-state actors use diplomatic representatives to deal with any problems that occur within the international system. Ambassadors now normally live overseas or within the country to which it is assigned for long periods of time so that they are acquainted with the culture and local people. This way they are more politically effective and trusted, enabling them to accomplish goals that their host country desires.\nAmbassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary.\nThe Congress of Vienna of 1815 formalized the system of diplomatic rank under international law, distinguishing between three hierarchical descending categories of diplomatic representatives: full ambassadors (including legates or \"nuntii\"), accredited to heads of state; envoys or ministers, who were also accredited to heads of state; and finally charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires, who were accredited to the minister of foreign affairs.\nThe Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, which took effect in 1964 and is still in force, modified the system. According to it, ambassadors are diplomats of the highest rank, formally representing their head of state, with plenipotentiary powers (i.e. full authority to represent the government). In modern usage, most ambassadors on foreign postings as head of mission carry the full title of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. The distinction between extraordinary and ordinary ambassadors was common when not all ambassadors resided in the country to which they were assigned, often serving only for a specific purpose or mission.\nThe \"ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary\" being historically regarded as the personal representative of the sovereign, the custom of dispatching ambassadors to the head of state rather than the government has persisted. For example, ambassadors to and from the United Kingdom are accredited to or from the Royal Court of St James's. Ambassadors hold the highest diplomatic rank and have precedence over \"charg\u00e9s d'affaires\", who are accredited by the foreign minister. Ambassadors also outranked envoys until the 1960s, when the last legations were upgraded to embassies.\nBecause members of the Commonwealth of Nations have or had a common head of state, they do not exchange ambassadors, but instead have High Commissioners, who represent the government, rather than the head of state. The diplomat representing the Holy See is titled a nuncio. In diplomatic usage, both the high commissioner and nuncio are considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador; high commissioners, like ambassadors, carry the full title of \"High Commissioner Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary\", but nuncios do not. Resident Coordinators within the United Nations system are accredited to the Head of State and have the same rank as ambassador.\nAmbassadors carry formal letters of credence from their head of state, addressed to the host country's head of state. Because many Commonwealth countries have the same head of state, the accreditation of a High Commissioner is in the form of a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one head of government (Prime Minister) to that of another. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to foreign and Commonwealth states: e.g., British High Commissioners are formally titled \"The High Commissioner for His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom\", whereas British Ambassadors to foreign countries are known as \"His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador\". \nAmbassador-at-large.\nAn ambassador-at-large is a diplomat of the highest rank or a minister who is accredited to represent their country. But unlike the ambassador-in-residence, who is usually limited to a country or embassy, the ambassador-at-large can be appointed to operate in several usually neighbouring countries, a region or sometimes a seat of international organizations such as the United Nations or European Union. In some cases, an ambassador-at-large may even be specifically assigned a role to advise and assist the state or government in particular issues.\nHistorically, presidents or prime ministers have commissioned special diplomatic envoys for specific assignments, primarily overseas but sometimes also within the country as ambassadors-at-large.\nTitle.\nWhile the title generally reflects the ambassador's second head position as head of a diplomatic mission, in some countries the term may also represent a rank held by career diplomats, as a matter of internal promotion, regardless of the posting, and in many national careers it is quite common for them to be appointed to other functions, especially within the ministry/ministries in charge of foreign affairs, in some countries in systematic alternation with actual postings.\nThe formal form of address for an ambassador is generally the form that would be used to address a head of state: \"(Your/His/Her) Excellency\" followed by name or the country represented. In many countries, less formal variations are frequently used, such as \"Ambassador\" followed by name, or the name followed by \"Ambassador of...\". In the United States, \"Mister/Madam Ambassador\" may be used.\nIn some countries, a former ambassador may continue to be styled and addressed as ambassador throughout their life (in the United States, \"Mr. Ambassador\" or \"Madam Ambassador\" may be heard). In other countries, ambassador is a title that accrues to its holder only with respect to a specific position, and may not be used after leaving or beyond the position. Some countries do not use the term while an ambassador is in the home country, as the officeholder is not an ambassador there; for example, a Canadian ambassador while in Canada is not generally addressed as ambassador, although they may be referred to as \"Canadian ambassador to ...\"; that is, with reference to a specific job function; the person is addressed or styled as ambassador only while holding such office.\nNon-diplomatic ambassadorships.\nIn a less formal sense, the phrase is used for high-profile non-diplomatic representatives of various entities (rarely states), mainly cultural and charitable organizations, often as willing figureheads to attract media attention; for example, film and pop stars make appeals to the public at large for United Nations activities, sometimes during press-swarmed visits in the foreign country. Public figures are sometimes nominated or invited to endorse events designated as ambassadors, brand ambassadors, and goodwill ambassadors.\nMany times, international agencies like United Nations also appoint ambassadors to achieve the objectives of a particular mission, like the appointment of goodwill ambassador Bollywood film actress Priyanka Chopra for UNICEF. Japan adopted the cartoon character Hello Kitty as their official goodwill and tourism ambassador to China and Hong Kong in 2008. Businesses may appoint brand ambassadors, typically a celebrity or someone of a well-known presence, who may be paid considerably. In French-speaking regions such as metropolitan France, Guadeloupe, R\u00e9union, Quebec, or Wallonia, the title of \"ambassadeur personne\" is used.\nFurther, in the United States of America, senior career officers of the U.S. Foreign Service may be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to the rank of Career Ambassador as professional achievement. Holders of this rank may not necessarily possess diplomatic authority or accreditation to any state, though nearly all have previously served as an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary during their careers. By custom, they hold the rank for life (including retirement), are addressed with the title \"Ambassador\" and may use U.S. Diplomatic Passports for all travel. Prominent career ambassadors include Lawrence Eagleburger, William Joseph Burns and Ryan Crocker.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68659", "revid": "765510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68659", "title": "Ammonoidea", "text": "Extinct subclass of cephalopod molluscs\nAmmonoids are extinct, (typically) coiled-shelled cephalopods comprising the subclass Ammonoidea. They are more closely related to living octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish (which comprise the clade Coleoidea) than they are to nautiluses (family Nautilidae). The earliest ammonoids appeared during the Emsian stage of the Early Devonian (410.62 million years ago), with the last species vanishing during or soon after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event (66 million years ago). They are often called ammonites, which is most frequently used for members of the order Ammonitida, the only remaining group of ammonoids from the Jurassic up until their extinction.\nAmmonoids exhibited considerable diversity over their evolutionary history, with over 10,000 species having been described. Ammonoids are excellent index fossils, and they have been frequently used to link rock layers in which a particular species or genus is found to specific geologic time periods. Their fossil shells usually take the form of planispirals, although some helically spiraled and nonspiraled forms (known as heteromorphs) have been found, primarily during the Cretaceous period.\nThe name \"ammonite\", from which the scientific term is derived, was inspired by the spiral shape of their fossilized shells, which somewhat resemble tightly coiled rams' horns. Pliny the Elder (d. 79 AD near Pompeii) called fossils of these animals (\"horns of Ammon\") because the Egyptian god Ammon (Amun) was typically depicted wearing rams' horns. Often, the name of an ammonite genus ends in -\"ceras\", which is from ancient Greek () meaning \"horn\".\nClassification.\nOrders and suborders.\nThe Ammonoidea can be divided into six orders, listed here starting with the most primitive and going to the more derived:\nIn some classifications, these are left as suborders, included in only three orders: Goniatitida, Ceratitida and Ammonitida. The classification of ammonoids is based in part on the ornamentation and structure of the septa comprising their shells' gas chambers.\nTaxonomy of the \"Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology\".\nThe \"Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology\" (Part L, 1957) divides the Ammonoidea, regarded simply as an order, into eight suborders, the Anarcestina, Clymeniina, Goniatitina and Prolecanitina from the Paleozoic; the Ceratitina from the Triassic; and the Ammonitina, Lytoceratina and Phylloceratina from the Jurassic and Cretaceous. In subsequent taxonomies, these are sometimes regarded as orders within the subclass Ammonoidea.\nShell anatomy and diversity.\nBasic shell anatomy.\nThe chambered part of the ammonite shell is called a phragmocone. It contains a series of progressively larger chambers, called camerae (sing. camera) that are divided by thin walls called septa (sing. septum). Only the last and largest chamber, the body chamber, was occupied by the living animal at any given moment. As it grew, it added newer and larger chambers to the open end of the coil. Where the outer whorl of an ammonite shell largely covers the preceding whorls, the specimen is said to be \"involute\" (e.g., \"Anahoplites\"). Where it does not cover those preceding, the specimen is said to be \"evolute\" (e.g., \"Dactylioceras\").\nA thin living tube called a siphuncle passed through the septa, extending from the ammonite's body into the empty shell chambers. Through a hyperosmotic active transport process, the ammonite emptied water out of these shell chambers. This enabled it to control the buoyancy of the shell and thereby rise or descend in the water column.\nA primary difference between ammonites and nautiloids is the siphuncle of ammonites (excepting Clymeniina) runs along the ventral periphery of the septa and camerae (i.e., the inner surface of the outer axis of the shell), while the siphuncle of nautiloids runs more or less through the center of the septa and camerae.\nSepta and suture patterns.\nAmmonites (subclass Ammonoidea) can be distinguished by their septa, the dividing walls that separate the chambers in the phragmocone, by the nature of their sutures where the septa join the outer shell wall, and in general by their siphuncles.\nAmmonoid septa characteristically have bulges and indentations and are to varying degrees convex when seen from the front, distinguishing them from nautiloid septa, which are typically simple concave, dish-shaped structures. The topology of the septa, especially around the rim, results in the various suture patterns found. The septal curvature in nautiloids and ammonoids also differ in that the septa curves towards the opening in nautiloids, and away from the opening in amm\u043enoids.While nearly all nautiloids show gently curving sutures, the ammonoid suture line (the intersection of the septum with the outer shell) is variably folded, forming saddles (\"peaks\" that point towards the aperture) and lobes (\"valleys\" which point away from the aperture). The suture line has four main regions.\nThe external or ventral region refers to sutures along the lower (outer) edge of the shell, where the left and right suture lines meet. The external (or ventral) saddle, when present, lies directly on the lower midline of the shell. As a result, it is often called the median saddle. On suture diagrams the median saddle is supplied with an arrow which points towards the aperture. The median saddle is edged by fairly small external (or ventral) lobes. The earliest ammonoids lacked a median saddle and instead had a single midline ventral lobe, which in later forms is split into two or more components.\nThe lateral region involves the first saddle and lobe pair past the external region as the suture line extends up the side of the shell. The lateral saddle and lobe are usually larger than the ventral saddle and lobe. Additional lobes developing towards the inner edge of a whorl are labelled umbilical lobes, which increase in number through ammonoid evolution as well as an individual ammonoid's development. In many cases the distinction between the lateral and umbilical regions are unclear; new umbilical features can develop from subdivisions of other umbilical features, or from subdivisions of lateral features. Lobes and saddles which are so far towards the center of the whorl that they are covered up by succeeding whorls are labelled internal (or dorsal) lobes and saddles.\nThree major types of suture patterns are found in the Ammonoidea:\nSiphuncle.\nThe siphuncle in most ammonoids is a narrow tubular structure that runs along the shell's outer rim, known as the venter, connecting the chambers of the phragmocone to the body or living chamber. This distinguishes them from living nautiloides (\"Nautilus\" and \"Allonautilus\") and typical Nautilida, in which the siphuncle runs through the center of each chamber. However the very earliest nautiloids from the Late Cambrian and Ordovician typically had ventral siphuncles like ammonites, although often proportionally larger and more internally structured. The word \"siphuncle\" comes from the Neo-Latin \"siphunculus\", meaning \"little siphon\".\nSexual dimorphism.\nOne feature found in shells of the modern \"Nautilus\" is the variation in the shape and size of the shell according to the sex of the animal, the shell of the male being slightly smaller and wider than that of the female. This sexual dimorphism is thought to be an explanation for the variation in size of certain ammonite shells of the same species, the larger shell (the \"macroconch\") being female, and the smaller shell (the \"microconch\") being male. This is thought to be because the female required a larger body size for egg production. A good example of this sexual variation is found in \"Bifericeras\" from the early part of the Jurassic period of Europe.\nOnly recently has sexual variation in the shells of ammonites been recognized. The macroconch and microconch of one species were often previously mistaken for two closely related but different species occurring in the same rocks. However, because the dimorphic sizes are so consistently found together, they are more likely an example of sexual dimorphism within the same species.\nWhorl width in the body chamber of many groups of ammonites, as expressed by the width:diameter ratio, is another sign of dimorphism. This character has been used to separate \"male\" (Largiventer conch \"L\") from \"female\" (Leviventer conch \"l\").\nVariations in shape.\nThe majority of ammonite species feature planispiral shells, tightly coiled in a flat plane. The most fundamental difference in spiral form is how strongly successive whorls expand and overlap their predecessors. This can be inferred by the size of the umbilicus, the sunken-in inner part of the coil, exposing older and smaller whorls. \"Evolute\" shells have very little overlap, a large umbilicus, and many exposed whorls. \"Involute\" shells have strong overlap, a small umbilicus, and only the largest and most recent whorls are exposed. Shell structure can be broken down further by the width of the shell, with implications for hydrodynamic efficiency.\nMajor shell forms include:\nAmmonites vary greatly in the ornamentation (surface relief) of their shells. Some may be smooth and relatively featureless, except for growth lines, resembling that of the modern \"Nautilus\". In others, various patterns of spiral ridges, ribs, nodes, or spines are presented. This type of complex ornamentation of the shell is especially evident in the later ammonites of the Cretaceous.\nHeteromorphs.\nAmmonoids with a shell shape diverging from the typical planispiral form are known as heteromorphs, instead forming a conch with detached whorls (open coiling) or non-planispiral coiling. These types of shells evolved four times in ammonoids, with the first forms appearing already in the Devonian period. In late Norian age in Triassic the first heteromorph ammonoid fossils belongs to the genus Rhabdoceras. The three other heteromorphic genera were Hannaoceras, Cochloceras and Choristoceras. All of them went extinct at the end of Triassic. In the Jurassic an uncoiled shell was found in the Spiroceratoidea, but by the end of Cretaceous the only heteromorph ammonites remaining belonged to the suborder Ancyloceratina. One example is \"Baculites\", which has a nearly straight shell convergent with the older orthocone nautiloids. Still other species' shells are coiled helically (in two dimensions), similar in appearance to some gastropods (e.g., \"Turrilites\" and \"Bostrychoceras\"). Some species' shells are even initially uncoiled, then partially coiled, and finally straight at maturity (as in \"Australiceras\").\nPerhaps the most extreme and bizarre-looking example of a heteromorph is \"Nipponites\", which appears to be a tangle of irregular whorls lacking any obvious symmetric coiling. Upon closer inspection, though, the shell proves to be a three-dimensional network of connected \"U\" shapes. \"\" occurs in rocks of the upper part of the Cretaceous in Japan and the United States.\nAptychus.\nSome ammonites have been found in association with a single horny plate or a pair of calcitic plates. In the past, these plates were assumed to serve in closing the opening of the shell in much the same way as an operculum, but more recently they are postulated to have been a jaw apparatus.\nThe plates are collectively termed the aptychus or aptychi in the case of a pair of plates, and anaptychus in the case of a single plate. The paired aptychi were symmetric to one another and equal in size and appearance.\nAnaptychi are relatively rare as fossils. They are found representing ammonites from the Devonian period through those of the Cretaceous period.\nCalcified aptychi only occur in ammonites from the Mesozoic era. They are almost always found detached from the shell, and are only very rarely preserved in place. Still, sufficient numbers have been found closing the apertures of fossil ammonite shells as to leave no doubt as to their identity as part of the anatomy of an ammonite.\nLarge numbers of detached aptychi occur in certain beds of rock (such as those from the Mesozoic in the Alps). These rocks are usually accumulated at great depths. The modern \"Nautilus\" lacks any calcitic plate for closing its shell, and only one extinct nautiloid genus is known to have borne anything similar. \"Nautilus\" does, however, have a leathery head shield (the hood) which it uses to cover the opening when it retreats inside.\nThere are many forms of aptychus, varying in shape and the sculpture of the inner and outer surfaces, but because they are so rarely found in position within the shell of the ammonite it is often unclear to which species of ammonite one kind of aptychus belongs. A number of aptychi have been given their own genus and even species names independent of their unknown owners' genus and species, pending future discovery of verified occurrences within ammonite shells.\nSoft tissues, life appearance and ecology.\nBecause ammonites and their close relatives are extinct, little is known about their way of life. Their soft body parts are very rarely preserved in any detail. Nonetheless, much has been worked out by examining ammonoid shells and by using models of these shells in water tanks.\nAlthough ammonites do occur in exceptional lagerstatten such as the Solnhofen Limestone, their soft-part record is surprisingly sparse. Beyond a tentative ink sac and possible digestive organs, no soft parts were known until 2021. In this year an isolated specimen showing some of the internal soft anatomy including organs was described. When neutron imaging was used on a fossil found in 1998, part of the musculature became visible and showed they were able to retract themselves into the shell for protection, and that the retractor muscles and hyponome that work together to enable jet propulsion in nautilus worked independently in ammonites. The soft body of the creature occupied the largest segments of the shell at the end of the coil. The smaller earlier segments were walled off and the animal could maintain its buoyancy by filling them with gas. Thus, the smaller sections of the coil would have floated above the larger sections. The reproductive organs show possible traces of spermatophores, which would support the hypothesis that the microconchs were males. They likely bore a radula and beak, and marginal siphuncle. They operated by direct development with sexual reproduction, were carnivorous, and had a crop for food storage. They are unlikely to have dwelt in fresh or brackish water. Many ammonites were likely filter feeders, so adaptations associated with this lifestyle like sieves probably occurred.A 2021 study reported specimens of the scaphitid ammonite genera \"Rhaeboceras\" and \"Hoploscaphites\" with mineralised hooks, which were likely present on the ends of a pair of enlarged tentacles. However, these mineralised hooks appear to be present only in scaphitids and were not typical of ammonites as a whole. The number of arms has been a subject of speculation, with different artists either opting for a nautilus-like restoration with many arms, or a more squid-like restoration with fewer arms, with a 1996 study suggesting they had 10 arms like modern squid. Paleontologist Mark Witton has stated that \"The basic details of ammonite life appearance are far from clear . . . While we can be certain that a squid-like organism lived in the last chamber of their shells . . . little else can be said with certainty about their appearance. ... Despite being creatures which occur so commonly as fossils that it seems like we should know everything about them, ammonites are creatures fraught with uncertainty for artists and palaeontologists alike. Until new data comes to light, all life reconstructions of ammonites should be taken as extremely tentative, almost speculative renditions of their actual appearance.\"\nMany ammonoids probably lived in the open water of ancient seas, rather than at the sea bottom, because their fossils are often found in rocks laid down under conditions where no bottom-dwelling life is found. In general, they appear to have inhabited the upper of the water column. Many of them (such as \"Oxynoticeras\") are thought to have been good swimmers, with flattened, discus-shaped, streamlined shells, although some ammonoids were less effective swimmers and were likely to have been slow-swimming bottom-dwellers. Synchrotron analysis of an aptychophoran ammonite revealed remains of isopod and mollusc larvae in its buccal cavity, indicating at least this kind of ammonite fed on plankton. They may have avoided predation by squirting ink, much like modern cephalopods; ink is occasionally preserved in fossil specimens.\nMany ammonite shells have been found with round holes once interpreted as a result of limpets attaching themselves to the shells. However, the triangular formation of the holes, their size and shape, and their presence on both sides of the shells, corresponding to the upper and lower jaws, is more likely evidence of the bite of a medium-sized mosasaur preying upon ammonites.\nSome ammonites appear to have lived in cold seeps and even reproduced there.\nSize.\nThe smallest ammonoid was \"Maximites\" from the Upper Carboniferous. Adult specimens reached only in shell diameter. Few of the ammonites occurring in the lower and middle part of the Jurassic period reached a size exceeding in diameter. Much larger forms are found in the later rocks of the upper part of the Jurassic and the lower part of the Cretaceous, such as \"Titanites\" from the Portland Stone of Jurassic of southern England, which is often in diameter, and \"Parapuzosia seppenradensis\" of the Cretaceous period of Germany, which is one of the largest-known ammonites, sometimes reaching in diameter. The largest-documented North American ammonite is \"Parapuzosia bradyi\" from the Cretaceous, with specimens measuring in diameter.\nEvolutionary history.\nAmmonoids are widely thought to have originated from straight-shelled (orthocone) \"nautiloids\" belong to Bactritida during the early Devonian (Emsian), with transitional fossils showing the transition from a straight shell, to a curved (cyrtoconic) shell to a relaxed (gyroconic) spiral and finally to a tight spiral. The Kellwasser Event at the end of the Frasnian let to a dramatic decline in ammonoid diversity, with only a handful of lineages belong to Tornoceratina (a subgroup of Goniatites) surviving, becoming ancestral to all later ammonoids. Ammonoids rediversified during the following Famennian, which also saw the radical shift of the siphuncle from a lower (ventral) to upper (dorsal) position. Ammonites were nearly completely exterminated by the Hangenberg Event at the end of the Devonian, with only a handful of lineages surviving, with one of the surviving goniatite lineages becoming ancestral to all post-early Carboniferous and later ammonoids. Ammonoids again rediversified during the Early Carboniferous. During the Carboniferous ammonoids underwent alternating periods of diversification and decline, and during the late Carboniferous ammonioid diversity became concentrated in a few geographical regions.\nDuring the Permian, the Capitanian mass extinction event severely reduced the diversity of Goniatitida and Prolecanitida, while the Ceratitida, which originated during the Middle Permian, likely from the Daraelitidae, was largely unaffected and radiated in the Late Permian, becoming the dominant group of ammonoids in this period represented by two groups, the araxoceratids and xenodiscids. The end-Permian mass extinction again reduced ammonoids to the verge of extinction, though both main ceratitd lineages lineages survived, though the xenodiscids were more successful and ancestral to all later ammonoids.\nAmmonites were devastated by the end-Triassic extinction, with only a handful of genera belonging to the family Psiloceratidae of the suborder Phylloceratina surviving and becoming ancestral to all later Jurassic and Cretaceous ammonites. Ammonites explosively diversified during the Early Jurassic, with the orders Psiloceratina, Ammonitina, Lytoceratina, Haploceratina, Perisphinctina and Ancyloceratina all appearing during the Jurassic. Heteromorph ammonites (ammonites with open or non-spiral coiling) of the order Ancyloceratina became common during the Cretaceous period.\nAt least 57 species of ammonites, which were widespread and belonged to six superfamilies, were extant during the last 500,000 years of the Cretaceous, indicating that ammonites remained highly diverse until the very end of their existence. All ammonites were wiped out during or shortly after the K-Pg extinction event, caused by the Chicxulub impact. It has been suggested that ocean acidification generated by the impact played a key role in their extinction, as the larvae of ammonites were likely small and planktonic, and would have been heavily affected. Nautiloids, exemplified by modern nautiluses, are conversely thought to have had a reproductive strategy in which eggs were laid in smaller batches many times during the lifespan, and on the sea floor well away from any direct effects of such a bolide strike, and thus survived. Many ammonite species were filter feeders, so they might have been particularly susceptible to marine faunal turnovers and climatic change. Some reports suggest that a few ammonite species may have persisted into the very early Danian stage of the Paleocene, before going extinct.\nCultural significance.\nIn medieval Europe, fossilised ammonites were thought to be petrified coiled snakes, and were called \"snakestones\" or, more commonly in medieval England, \"serpentstones\". They were considered to be evidence for the actions of saints, such as Hilda of Whitby, a myth referenced in Sir Walter Scott's \"Marmion\", and Saint Patrick, and were held to have healing or oracular powers. Traders would occasionally carve the head of a snake onto the empty, wide end of the ammonite fossil, and then sell them as petrified snakes.

{"id": "68667", "revid": "44062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68667", "title": "Anathema", "text": "Term for something or someone vehemently hated or banned\nThe word anathema has two main meanings. One is to describe that something or someone is being hated or avoided. The other refers to a formal excommunication by a church. These meanings come from the New Testament, where an anathema was a person or thing cursed or condemned by God. In the Old Testament, an anathema was something or someone cursed and separated from God because of sin. These represent two types of settings, one for devotion, the other for destruction.\nEtymology.\nAnathema derives from Ancient Greek: , , meaning \"an offering\" or \"anything dedicated\", itself derived from the verb , , meaning \"to offer up\". In the Old Testament, \u05d7\u05b5\u05e8\u05b6\u05dd (\"ch\u0113rem\") referred to both objects consecrated to divine use and those dedicated to destruction in the Lord's name, such as enemies and their weapons during religious wars. Since weapons of the enemy were considered unholy, the meaning became \"anything dedicated to evil\" or \"a curse\".\nIn New Testament usage a different meaning developed. St. Paul used the word anathema to signify a curse and the forced expulsion of one from the community of Christians. By the 6th century, the liturgical meaning evolved again to mean a formal ecclesiastical curse of excommunication and the condemnation of heretical doctrines, the severest form of separation from the Christian church issued against a heretic or group of heretics by a Pope or other church official. The phrase (\"let him be anathema\"), echoing Galatians 1:8\u20139, was thus used in decrees of councils defining Christian faith.\nExamples include:\nIn 1526, the word \"anathema\" appeared in modern English for the first time and was used in the sense of \"something accursed\". The \"consecrated object\" meaning was also adopted a short time later, but is no longer widely used. Its most common modern usage is in secular contexts where it is used to mean something or someone that is detested or shunned.\nExamples include:\nReligious usage.\nThe Old Testament applied the word to anything set aside for sacrifice, and thus banned from profane use and dedicated to destruction\u2014as, in the case of religious wars, the enemy and their cities and possessions. The New Testament uses the word to mean a curse and forced expulsion of someone from the Christian community.\nJudaism.\nThe Septuagint uses the Greek word (\"anathema\"), meaning something offered to a divinity, to render the Hebrew word (\"herem\"). The word appears in verses such as Leviticus 27:28 to refer to things that are offered to God and so banned for common (non-religious) use. The Hebrew word was also used for what was devoted, by virtue of a simple vow, not to the Lord, but to the priest. According to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" (1901\u20131906), with the rise of the synagogue as the organizing principle of Jewish life circa the Maccabean period, the sense of the word \"herem\" changed from \"an instrument of communal purification\" to \"an instrument for the promotion of personal conduct as well as the enforcement of public morality [...] an instrument of ecclesiastical discipline\"; see Herem (censure).\nNew Testament.\nThe noun \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1 (\"anathema\") occurs in the Greek New Testament six times, and frequently in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament). Its meaning in the New Testament is \"disfavour of God\", and is used both of the sentence of disfavour, as in Acts 23:14, and to the object of God's disfavour, as in the other cited places.\nEarly Church.\nSince the time of the apostles, the term 'anathema' has come to mean a form of extreme religious sanction, known as excommunication. The earliest recorded instance of the form is in the Council of Elvira (c.\u2009306), and thereafter it became the common method of cutting off heretics; for example, the Synod of Gangra (c. 340) pronounced that Manicheanism was anathema. Cyril of Alexandria issued twelve anathemas against Nestorius in 431. In the fifth century, a formal distinction between anathema and \"minor\" excommunication evolved, where \"minor\" excommunication entailed cutting off a person or group from the rite of Eucharist and attendance at worship, while anathema meant a complete separation of the subject from the Church.\nCatholicism.\nIn the dogmatic canons of all the ecumenical councils recognized by the Catholic Church that use the word anathema, the word \"anathema\" signifies exclusion from the society of the faithful because of heresy. Documents of the 9th and 12th centuries distinguish anathema from excommunication, a distinction later clarified by using the term \"major excommunication\" for exclusion from the society of the faithful, and \"minor excommunication\" for ordinary excommunication or exclusion from reception of the sacraments.\nAlthough in the canons of ecumenical councils the word \"anathema\" continued to be used to mean exclusion for heresy from the society of the faithful, the word was also used to signify a major excommunication inflicted with particular solemnity. Anathema, in this sense, was a major excommunication pronounced with the ceremonies described in the article bell, book, and candle, which were reserved for the gravest crimes.\nThe 1917 Roman Code of Canon Law abandoned the distinction between major and minor excommunication (which continues in use among the Eastern Catholic Churches) and abolished all penalties of whatever kind envisaged in previous canonical legislation but not included in the Code. It defined excommunication as exclusion from the communion of the faithful and said that excommunication \"is also called anathema, especially if inflicted with the solemnities described in the \"Pontificale Romanum\".\"\nThe 1983 Code of Canon Law, which is now in force, does not contain the word \"anathema\", and the \"Pontificale Romanum\", as revised after the Second Vatican Council, no longer mentions any particular solemnities associated with the infliction of excommunication.\nEastern Orthodoxy.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church distinguishes between \"epitemia\" (penances) laid on a person, one form of which is \"separation from the communion of the Church\" (excommunication), and anathema. While undergoing epitemia, the person remains an Orthodox Christian, even though their participation in the mystical life of the church is restricted; but those given over to anathema are considered completely torn from the Church until they repent. Epitemia, or excommunication, is normally limited to a specified period of time\u2014though it always depends on evidence of repentance by the one serving the penance. The lifting of anathema, however, depends solely on the repentance of the one condemned. The two causes for which a person may be anathematized are heresy and schism. Anathematization is only a last resort, and must always be preceded by pastoral attempts to reason with the offender and bring about their restoration.\nFor the Orthodox, anathema is not final damnation. God alone is the judge of the living and the dead, and up until the moment of death repentance is always possible. The purpose of public anathema is twofold: to warn the one condemned and bring about his repentance, and to warn others away from his error. Everything is done for the purpose of the salvation of souls.\nOn the First Sunday of Great Lent\u2014the \"Sunday of Orthodoxy\"\u2014the church celebrates the Rite of Orthodoxy, at which anathemas are pronounced against numerous heresies. This rite commemorates the end of Byzantine Iconoclasm\u2014the last great heresy to trouble the church (all subsequent heresies\u2014so far\u2014merely being restatements in one form or another of previous errors)\u2014at the Council of Constantinople in 843. The \"Synodicon\", or decree, of the council was publicly proclaimed on this day, including an anathema against not only Iconoclasm but also of previous heresies. The \"Synodicon\" continues to be proclaimed annually, together with additional prayers and petitions in cathedrals and major monasteries throughout the Eastern Orthodox Churches. During the rite (which is also known as the \"Triumph of Orthodoxy\"), lections are read from Romans 16:17\u201320, which directs the church to \"mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine you have learned, and avoid them. For they ... by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple,\" and Matthew 18:10\u201318, which recounts the parable of the Good Shepherd, and provides the procedure to follow in dealing with those who err:\n\"... if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he shall neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"\nAfter an ektenia (litany), during which petitions are offered that God will have mercy on those who err and bring them back to the truth, and that he will \"make hatred, enmity, strife, vengeance, falsehood and all other abominations to cease, and cause true love to reign in our hearts\", the bishop (or abbot) says a prayer during which he beseeches God to: \"look down now upon Thy Church, and behold how that, though we have joyously received the Gospel of salvation, we are but stony ground. For the thorns of vanity and the tares of the passions make it to bear but little fruit in certain places and none in others, and with the increase in iniquity, some, opposing the truth of Thy Gospel by heresy, and others by schism, do fall away from Thy dignity, and rejecting Thy grace, they subject themselves to the judgment of Thy most holy word. O most merciful and almighty Lord ... be merciful unto us; strengthen us in the right Faith by Thy power, and with Thy divine light illumine the eyes of those in error, that they may come to know Thy truth. Soften the hardness of their hearts and open their ears, that they may hear Thy voice and turn to Thee, our Saviour. O Lord, set aside their division and correct their life, which doth not accord with Christian piety. ... Endue the pastors of Thy Church with holy zeal, and so direct their care for the salvation and conversion of those in error with the spirit of the Gospel that, guided by Thee, we may all attain to that place where is the perfect faith, fulfillment of hope, and true love ...\" The protodeacon then proclaims the Synodicon, anathematizing various heresies and lauding those who have remained constant in the dogma and Holy Tradition of the Church.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

The Merkabah text Re'uyot Yehezkel identifies the Ancient of Days as Metatron.\nChristianity.\nEastern Christianity.\nIn Eastern Orthodox Christian hymns and icons, the Ancient of Days is sometimes identified with God the Father or occasionally the Holy Spirit; but most properly, in accordance with Orthodox theology he is identified with God the Son, Jesus Christ.\nMost of the eastern church fathers who comment on the passage in Daniel (7:9\u201310, 13\u201314) interpreted the elderly figure as a prophetic revelation of the Son before his physical incarnation.\nEastern Christian art will sometimes portray Jesus Christ as an old man, the Ancient of Days, to show symbolically that he existed from all eternity, and sometimes as a young man, or wise baby, to portray him as he was incarnate. This iconography emerged in the 6th century, mostly in the Eastern Empire with elderly images, although usually not properly or specifically identified as \"the Ancient of Days.\" The first images of the Ancient of Days, so named with an inscription, were developed by iconographers in different manuscripts, the earliest of which are dated to the 11th century. The images in these manuscripts included the inscription \"Jesus Christ, Ancient of Days,\" confirming that this was a way to identify Christ as pre-eternal with the God the Father. Indeed, later, it was declared by the Russian Orthodox Church at the Great Synod of Moscow in 1667 that the Ancient of Days was the Son and not the Father.\nWestern Christianity.\nIn the Western Church similar figures usually represent only God the Father. Thomas Aquinas, for example, identifies the Ancient of Days with God the Father, quoting Hilary of Poitiers' comment that \"eternity is in the Father\".\nThe Book of Daniel also contains a reference to \"someone like a son of man\", who is brought up close before the Ancient of Days, and to whom are given \"rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him\" (Daniel 7:13\u201314). Some Christian commentators have understood this to describe God the Father bestowing rulership over an everlasting kingdom upon Jesus (who is often called \"the Son of man\"), which would suggest that the Ancient of Days is not identical with Jesus. It has been noted that \"Daniel's vision of the two figures is the only one in which the two divine persons are seen face to face\".\nAmong ancient Jewish pseudepigrapha, the Book of Enoch states that he who is called \"Son of man,\" who existed before the worlds were, is seen by Enoch in company with the \"Ancient of Days\".\nIn the hymn \"Immortal, Invisible, God only Wise\" (lyrics Walter C.

Some view anger as an emotion that triggers part of the fight or flight response. Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively, and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force.\nAnger can have many physical and mental consequences. The external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions, body language, physiological responses, and at times public acts of aggression. Facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown. While most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of \"what has happened to them\", psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability.\nModern psychologists view anger as a normal and natural emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times, and as an emotion that has functional value for individual survival and mutual cooperation. However, uncontrolled anger can negatively affect personal or social well-being and may produce deleterious health effects and negatively impact those around them. While many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger, there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger. The issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers, but modern psychologists, in contrast to earlier writers, have also pointed out the possible ill effects of suppressing anger on one's well-being and interpersonal relationships.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPsychology and sociology.\nThree types of anger are recognized by psychologists:\nAnger can potentially mobilize psychological resources and boost determination toward correction of wrong behaviors, promotion of social justice, communication of negative sentiment, and redress of grievances. It can also facilitate patience. In contrast, anger can be destructive when it does not find its appropriate outlet in expression. Anger, in its strong form, impairs one's ability to process information and to exert cognitive control over one's behavior. An angry person may lose their objectivity, empathy, prudence or thoughtfulness and may cause harm to themselves or others. There is a sharp distinction between anger and aggression (verbal or physical, direct or indirect) even though they mutually influence each other. While anger can activate aggression or increase its probability or intensity, it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for aggression.\nNeuropsychological perspective.\nExtension of the stimuli of the fighting reactions: At the beginning of life, the human infant struggles indiscriminately against any restraining force, whether it be another human being or a blanket which confines their movements. There is no inherited susceptibility to social stimuli as distinct from other stimulation, in anger. At a later date the child learns that certain actions, such as striking, scolding, and screaming, are effective toward persons, but not toward things. In adults, though the infantile response is still sometimes seen, the fighting reaction becomes fairly well limited to stimuli whose hurting or restraining influence can be thrown off by physical violence.\nBrain regions which are activated when recognizing threat or provocation, and facilitate autonomic arousal and interoception and activate the stress response, are the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula cortex) and subcortical area (the thalamus, the amygdala, and the brain stem).\nDifferences between related concepts.\nRaymond Novaco of University of California Irvine, who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject, stratified anger into three modalities: cognitive (appraisals), somatic-affective (tension and agitations), and behavioral (withdrawal and antagonism).\nThe words annoyance and rage are often imagined to be at opposite ends of an emotional continuum: mild irritation and annoyance at the low end and fury at the high end. Rage problems are conceptualized as \"the inability to process emotions or life's experiences\" either because the capacity to regulate emotion (Schore, 1994) has never been sufficiently developed or because it has been temporarily lost due to more recent trauma. Rage is understood as raw, undifferentiated emotions, that spill out when another life event that cannot be processed, no matter how trivial, puts more stress on the organism than it can bear.\nAnger, when viewed as a protective response or instinct to a perceived threat, is considered as positive. The negative expression of this state is known as aggression commits antisocial personality disorder and Intermittent explosive disorder. Acting on this misplaced state is rage due to possible potential errors in perception and judgment.\nExamples\nCharacteristics.\nWilliam DeFoore, an anger management writer, described anger as a pressure cooker, stating that \"we can only suppress or apply pressure against our happy for so long before it erupts\".\nOne simple trichotomy of anger expression is \"passive anger\" versus \"aggressive anger\" versus \"assertive anger\". These three types of anger have some characteristic symptoms:\nPassive anger.\nPassive anger can be expressed in the following ways:\nAggressive anger.\nThe symptoms of aggressive anger are:\nSix dimensions of anger expression.\nAnger expression can take on many more styles than passive or aggressive. Ephrem Fernandez has identified six dimensions of anger expression. They relate to the direction of anger, its locus, reaction, modality, impulsivity, and objective. Coordinates on each of these dimensions can be connected to generate a profile of a person's anger expression style. Among the many profiles that are theoretically possible in this system, are the familiar profile of the person with explosive anger, profile of the person with repressive anger, profile of the passive aggressive person, and the profile of constructive anger expression.\nEthnicity and culture.\nMuch research has explored whether the emotion of anger is experienced and expressed differently depending on the culture. Matsumoto (2007) conducted a study in which White-American and Asian participants needed to express the emotions from a program called JACFEE (Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expression of Emotion) in order to determine whether Caucasian observers noticed any differences in expression of participants of a different nationality. He found that participants were unable to assign a nationality to people demonstrating expression of anger, i.e. they could not distinguish ethnic-specific expressions of anger. Hatfield, Rapson, and Le (2009) conducted a study that measured ethnic differences in emotional expression using participants from the Philippines, Hawaii, China, and Europe. They concluded that there was a difference between how someone expresses an emotion, especially the emotion of anger in people with different ethnicities, based on frequency, with Europeans showing the lowest frequency of expression of negative emotions.\nOther research investigates anger within different ethnic groups who live in the same country. Researchers explored whether Black Americans experience and express greater anger than Whites (Mabry &amp; Kiecolt, 2005). They found that, after controlling for sex and age, Black participants did not feel or express more anger than Whites. Deffenbacher and Swaim (1999) compared the expression of anger in Mexican American people and White non-Hispanic American people. They concluded that White non-Hispanic Americans expressed more verbal aggression than Mexican Americans, although when it came to physical aggression expressions there was no significant difference between both cultures when it came to anger.\nCauses.\nSome animals make loud sounds, attempt to look physically larger, bare their teeth, and stare. The behaviors associated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening behavior. Rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression of anger by at least one of the participants. Displays of anger can be used as a manipulation strategy for social influence.\nPeople feel really angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are convinced someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still influence the situation or cope with it. For instance, if a person's car is damaged, they will feel angry if someone else did it (e.g. another driver rear-ended it), but will feel sadness instead if it was caused by situational forces (e.g. a hailstorm) or guilt and shame if they were personally responsible (e.g. they crashed into a wall out of momentary carelessness). Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham defines anger in terms of our expectations and assumptions about the world. Graham states anger almost always results when we are caught up \"...expecting the world to be different than it is\".\nUsually, those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of \"what has happened to them\" and in most cases the described provocations occur immediately before the anger experience. Such explanations confirm the illusion that anger has a discrete external cause. The angry person usually finds the cause of their anger in an intentional, personal, and controllable aspect of another person's behavior. This explanation is based on the intuitions of the angry person who experiences a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability as a result of their emotion. Anger can be of multicausal origin, some of which may be remote events, but people rarely find more than \"one\" cause for their anger. According to Novaco, \"Anger experiences are embedded or nested within an environmental-temporal context. Disturbances that may not have involved anger at the outset leave residues that are not readily recognized but that operate as a lingering backdrop for focal provocations (of anger).\" According to Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, an internal infection can cause pain which in turn can activate anger. According to cognitive consistency theory, anger is caused by an inconsistency between a desired, or expected, situation and the actually perceived situation, and triggers responses, such as aggressive behavior, with the expected consequence of reducing the inconsistency. Sleep deprivation also seems to be a cause of anger.\nCognitive effects.\nAnger causes a reduction in cognitive ability and the accurate processing of external stimuli. Dangers seem smaller, actions seem less risky, ventures seem more likely to succeed, and unfortunate events seem less likely. Angry people are more likely to make risky decisions, and make less realistic risk assessments. In one study, test subjects primed to feel angry felt less likely to have heart disease, and more likely to receive a pay raise, compared to fearful people. This tendency can manifest in retrospective thinking as well: in a 2005 study, angry subjects said they thought the risks of terrorism in the year following 9/11 in retrospect were low, compared to what the fearful and neutral subjects thought.\nIn inter-group relationships, anger makes people think in more negative and prejudiced terms about outsiders. Anger makes people less trusting, and slower to attribute good qualities to outsiders.\nWhen a group is in conflict with a rival group, it will feel more anger if it is the politically stronger group and less anger when it is the weaker.\nUnlike other negative emotions like sadness and fear, angry people are more likely to demonstrate correspondence bias \u2013 the tendency to blame a person's behavior more on their nature than on their circumstances. They tend to rely more on stereotypes, and pay less attention to details and more attention to the superficial. In this regard, anger is unlike other \"negative\" emotions such as sadness and fear, which promote analytical thinking.\nAn angry person tends to anticipate other events that might cause them anger. They will tend to rate anger-causing events (e.g. being sold a faulty car) as more likely than sad events (e.g. a good friend moving away).\nA person who is angry tends to place more blame on another person for their misery. This can create a feedback, as this extra blame can make the angry person angrier still, so they in turn place yet more blame on the other person.\nWhen people are in a certain emotional state, they tend to pay more attention to, or remember, things that are charged with the same emotion; so it is with anger. For instance, if a person is trying to persuade someone that a tax increase is necessary, if the person is currently feeling angry, they would do better to use an argument that elicits anger (\"more criminals will escape justice\") than, say, an argument that elicits sadness (\"there will be fewer welfare benefits for disabled children\"). Also, unlike other negative emotions, which focus attention on all negative events, anger only focuses attention on anger-causing events.\nAnger can make a person more desiring of an object to which their anger is tied. In a 2010 Dutch study, test subjects were primed to feel anger or fear by being shown an image of an angry or fearful face, and then were shown an image of a random object. When subjects were made to feel angry, they expressed more desire to possess that object than subjects who had been primed to feel fear.\nExpressive strategies.\nAs with any emotion, the display of anger can be feigned or exaggerated. Studies by Hochschild and Sutton have shown that the show of anger is likely to be an effective manipulation strategy in order to change and design attitudes. Anger is a distinct strategy of social influence and its use (e.g. belligerent behaviors) as a goal achievement mechanism proves to be a successful strategy.\nLarissa Tiedens, known for her studies of anger, claimed that expression of feelings would cause a powerful influence not only on the perception of the expresser but also on their power position in the society. She studied the correlation between anger expression and social influence perception. Previous researchers, such as Keating, 1985 have found that people with angry face expression were perceived as powerful and as in a high social position. Similarly, Tiedens et al. have revealed that people who compared scenarios involving an angry and a sad character, attributed a higher social status to the angry character. Tiedens examined in her study whether anger expression promotes status attribution. In other words, whether anger contributes to perceptions or legitimization of others' behaviors. Her findings clearly indicated that participants who were exposed to either an angry or a sad person were inclined to express support for the angry person rather than for a sad one. In addition, it was found that a reason for that decision originates from the fact that the person expressing anger was perceived as an ability owner, and was attributed a certain social status accordingly.\nShowing anger during a negotiation may increase the ability of the anger expresser to succeed in negotiation. A study by Tiedens et al. indicated that the anger expressers were perceived as stubborn, dominant and powerful. In addition, it was found that people were inclined to easily give up to those who were perceived by them as powerful and stubborn, rather than soft and submissive. Based on these findings Sinaceur and Tiedens have found that people conceded more to the angry side rather than for the non-angry one.\nA question raised by Van Kleef et al. based on these findings was whether expression of emotion influences others, since it is known that people use emotional information to conclude about others' limits and match their demands in negotiation accordingly. Van Kleef et al. wanted to explore whether people give up more easily to an angry opponent or to a happy opponent. Findings revealed that participants tended to be more flexible toward an angry opponent compared with a happy opponent. These results strengthen the argument that participants analyze the opponent's emotion to conclude about their limits and carry out their decisions accordingly.\nCoping strategies.\nTherapy and behavioral strategies.\nAccording to Leland R. Beaumont, each instance of anger demands making a choice. A person can respond with hostile action, including overt violence, or they can respond with hostile inaction, such as withdrawing or stonewalling. Other options include initiating a dominance contest; harboring resentment; or working to better understand and constructively resolve the issue.\nAccording to Raymond Novaco, there are a multitude of steps that were researched in attempting to deal with this emotion. In order to manage anger the problems involved in the anger should be discussed, Novaco suggests. The situations leading to anger should be explored by the person.\nConventional therapies for anger involve restructuring thoughts and beliefs to bring about a reduction in anger. These therapies often come within the schools of CBT (or cognitive behavioral therapy) like modern systems such as REBT (rational emotive behavior therapy). Research shows that people with excessive anger often harbor and act on dysfunctional attributions, assumptions and evaluations in specific situations. It has been shown that with therapy by a trained professional, individuals can bring their anger to more manageable levels. The therapy is followed by the so-called \"stress inoculation\" in which the clients are taught relaxation skills to control their arousal and various cognitive controls to exercise on their attention, thoughts, images, and feelings. \"Logic defeats anger, because anger, even when it's justified, can quickly become irrational.\" (American Psychological Association). In other words, although there may be a rational reason to get angry, the frustrated actions of the subject can become irrational. Taking deep breaths is regarded as the first step to calming down. Once the anger has subsided a little, the patient will accept that they are frustrated and move on. Lingering around the source of frustration may bring the rage back.\nThe skills-deficit model states that poor social skills is what renders a person incapable of expressing anger in an appropriate manner. Social skills training has been found to be an effective method for reducing exaggerated anger by offering alternative coping skills to the angry individual. Research has found that persons who are prepared for aversive events find them less threatening, and excitatory reactions are significantly reduced. In a 1981 study, that used modeling, behavior rehearsal, and videotaped feedback to increase anger control skills, showed increases in anger control among aggressive youth in the study. Research conducted with youthful offenders using a social skills training program (aggression replacement training), found significant reductions in anger, and increases in anger control. Research has also found that antisocial personalities are more likely to learn avoidance tasks when the consequences involved obtaining or losing tangible rewards. Learning among antisocial personalities also occurred better when they were involved with high intensity stimulation. Social learning theory states that positive stimulation was not compatible with hostile or aggressive reactions. Anger research has also studied the effects of reducing anger among adults with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), with a social skills program approach that used a low fear and high arousal group setting. This research found that low fear messages were less provocative to the ASPD population, and high positive arousal stimulated their ability to concentrate, and subsequently learn new skills for anger reduction.\nA new integrative approach to anger treatment has been formulated by Fernandez (2010). Termed CBAT, for cognitive behavioral affective therapy, this treatment goes beyond conventional relaxation and reappraisal by adding cognitive and behavioral techniques and supplementing them with effective techniques to deal with the feeling of anger. The techniques are sequenced contingently in three phases of treatment: prevention, intervention, and postvention. In this way, people can be trained to deal with the onset of anger, its progression, and the residual features of anger.\nMedication therapy.\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that certain psychiatric medications may be effective in controlling symptoms of anger, hostility, and irritability. These include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants like sertraline, certain anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, antipsychotics like aripiprazole, risperidone, and olanzapine, and benzodiazepines like midazolam, among others. Another meta-analysis of antidepressants and aggression found no change in aggression in adults and increased aggression in children. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamines as well as the atypical antipsychotic risperidone are useful in reducing aggression and oppositionality in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), antisocial personality disorder, and autism spectrum disorder with moderate to large effect sizes and greater effectiveness than other studied medications. Yet another meta-analysis found that methylphenidate slightly reduced irritability while amphetamines increased the risk of irritability several-fold in children with ADHD. Other research has found no impact of amphetamine or methamphetamine on aggression in humans.\nSuppression.\nModern psychologists point out that suppression of anger may have harmful effects. The suppressed anger may find another outlet, such as a physical symptom, or become more extreme. John W. Fiero cites Los Angeles riots of 1992 as an example of sudden, explosive release of suppressed anger. The anger was then displaced as violence against those who had nothing to do with the matter. There is also the case of Francine Hughes, who suffered 13 years of domestic abuse. Her suppressed anger drove her to kill her abuser husband. It is claimed that a majority of female victims of domestic violence who suppress their aggressive feelings are unable to recognize, experience, and process negative emotion and this has a destabilising influence on their perception of agency in their relationships. Another example of widespread deflection of anger from its actual cause toward scapegoating, Fiero says, was the blaming of Jews for the economic ills of Germany by the Nazis.\nSome psychologists criticized the catharsis theory of aggression, which suggests that releasing pent-up anger reduces aggression. On the other hand, there are experts who maintain that suppression does not eliminate anger since it merely forbids the expression of anger and this is also the case for repression, which merely hides anger from awareness. There are also studies that link suppressed anger and medical conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cancer. Suppressed or repressed anger is found to cause irritable bowel syndrome, eating disorders, and depression among women. Suppression is also referred to as a form of \"self-silencing\", which is described as a cognitive activity wherein an individual monitors the self and eliminate thoughts and feelings that are perceived to be dangerous to relationships. Anger suppression is also associated with higher rates of suicide.\nDual threshold model.\nAnger expression might have negative outcomes for individuals and organizations as well, such as decrease of productivity. and increase of job stress, It could also have positive outcomes, such as increased work motivation, improved relationships and increased mutual understanding (for ex. Tiedens, 2000). A Dual Threshold Model of Anger in organizations by Geddes and Callister, (2007) provides an explanation on the valence of anger expression outcomes. The model suggests that organizational norms establish emotion thresholds that may be crossed when employees feel anger. The first \"expression threshold\" is crossed when an organizational member conveys felt anger to individuals at work who are associated with or able to address the anger-provoking situation. The second \"impropriety threshold\" is crossed if or when organizational members go too far while expressing anger such that observers and other company personnel find their actions socially and/or culturally inappropriate.\nThe higher probability of negative outcomes from workplace anger likely will occur in either of two situations. The first is when organizational members suppress rather than express their anger\u2014that is, they fail to cross the \"expression threshold\". In this instance personnel who might be able to address or resolve the anger-provoking condition or event remain unaware of the problem, allowing it to continue, along with the affected individual's anger. The second is when organizational members cross both thresholds\u2014\"double cross\"\u2014 displaying anger that is perceived as deviant. In such cases the angry person is seen as the problem\u2014increasing chances of organizational sanctions against him or her while diverting attention away from the initial anger-provoking incident. In contrast, a higher probability of positive outcomes from workplace anger expression likely will occur when one's expressed anger stays in the space between the expression and impropriety thresholds. Here, one expresses anger in a way fellow organizational members find acceptable, prompting exchanges and discussions that may help resolve concerns to the satisfaction of all parties involved. This space between the thresholds varies among different organizations and also can be changed in organization itself: when the change is directed to support anger displays; the space between the thresholds will be expanded and when the change is directed to suppressing such displays; the space will be reduced.\nPhysiology.\nNeuroscience has shown that emotions are generated by multiple structures in the brain. The rapid, minimal, and evaluative processing of the emotional significance of the sensory data is done when the data passes through the amygdala in its travel from the sensory organs along certain neural pathways towards the limbic forebrain. Emotion caused by discrimination of stimulus features, thoughts, or memories occurs when its information is relayed from the thalamus to the neocortex. Based on some statistical analysis, some scholars have suggested that the tendency for anger may be genetic. Distinguishing between genetic and environmental factors requires further research and actual measurement of specific genes and environments.\nIn neuroimaging studies of anger, the most consistently activated region of the brain was the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. This region is associated with approach motivation and positive affective processes.\nThe external expression of anger can be found in physiological responses, facial expressions, body language, and at times in public acts of aggression. The rib cage tenses and breathing through the nose becomes faster, deeper, and irregular. Anger activates the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. The catecholamine activation is more strongly norepinephrine than epinephrine. Heart rate and blood pressure increase. Blood flows to the hands. Perspiration increases (particularly when the anger is intense). The face flushes. The nostrils flare. The jaw tenses. The brow muscles move inward and downward, fixing a hard stare on the target. The arms are raised and a squared-off stance is adopted. The body is mobilized for immediate action, often manifesting as a subjective sense of strength, self-assurance, and potency. This may encourage the impulse to strike out.\nMeasuring anger.\nThe Gallup World Poll.\nEvery year, Gallup asks people in over 140 countries, \"did you experience anger during a lot of the day yesterday?\" In 2021, Gallup found that 23% of adults experienced a lot of anger, which is up from 18% in 2014. The countries that experienced the most anger were Lebanon, Turkey, Armenia, Iraq, and Afghanistan; the countries that experience the least anger were Finland, Mauritius, Estonia, Portugal, and the Netherlands.\nSelf-reports of Psychological Anger.\nThe most common way to measure anger has been through the use of self-report measures. It is currently thought there are just under 50 measures of psychological anger.\nThe Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory and the Novaco Anger Scale and Provocation Inventory are widely recognized and frequently used self-report measures for assessing anger, focusing on various aspects of anger expression including outward, inward, and controlled expressions. Additionally, various anger scales draw on different perspectives, such as cognitive processes of anger rumination, anger as behavioral and cognitive responses to avoidance, assertion, and social support, cognitive and emotional aspects of irritability, functional and dysfunctional responses and goal-oriented behavior in response to anger, experiences of anger, and positive beliefs about anger. Some approaches even consider anger as being reciprocally related to frustration and hostility.\nIn 2023, a study revealed that the relationships between 46 subscales of publicly available self-report measures of anger suggest five primary factors. These factors suggest a model of five key dimensions to anger; anger-arousal, anger-rumination, frustration-discomfort, anger-regulation, and socially constituted anger. The proposed five-factor model is based on various theoretical contexts and provides a useful framework for examining the distinct domains of anger.\nThe study suggests a number of existing subscales that can be used to measure these five domains of anger.\nPhilosophical perspectives.\nAncient history.\nAncient Greek philosophers, describing and commenting on the uncontrolled anger, particularly toward slaves, in their society generally showed a hostile attitude towards anger. Galen and Seneca regarded anger as a kind of madness. They all rejected the spontaneous, uncontrolled fits of anger and agreed on both the possibility and value of controlling anger. There were disagreements regarding the value of anger. For Seneca, anger was \"worthless even for war\". Seneca believed that the disciplined Roman army was regularly able to beat the Germans, who were known for their fury. He argued that \"...in sporting contests, it is a mistake to become angry\".\nAristotle on the other hand, ascribed some value to anger that has arisen from perceived injustice because it is useful for preventing injustice. Furthermore, the opposite of anger is a kind of insensibility, Aristotle stated. The difference in people's temperaments was generally viewed as a result of the different mix of qualities or humors people contained. Seneca held that \"red-haired and red-faced people are hot-tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors\". Ancient philosophers rarely refer to women's anger at all, according to Simon Kemp and K.T. Strongman perhaps because their works were not intended for women. Some of them that discuss it, such as Seneca, considered women to be more prone to anger than men.\nControl methods.\nSeneca addresses the question of mastering anger in three parts: 1. how to avoid becoming angry in the first place 2. how to cease being angry and 3. how to deal with anger in others. Seneca suggests, to avoid becoming angry in the first place, that the many faults of anger should be repeatedly remembered. One should avoid being too busy or dealing with anger-provoking people. Unnecessary hunger or thirst should be avoided and soothing music be listened to. To cease being angry, Seneca suggests &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSeneca further advises daily self-inquisition about one's bad habit. To deal with anger in others, Seneca suggests that the best reaction is to keep calm. A certain kind of deception, Seneca says, is necessary in dealing with angry people.\nGalen repeats Seneca's points but adds a new one: finding a guide and teacher can help the person in controlling their passions. Galen also gives some hints for finding a good teacher. Both Seneca and Galen (and later philosophers) agree that the process of controlling anger should start in childhood on grounds of malleability. Seneca warns that this education should not blunt the spirit of the children nor should they be humiliated or treated severely. At the same time, they should not be pampered. Children, Seneca says, should learn not to beat their playmates and not to become angry with them. Seneca also advises that children's requests should not be granted when they are angry.\nPost-classical history.\nDuring the period of the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages, philosophers elaborated on the existing conception of anger, many of whom did not make major contributions to the concept. For example, many medieval philosophers such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Roger Bacon and Thomas Aquinas agreed with ancient philosophers that animals cannot become angry. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (Algazel), who often disagreed with Aristotle and Ibn Sina on many issues, argued that animals do possess anger as one of the three \"powers\" in their heart, the other two being appetite and impulse. He also argued that animal will is \"conditioned by anger and appetite\" in contrast to human will which is \"conditioned by the intellect\". A common medieval belief was that those prone to anger had an excess of yellow bile or choler (hence the word \"choleric\"). \nBy gender.\nWrath was sinful because of the social problems it caused, sometimes even homicide. It served to ignore those who are present, contradicts those who are absent, produces insults, and responds harshly to insults that are received. Aristotle felt that anger or wrath was a natural outburst of self-defense in situations where people felt they had been wronged. Aquinas felt that if anger was justified, it was not a sin. For example, \"He that is angry without cause, shall be in danger; but he that is angry with cause, shall not be in danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked. Therefore to be angry is not always an evil.\"\nThe concept of wrath contributed to a definition of gender and power. Many medieval authors in 1200 agreed the differences between men and women were based on complexion, shape, and disposition. Complexion involved the balance of the four fundamental qualities of heat, coldness, moistness, and dryness. When various combinations of these qualities are made they define groups of certain people as well as individuals. Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen all agreed on that, in terms of biology and sexual differentiation, heat was the most important of the qualities because it determined shape and disposition. Disposition included a balance of the previous four qualities, the four elements and the four humors. For example, the element of fire shared the qualities of heat and dryness: fire dominated in yellow bile or choler, meaning a choleric person was more or hot and dry than others. Hot and dry individuals were active, dominant, and aggressive. The opposite was true with the element of water. Water, is cold and moist, related closely to phlegm: people with more phlegmatic personalities were passive and submissive. While these trait clusters varied from individual to individual most authors in the Middle Ages assumed certain clusters of traits characterized men more than women and vice versa.\nWomen.\nScholars posted that females were seen by authors in the Middle Ages to be more phlegmatic (cold and wet) than males, meaning females were more sedentary and passive than males. Women's passive nature appeared \"natural\" due to their lack of power when compared to men. Aristotle identified traits he believed women shared: female, feminine, passive, focused on matter, inactive, and inferior. Thus medieval women were supposed to act submissively toward men and relinquish control to their husbands.\nMen.\nMedieval scholars believed most men were choleric, or hot and dry. Thus they were dominant and aggressive. (Barton) Aristotle also identified characteristics of men: male, masculine, active, focused on form, potent, outstanding, and superior. Men were aware of the power they held. Given their choleric \"nature\", men exhibited hot temperatures and were quick to anger. Peter of Albano once said, \"The male's spirit, is lively, given to violent impulse; [it is] slow getting angry and slower being calmed.\" Medieval ideas of gender assumed men were more rational than women. Masculinity involved a wide range of possible behaviors, and men were not angry all the time. Every man's humoral balance was different, some men were strong, others weak, also some more prone to wrath than others. There are those who view anger as a manly act. For instance, David Brakke maintained:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;because anger motivated a man to action in righting wrongs to himself and others, because its opposite appeared to be passivity in the face of challenges from other males, because \u2013 to put it simply \u2013 it raised the body's temperature, anger appeared to be a characteristic of masculinity, a sign that a man was indeed a manly man.\nControl methods.\nMaimonides considered being given to uncontrollable passions as a kind of illness. Like Galen, Maimonides suggested seeking out a philosopher for curing this illness just as one seeks out a physician for curing bodily illnesses. Roger Bacon elaborates Seneca's advices. Many medieval writers discuss at length the evils of anger and the virtues of temperance. In a discussion of confession, John Mirk, an English 14th-century Augustinian writer, tells priests how to advise the penitent by considering the spiritual and social consequences of anger:\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn \"The Canon of Medicine\", Ibn Sina (Avicenna) modified the theory of temperaments and argued that anger heralded the transition of melancholia to mania, and explained that humidity inside the head can contribute to such mood disorders.\nOn the other hand, Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi classified anger (along with aggression) as a type of neurosis, while al-Ghazali argued that anger takes form in rage, indignation and revenge, and that \"the powers of the soul become balanced if it keeps anger under control\".\nModern perspectives.\nImmanuel Kant rejects revenge as vicious. Regarding the latter, David Hume argues that because \"anger and hatred are passions inherent in our very frame and constitution, the lack of them is sometimes evidence of weakness and imbecility\". Martha Nussbaum has also agreed that even \"great injustice\" is no \"excuse for childish and undisciplined behavior\". Two main differences between the modern understanding and ancient understanding of anger can be detected, Kemp and Strongman state: one is that early philosophers were not concerned with possible harmful effects of the suppression of anger; the other is that, recently, studies of anger take the issue of gender differences into account. Soraya Chemaly has in contrast argued that anger is \"a critically useful and positive emotion\" which \"warns us, as humans, that something is wrong and needs to change\" when \"being threatened with indignity, physical harm, humiliation and unfairness\" and therefore \"a powerful force for political good\". Furthermore, she argues that women and minorities are not allowed to be angry to the same extent as white men. In a similar vein, Rebecca Traister has argued that holding back anger has been an impediment to the progress of women's rights.\nThe American psychologist Albert Ellis has suggested that anger, rage, and fury partly have roots in the philosophical meanings and assumptions through which human beings interpret transgression. According to Ellis, these emotions are often associated and related to the leaning humans have to absolutistically depreciating and damning other peoples' humanity when their personal rules and domain are transgressed.\nReligious perspectives.\nJudaism.\nIn Judaism, anger is a negative trait. In the Book of Genesis, Jacob condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons Simon and Levi: \"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel.\"\nRestraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable, as Ethics of the Fathers states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ben Zoma said:\nWho is strong? He who subdues his evil inclination, as it is stated,\n\"He who is slow to anger is better than a strong man, and he who masters his passions is better than one who conquers a city\" (Proverbs 16:32).\nMaimonides rules that one who becomes angry is as though that person had worshipped idols. Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains that the parallel between anger and idol worship is that by becoming angry, one shows a disregard of Divine Providence \u2013 whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from Above \u2013 and that through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of God in one's life.\nIn its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt, the \"Kitzur Shulchan Aruch\" states: \"Anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs. You should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry.\"\nIn modern writings, Rabbi Harold Kushner finds no grounds for anger toward God because \"our misfortunes are none of His doing\". In contrast to Kushner's reading of the Bible, David Blumenthal finds an \"abusing God\" whose \"sometimes evil\" actions evoke vigorous protest, but without severing the protester's relationship with God.\nChristianity.\nBoth Catholic and Protestant writers have addressed anger in different perspectives. Anger among mortals is typically seen as a sin, though this contrasts against the righteous wrath of God.\nCatholic.\n\"Wrath\" is one of the Seven Deadly Sins in Catholicism; and yet the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (canons 1772 and 1773) that anger is among the passions, and that \"in the passions, as movements of the sensitive appetite, there is neither good nor evil\". The neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it is directed against an innocent person, when it is unduly unbending or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. \"If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin\" (CCC 2302). Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil, and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm (CCC 2302-03).\nMedieval Christianity vigorously denounced wrath as one of the seven cardinal, or deadly sins, but some Christian writers at times regarded the anger caused by injustice as having some value. Saint Basil viewed anger as a \"reprehensible temporary madness\". Joseph F. Delany in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1914) defines anger as \"the desire of vengeance\" and states that a reasonable vengeance and passion is ethical and praiseworthy. Vengeance is sinful when it exceeds its limits in which case it becomes opposed to justice and charity. For example, \"vengeance upon one who has not deserved it, or to a greater extent than it has been deserved, or in conflict with the dispositions of law, or from an improper motive\" are all sinful. An unduly vehement vengeance is considered a venial sin unless it seriously goes counter to the love of God or of one's neighbor.\nA more positive view of anger is espoused by Roman Catholic pastoral theologian Henri J.M. Nouwen. Father Nouwen points to the spiritual benefits in anger toward God as found in both the Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible. In the Bible, says Father Nouwen, \"it is clear that only by expressing our anger and hatred directly to God will we come to know the fullness of both his love and our freedom\".\nGeorges Bernanos illustrates Nouwen's position in his novel \"The Diary of a Country Priest\". The countess gave birth to the son she had long wanted, but the child died. She was fiercely angry. When the priest called, the countess vented her anger toward her daughter and husband, then at the priest who responded gently, \"open your heart to [God]\". The countess rejoined, \"I've ceased to bother about God. When you've forced me to admit that I hate Him, will you be any better off?\" The priest continued, \"you no longer hate Him. Hate is indifference and contempt. Now at last you're face to face with Him... Shake your fist at Him, spit in His face, scourge Him.\" The countess did what the priest counseled. By confessing her hate, she was enabled to say, \"all's well\".\nProtestant.\nEveryone experiences anger, Andrew D. Lester observes, and furthermore anger can serve as \"a spiritual friend, a spiritual guide, and a spiritual ally\". Denying and suppressing anger is contrary to St. Paul's admonition in his Epistle to the Ephesians 4:26. When anger toward God is denied and suppressed, it interferes with an individual's relation with God. Expressing one's anger toward God can deepen the relationship. C. FitzSimons Allison holds that \"we worship God by expressing our honest anger at him\".\nBiblical scholar Leonard Pine concludes from his studies in the Book of Habakkuk that \"far from being a sin, proper remonstration with God is the activity of a healthy faith relationship with Him\". Other biblical examples of anger toward God include the following:\nHinduism.\nIn Hinduism, anger is equated with sorrow as a form of unrequited desire. The objects of anger are perceived as a hindrance to the gratification of the desires of the angry person. Alternatively if one thinks one is superior, the result is grief. Anger is considered to be packed with more evil power than desire. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna regards greed, anger, and lust as signs of ignorance that lead to perpetual bondage. As for the agitations of the bickering mind, they are divided into two divisions. The first is called avirodha-pr\u012bti, or unrestricted attachment, and the other is called virodha-yukta-krodha, anger arising from frustration. Adherence to the philosophy of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs, belief in the fruitive results of the karma-v\u0101d\u012bs, and belief in plans based on materialistic desires are called avirodha-pr\u012bti.\nJ\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs, karm\u012bs and materialistic planmakers generally attract the attention of conditioned souls, but when the materialists cannot fulfill their plans and when their devices are frustrated, they become angry. Frustration of material desires produces anger.\nBuddhism.\nAnger is defined in Buddhism as: \"being unable to bear the object, or the intention to cause harm to the object\". Anger is seen as aversion with a stronger exaggeration, and is listed as one of the five hindrances. Buddhist monks, such as Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetans in exile, sometimes get angry. Most often a spiritual person is aware of the emotion and the way it can be handled. Thus, in response to the question: \"Is any anger acceptable in Buddhism?' the Dalai Lama answered: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Buddhism in general teaches that anger is a destructive emotion and although anger might have some positive effects in terms of survival or moral outrage, I do not accept that anger of any kind as [\"sic\"] a virtuous emotion nor aggression as constructive behavior. The Gautama Buddha [\"sic\"] has taught that there are three basic kleshas at the root of samsara (bondage, illusion) and the vicious cycle of rebirth. These are greed, hatred, and delusion\u2014also translatable as attachment, anger, and ignorance. They bring us confusion and misery rather than peace, happiness, and fulfillment. It is in our own self-interest to purify and transform them. \nBuddhist scholar and author Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has also explained Buddha's teaching on the spiritual imperative to identify anger and overcome it by transforming difficulties:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When things go wrong in our life and we encounter difficult situations, we tend to regard the situation itself as our problem, but in reality whatever problems we experience come from the side of the mind. If we responded to difficult situations with a positive or peaceful mind they would not be problems for us. Eventually, we might even regard them as challenges or opportunities for growth and development. Problems arise only if we respond to difficulties with a negative state of mind. Therefore if we want to be free from problems, we must transform our mind.\nThe Buddha himself on anger:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAn angry person is ugly &amp; sleeps poorly. Gaining a profit, he turns it into a loss, having done damage with word &amp; deed. A person overwhelmed with anger destroys his wealth. Maddened with anger, he destroys his status. Relatives, friends, &amp; colleagues avoid him. Anger brings loss. Anger inflames the mind. He doesn't realize that his danger is born from within. An angry person doesn't know his own benefit. An angry person doesn't see the Dharma. A man conquered by anger is in a mass of darkness. He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good, but later, when his anger is gone, he suffers as if burned with fire. He is spoiled, blotted out, like fire enveloped in smoke. When anger spreads, when a man becomes angry, he has no shame, no fear of evil, is not respectful in speech. For a person overcome with anger, nothing gives light.\nIslam.\nA verse in the third surah of the Quran instructs people to restrain their anger.\nAnger (Arabic: \u063a\u0636\u0628, \"ghadab\") in Islam is considered to be instigated by Satan (\"Shaitan\"). Factors stated to lead to anger include selfishness, arrogance and excessive ambition. Islamic teachings also state that anger hinders the faith (\"iman\") of a person. The Quran attributes anger to prophets and believers as well as Muhammad's enemies. It mentions the anger of Moses (\"Musa\") against his people for worshiping a golden calf and at the moment when Moses strikes an Egyptian for fighting against an Israelite. The anger of Jonah (\"Yunus\") is also mentioned in the Quran, which led to his departure from the people of Nineveh and his eventual realization of his error and his repentance. The removal of anger from the hearts of believers by God (Arabic: \"\") after the fighting against Muhammad's enemies is over. In general, suppression of anger (Arabic: \u0643\u064e\u0638\u0645, \"kazm\") is deemed a praiseworthy quality in the hadis. Ibn Abdil Barr, the Andalusian Maliki jurist explains that controlling anger is the door way for restraining other blameworthy traits ego and envy, since these two are less powerful than anger. The hadis state various ways to diminish, prevent and control anger. One of these methods is to perform a ritual ablution, a different narration states that the angry person should lie down and other narrations instruct the angry person to invoke God and seek refuge from the Devil, by reciting \"I take refuge with Allah/God from the accursed Devil.\"\nAli, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad said \"A moment of patience in a moment of anger saves a thousand moments of regret\" and \"Anger begins with madness, and ends in regret.\"\nDivine retribution.\nIn many religions, anger is frequently attributed to God or gods. Primitive people held that gods were subject to anger and revenge in anthropomorphic fashion. The Hebrew Bible says that opposition to God's will results in God's anger. Reform rabbi Kaufmann Kohler explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Christians believe in God's anger at the sight of evil. This anger is not inconsistent with God's love, as demonstrated in the Gospel where the righteous indignation of Christ is shown in the Cleansing of the Temple.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArticles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68674", "revid": "36788768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68674", "title": "Anise", "text": "Species of flowering plant\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnise (; ), also called aniseed or rarely anix, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae native to the eastern Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia.\nThe flavor and aroma of its seeds have similarities with some other spices and herbs, such as star anise, fennel, liquorice, and tarragon. It is widely cultivated and used to flavor food, candy, and alcoholic drinks, especially around the Mediterranean.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"anise\" is derived via Old French from the Latin words or from Greek \"\u00e1n\u0113thon\" referring to dill.\nAn obsolete English word for anise is \"anet\", also coming from \"an\u012bsum\".\nBotany.\nAnise is an herbaceous annual plant growing to or more. The leaves at the base of the plant are simple, long and shallowly lobed, while leaves higher on the stems are feathery or lacy, pinnate, divided into numerous small leaflets.\nBoth leaves and flowers are produced in large, loose clusters. The flowers are either white or yellow, approximately in diameter, produced in dense umbels.\nThe fruit is a dry oblong and curved schizocarp, long, usually called \"aniseed\".\nEcology.\nAnise is a food plant for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths), including the lime-speck pug and wormwood pug.\nCultivation.\nAnise was first cultivated in Egypt and the Middle East, and was brought to Europe for its medicinal value. It has been cultivated in Egypt for approximately 4,000 years.\nAnise plants grow best in light, fertile, well-drained soil. The seeds should be planted as soon as the ground warms up in spring. Because the plants have a taproot, they do not transplant well after being established so they should either be started in their final location or be transplanted while the seedlings are still small.\nProduction.\nWestern cuisines have long used anise to flavor dishes, drinks, and candies. The word is used for both the species of herb and its licorice-like flavor. The most powerful flavor component of the essential oil of anise, anethole, is found in both anise and an unrelated spice indigenous to South China called star anise (\"Illicium verum\") widely used in South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian dishes. Star anise is considerably less expensive to produce and has gradually displaced \"P. anisum\" in Western markets. While formerly produced in larger quantities, by 1999 world production of the essential oil of anise was 8 tons, compared to 400 tons of star anise.\nUses.\nComposition.\nAs with all spices, the composition of anise varies considerably with origin and cultivation method. These are typical values for the main constituents.\nMoisture: 9\u201313%\nProtein: 18%\nFatty oil: 8\u201323%\nEssential oil: 2\u20137%\nStarch: 5%\nN-free extract: 22\u201328%\nCrude fibre: 12\u201325%\nIn particular, the anise seeds products should also contain more than 0.2 milliliter volatile oil per 100 grams of spice.\nCulinary.\nAnise is sweet and aromatic, distinguished by its characteristic flavor. The seeds, whole or ground, are used for preparation of teas and tisanes (alone or in combination with other aromatic herbs), as well many regional and ethnic confectioneries, including black jelly beans (often marketed as licorice-flavored), British aniseed balls, aniseed twists and \"troach\" drops, Australian humbugs, New Zealand aniseed wheels, Italian \"pizzelle\" and \"biscotti\", German \"Pfeffern\u00fcsse\" and \"Springerle\", Austrian \"Anisb\u00f6gen\", Dutch \"muisjes\", New Mexican \"bizcochitos\" and Peruvian \"picarones.\"\nThe culinary uses of anise are not limited only to sweets and confections, as it is a key ingredient in Mexican \"atole de an\u00eds\" and \"champurrado\", which is similar to hot chocolate. In India and Pakistan, it is taken as a digestive after meals, used in brines in the Italian region of Apulia and as a flavoring agent in Italian sausage, pepperoni and other Italian processed meat products. The freshly chopped leaves are added to cheese spreads, dips or salads, while roots and stems impart a mild licorice flavor to soups and stews.\nLiquor.\nAnise is used to flavour Greek and Bulgarian ; Italian ; French , , and ; Portuguese which has an aniseed stem in each bottle crystallised with sugar, Spanish , , , and Herbs de Majorca; Turkish and Armenian ; Lebanese, Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, Palestinian and Israeli ; and Algerian . Outside the Mediterranean region, it is found in Colombian and Mexican . These liqueurs are clear, but on addition of water become cloudy, a phenomenon known as the ouzo effect.\nAnise is used together with other herbs and spices in some root beers, such as Virgil's in the United States.\nTraditional medicine.\nThe main use of anise in traditional European herbal medicine was for its carminative effect (reducing flatulence), as noted by John Gerard in his \"Great Herball\", an early encyclopedia of herbal medicine:\nThe seed wasteth and consumeth winde, and is good against belchings and upbraidings of the stomach, alaieth gripings of the belly, provoketh urine gently, maketh abundance of milke, and stirreth up bodily lust: it staieth the laske (diarrhea), and also the white flux (leukorrhea) in women.\nAccording to Pliny the Elder, anise was used as a cure for sleeplessness, chewed with alexanders and a little honey in the morning to freshen the breath, and, when mixed with wine, as a remedy for asp bites (N.H. 20.72). In 19th-century medicine, anise was prepared as ' (\"Water of Anise\") in doses of an ounce or more and as ' (\"Spirit of Anise\") in doses of 5\u201320 minims. In Turkish folk medicine, its seeds have been used as an appetite stimulant, tranquilizer or diuretic.\nEssential oil.\nAnise essential oil can be obtained from the fruits by either steam distillation or extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide. The yield of essential oil is influenced by the growing conditions and extraction process, with supercritical extraction being more efficient. Regardless of the method of isolation the main component of the oil is anethole (80\u201390%), with minor components including 4-anisaldehyde, estragole and pseudoisoeugenyl-2-methylbutyrates amongst others. (Alternately found by Orav et al. 2008 to be 2\u20136% extracted oil by weight of raw seed material, 74\u201394% being \"trans\"-anethole and the remaining fraction estragole (methylchavicol), anisaldehyde and \u03b3-himachalene.) Anethole is responsible for anise's characteristic odor and flavor.\nOther uses.\nBuilders of steam locomotives in Britain incorporated capsules of aniseed oil into white metal plain bearings so the distinctive smell would give warning in case of overheating. Anise can be made into a liquid scent and is used for both drag hunting and fishing. It is put on fishing lures to attract fish.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Yet while having been officially removed from office, he remained as one of the nation's most influential political and social individuals, aided greatly by the fact that his five sons and his son-in-law Caiaphas all served at sometime as High Priests. His death is unrecorded. His son Annas the Younger, also known as Ananus the son of Ananus, was assassinated in AD 66 for advocating peace with Rome.\nEleazar ben Ananus (16\u201317).\nAfter Valerius Gratus deposed Ishmael ben Fabus from the high priesthood, he installed Eleazar ben Ananus, (15\u201416), a descendant of John Hyrcanus. It was a time of turbulence in Jewish politics, with the role of the high priesthood being contended for by several priestly families. Eleazar was likewise deposed by Gratus, who gave the office to Simon ben Camithus (17-18).\nCaiaphas (18\u201336).\nCaiaphas was married to the daughter of Annas (John 18:13). Gratus made him high priest after depriving Simon ben Camithus of the office. The comparatively long eighteen-year tenure of Caiaphas suggests he had established a good working relationship with the Roman authorities. Gratus' successor Pontius Pilate retained him as high priest.\nAnanus ben Ananus (63).\nReferences in the Mosaic Law to \"the death of the high priest\" () suggest that the high-priesthood was ordinarily held for life. Annas was still called \"high priest\" even after his dismissal, along with Caiaphas (), perhaps for that reason. It is also thought that Annas also may have been acting as president of the Sanhedrin, or a coadjutor of the high priest.\nIn the New Testament.\nThe trial of Jesus.\nAlthough Caiaphas was the properly appointed high priest, Annas, being his father-in-law and a former incumbent of the office, he possibly retained some of the power attached to the position. According to the Gospel of John (the event is not mentioned in other accounts), Jesus was first brought before Annas, whose palace was closer. Annas questioned him regarding his disciples and teaching, and then sent him on to Caiaphas, where some members of the Sanhedrin had met, and where in Matthew's account the first trial of Jesus took place ().\nIn the Book of Acts.\nAfter Pentecost, Annas presided over the Sanhedrin before which the Apostles Peter and John were brought ().\nCultural references.\nAnnas has an important role in \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", as one of the two main antagonists of the show (the other being Caiaphas) spurring Pontius Pilate to take action against Jesus. In almost all versions, Annas has a high voice to contrast against Caiaphas' bass. Despite being Caiaphas' father-in-law, Annas is generally played by a younger actor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68676", "revid": "49566734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68676", "title": "Anointing", "text": "Ritual act of putting aromatic oil on a person\nAnointing is the ritual act of pouring aromatic oil over a person's head or entire body. By extension, the term is also applied to related acts of sprinkling, dousing, or smearing a person or object with any perfumed oil, milk, butter, or other fat. Scented oils are used as perfumes and sharing them is an act of hospitality. Their use to introduce a divine influence or presence is recorded from the earliest times; anointing was thus used as a form of medicine, thought to rid persons and things of dangerous spirits and demons which were believed to cause disease.\nIn present usage, \"anointing\" is typically used for ceremonial blessings such as the coronation of European monarchs. This continues an earlier Hebrew practice most famously observed in the anointings of Aaron as high priest and both Saul and David by the prophet Samuel. The concept is important to the figure of the Messiah or the Christ (Hebrew and Greek for \"The Anointed One\") who appear prominently in Jewish and Christian theology and eschatology. Anointing\u2014particularly the anointing of the sick\u2014may also be known as unction; the anointing of the dying as part of last rites in the Catholic church is sometimes specified as \"extreme unction\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName.\nThe present verb derives from the now obsolete adjective \"anoint\", equivalent to \"anointed\". The adjective is first attested in 1303, derived from Old French , the past participle of , from Latin , an intensified form of 'to anoint'. It is thus cognate with \"unction\".\nThe oil used in a ceremonial anointment may be called \"chrism\", from Greek () 'anointing'.\nPurpose.\nAnointing served and serves three distinct purposes: it is regarded as a means of health and comfort, as a token of honor, and as a symbol of consecration. It seems probable that its sanative purposes were enjoyed before it became an object of ceremonial religion, but the custom appears to predate written history and the archaeological record, and its genesis is impossible to determine with certainty.\nHealth.\nUsed in conjunction with bathing, anointment with oil closes pores. It was regarded as counteracting the influence of the sun, reducing sweating. Aromatic oils naturally masked body and other offensive odors.\nApplications of oils and fats are also used as traditional medicines. The Bible records olive oil being applied to the sick and poured into wounds. Known sources date from times when anointment already served a religious function; therefore, anointing was also used to combat the malicious influence of demons in Persia, Armenia, and Greece. Anointing was also understood to \"seal in\" goodness and resist corruption, probably via analogy with the use of a top layer of oil to preserve wine in ancient amphoras, its spoiling usually being credited to demonic influence.\nFor sanitary and religious reasons, the bodies of the dead are sometimes anointed. In medieval and early modern Christianity, the practice was particularly associated with protection against vampires and ghouls who might otherwise take possession of the corpse.\nHospitality.\nAnointing guests with oil as a mark of hospitality and token of honor is recorded in Egypt, Greece, and Rome, as well as in the Hebrew scriptures. It was a common custom among the ancient Hebrews and continued among the Arabs into the 20th century.\nReligion.\nIn the sympathetic magic common to prehistoric and primitive religions, the fat of sacrificial animals and persons is often reckoned as a powerful charm, second to blood as the vehicle and seat of life. East African Arabs traditionally anointed themselves with lion's fat to gain courage and provoke fear in other animals. Australian Aborigines would rub themselves with a human victim's caul fat to gain his powers.\nIn religions like Christianity where animal sacrifice is no longer practiced, it is common to consecrate the oil in a special ceremony.\nEgypt.\nAccording to scholars belonging to the early part of the twentieth century (Wilhelm Spiegelberg, Bonnet, Cothenet, Kutsch, Martin-Pardey) officials of ancient Egypt were anointed as part of a ceremony that installed them into office. This assumption has been questioned by scholars like Stephen Thompson, who doubt such anointing ever existed:After a review of the evidence for the anointing of officials in ancient Egypt as a part of their induction into office, I must conclude that there is no evidence that such a ceremony was ever practiced in ancient Egypt. Attempts to trace the origin of the Hebrew practice of anointing kings to an Egyptian source are misdirected. The only definite case in which an Egyptian king anointed one of his officials is that of EA 51. In this instance, it is probable that Thutmosis III was engaging in a custom common among Asiatics, rather than that he was introducing an Egyptian custom into Syria-PalestineAnointment of the corpse with scented oils was however a well attested practice as an important part of mummification.\nIndia.\nIn Indian religion, late Vedic rituals developed involving the anointing of government officials, worshippers, and idols. These are now known as abhisheka. The practice spread to Indian Buddhists. In modern Hinduism and Jainism, anointment is common, although the practice typically employs water or yoghurt, milk, or (particularly) butter from the holy cow, rather than oil. Many devotees are anointed as an act of consecration or blessing at every stage of life, with rituals accompanying birthing, educational enrollments, religious initiations, and death. New buildings, houses, and ritual instruments are anointed, and some idols are anointed daily. Particular care is taken in such rituals to the \"direction\" of the smearing. People are anointed from head to foot, downwards. The water may derive from one of the holy rivers or be scented with saffron, turmeric, or flower infusions; the waste water produced when cleaning certain idols or when writing certain verses of scripture may also be used. Ointments may include ashes, clay, powdered sandalwood, or herbal pastes.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhist practices of anointing are largely derived from Indian practices but tend to be less elaborate and more ritualized. Buddhists may sprinkle assembled practitioners with water or mark idols of Buddha or the Bodhisattvas with cow or yak butter. Flower-scented water is also used, as are ink-water and \"saffron water\" stained yellow using saffron or turmeric.\nJudaism.\nIn antiquity, use of a holy anointing oil was significant in the Hebrews' consecration of priests, the Kohen Gadol (High Priest), and the sacred vessels. Prophets and the Israelite kings were anointed as well, the kings from a horn. Anointment by the chrism prepared according to the ceremony described in the Book of Exodus was considered to impart the \"Spirit of the Lord\". It was performed by Samuel in place of a coronation of both Saul and David. The practice was not always observed and seems to have been essential only at the consecration of a new line or dynasty.\nBecause of its importance, the High Priest and the king were sometimes called \"the Anointed One\". The term\u2014, \"Mashia\u1e96\"\u2014gave rise to the prophesied figure of the Messiah (\"q.v.\") and a long history of claimants.\nThe expression \"anoint the shield\" which occurs in Isaiah is a related or poetic usage, referring to the practice of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield to keep it supple and fit for war. The practice of anointing a shield predates the anointing of other objects in that the \"smearing\" (Hebrew \"mashiach\") of the shield renewed the leather covering on a wooden shield. A victorious soldier was elevated on his shield by his comrades after a battle or upon his selection as a new king. The idea of protection and selection arose from this and was extended to the idea of a \"chosen one\" thus leading to the modern concept of a Messiah (Hebrew for the one who was anointed.)\nChristianity.\nChristianity developed from the association of Jesus of Nazareth with the Jewish prophecies of an \"Anointed One\". His epithet \"Christ\" is a form of the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew title. He was not anointed by the High Priest in accordance with the ceremony described in Exodus, but he was considered to have been anointed by the Holy Spirit during his baptism. A literal anointing of Jesus also occurs when he was lavishly oiled by Mary of Bethany. Performed out of affection, the anointment is said by Jesus to have been preparation for his burial.\nIn the New Testament, John describes \"anointing from the Holy One\" and \"from Him abides in you\". Both this spiritual anointment and literal anointment with oil are usually associated with the Holy Spirit. Eastern Orthodox churches in particular attach great importance to the oil said to have been originally blessed by the Twelve Apostles.\nThe practice of \"chrismation\" (baptism with oil) appears to have developed in the early church during the later 2nd century as a symbol of Christ, rebirth, and inspiration. The earliest surviving account of such an act seems to be the letter written \"To Autolycus\" by Theophilus, bishop of Antioch. In it, he calls the act \"sweet and useful\", punning on \"khrist\u00f3s\" (, \"anointed\") and \"khr\u0113st\u00f3s\" (, \"useful\"). He seems to go on to say \"wherefore we are called Christians on this account, because we are anointed with the oil of God\", and \"what person on entering into this life or being an athlete is not anointed with oil?\" The practice is also defended by Hippolytus in his \"Commentary on the Song of Songs\" and by Origen in his \"Commentary on Romans\". Origen opines that \"all of us may be baptized in those visible waters and in a visible anointing, in accordance with the form handed down to the churches\".\nAnointing was particularly important among the Gnostics. Many early apocryphal and Gnostic texts state that John the Baptist's baptism by water was incomplete and that anointment with oil is a necessary part of the baptismal process. The Gospel of Philip claims that chrism is superior to baptism, for it is from the word \"chrism\" that we have been called \"Christians\", certainly not from the word \"baptism\". And it is from the \"chrism\" that the \"Christ\" has his name. For the Father anointed the Son, and the Son anointed the apostles, and the apostles anointed us. He who has been anointed possesses everything. He possesses the Resurrection, the Light, the Cross, the Holy Spirit. The Father gave him this in the bridal chamber; he merely accepted the gift. The Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. This is the Kingdom of Heaven. In the Acts of Thomas, the anointing is the beginning of the baptismal ritual and essential to becoming a Christian, as it says God knows his own children by his seal and that the seal is received through the oil. Many such chrismations are described in detail through the work.\nIn medieval and early modern Christianity, the oil from the lamps burnt before the altar of a church was felt to have particular sanctity. New churches and altars were anointed at their four corners during their dedication, as were tombs, gongs, and some other ritual instruments and utensils.\nLatin Catholicism.\nThe Roman Catholic, Anglican and Lutheran Churches bless three types of holy oils for anointing: \"Oil of the Catechumens\" (abbreviated OS, from the Latin , meaning holy oil), \"Oil of the Infirm\" (OI), and \"Sacred Chrism\" (SC). The first two are said to be blessed, while the chrism is consecrated.\nThe Oil of Catechumens is used to people immediately before baptism, whether they are infants or adult catechumens. In the early church converts seeking baptism, known as \"catechumens\", underwent a period of formation known as catechumenate, and during that period of instruction received one or more anointings with the oil of cathecumens for the purpose of expelling evil spirits. Before the 1968 revision of the rite of ordination the ordaining bishop anointed the hands of the new priest with the Oil of Catechumens, The older form is now used only in ordaining members of associations, such as the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter, dedicated to the preservation of the pre-Vatican II liturgy. In the later form, priests, like bishops, are anointed with chrism, the hands of a priest, the head of a bishop. (In the older form, a bishop's hands, as well as the head, are anointed with chrism. The traditional Roman Pontifical also has a rite of coronation of kings and queens including anointing with the Oil of Catechumens. In some countries, as in France, the oil used in that rite was chrism.\nOil of the Infirm is used for administration of the sacrament of anointing of the sick, the ritual treatment of the sick and infirm through what was usually called Extreme Unction in Western Christianity from the late 12th to the late 20th century.\nSacred Chrism is used in the sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and holy orders. It is also used in the dedication of new churches, new altars, and in the consecration of new patens and chalices for use in Mass. In the case of the sacrament of baptism, the subject receives two distinct unctions: one with the oil of catechumens, prior to being baptized, and then, after baptism with water is performed, the subject receives an unction with chrism. In the case of the sacrament of confirmation, anointing with chrism is the essential part of the rite.\nAny bishop may consecrate the holy oils. They normally do so every Holy Thursday at a special \"Chrism Mass\". In the Gelasian sacramentary, the formula for doing so is:\nSend forth, O Lord, we beseech thee, thy Holy Spirit the Paraclete from heaven into this fatness of oil, which thou hast deigned to bring forth out of the green wood for the refreshing of mind and body; and through thy holy benediction may it be for all who anoint with it, taste it, touch it, a safeguard of mind and body, of soul and spirit, for the expulsion of all pains, of every infirmity, of every sickness of mind and body. For with the same thou hast anointed priests, kings, and prophets and martyrs with this thy chrism, perfected by thee, O Lord, blessed, abiding within our bowels in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nOrthodoxy and Greek Catholicism.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, confirmation is known as chrismation. The Mystery of Chrismation is performed immediately after the Mystery of Baptism as part of a single ceremony. The ritual employs the sacred \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;myron\" (, \"chrism\"), which is said to contain a remnant of oil blessed by the Twelve Apostles. In order to maintain the apostolic blessing unbroken, the container is never completely emptied but it is refilled as needed, usually at a ceremony held on Holy Thursday at the Patriarchate of Constantinople or the patriarchal cathedrals of the autocephalous churches. At the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the process is under the care of the \"Archontes Myrepsoi\", lay officials of the patriarchate. Various members of the clergy may also participate in the preparation, but the consecration itself is always performed by the patriarch or a bishop deputed by him for that purpose. The new \"myron\" contains olive oil, myrrh, and numerous spices and perfumes. This \"myron\" is normally kept on the Holy Table or on the Table of Oblation. During chrismation, the \"newly illuminate\" person is anointed by using the \"myron\" to make the sign of the cross on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, lips, both ears, breast, hands, and feet. The priest uses a special brush for this purpose. Prior to the 20th century, the \"myron\" was also used for the anointing of Orthodox monarchs.\nThe oil that is used to anoint the catechumens before baptism is simple olive oil which is blessed by the priest immediately before he pours it into the baptismal font. Then, using his fingers, he takes some of the blessed oil floating on the surface of the baptismal water and anoints the catechumen on the forehead, breast, shoulders, ears, hands, and feet. He then immediately baptizes the catechumen with threefold immersion in the name of the Trinity.\nAnointing of the sick is called the \"Sacred Mystery of Unction\". The practice is used for spiritual ailments as well as physical ones, and the faithful may request unction any number of times at will. In some churches, it is normal for all of the faithful to receive unction during a service on Holy Wednesday of Holy Week. The holy oil used at unction is not stored in the church like the \"myron\", but consecrated anew for each individual service. When an Orthodox Christian dies, if he has received the Mystery of Unction and some of the consecrated oil remains, it is poured over his body just before burial. It is also common to bless using oils which have been blessed either with a simple blessing by a priest (or even a venerated monastic), or by contact with some sacred object, such as relics of a saint, or which has been taken from an oil lamp burning in front of a wonderworking icon or some other shrine.\nIn the Armenian Church, crosses are traditionally not considered holy until they have been anointed and prayed over, thus introducing the Holy Spirit into them. The same ritual was formerly observed in the other Orthodox churches.\nProtestantism.\nOwing to their particular focus upon the action of the Holy Spirit, Pentecostal churches sometimes continue to employ anointing for consecration and ordination of pastors and elders, as well as for healing the sick.\nThe Pentecostal expression \"the anointing breaks the yoke\" derives from a passage in Isaiah which discusses the power given the prophet Hezekiah by the Holy Spirit over the tyrant Sennacherib.\nLatter-day Saints.\nMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints practice anointing with pure, consecrated olive oil in two ways: 1) as a priesthood ordinance in preparation for the administration of a priesthood blessing, and 2) in conjunction with washing as part of the endowment.\nThe Doctrine and Covenants contains numerous references to anointing and administration to the sick by those with authority to perform the laying on of hands. On 21 January 1836, Joseph Smith instituted anointing during the rites of sanctification and consecration preparatory to the rites practiced in the Kirtland Temple. The anointing would prepare church members to receive the endowment of \"power from on high\" promised in an earlier 1831 revelation. At the present time, any holder of the Melchizedek priesthood may anoint the head of an individual by the laying on of hands. Olive oil must be used if available, and it must have been consecrated earlier in a short ordinance that any holder of the Melchizedek priesthood may perform.\nRoyalty.\nIn addition to its use for the Israelite kingship, anointing has been an important ritual in Christian rites of Coronation, especially in Europe. As reported by the jurisconsult Tancredus, initially only the kings of Jerusalem, France, England and Sicily were crowned and anointed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; And [the kings] are both crowned and not, among them, those who are crowned must be anointed: they have this privilege by ancient custom. The others, instead, must not be crowned or anointed: and if they do so unduly it is abuse.\nLater French legend held that a vial of oil, the Holy Ampulla, descended from Heaven to anoint Clovis\u00a0I as the king of the Franks following his conversion to Christianity in 493. The Visigoth Wamba is the earliest Catholic king known to have been anointed, although the practice apparently preceded him in Spain. The ceremony, which closely followed the rite described by the Old Testament., was performed in 672 by Quiricus, the archbishop of Toledo; It was apparently copied a year later when Flavius Paulus defected and joined the Septimanian rebels he had been tasked with quieting. The rite epitomized the Catholic Church's sanctioning the monarch's rule; it was notably employed by usurpers such as Pepin, whose dynasty replaced the Merovingians in 751. While it might be argued that the practice subordinated the king to the church, in practice the sacral anointing of kings was seen as elevating the king to priestly or even saintly status. Lupoi argues that this set in motion the conflicting claims that developed into the Investiture Crisis. At the same time, royal unction recontextualized the elections and popular acclamations still legally responsible for the elevation of new rulers. They were no longer understood as autonomous authorities but merely agents in service of God's will. The nature of anointment was alluded to in Shakespeare's \"Richard II\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Not all the water in the rough rude sea\nCan wash the balm off an anointed king.&lt;/poem&gt;\nNapoleon was reportedly anointed in the presence of the Pope at his coronation.\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy, the anointing of a new king is considered a Sacred Mystery. The act is believed to empower him\u2014through the grace of the Holy Spirit\u2014with the ability to discharge his divinely appointed duties, particularly his ministry in defending the faith. The same \"myron\" used in Chrismation is used for the ceremony. In Russian Orthodox ceremonial, the anointing took place during the coronation of the tsar towards the end of the service, just before his receipt of Holy Communion. The sovereign and his consort were escorted to the Holy Doors (Iconostasis) of the cathedral and jointly anointed by the metropolitan. Afterwards, the tsar was taken alone through the Holy Doors\u2014an action normally reserved only for priests\u2014and received communion at a small table set next to the Holy Table.\nIn the present day, royal unction is less common, being practiced only upon the monarchs of Britain and of Tonga. The utensils for the practice are sometimes reckoned as regalia, like the ampulla and spoon used in the Kingdom of France and the anointing horns used in Sweden and Norway. The Biblical formula is not necessarily followed. For the 1626 coronation of King Charles I of England, the holy oil was made of a concoction of orange, jasmine, distilled roses, distilled cinnamon, and ben oil.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68679", "revid": "23939382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68679", "title": "Antipatris", "text": "First century BCE city\nAntipatris (, ) was a city built during the first century BC by Herod the Great, who named it in honour of his father, Antipater. The site, now a national park in central Israel, was inhabited from the Chalcolithic period to the Late Roman period. The remains of Antipatris are known in Modern Hebrew as Tel Afek (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05ea\u05dc \u05d0\u05e4\u05e7\u200e), and in Arabic as Khulat R\u0101s al-\u2018Ayn ('castle of the head of the spring'), after the nearby riverhead of the Yarkon. It has been identified as either the tower of \"Aphek\" mentioned by Josephus, or the biblical Aphek, best known from the story of the Battle of Aphek. During the Crusader period the site was known as Surdi fontes, \"Silent springs\". The Ottoman fortress known as Binar Bashi or Ras al-Ayn was built there in the 16th century.\nAntipatris/Tel Afek lies at the strong perennial springs of the Yarkon River, which throughout history has created an obstacle between the hill country to the east and the Mediterranean to the west, forcing travellers and armies to pass through the narrow Afek Pass between the springs and the foothills of Samaria. This gave the location of Antipatris/Tel Afek its strategic importance.\nAntipatris was situated on the Roman road from Caesarea Maritima to Jerusalem, north of the town of Lod where the road turned eastwards towards Jerusalem. During the British Mandate, a water pumping station was built there to channel water from the Yarkon to Jerusalem.\nToday the remains of Antipatris are located roughly between Petah Tikva and the towns of Kafr Qasim and Rosh HaAyin (literally \"headspring\"), south of Hod HaSharon.\nHistory.\nAphek.\nThe Bronze Age saw the construction of defensive walls, to wide, and a series of palaces. One of these is described as an Egyptian governor residence of the 15th century BC, and within, an array of cuneiform tablets were found. Philistine ware is found in the site in 12th century BC layers.\nMost scholars agree that there were more than one Aphek. While Tel-Aphek (Antipatris) is one of them, C.R. Conder identified the Aphek of Eben-Ezer with a ruin (\"Khirbet\") some distant from Dayr Aban (believed to be Eben-Ezer), and known by the name \"Marj al-Fikiya\"; the name \"al-Fikiya\" being an Arabic corruption of Aphek. Eusebius, when writing about Eben-ezer in his \"Onomasticon\", says that it is \"the place from which the Gentiles seized the Ark, between Jerusalem and Ascalon, near the village of Bethsamys (Beit Shemesh),\" a locale that corresponds with Conder's identification.\nThe historian Josephus mentions a certain tower called \"Aphek\", not far from Antipatris, and which was burnt by a contingent of Roman soldiers.\nAntipatris.\nAntipatris was a city built by Herod the Great, and named in honor of his father, Antipater II of Judea. It lay between Caesarea Maritima and Lydda, on the great Roman road from Caesarea to Jerusalem, and figures prominently in Roman-era history. Today, the nearby river bears the town's old namesake in Arabic ().\nAccording to Josephus, Antipatris was built on the site of an older town that was formerly called \"Chabarzaba\" (), a place so-named in classical Jewish literature and in the Mosaic of Rehob. During the outbreak of the Jewish war with Rome in 66 CE, the Roman army under Cestius was routed as far as Antipatris.\nPaul the Apostle was brought by night from Jerusalem to Antipatris and next day from there to Caesarea Maritima, to stand trial before the governor Antonius Felix; see Acts of the Apostles 23:31-32\nIn 363, the city was badly damaged by an earthquake. Only one of the early bishops of the Christian bishopric of Antipatris, a suffragan of Caesarea, is mentioned by name in extant documentation: Polychronius, who was present both at the Robber Council of Ephesus in 449 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451. No longer a residential bishopric, Antipatris is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. \nOn 27 April 750, the Abbasid general Abd Allah ibn Ali, uncle of Caliph al-Saffah (r.\u2009750\u00a0\u2013\u00a0754), marched to Antipatris ('Abu Futrus'). There, he summoned around eighty members of the Umayyad dynasty, whom the Abbasids had toppled earlier that year, with promises of fair surrender terms, only to have them massacred.\nOttoman Ras al-Ayn.\nOttoman records indicate that a Mamluk fortress may have stood on the site. However, the Ottoman fortress was built following the publication of a firman in AD 1573 (981 H.):\"You have sent a letter and have reported that four walls of the fortress Ras al-Ayn have been built, [..] I have commanded that when [this firman] arrives you shall [..have built] the above mentioned rooms and mosque with its minaret and have the guards remove the earth outside and clean and tidy [the place].\nThe Turkish name of the place and fortress, \"p\u0131nar ba\u015f\u0131\", means \"fountain-head\" or simply \"head of the springs\", much like the Arabic and Hebrew names (Ras al-Ayin and Rosh ha-Ayin, \"head of the springs\"). Pronounced by Arabic-speakers, it became \"Binar Bashi\" (Arabic has no \"p\").\nThe fortress was built to protect a vulnerable stretch of the Cairo-Damascus highway (the Via Maris), and was provided with 100 horsemen and 30 foot soldiers. The fortress was also supposed to supply soldiers to protect the hajj route. The fortress is a massive rectangular enclosure with four corner towers and a gate at the centre of the west side. The south-west tower is octagonal, while the three other towers have a square ground plan.\nIt appeared named \"Chateau de Ras el Ain\" on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled in 1799.\nThe Arab peasants deserted the village in the 1920s.\nYarkon-Tel Afek national park.\nCurrently, the site of Antipatris is included in the national park \"Yarkon-Tel Afek\", under the jurisdiction of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, incorporating the area of the Ottoman fortress, the remains of the Roman city and the British water pumping station.\nExcavation.\nArea A.\nThe earliest winepresses discovered to date in the Southern Levant were excavated adjoining the governor's residency at Tel Aphek, dated to the 13th century BC, the reign of Ramesses II. The two winepresses were plastered and possessed two treading floors (Hebrew: \"gat elyonah\", \u201cupper vat\u201d) in parallel configuration extending over 6 m\u00b2. Beneath and next to these, the stone-lined plastered collection vats (Hebrew: \"gat tahtonah\", \u201clower vat\u201d) could each store over 3 m\u00b3, or 3,000 litres, of pressed grape juice. Canaanite amphorae were recovered still in situ at the bottom of each pit, while a midden of grape skins, seeds and other debris was discovered adjacent to the installations [Kochavi 1981:81]. The excavator has drawn attention to the proximity of these winepresses to the Residency, their large size and the fact that ancient winepresses were normally located outside settlements amongst the vineyards suggesting that the Egyptian administration supervised the viniculturists of the Sharon closely [Kochavi 1990:XXIII].\nTrade links and relations.\nIt is clear that Tel Aphek was a site not only at the centre of imperial administration, but also well-connected to the international trade in luxury goods, as reflected in the abundant finds of Cypriot and Mycenaean ceramics.\nIllustrative of Cypro-Canaanite trade especially is a fragmentary amphora handle [Aphek 5/29277], clearly inscribed \"after firing\" with Sign 38 of the Cypro-Minoan Linear Script [Yasur-Landau and Goren 2004]. The handle was excavated from secondary deposition in Aphek Area X, Locus 2953, belonging to the very meagre Stratum X11 built over the Governor's Residency. An extreme likelihood exists, therefore, that the object belonged to the earlier, more prosperous Stratum XI2 of the Residency itself. Given the as-yet-undeciphered nature of the script, the precise significance of the post-firing addition of a Cypro-Minoan sign must remain uncertain. At minimum the sign indicates that individuals employing Cypro-Minoan script handled the vessel from which the handle derived. Combined with petrographic analysis of the clay employed in manufacturing the amphora\u2014pointing to an origin in or within the vicinity of Akko\u2014the readiest reconstruction from the evidence must be that the vessel (and any companions) was manufactured in the Akko region before shipping, \"either\" to such redistribution points as Tell Abu Hawam or Tel Nami, \"or\" (more likely) to Cyprus itself (perhaps \"via\" one of these ports), where it was likely emptied of its original contents\u2014certainly marked\u2014\"before\" being shipped back to the Levant (now probably containing Cypriot product) and achieving final deposition at Aphek.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city is also the seat of the eponymous municipality. It is located slightly inland from the northwest corner of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, about from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2020, it had a population of 921,770 while its metropolitan area, which also includes the cities of Kanas\u00edn and Um\u00e1n, had a population of 1,316,090.\nM\u00e9rida is also the cultural and financial capital of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The city's rich cultural heritage is a product of the syncretism of the Maya and Spanish cultures during the colonial era. The Cathedral of M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n was built in the late 16th century with stones from nearby Maya ruins and is the oldest cathedral in the mainland Americas. The city has the third largest old town district on the continent. It was the first city to be named American Capital of Culture, and the only city that has received the title twice.\nM\u00e9rida is among the safest cities of Mexico as well as in the Americas. In 2015, the city was certified as an International Safe Community by the Karolinska Institute of Sweden for its high level of public security. \"Forbes\" has ranked M\u00e9rida three times as one of the three best cities in Mexico to live, invest and do business. In 2022, the UN-Habitat's City Prosperity Index recognized M\u00e9rida as the city with the highest quality of life in Mexico.\nNickname.\nM\u00e9rida was named after M\u00e9rida, Spain because the Maya ruins that the Spanish conquistadors found in the settlement of Ti'ho reminded them of the Roman ruins of Augusta Emerita. Over time, the city acquired the nickname \"La Ciudad Blanca\" (The White City). This nickname may be due to the white color of the limestone used to paint the fa\u00e7ades of the city's colonial buildings. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the city can be seen from outer space as a large whitish area in the middle of the immense green forest that covers the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Other cities in Hispanic America share the same nickname for this reason, like Arequipa and Popayan. Folktale says that the name go back to the founding of the city when the Spanish conquistadors \u2013 motivated by security reasons and given the persistent rebellion of the indigenous Maya people \u2013 decided to allow only white-skinned Europeans to live in the city. Old arches at the entrance to the city would have been built for this reason, and beyond these were the Indigenous communities. However, the first arches were not commissioned until 1690, almost 150 years after the city's foundation. The arch of San Juan and the one on 59th street marked the beginning of roads to Campeche and Izamal, respectively. Other arches served only decorative purposes, like the one Juan Quijano had erected in 1760 in front of his house at the intersection of 65th and 56th streets, which has since been demolished. Additionally, the Nahua indigenous troops who accompanied Montejo's troops in the conquest of Yucat\u00e1n settled in the neighborhoods of San Crist\u00f3bal, Santiago, and San Rom\u00e1n, where they enjoyed the privilege of exemption from taxes for their military assistance.\nHistory.\nM\u00e9rida was founded in 1542 by the Spanish conquistadors, including Francisco de Montejo the Younger and Juan de la C\u00e1mara, and named after the town of M\u00e9rida in Extremadura, Spain. It was built on the site of the Maya city of Ti'ho (/t\u02bc\u03c7o\u02bc/), which was also called Ichkanzih\u00f3o or Ichcaanzih\u00f3 (/i\u0283kan'si\u03c7o/; \"City of Five Hills\") in reference to its pyramids. Many of the carved stones of the ruins of ancient Ti'ho were used in the construction of the early Spanish buildings of M\u00e9rida. These stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, M\u00e9rida was a walled city designed to protect the \"peninsulares\" and criollos from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya people.\nIn the late 19th century, the area surrounding M\u00e9rida prospered from the cultivation of henequen, the fiber of which was used in the production of rope and twine, as well as for the production of \"licor del henequ\u00e9n\", a traditional Mexican alcoholic drink. By the beginning of the 20th century, manufacturing focused mainly on tobacco, molasses, rum, soap, and leather products. Korean immigration to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucat\u00e1n from the city of Jemulpo. These first Korean immigrants settled around M\u00e9rida as workers in henequen plantations.\nIn August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. The city has been host to two bilateral United States \u2013 Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton \u2013 Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W. Bush \u2013 Felipe Calder\u00f3n, which resulted in the creation of the M\u00e9rida Initiative). M\u00e9rida hosted the VI Summit of Association of Caribbean States in April 2014. In recent years, important sports competitions have been held in M\u00e9rida, such as the World Cup of the World Archery Federation. The city has also hosted important scientific meetings such as the International Cosmic Ray Conference.\nGeography.\nM\u00e9rida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucat\u00e1n, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. To the north is Progreso and the Gulf of Mexico. Valladolid and Tizim\u00edn are to the east, Celest\u00fan is to the west, and the city of Campeche is located to the southwest. There are many important Maya archae sites in the area, including Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Oxkintok, Sayil and Kabah.\nThe city is located near the center of the Chicxulub Crater. It has a very flat topography and is only above sea level. The land outside of M\u00e9rida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields. Almost no surface water exists, but several cenotes (sinkholes that provide access to underground springs and rivers) are found in the area.\nM\u00e9rida has a \"centro hist\u00f3rico\" typical of colonial Spanish cities. The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east\u2013west and even-numbered streets running north\u2013south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the \"Plaza Grande\" in the heart of the city. The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south.\nClimate.\nM\u00e9rida features a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Aw\"). The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. M\u00e9rida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is , ranging from in December to in May, but temperatures often rise above in the afternoon during this period. Low temperatures range between in January to in May. It is most often a few degrees hotter in M\u00e9rida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.\nGovernance.\nM\u00e9rida is the capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. The offices of the governor of Yucat\u00e1n, the Congress of Yucat\u00e1n, and the Superior Court of Justice of Yucat\u00e1n are all located within the city.\nThe municipal government is invested under the authority of a City Council (\"Ayuntamiento\") which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located in the historic center of the city. The City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (\"regidores\") and trustees (\"s\u00edndicos\"). Ren\u00e1n Barrera Concha became Mayor on September 1, 2018.\nEconomy.\nThe Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, in particular the capital city M\u00e9rida, is in a prime coastal location which allows for economic growth. M\u00e9rida has been a popular location for investment. This, in turn, has allowed the Yucat\u00e1n economy to grow at three times the rate of the national average.\nIn addition, the World Bank Group's Ease of Doing Business Index ranked M\u00e9rida fourth nationally in the category of ease of starting a business.\nScience and technology.\nThe city is home to important national and local research institutes, like the Yucatan Scientific Research Center (\"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica de Yucat\u00e1n\", CICY) of the National Council of Science and Technology (\"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda\", Conacyt), a unit of the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (\"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados\", CINVESTAV Unidad M\u00e9rida), the Dr. Hideyo Noguchi Regional Research Center (\"Centro de Investigaciones Regionales Dr. Hideyo Noguchi\") of the Autonomous University of Yucatan (CIR-UADY), the Yucat\u00e1n Science and Technology Park (\"Parque Cient\u00edfico Tecnol\u00f3gico de Yucat\u00e1n\", PCYTY) and the Peninsular Center for Humanities and Social Sciences (\"Centro Peninsular en Humanidades y Ciencias Sociales\", CEPHCIS) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).\nCulture.\nM\u00e9rida has served as the American Capital of Culture in the years 2000 and 2017.\nAs the state and regional capital, M\u00e9rida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. M\u00e9rida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue Paseo de Montejo is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in M\u00e9rida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for 10 months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.\nM\u00e9rida and the state of Yucat\u00e1n have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Maya culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Maya tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Maya culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Maya/Catholic Day of the Dead celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings. \"M\u00fakbil pollo\" (pronounced/'myk\u03b2il p\u02b0o\u028eo\u02c0/) is the Maya tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate. Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead. And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air. (\"Muk-bil\" literally means \"to put in the ground\" or to cook in a \"pib\", an underground oven).\nFor English speakers or would-be speakers, M\u00e9rida has the M\u00e9rida English Library, a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.\nM\u00e9rida is also home to the Yucat\u00e1n Symphony Orchestra, which plays regular seasons at the Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f3n Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.\nFood.\nYucat\u00e1n food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider \"Mexican\" food. It includes influences from the local Maya cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucat\u00e1n cuisine.\nThere are many regional dishes. Some of them are:\nAchiote is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard annatto seed found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called \"recado rojo\". The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, Mexican oregano, cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.\nHot sauce in M\u00e9rida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucat\u00e1n, and Chile Habanero.\nLanguage and accent.\nThe Spanish language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the Yucatec Maya language, which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucat\u00e1n. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and \"sh\" sounds (represented by the letter \"x\" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the \"correct\" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.\nDue to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.\nApart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.\nMain sights.\nHistoric sites.\nModern M\u00e9rida has expanded far beyond its original city walls, and many old Spanish colonial buildings and several old city gates can still be seen in the \"centro hist\u00f3rico\", which is among the largest in the Americas. Many large and elaborate homes from the early 20th century still line the main avenue called \"Paseo de Montejo\". For example, \"Las Casas Gemelas\" (The Twin Houses) are two side-by-side French and Spanish style mansions completed in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto C\u00e1mara Zavala. Owned by the Barbachano and Molina M\u00e9ndez families, they are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. During the Porfiriato, the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted aristocrats including Princess Grace and Prince Ranier, as well as first lady of the U.S., Jacqueline Kennedy.\nThe Cathedral of M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, dating to 1598, was the first cathedral in continental North Am\u00e9rica.\nSports.\nThe Leones de Yucat\u00e1n baseball team has played in the Mexican League since 1954 (with two interrputions), where it has won five championships. The Parque Kukulc\u00e1n Alamo has been its home stadium since 1982.\nThe Venados F.C. currently plays in the Liga de Expansi\u00f3n MX, the second-tier soccer league, with home games at the Estadio Carlos Iturralde.\nThe Mayas de Yucat\u00e1n basketball team played at the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional from 2006 to 2008. Its homes games were played at the Gimnasio Polifuncional.\nOther sports facilities include the Poliforum Zamna and the Complejo Deportivo La Inal\u00e1mbrica.\nThe city is home to the M\u00e9rida Marathon, held each year since 1986.\nTransportation.\nBus.\nCity service is mostly provided by four local transportation companies: Uni\u00f3n de Camioneros de Yucat\u00e1n (UCY), Alianza de Camioneros de Yucat\u00e1n (ACY), R\u00e1pidos de M\u00e9rida, and Minis 2000. Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like Guadalajara or Mexico City. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.\nAs of 2024 the privately owned city bus system is being replaced by a new municipal system called \"Va y Ven\".\nIe-Tram Yucat\u00e1n is a bus rapid transit (BRT) system opening in December 2023.\nThe main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class (ADO) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucat\u00e1n with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.\nTaxis.\nSeveral groups and unions offer taxi transportation: Frente \u00danico de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Uni\u00f3n de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotax\u00edmetros de Yucat\u00e1n, among others. Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.\nTaxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved down along the road, or called in by radio. Unlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.\nAnother type of taxi service is called \"Colectivo\". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.\nUber, DiDi, and inDrive also offer services in M\u00e9rida.\nAir.\nM\u00e9rida (IATA: MID, ICAO: MMMD) is serviced by Manuel Crescencio Rej\u00f3n International Airport with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto. As of 2006[ [update]] more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007). The airport is under ASUR administration.\nTrain.\nM\u00e9rida was the hub of an extensive narrow gauge railway network that operated in the states of Yucat\u00e1n and Campeche beginning in 1902. This system was merged into Ferrocarriles Unidos del Sureste in 1975, and later merged into Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab. In 2016, The Secretary of Communications and Transportation revoked the concession.\nCurrent passenger train service to M\u00e9rida is provided by Tren Maya which runs from Palenque, Chiapas to Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo, continuing on to Playa del Carmen. It stops at Teya M\u00e9rida railway station, east of the city.\nRoads.\nMain roads in and out of M\u00e9rida:\nEducation.\nIn 2000, the M\u00e9rida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 junior high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 high schools and 16 universities/higher education schools. M\u00e9rida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction. Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15. Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.\nEducation in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous people are at the bottom of these strata and this can be represented in the type of education the children receive. The upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs. Most private schools are in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent. A statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities is \"In Yucatan only 8.9% of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high.\"\nMany laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between Spanish speakers and Mayan speakers as the \"Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee \u2013 guarantee, not just try, not just attempt \u2013 that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents.\" There is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school. The system for indigenous education serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area. Many Maya\n children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may drop out early in their education.\nThere are several state institutions offering higher education including:\nAmong several private institutions:\nM\u00e9rida has several national research centers including the\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located in the western-central part of the Iberian Peninsula at 217 metres above sea level, the city is crossed by the Guadiana and Albarregas rivers. The population was 60,119 in 2017.\nThe primitive settlement was founded by the Roman Empire as Augusta Emerita in the 1st century BCE to allocate discharged soldiers, eventually prospering as one of the largest cities of Hispania and the capital of the province of Lusitania. Its ecclesiastical metropolitan seat was taken away by the Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela in 1119. Conquered by the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n in 1230, shortly before the latter's final integration into the Crown of Castile, it was handed over to the Order of Santiago. On numerous occasions over the course of the middle ages and the Modern Period, it suffered from the effects of warfare due to its location close to the border with Portugal.\nEtymology.\nThe place name of \"M\u00e9rida\" derives from the Latin \"Emerita\", with a meaning of \"retired\" or \"veteran\". It is part of the name that the city received after its foundation by the emperor Augustus in 25 BC, \"Augusta Emerita\", colony in which veteran soldiers or emeritus settled.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nM\u00e9rida has been populated since prehistoric times, as demonstrated by a prestigious hoard of gold jewellery excavated from a girl's grave in 1870. Consisting of two penannular bracelets, an armlet, and a chain of six spiral wire rings, the hoard is now preserved at the British Museum.\nAntiquity.\nThe town was founded in 25 BC under the name \"Emerita Augusta\" (meaning \"veterans of Augustus\"), by order of Emperor Augustus, to settle discharged soldiers of the V Alaudae and X Gemina. Established to guard a strategic pass and the Guadiana river bridge, it quickly became one of the most important cities in Roman Hispania. It was the capital of the Lusitania province and later, in the 4th century, served as the capital of the Diocese of Hispania.\n\"Emerita Augusta\" was also a terminus of the V\u00eda de la Plata (Silver Way), a key Roman route connecting the gold mines near \"Asturica Augusta\" with the south of the Iberian Peninsula. M\u00e9rida preserves more major Roman monuments than any other city in Spain, including a triumphal arch and the Roman theatre.\nJewish historical tradition, as recorded in Abraham ibn Daud's \"Sefer ha-Qabbala\" (a 12th-century source) holds that a group of noble Jewish exiles arrived in M\u00e9rida following the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. One of these exiles, Baruch, a silk craftsman, is described as the progenitor of the influential Albalia family of medieval C\u00f3rdoba.\nIn 409, during the invasion of Iberia, the city became the capital of the short-lived Kingdom of the Alans under King Attaces. His death in 418 in battle against the Visigoths led to the city's absorption into the neighboring Vandal kingdom. In 469, it was taken by the Visigoths and remained an important city in the Visigothic Kingdom.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn 713, M\u00e9rida was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate under Musa ibn Nusayr and became the capital of the Cora of M\u00e9rida. The Arabs reused and expanded many Roman buildings, notably the Alcazaba fortress. In the 9th century, the Mozarabs of M\u00e9rida frequently rebelled against the Caliphate, contributing to the city\u2019s gradual decline. During the Fitna of al-Andalus, M\u00e9rida became part of the Taifa of Badajoz.\nIn the early 13th century, under Almohad control, M\u00e9rida supported the rival leader Ibn Hud. In 1230, it was conquered by Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n and returned to Christian rule. The city then became the seat of the priory of San Marcos de Le\u00f3n of the Order of Santiago. A period of recovery began in the 15th century following the unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile, aided by Alonso de C\u00e1rdenas, Grand Master of the Order.\nModern times.\nIn 1720, M\u00e9rida became the capital of the Intendencia of M\u00e9rida. The city is also located along the V\u00eda de la Plata route of the Camino de Santiago, offering an alternative to the more widely known French Way.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, many of M\u00e9rida\u2019s historic monuments were damaged or destroyed. In the aftermath, the city developed as a railway hub and underwent significant industrialization.\nOn 10 August 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, M\u00e9rida was captured by Nationalist forces in the Battle of M\u00e9rida.\nIn modern times, M\u00e9rida became the capital of the autonomous community of Extremadura in 1983. It also serves as the ecclesiastical seat of the Archdiocese of M\u00e9rida-Badajoz. The city's archaeological site was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993.\nThe current mayor (since 2015) is Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Osuna of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.\nClimate.\nM\u00e9rida has a Mediterranean climate with Atlantic influences (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\"; Trewartha: \"Csak\"), due to the proximity of the Portuguese coast. The winters are mild, with minimum temperature rarely below , and summers are hot with maximum temperatures occasionally exceeding .\nPrecipitation is normally between annually. The months with most rainfall are November and December. Summers are dry, and in M\u00e9rida, as in the rest of southern Spain, cycles of drought are common, ranging in duration from 2 to 5 years.\nIn autumn the climate is more changeable than in the rest of the year. Storms occur with some frequency, but the weather is often dry.\nBoth humidity and winds are low. However, there is frequent fog, especially in the central months of autumn and winter.\nAnnual Events.\nEmerita Lvdica.\nEach year the city holds a week-long event to celebrate the Roman history of the area. The \"games\" \"(lvdica)\" include scheduled events throughout the city during the day and into M\u00e9rida's comfortable evenings. They include parades, brightly-costumed attendees, fiercely-armored gladiators, mock battles in the ancient amphitheater, plus some simulation of the daily life in that period. The schedule is roughly the last week of May until the first weekend in June and should be checked in advance by visiting the city's schedule of events page.\nCulture.\nMain sights.\nAmong the remaining Roman monuments are:\nThe Puente Romano, a bridge over the Guadiana River that is still used by pedestrians, and the longest of all existing Roman bridges. Annexed is a fortification (the \"Alcazaba\"), built by the Muslim emir Abd ar-Rahman II in 835 on the Roman walls and Roman-Visigothic edifices in the area. The court houses Roman mosaics, while underground is a Visigothic cistern.\nOther sights include:\nSeveral notable buildings were built more recently, including the Escuela de la Administraci\u00f3n P\u00fablica (Public Administration College), the Consejer\u00edas y Asamblea de Junta de Extremadura (councils and parliament of Extremadura), the Agenc\u00eda de la Vivienda de Extremadura (Housing Agency of Extremadura), the Biblioteca del Estado (State Library), the Palacio de Congresos y Exposiciones (auditorium), the Factor\u00eda de Ocio y Creaci\u00f3n Joven (cultural and leisure center for youth), the Complejo Cultural Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s (cultural centre), the Ciudad Deportiva (sports city), the Universidad de M\u00e9rida (M\u00e9rida University), the Confederaci\u00f3n Hidrografica del Guadiana (Guadiana Hydrographic Confederation designed by Rafael Moneo), the Lusitania Bridge over the Guadiana River designed by Santiago Calatrava), the Palacio de Justicia (Justice Hall), etc.\nSport.\nAD M\u00e9rida is the principal football team of the city, founded in 2013 as a successor to M\u00e9rida UD, which itself was a successor to CP M\u00e9rida. The last of these teams played two seasons in Spain's top division, La Liga, in the late 1990s.\nAll three clubs played at the city's 14,600-capacity Estadio Romano. On 9 September 2009, it hosted the Spanish national team as they defeated Estonia 3\u20130 to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which they went on to win. Mayor of M\u00e9rida \u00c1ngel Calle said, \"We want to use the Estonia match to promote M\u00e9rida and Extremadura, we will welcome the players as if they were 21st-century gladiators.\"\nTransport.\nThe nearest airport to the city is Badajoz Airport, located west of Merida.\nInternational relations.\nM\u00e9rida is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68685", "revid": "9337959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68685", "title": "Bobby Robson", "text": "English footballer and manager (1933\u20132009)\nSir Robert William Robson (18 February 1933 \u2013 31 July 2009) was an English football player and coach. His career included periods playing for and later managing the England national team and being a UEFA Cup-winning manager at Ipswich Town.\nRobson's professional playing career as an inside forward spanned nearly 20 years, during which he played for three clubs: Fulham, West Bromwich Albion, and, briefly, Vancouver Royals. He also made 20 appearances for England, scoring four goals. After his playing career, he found success as both a club and international manager, winning league championships in both the Netherlands and Portugal, earning trophies in England and Spain, and taking England to the semi-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, which remained the national team's best run in a World Cup since 1966 until they reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup. His last management role was as a mentor to the manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, while his final official club job was at boyhood club Newcastle United, whom he left in 2004. He held several managerial positions outside of England, most notably one year at Barcelona in 1996\u201397, as well as stints at PSV, Sporting CP and Porto.\nRobson was created a Knight Bachelor in 2002, was inducted as a member of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003, and was the honorary president of Ipswich Town. From 1991 onwards, he had recurrent medical problems with cancer, and in March 2008, put his name and efforts into the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, a cancer research charity which had raised over \u00a312\u00a0million as of March 2018. In August 2008, his lung cancer was confirmed to be terminal; he said, \"My condition is described as static and has not altered since my last bout of chemotherapy... I am going to die sooner rather than later. But then everyone has to go sometime and I have enjoyed every minute.\" He died just under a year later, in July 2009.\nEarly life.\nBobby Robson was born on 18 February 1933 in Sacriston, County Durham, the fourth of five sons of Philip and Lilian Robson (n\u00e9e Watt). When he was a few months old, Robson's family moved to the nearby village of Langley Park where his father was a coal miner. Their two-bedroom house had no bath and an outside toilet. As a boy, he was often taken by his father to watch Newcastle United play at St James' Park on Saturday afternoons, requiring a 34-mile round trip. Robson described Jackie Milburn and Len Shackleton as his childhood heroes. Both played for Newcastle in the inside-forward position, the position Robson would later assume during his playing career.\nRobson attended Langley Park Primary School and then Waterhouses secondary modern school, after failing his eleven-plus but the headmaster did not allow the school football team to join a league. Instead, he began to play for Langley Park Juniors on Saturday mornings at age 11, and by the time he was 15, he was representing the club at under-18 level. Robson played football whenever he possibly could but left school aged 15 to start work as an electrician's apprentice for the National Coal Board in the Langley Park colliery. In May 1950, Bill Dodgin, the manager of Fulham, made a personal visit to the Robson household to offer Bobby a professional contract. Despite being offered a contract by nearby Middlesbrough, the offer made by Dodgin was too attractive to turn down, so he signed for Fulham and moved to London, playing as a wing half and inside forward. Robson had also interested his beloved Newcastle, but he opted to join Fulham as, in his opinion, \"Newcastle made no appreciable effort to secure [my] signature.\" He also thought he stood a better chance of breaking into the first team at Fulham. Robson had partial deafness in one ear, which rendered him ineligible to be called up for national service.\nPlaying career.\nClub playing career.\nAlthough Robson had signed professionally, his father insisted he continue to work as an electrician. He spent the day working at the Festival of Britain site and trained three nights a week at Fulham. Eventually, this took its toll on Robson and he gave up his trade for full-time professional football.\nIn 1950, Robson made his first-team debut for Fulham, recently promoted to the First Division, in a match against Sheffield Wednesday. He came to regard Fulham as \"a nice club, a social club...\", but \"never... a serious, championship-challenging club\". Indeed, he and Fulham were relegated from the top-flight in the 1951\u201352 season, but he made his return to the First Division, four years later, when he signed for Vic Buckingham's West Bromwich Albion in March 1956. The transfer fee of \u00a325,000 was a club record for West Brom at the time.\nHe made his West Brom debut in a 4\u20130 home defeat to Manchester City on 10 March 1956. In 1957\u201358, he was the club's top league goalscorer; his tally of 24 goals included four in a 5\u20131 win against Burnley. Often playing as a midfielder, he went on to play 257 matches and score 61 goals for West Brom, and he captained the team for the 1960\u201361 and 1961\u201362 seasons. However, in August 1962, he returned to Fulham after a disagreement with West Brom vice-chairman Jim Gaunt over his salary. The ongoing dispute over both minimum and maximum wages in the game, instigated by Robson's teammate Jimmy Hill and the Professional Footballers' Association, combined with the birth of Robson's second son, prompted Robson to demand a higher salary. Gaunt refused to negotiate Robson's contract, so Robson placed a transfer request and was sold to Fulham for \u00a320,000 in a deal which doubled his salary. Soon after Robson joined Fulham, the club sold Alan Mullery and Rodney Marsh, meaning Robson's chances of securing any significant honour there were substantially reduced. Robson himself stated, \"In all my time as a footballer, I didn't win a thing.\"\nDespite press reports of interest from Arsenal, and the offer of a player-manager role by Southend United, Robson left Fulham in 1967 and accepted a three-year deal with Canada's Vancouver Royals. He was to be player-manager in their inaugural 1968 season in the North American Soccer League (NASL) and believed it \"was a chance too good to miss\". He began scouting and holding tryout camps for the new team in late 1967. The position proved difficult; a long-distance joint-ownership agreement gave the Hungarian footballer Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s control over the San Francisco section of the squad, while Robson took care of the Vancouver squad. Robson was dissatisfied by this situation and when, in January 1968, Fulham offered him a contract as their manager, he accepted the position at Craven Cottage.\nInternational playing career.\nDuring his first spell at Fulham, Robson participated in two ambassadorial Football Association tours in the West Indies in 1955 and South Africa in 1956. However, it was during his time at West Bromwich Albion that he graduated to the full England squad, with his first call-up in 1956. His manager, Vic Buckingham, advocated the \"push and run\" approach to the game, a precursor to \"total football\", and playing this, Robson graduated to the full England squad in 1956, It was also at West Brom when Robson met future England international and assistant coach Don Howe.\nRobson went on to make 20 appearances for the England national team, making his debut in a November 1957 victory against France, scoring twice in a 4\u20130 victory. Although he made a successful debut, he was dropped for England's next match, against Scotland, in favour of Bobby Charlton. However, Robson was selected for the 1958 FIFA World Cup squad, ahead of Nat Lofthouse and Stanley Matthews, but returned from host nation Sweden disappointed after England were defeated by the Soviet Union in a group play-off match.\nFollowing the World Cup, Robson became an established member of the England squad, enjoying considerable success in a period between October 1960 and March 1961 when he played in six England victories, including scoring a goal in the record 9\u20133 defeat of Scotland at Wembley Stadium. He was selected for the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile, but an injury to his ankle sustained in a pre-tournament friendly against a Chilean club side ruled him out of most of the tournament. As Robson recalled, \"I never played for England again... my international career was unfulfilled.\" His place in the England team was taken by Bobby Moore.\nManagerial career.\nEarly club management.\nIn 1959, the then England manager and the Football Association (FA) director of coaching, Walter Winterbottom, suggested to Robson that he take a coaching course at Lilleshall. He obtained coaching qualifications during his second spell at Fulham, and coached Oxford University A.F.C. Robson made his debut as a manager in January 1968 at his former club Fulham, against Macclesfield Town, then in the Cheshire County League, in the third round of the FA Cup. Fulham were struggling with 16 points from 24 matches. Despite the acquisition of the young Malcolm Macdonald, Robson could not save the club from relegation to the Second Division, and he left them in November with the club sitting eighth in the Second Division. He discovered he had been sacked not from the club itself, but from the headline \"Robson sacked\" on an \"Evening Standard\" placard outside Putney station.\nIpswich Town.\nRobson moved on to Ipswich Town in 1969 and it was there that he established his reputation as a successful manager, supported by the club chairman John Cobbold and then later by his brother Patrick Cobbold. He was offered the vacant job at the Suffolk club after a chance encounter with Town director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton.\nAfter four mediocre seasons, Robson led Ipswich to fourth place in the First Division and success in the Texaco Cup in the 1972\u201373 season. In the following nine seasons, Ipswich finished lower than sixth place in the First Division only once, in the 1977\u201378 season. However, that season was a success with a 1\u20130 victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup final. His reign at Ipswich lasted 13 years, during which time the club twice finished as League runners-up, and made regular appearances in European competitions, winning the UEFA Cup in 1981 with a 5\u20134 aggregate victory over Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar. About that team, Robson said: \"We played with two strikers, no wingers, Eric Gates sitting off the front two, two semi-wide midfield players in Arnold Muhren and Frans Thijssen and Johnny Wark sitting in the holding role\". During his 13-year tenure, he brought in only 14 players from other clubs, most notably Allan Hunter, Bryan Hamilton and Paul Mariner, relying instead on players developed through Ipswich's youth programmes, including Terry Butcher, George Burley, John Wark, Mick Mills, Colin Viljoen, Alan Brazil, Trevor Whymark, Brian Talbot, Kevin Beattie and Eric Gates, who all went on to play international football. His imports included Dutch players Frans Thijssen and Arnold M\u00fchren. Robson \"was not a tactical genius\" but he \"showed a talent for developing new players, with his good interpersonal skills, caring attitude, hard work and enthusiasm helping them to achieve their best\".\nIn 2002, in recognition of his achievements with the club, a life-size statue of Robson was unveiled opposite the Cobbold Stand of Ipswich Town's ground, Portman Road. On 7 July 2006, Robson was named as honorary president of Ipswich Town Football Club, the first since Lady Blanche Cobbold who had died in 1987.\nEngland manager.\nRobson's achievements with Ipswich earned him a job offer from the Football Association for the position of national coach in July 1982, and he declined an offer of a ten-year contract extension and increased salary from Ipswich director Patrick Cobbold. On 7 July 1982, two days after England were knocked out of the 1982 World Cup, he succeeded Ron Greenwood as coach of the England national team, selecting former West Bromwich Albion teammate Don Howe as his chief coach.\nRobson's first match in charge saw immediate controversy, as he dropped Kevin Keegan for the match against Denmark. On 21 September 1983, Robson suffered his only loss in the 28 qualifying matches he was to undertake as England manager. The defeat, again to Denmark, ultimately led to England's failure to qualify for the 1984 European Championships and resulted in Robson offering to resign in favour of Brian Clough. The resignation was rejected by FA chairman Bert Millichip (primarily down to his and the FA's disdain for the controversial and outspoken Clough), and Robson went on to lead the England team to qualify for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.\nEngland made a slow start at the World Cup, and captain Bryan Robson was injured with a recurrence of a dislocated shoulder. Bobby Robson changed the team's tactics for the final match of the first round, selecting Peter Beardsley ahead of Mark Hateley as a strike partner for Gary Lineker. The team won its next two matches, against Poland and Paraguay, 3\u20130, and qualified for the quarter-finals. England were defeated in the last eight by Argentina with a brace of goals from Diego Maradona, the infamous \"Hand of God\" goal and the \"Goal of the Century\" he scored five minutes later. Robson was unimpressed by Maradona's claim of divine intervention:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It wasn't the hand of God. It was the hand of a rascal. God had nothing to do with it... That day, Maradona was diminished in my eyes forever.\nRobson's England dropped only one point in qualifying for Euro 1988, which included an 8\u20130 victory over Turkey. However, this was followed by failure at the tournament itself, held in West Germany, where England were eliminated in the group stage. They finished bottom of their group, succumbing to defeats against the Republic of Ireland, the eventual winners, the Netherlands, and the eventual runners-up, the Soviet Union. Robson was vilified by the British press, and after a draw in a friendly with Saudi Arabia in November 1988, one newspaper demanded, \"In the name of Allah, go.\" Again Robson submitted his resignation, and again it was rejected by Millichip (again the FA's unwillingness to offer the job to Brian Clough is often cited as a reason).\nRobson led England without conceding a goal through the six-match qualification for the 1990 World Cup where they were one of six seeded teams. Again they were placed in a group with the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, with Egypt the fourth side. As in the 1986 World Cup, Robson was denied the service of his captain, Bryan Robson, who injured his achilles tendon which prevented him playing in the latter stages of the tournament. England topped their group, accumulating four points from their three matches. However, their progress was not without controversy. England changed formation from their traditional 4\u20134\u20132 to 5\u20133\u20132 incorporating a sweeper, with some sources suggesting this was due to player revolt after the 1\u20131 draw in the first match with the Republic of Ireland. Robson denied this claim:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...I made the switch, not them. I had no intention of allowing van Basten and Gullit to rip holes in us...\nThis was followed by victories over Belgium and Cameroon in the knock-out stages, to set up a semi-final with West Germany. England lost the match on a penalty shoot-out, after the score had been tied at 1\u20131 following extra time. Robson said afterwards: \"[N]ot a day goes by when [he] does not think about the semi-final and other choices [he] might have made.\" Robson was the second coach, after Alf Ramsey, to take England to a World Cup semi-final, and the first coach to do so on foreign soil, an achievement not equalled until Gareth Southgate's team reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup.\nRobson's final game in charge of England was the third-place play off against hosts Italy, which England lost 2\u20131. He then took on the role as manager of PSV Eindhoven, and Graham Taylor was announced as his successor.\nEuropean club management.\nBefore the 1990 World Cup, the FA told Robson it would not renew his contract as England manager, so he moved to the Netherlands to coach PSV Eindhoven, succeeding manager Guus Hiddink, who had left the team after leading them to European Cup victory and four consecutive Eredivisie titles. PSV sought a manager capable of instilling discipline into a fractious squad, much as Hiddink had done previously. Robson described the move as \"a culture shock\" but felt \"a sense of adventure\". News of Robson's new position in the Netherlands became public before the start of the 1990 World Cup, leading to tabloid stories impugning Robson's patriotism; he sued \"Today\" for calling him a \"traitor\".\nThe Dutch penchant for tactical debate surprised Robson. In an interview with \"Voetbal International\", he lamented: \"An English pro accepts the manager's decision. After every match here, the substitutes come and visit me.\" Another of his challenges at PSV was handling the Brazilian international Rom\u00e1rio. Robson became frustrated with the Brazilian's work ethic, although admitted \"in some matches he would be scintillating\". Robson arranged showdown talks with Rom\u00e1rio, with Frank Arnesen, Robson's assistant, acting as a translator. The talks proved unsuccessful, with Rom\u00e1rio unwilling to change his lifestyle. Despite this, PSV won the Eredivisie in both the 1990\u201391 and 1991\u201392 seasons. However, the team did not make the progress expected by the board in European competitions and Robson was informed he would be leaving the club at the end of the 1991\u201392 season.\nRobson moved to Sporting CP in July 1992, where his Portuguese interpreter was a young Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Robson guided the club to a third-place finish in his first season in charge while admitting the club was in \"a terrible state\". He described the club's president as a \"loose cannon\" who frequently signed players without Robson's consent. Robson was sacked in December 1993, with the club sitting at the top of the league table. Club president Sousa Cintra cited the club's early exit from the UEFA Cup, at the hands of Casino Salzburg, as the reason for his dismissal.\nSporting CP's rivals Porto quickly hired Robson, with Mourinho appointed as his assistant manager. Living in the same apartment block at the time was another future Porto, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur manager, the young Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, who, aged 16, introduced himself to Robson. Robson subsequently appointed Villas-Boas to work in the Porto observation department and helped him gain his UEFA \"C\" coaching badge in Scotland, despite him technically being ineligible as he was aged 17. Porto were in a poor state when Robson arrived and the average attendance had dwindled to 10,000. The club promptly went on to beat Robson's former club, Sporting CP, in the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal final, following that achievement with successive League titles in the 1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396 seasons.\nSuch was the impact of Robson at Porto, he became known to the locals as \"Bobby Five-O\" in honour of the number of matches Porto won 5\u20130, and he signed a new contract with the club in 1995. Robson had melanoma and missed the first few months of the 1995\u201396 season. He still successfully led Porto in defence of their league title.\nA phone call during the summer of 1996 from Barcelona vice-president Joan Gaspart to discuss Lu\u00eds Figo resulted in an offer of employment with the Spanish club. Robson took over in July 1996, where again his assistant was Mourinho; Robson had made Mourinho's move with him to the Camp Nou a condition of his employment. One of the key decisions Robson made during his brief tenure at Barcelona was the US$19.5\u00a0million signing of Ronaldo, who was influential in a season when Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Robson himself was voted European Manager of the Year for 1996\u201397, while Ronaldo stated, \"as a trainer without doubt [Robson] is one of the greatest in the world\".\nThe 1997\u201398 season saw Robson moved \"upstairs\" to the general manager position, with Louis van Gaal taking over as manager, but Robson stayed in this position for only one season before returning to manage PSV on a short-term deal for the 1998\u201399 season. PSV missed out on the league title, finishing third behind Feyenoord and Willem II, but Robson still led the club to victory in the Johan Cruyff Shield and also qualification for the UEFA Champions League on the last day of the season.\nReturn to England.\nAfter Robson's contract with PSV expired, he returned to England to take up a position in the Football Association's technical department. Following the resignation of Ruud Gullit as Newcastle United manager, Robson moved to St James' Park in September 1999. Robson was disappointed with the club's opening salary offer, stating, \"[I]t was miles below the going rate,\" but negotiated a one-year, \u00a31\u00a0million deal.\nIn Robson's first home match in charge, bottom-placed Newcastle faced second bottom Sheffield Wednesday, thrashing them 8\u20130. In his first season in charge, 1999\u20132000, Robson led the club to an 11th-place finish, with 14 wins from his 32 matches in charge. In late 2000, following the resignation of ex-\"Magpies\" boss Kevin Keegan as England manager, the FA asked Newcastle club chairman Freddy Shepherd to permit Robson to take over in a part-time caretaker capacity, but the request was refused. Robson guided Newcastle from bottom of the Premier League to a fourth-place finish in the 2001\u201302 season. The following season, Newcastle finished third, ensuring qualification for the UEFA Champions League for the second consecutive year.\nHowever, Robson was unable to guide Newcastle through the Champions League qualifying rounds, and the club was dropped to participate in the UEFA Cup for the 2003\u201304 season. At the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Newcastle finished fifth in the table, five points short of the Champions League qualifying fourth place but reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup before losing to Marseille.\nRobson held the Newcastle post until 30 August 2004, when he was dismissed by Freddy Shepherd, after a poor start to the Premier League season and alleged discontent in the dressing room. Robson's dismissal followed publication of his off the record observation of his disappointment that only 5,000 fans stayed to see the traditional lap of honour made by the players at St James' Park at the end of the previous season. However, he remains held in the highest esteem by some fans; he was granted the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne on 2 March 2005.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is a club in any case? Not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it. It's not the television contracts, get-out clauses, marketing departments or executive boxes. It's the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. It's a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his father's hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.&lt;br&gt;\u2013 Robson\nRobson's second autobiography, entitled \"Bobby Robson: Farewell but not Goodbye\" was released in 2005. The title is based on one of his quotes upon leaving the England job in 1990: \"I'm here to say goodbye\u2014maybe not goodbye but farewell.\" Robson was critical of Shepherd in the book, claiming that he was denied information regarding the players' contracts and transfer negotiations by Shepherd while Robson was manager. He also criticised Shepherd and the club's deputy chairman Douglas Hall, for their focus on the first team and St James' Park, causing them to neglect less glamorous issues, such as the training ground, youth development and talent scouts. The club's training ground was later blamed by Graeme Souness, Robson's successor, for a series of injuries to first team players.\nFootball consultant for Republic of Ireland and retirement.\nOn 7 June 2005, Robson declined the invitation to become director of football of Heart of Midlothian because he wanted to stay in the Newcastle area. On 13 January 2006, Steve Staunton was appointed manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, with Robson named in a support role as \"international football consultant\". Robson stepped down from his role of consultant on 17 November 2007 following the nation's final match in their unsuccessful qualifying campaign for Euro 2008. Robson was a former vice president of the League Managers Association, a non-executive role.\nStyle of management.\nRobson was known for his man-management skills, his composed and demanding yet caring style as a coach, and for his ability to motivate his players and build positive relationships with them, making him a well-liked figure among fans and players alike. His profile on the website of the \"National Football Museum Hall of Fame\" describes him as \"a tough taskmaster,\" who was \"fiercely loyal to those who gave their all, and never failed to get the very best out of his players.\" Gary Lineker opined that Robson \"wasn't the greatest tactician of world football,\" but that \"he had a good understanding of the game,\" describing him with the following words: \"He was fiercely loyal to the players who served him well, he understood the game and he had this magnetic enthusiasm, not just for football, but for everything in life. You just wanted to go out there and run yourself into the ground for him and the team.\" Mourinho, who initially served as an interpreter and later as an assistant coach under Robson at Barcelona, praised him for his leadership and for his methodology in the attacking phase of the game. His style also influenced Villas-Boas, who worked under him at Porto. Robson often used a 4\u20134\u20132 formation throughout his career. At Ipswich Town, however, he had used a 4\u20134\u20132 diamond, without wingers, and with a holding midfielder, and an attacking midfielder behind the strikers. During the 1990 World Cup, he also changed England's set-up and used a 3\u20135\u20132/5\u20133\u20132 formation with a sweeper.\nLife outside football.\nPersonal life.\nRobson met Elsie Gray on a trip back to his parents' home in Langley Park. Gray was a student nurse, and later a teacher. They were married on 25 June 1955 with Fulham teammate Tom Wilson as Robson's best man.\nAfter 1991, Robson was repeatedly diagnosed with cancer. He had several operations and in 2006 was operated on for a brain tumour. This, on occasion, affected his work; while at Porto, for example, Robson had melanoma, which resulted in his missing the first few months of the 1995\u201396 season.\nOn 17 October 2006, it was revealed that Robson had been given the all-clear and was set to see out his contract as consultant to the Irish team. Robson revealed on 7 May 2007 he had been diagnosed with cancer for the fifth time. On 17 May 2008, Robson was the guest of honour at the 2008 FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium when Portsmouth defeated Cardiff City 1\u20130. He presented the trophy to the victorious captain, Sol Campbell.\nOther activities.\nRobson made a number of product endorsements, including an appearance in Carlsberg's \"Best Pub Side\" television commercial. He also acted as a pundit for ITV during the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004.\nBobby Robson Foundation.\nRobson defeated bowel cancer in 1992, a melanoma in 1995, as well as a tumour in his right lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially paralysed due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and also with a partially prosthetic upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as terminal in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts of chemotherapy. After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining years of his life to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. The Foundation raised over \u00a31\u00a0million, which funded equipment for the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre, in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, and would go on to fund other cancer projects in the North East of England.\nIn aid of the Foundation, Robson's 1990 World Cup semi-final 4\u20133 loss after penalties against West Germany was replayed on 26 July 2009 as the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match at St James' Park, featuring players from the original 1990 World Cup squads and other special guests. Robson was given a guard of honour before the match, which finished 3\u20132 to the England side.\nAt the time of Robson's death, the Foundation had raised \u00a31.6\u00a0million. Donations totalling \u00a3156,000 were received by the Foundation in the 18 days following his death, and on 15 October 2009, it was announced the Foundation had raised over \u00a32\u00a0million, and that at the request of Robson's family, Alan Shearer would take over Robson's role as the Foundation's patron. It passed the \u00a32.5\u00a0million mark in September 2010. Three other patrons were added in 2010, Steve Gibson, Mick Mills and Niall Quinn.\nDeath.\nOn 31 July 2009, Robson died of lung cancer at his home in Beamish, County Durham, aged 76, after a long battle with the disease. After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of football and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a \"great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man\". UEFA president Michel Platini said: \"He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being.\" Gary Lineker said, \"It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game.\" Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a \"real Geordie gentleman\". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson \"epitomised everything that is great about football in this country\". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, \"Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is \u2013 shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph.\"\nRobson's funeral, a private family ceremony, took place on 5 August 2009. The location remained undisclosed at the request of his family until the funeral had taken place. It was later revealed to be Esh, County Durham. A thanksgiving service for Robson was held on 21 September 2009 at Durham Cathedral. One thousand invited guests attended the service, which was also broadcast live on national television, and to Newcastle United's St James' Park, Ipswich Town's Portman Road ground and Fulham's Craven Cottage.\nRobson was survived by his wife and their three sons: Andrew, Paul and Mark.\nAchievements.\nRobson was awarded a number of honours for his contributions to football. In 1990, at the end of his eight-year reign as England manager, he was appointed a CBE in 1991 and in 2002, he was knighted; both awards were for services to football.\nIn 2002 (during his time as Newcastle manager), the 69-year-old Robson was awarded the freedom of Newcastle upon Tyne and the UEFA President's Award for \"services to football\". He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003 in recognition of his impact as a manager. Following his time as Newcastle United manager in 2005, Robson was made an Honorary Freeman of Newcastle, which, in his autobiography, he described as being \"the proudest moment of my life\". Robson also won the 1992\u00a0Football Writers' Association Tribute Award for an outstanding contribution to the national game, and the 2001 British Sports Writers' Association Pat Besford Trophy for Outstanding Achievement. In 2005, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Sports Coach UK Awards, and was also awarded the Eircom International Personality of the Year in 2006. On 9 December 2007, Robson was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year show in recognition of \"his contribution as both player and manager in a career spanning more than half a century\".\nOn 5 May 2008, during the 30th anniversary celebrations of Ipswich Town's 1978 FA Cup win, Robson was granted the Freedom of Ipswich by the Lady Mayor. On 8 December 2008, he earned another such accolade when he was given the Freedom of the City of Durham. In March 2009, UEFA awarded Robson the Emerald UEFA Order of Merit award, awarded to \"individuals who have dedicated their talents to the good of the game\". The award was presented to Robson at St James' Park on 26 July 2009, prior to the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match, and just five days before his death.\nPosthumous honours.\nIn December 2009, Robson was posthumously awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award, for the \"gentlemanly qualities he showed throughout his career as a player and coach\". All English football league matches held a one minute's applause in his memory at the beginning of the 2009\u201310 season.\nThe Football League gave Newcastle United and Ipswich Town special dispensation to wear special commemorative kits for their Championship match on 26 September 2009 at Portman Road, in aid of Sir Bobby's Foundation. At half-time during this match, the North Stand of Portman Road was renamed the Sir Bobby Robson Stand.\nThe first anniversary of Robson's death on 31 July 2010 was marked with a ceremony and pre-season friendly match at Newcastle's St James' Park, between two of his former clubs Newcastle United and PSV Eindhoven, involving Robson's PSV captain Stan Valckx presenting a PSV shirt to the club.\nIn July 2010, plans were unveiled for a memorial garden to Robson to be built in Newcastle. It was to be created by the city council in partnership with the regeneration company NE1Ltd, and located on Gallowgate street close to the Newcastle United stadium St James' Park. Work began on the site in November 2010, which was completed by Spring 2011. The garden covers 400 square meters, and features a tiered seating area and sculpted stone plinths reflecting aspects of his life and work. The area also hosts 400 square metre memorial garden to Sir Bobby Robson.\nWith a keen interest in cricket as well as football, Robson was to have replaced Mike Gatting as president of the Lord's Taverners charity and cricket club in 2007, but this was prevented by his ill-health. After his death, the club held a dinner in his honour, as \"The best President we never had\".\nIn March 2011, the East Coast train operating company named one of its Class 91 electric locomotives \"Sir Bobby Robson\", unveiled at Newcastle station by his widow Elsie and Alan Shearer. Similarly, in December 2011, the Port of Tyne Authority named its new work boat the \"Sir Bobby Robson\". On 6 May 2012, a statue of Robson created by sculptor Tom Maley was unveiled at St James' Park before a 2\u20130 defeat to eventual champions Manchester City. On 16 July 2013, marking the 150th anniversary celebrations of the FA, the FA designated 10 August as the Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day, celebrated as a day to celebrate the national game. In 2018, \"\", a feature-length British film about Robson's career and cancer diagnosis, was released to critical acclaim.\nIn September 2020, the Sir Bobby Robson School opened in Ipswich. The school will serve children aged 8\u201316 with social, emotional and mental health needs.\n\"Scores and results list England's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Robson goal.\"\nHonours.\nPlayer.\nEngland\nManager.\nIpswich Town\nPSV Eindhoven\nPorto\nBarcelona\nNewcastle United\nEngland\nIndividual\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68686", "revid": "18872885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68686", "title": "Raman spectroscopy", "text": "Spectroscopic technique\nRaman spectroscopy () (named after physicist C. V. Raman) is a spectroscopic technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules, although rotational and other low-frequency modes of systems may also be observed. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified.\nRaman spectroscopy relies upon inelastic scattering of photons, known as Raman scattering. A source of monochromatic light, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared, or near ultraviolet range is used, although X-rays can also be used. The laser light interacts with molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the system, resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up or down. The shift in energy gives information about the vibrational modes in the system. Time-resolved spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy typically yield similar yet complementary information.\nTypically, a sample is illuminated with a laser beam. Electromagnetic radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength corresponding to the laser line (Rayleigh scattering) is filtered out by either a notch filter, edge pass filter, or a band pass filter, while the rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector.\nSpontaneous Raman scattering is typically very weak. As a result, for many years the main difficulty in collecting Raman spectra was separating the weak inelastically scattered light from the intense Rayleigh scattered laser light (referred to as \"laser rejection\"). Historically, Raman spectrometers used holographic gratings and multiple dispersion stages to achieve a high degree of laser rejection. In the past, photomultipliers were the detectors of choice for dispersive Raman setups, which resulted in long acquisition times. However, modern instrumentation almost universally employs notch or edge filters for laser rejection. Dispersive single-stage spectrographs (axial transmissive (AT) or Czerny\u2013Turner (CT) monochromators) paired with CCD detectors are most common although Fourier transform (FT) spectrometers are also common for use with NIR lasers.\nThe name \"Raman spectroscopy\" typically refers to vibrational Raman spectroscopy using laser wavelengths which are not absorbed by the sample. There are many other variations of Raman spectroscopy including surface-enhanced Raman, resonance Raman, tip-enhanced Raman, polarized Raman, stimulated Raman, transmission Raman, spatially-offset Raman, and hyper Raman.\nHistory.\nAlthough the inelastic scattering of light was predicted by Adolf Smekal in 1923, it was not observed in practice until 1928. The Raman effect was named after one of its discoverers, the Indian scientist C. V. Raman, who observed the effect in organic liquids in 1928 together with K. S. Krishnan, and independently by Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam in inorganic crystals. Raman won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 for this discovery. The first observation of Raman spectra in gases was in 1929 by Franco Rasetti.\nSystematic pioneering theory of the Raman effect was developed by Czechoslovak physicist George Placzek between 1930 and 1934. The mercury arc became the principal light source, first with photographic detection and then with spectrophotometric detection.\nIn the years following its discovery, Raman spectroscopy was used to provide the first catalog of molecular vibrational frequencies. Typically, the sample was held in a long tube and illuminated along its length with a beam of filtered monochromatic light generated by a gas discharge lamp. The photons that were scattered by the sample were collected through an optical flat at the end of the tube. To maximize the sensitivity, the sample was highly concentrated (1 M or more) and relatively large volumes (5 mL or more) were used.\nTheory.\nThe magnitude of the Raman effect correlates with the polarizability of the electrons in a molecule. It is a form of inelastic light scattering, where a photon excites the sample. This excitation puts the molecule into a virtual energy state for a short time before the photon is emitted. Inelastic scattering means that the energy of the emitted photon is of either lower or higher energy than the incident photon. After the scattering event, the sample is in a different rotational or vibrational state.\nFor the total energy of the system to remain constant after the molecule moves to a new rovibronic (rotational\u2013vibrational\u2013electronic) state, the scattered photon shifts to a different energy, and therefore a different frequency. This energy difference is equal to that between the initial and final rovibronic states of the molecule. If the final state is higher in energy than the initial state, the scattered photon will be shifted to a lower frequency (lower energy) so that the total energy remains the same. This shift in frequency is called a Stokes shift, or downshift. If the final state is lower in energy, the scattered photon will be shifted to a higher frequency, which is called an anti-Stokes shift, or upshift.\nFor a molecule to exhibit a Raman effect, there must be a change in its electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability with respect to the vibrational coordinate corresponding to the rovibronic state. The intensity of the Raman scattering is proportional to this polarizability change. Therefore, the Raman spectrum (scattering intensity as a function of the frequency shifts) depends on the rovibronic states of the molecule.\nThe Raman effect is based on the interaction between the electron cloud of a sample and the external electric field of the monochromatic light, which can create an induced dipole moment within the molecule based on its polarizability. Because the laser light does not excite the molecule there can be no real transition between energy levels. The Raman effect should not be confused with emission (fluorescence or phosphorescence), where a molecule in an excited electronic state emits a photon and returns to the ground electronic state, in many cases to a vibrationally excited state on the ground electronic state potential energy surface. Raman scattering also contrasts with infrared (IR) absorption, where the energy of the absorbed photon matches the difference in energy between the initial and final rovibronic states. The dependence of Raman on the electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability derivative also differs from IR spectroscopy, which depends on the electric dipole moment derivative, the atomic polar tensor (APT). This contrasting feature allows rovibronic transitions that might not be active in IR to be analyzed using Raman spectroscopy, as exemplified by the rule of mutual exclusion in centrosymmetric molecules. Transitions which have large Raman intensities often have weak IR intensities and vice versa. If a bond is strongly polarized, a small change in its length such as that which occurs during a vibration has only a small resultant effect on polarization. Vibrations involving polar bonds (e.g. C-O, N-O, O-H) are therefore, comparatively weak Raman scatterers. Such polarized bonds, however, carry their electrical charges during the vibrational motion, (unless neutralized by symmetry factors), and this results in a larger net dipole moment change during the vibration, producing a strong IR absorption band. Conversely, relatively neutral bonds (e.g. C-C, C-H, C=C) suffer large changes in polarizability during a vibration. However, the dipole moment is not similarly affected such that while vibrations involving predominantly this type of bond are strong Raman scatterers, they are weak in the IR. A third vibrational spectroscopy technique, inelastic incoherent neutron scattering (IINS), can be used to determine the frequencies of vibrations in highly symmetric molecules that may be both IR and Raman inactive. The IINS selection rules, or allowed transitions, differ from those of IR and Raman, so the three techniques are complementary. They all give the same frequency for a given vibrational transition, but the relative intensities provide different information due to the different types of interaction between the molecule and the incoming particles, photons for IR and Raman, and neutrons for IINS.\nRaman shift.\nRaman shifts are typically reported in wavenumbers, which have units of inverse length, as this value is directly related to energy. In order to convert between spectral wavelength and wavenumbers of shift in the Raman spectrum, the following formula can be used:\nformula_1\nwhere \u0394\u03bd\u0303 is the Raman shift expressed in wavenumber, \u03bb0 is the excitation wavelength, and \u03bb1 is the Raman spectrum wavelength. Most commonly, the unit chosen for expressing wavenumber in Raman spectra is inverse centimeters (cm\u22121). Since wavelength is often expressed in units of nanometers (nm), the formula above can scale for this unit conversion explicitly, giving\nformula_2\nInstrumentation.\nModern Raman spectroscopy nearly always involves the use of lasers as excitation light sources. Because lasers were not available until more than three decades after the discovery of the effect, Raman and Krishnan used a mercury lamp and photographic plates to record spectra. Early spectra took hours or even days to acquire due to weak light sources, poor sensitivity of the detectors and the weak Raman scattering cross-sections of most materials. Various colored filters and chemical solutions were used to select certain wavelength regions for excitation and detection but the photographic spectra were still dominated by a broad center line corresponding to Rayleigh scattering of the excitation source.\nTechnological advances have made Raman spectroscopy much more sensitive, particularly since the 1980s. The most common modern detectors are now charge-coupled devices (CCDs). Photodiode arrays and photomultiplier tubes were common prior to the adoption of CCDs. The advent of reliable, stable, inexpensive lasers with narrow bandwidths has also had an impact.\nLasers.\nRaman spectroscopy requires a light source such as a laser. The resolution of the spectrum relies on the bandwidth of the laser source used. Generally shorter wavelength lasers give stronger Raman scattering due to the \u03bd4 increase in Raman scattering cross-sections, but issues with sample degradation or fluorescence may result.\nContinuous wave lasers are most common for normal Raman spectroscopy, but pulsed lasers may also be used. These often have wider bandwidths than their CW counterparts but are very useful for other forms of Raman spectroscopy such as transient, time-resolved and resonance Raman.\nDetectors.\nRaman scattered light is typically collected and either dispersed by a spectrograph or used with an interferometer for detection by Fourier Transform (FT) methods. In many cases commercially available FT-IR spectrometers can be modified to become FT-Raman spectrometers.\nDetectors for dispersive Raman.\nIn most cases, modern Raman spectrometers use array detectors such as CCDs. Various types of CCDs exist which are optimized for different wavelength ranges. Intensified CCDs can be used for very weak signals and/or pulsed lasers.\nThe spectral range depends on the size of the CCD and the focal length of spectrograph used.\nIt was once common to use monochromators coupled to photomultiplier tubes. In this case the monochromator would need to be moved in order to scan through a spectral range.\nDetectors for FT\u2013Raman.\nFT\u2013Raman is almost always used with NIR lasers and appropriate detectors must be used depending on the exciting wavelength. Germanium or Indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detectors are commonly used.\nFilters.\nIt is usually necessary to separate the Raman scattered light from the Rayleigh signal and reflected laser signal in order to collect high quality Raman spectra using a laser rejection filter. Notch or long-pass optical filters are typically used for this purpose. Before the advent of holographic filters it was common to use a triple-grating monochromator in subtractive mode to isolate the desired signal. This may still be used to record very small Raman shifts as holographic filters typically reflect some of the low frequency bands in addition to the unshifted laser light. However, Volume hologram filters are becoming more common which allow shifts as low as 5\u00a0cm\u22121 to be observed.\nApplications.\nRaman spectroscopy is used in chemistry to identify molecules and study chemical bonding and intramolecular bonds. Because vibrational frequencies are specific to a molecule's chemical bonds and symmetry (the fingerprint region of organic molecules is in the wavenumber range 500\u20131,500\u00a0cm\u22121), Raman provides a fingerprint to identify molecules. For instance, Raman and IR spectra were used to determine the vibrational frequencies of SiO, Si2O2, and Si3O3 on the basis of normal coordinate analyses. Raman is also used to study the addition of a substrate to an enzyme.\nIn solid-state physics, Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize materials, measure temperature, and find the crystallographic orientation of a sample. As with single molecules, a solid material can be identified by characteristic phonon modes. Information on the population of a phonon mode is given by the ratio of the Stokes and anti-Stokes intensity of the spontaneous Raman signal. Raman spectroscopy can also be used to observe other low frequency excitations of a solid, such as plasmons, magnons, and superconducting gap excitations. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) uses the Raman-shifted backscatter from laser pulses to determine the temperature along optical fibers. The orientation of an anisotropic crystal can be found from the polarization of Raman-scattered light with respect to the crystal and the polarization of the laser light, if the crystal structure's point group is known.\nIn nanotechnology, a Raman microscope can be used to analyze nanowires to better understand their structures, and the radial breathing mode of carbon nanotubes is commonly used to evaluate their diameter.\nRaman active fibers, such as aramid and carbon, have vibrational modes that show a shift in Raman frequency with applied stress. Polypropylene fibers exhibit similar shifts.\nIn solid state chemistry and the bio-pharmaceutical industry, Raman spectroscopy can be used to not only identify active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), but to identify their polymorphic forms, if more than one exist. For example, the drug Cayston (aztreonam), marketed by Gilead Sciences for cystic fibrosis, can be identified and characterized by IR and Raman spectroscopy. Using the correct polymorphic form in bio-pharmaceutical formulations is critical, since different forms have different physical properties, like solubility and melting point.\nRaman spectroscopy has a wide variety of applications in biology and medicine. It has helped confirm the existence of low-frequency phonons in proteins and DNA, promoting studies of low-frequency collective motion in proteins and DNA and their biological functions. Raman reporter molecules with olefin or alkyne moieties are being developed for tissue imaging with SERS-labeled antibodies. Raman spectroscopy has also been used as a noninvasive technique for real-time, in situ biochemical characterization of wounds. Multivariate analysis of Raman spectra has enabled development of a quantitative measure for wound healing progress. Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS), which is less sensitive to surface layers than conventional Raman, can be used to discover counterfeit drugs without opening their packaging, and to non-invasively study biological tissue. A reason why Raman spectroscopy is useful in biological applications is because its results often do not face interference from water molecules, due to the fact that they have permanent dipole moments, and as a result, the Raman scattering cannot be picked up on. This is a large advantage, specifically in biological applications. Raman spectroscopy also has a wide usage for studying biominerals. Lastly, Raman gas analyzers have many practical applications, including real-time monitoring of anesthetic and respiratory gas mixtures during surgery.\nRaman spectroscopy has been used in several research projects as a means to detect explosives from a safe distance using laser beams.\nRaman spectroscopy is being further developed so it could be used in the clinical setting. Raman4Clinic is a European organization that is working on incorporating Raman Spectroscopy techniques in the medical field. They are currently working on different projects, one of them being monitoring cancer using bodily fluids such as urine and blood samples which are easily accessible. This technique would be less stressful on the patients than constantly having to take biopsies which are not always risk free.\nIn photovoltaics, Raman spectroscopy has gained more interest in the past few years demonstrating high efficacy in delivering important properties for such materials. This includes optoelectronic and physicochemical properties such as open circuit voltage, efficiency, and crystalline structure. This has been demonstrated with several photovoltaic technologies, including kesterite-based, CIGS devices, Monocrystalline silicon cells, and perovskites devices.\nArt and cultural heritage.\nRaman spectroscopy is an efficient and non-destructive way to investigate works of art and cultural heritage artifacts, in part because it is a non-invasive process which can be applied \"in situ\". It can be used to analyze the corrosion products on the surfaces of artifacts (statues, pottery, etc.), which can lend insight into the corrosive environments experienced by the artifacts. The resulting spectra can also be compared to the spectra of surfaces that are cleaned or intentionally corroded, which can aid in determining the authenticity of valuable historical artifacts.\nIt is capable of identifying individual pigments in paintings and their degradation products, which can provide insight into the working method of an artist in addition to aiding in authentication of paintings. It also gives information about the original state of the painting in cases where the pigments have degraded with age. Beyond the identification of pigments, extensive Raman microspectroscopic imaging has been shown to provide access to a plethora of trace compounds in Early Medieval Egyptian blue, which enable to reconstruct the individual \"biography\" of a colourant, including information on the type and provenance of the raw materials, synthesis and application of the pigment, and the ageing of the paint layer.\nIn addition to paintings and artifacts, Raman spectroscopy can be used to investigate the chemical composition of historical documents (such as the Book of Kells), which can provide insight about the social and economic conditions when they were created. It also offers a noninvasive way to determine the best method of preservation or conservation of such cultural heritage artifacts, by providing insight into the causes behind deterioration.\nThe IRUG (Infrared and Raman Users Group) Spectral Database is a rigorously peer-reviewed online database of IR and Raman reference spectra for cultural heritage materials such as works of art, architecture, and archaeological artifacts. The database is open for the general public to peruse, and includes interactive spectra for over a hundred different types of pigments and paints.\nMicrospectroscopy.\nRaman spectroscopy offers several advantages for microscopic analysis. Since it is a light scattering technique, specimens do not need to be fixed or sectioned. Raman spectra can be collected from a very small volume (&lt; 1\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter, &lt; 10\u00a0\u03bcm in depth); these spectra allow the identification of species present in that volume. Water does not generally interfere with Raman spectral analysis. Thus, Raman spectroscopy is suitable for the microscopic examination of minerals, materials such as polymers and ceramics, cells, proteins and forensic trace evidence. A Raman microscope begins with a standard optical microscope, and adds an excitation laser, a monochromator or polychromator, and a sensitive detector (such as a charge-coupled device (CCD), or photomultiplier tube (PMT)). FT-Raman has also been used with microscopes, typically in combination with near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation. Ultraviolet microscopes and UV enhanced optics must be used when a UV laser source is used for Raman microspectroscopy.\nIn \"direct imaging\" (also termed \"global imaging\" or \"wide-field illumination\"), the whole field of view is examined for light scattering integrated over a small range of wavenumbers (Raman shifts). For instance, a wavenumber characteristic for cholesterol could be used to record the distribution of cholesterol within a cell culture. This technique is being used for the characterization of large-scale devices, mapping of different compounds and dynamics study. It has already been used for the characterization of graphene layers, J-aggregated dyes inside carbon nanotubes and multiple other 2D materials such as MoS2 and WSe2. Since the excitation beam is dispersed over the whole field of view, those measurements can be done without damaging the sample.\nThe most common approach is \"hyperspectral imaging\" or \"chemical imaging\", in which thousands of Raman spectra are acquired from all over the field of view by, for example, raster scanning of a focused laser beam through a sample. The data can be used to generate images showing the location and amount of different components. Having the full spectroscopic information available in every measurement spot has the advantage that several components can be mapped at the same time, including chemically similar and even polymorphic forms, which cannot be distinguished by detecting only one single wavenumber. Furthermore, material properties such as stress and strain, crystal orientation, crystallinity and incorporation of foreign ions into crystal lattices (e.g., doping, solid solution series) can be determined from hyperspectral maps. Taking the cell culture example, a hyperspectral image could show the distribution of cholesterol, as well as proteins, nucleic acids, and fatty acids. Sophisticated signal- and image-processing techniques can be used to ignore the presence of water, culture media, buffers, and other interferences.\nBecause a Raman microscope is a diffraction-limited system, its spatial resolution depends on the wavelength of light, the numerical aperture of the focusing element, and \u2014 in the case of confocal microscopy \u2014 on the diameter of the confocal aperture. When operated in the visible to near-infrared range, a Raman microscope can achieve lateral resolutions of approx. 1\u00a0\u03bcm down to 250\u00a0nm, depending on the wavelength and type of objective lens (e.g., air \"vs.\" water or oil immersion lenses). The depth resolution (if not limited by the optical penetration depth of the sample) can range from 1\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm with the smallest confocal pinhole aperture to tens of micrometers when operated without a confocal pinhole. Depending on the sample, the high laser power density due to microscopic focussing can have the benefit of enhanced photobleaching of molecules emitting interfering fluorescence. However, the laser wavelength and laser power have to be carefully selected for each type of sample to avoid its degradation.\nApplications of Raman imaging range from materials sciences to biological studies. For each type of sample, the measurement parameters have to be individually optimized. For that reason, modern Raman microscopes are often equipped with several lasers offering different wavelengths, a set of objective lenses, and neutral density filters for tuning of the laser power reaching the sample. Selection of the laser wavelength mainly depends on optical properties of the sample and on the aim of the investigation. For example, Raman microscopy of biological and medical specimens is often performed using red to near-infrared excitation (e.g., 785\u00a0nm, or 1,064\u00a0nm wavelength). Due to typically low absorbances of biological samples in this spectral range, the risk of damaging the specimen as well as autofluorescence emission are reduced, and high penetration depths into tissues can be achieved. However, the intensity of Raman scattering at long wavelengths is low (owing to the \u03c94 dependence of Raman scattering intensity), leading to long acquisition times. On the other hand, resonance Raman imaging of single-cell algae at 532\u00a0nm (green) can specifically probe the carotenoid distribution within a cell by a using low laser power of ~5\u00a0\u03bcW and only 100\u00a0ms acquisition time.\nRaman scattering, specifically tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, produces high resolution hyperspectral images of single molecules, atoms, and DNA.\nPolarization dependence of Raman scattering.\nRaman scattering is polarization sensitive and can provide detailed information on symmetry of Raman active modes. While conventional Raman spectroscopy identifies chemical composition, polarization effects on Raman spectra can reveal information on the orientation of molecules in single crystals and anisotropic materials, e.g. strained plastic sheets, as well as the symmetry of vibrational modes.\nPolarization\u2013dependent Raman spectroscopy uses (plane) polarized laser excitation from a polarizer. The Raman scattered light collected is passed through a second polarizer (called the analyzer) before entering the detector. The analyzer is oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the polarization of the laser. Spectra acquired with the analyzer set at both perpendicular and parallel to the excitation plane can be used to calculate the depolarization ratio. Typically a polarization scrambler is placed between the analyzer and detector also.It is convenient in polarized Raman spectroscopy to describe the propagation and polarization directions using Porto's notation, described by and named after Brazilian physicist Sergio Pereira da Silva Porto.\nFor isotropic solutions, the Raman scattering from each mode either retains the polarization of the laser or becomes partly or fully depolarized. If the vibrational mode involved in the Raman scattering process is totally symmetric then the polarization of the Raman scattering will be the same as that of the incoming laser beam. In the case that the vibrational mode is not totally symmetric then the polarization will be lost (scrambled) partially or totally, which is referred to as depolarization. Hence polarized Raman spectroscopy can provide detailed information as to the symmetry labels of vibrational modes.\nIn the solid state, polarized Raman spectroscopy can be useful in the study of oriented samples such as single crystals. The polarizability of a vibrational mode is not equal along and across the bond. Therefore, the intensity of the Raman scattering will be different when the laser's polarization is along and orthogonal to a particular bond axis. This effect can provide information on the orientation of molecules with a single crystal or material. The spectral information arising from this analysis is often used to understand macro-molecular orientation in crystal lattices, liquid crystals or polymer samples.\nCharacterization of the symmetry of a vibrational mode.\nThe polarization technique is useful in understanding the connections between molecular symmetry, Raman activity, and peaks in the corresponding Raman spectra. Polarized light in one direction only gives access to some Raman\u2013active modes, but rotating the polarization gives access to other modes. Each mode is separated according to its symmetry.\nThe symmetry of a vibrational mode is deduced from the depolarization ratio \u03c1, which is the ratio of the Raman scattering with polarization orthogonal to the incident laser and the Raman scattering with the same polarization as the incident laser: formula_3 Here formula_4 is the intensity of Raman scattering when the analyzer is rotated 90 degrees with respect to the incident light's polarization axis, and formula_5 the intensity of Raman scattering when the analyzer is aligned with the polarization of the incident laser. When polarized light interacts with a molecule, it distorts the molecule which induces an equal and opposite effect in the plane-wave, causing it to be rotated by the difference between the orientation of the molecule and the angle of polarization of the light wave. If formula_6, then the vibrations at that frequency are \"depolarized\"; meaning they are not totally symmetric.\nRaman Excitation Profile Analysis.\nResonance Raman selection rules can be explained by the Kramers\u2013Heisenberg equation using the Albrecht A and B terms, as demonstrated. The Kramers\u2013Heisenberg expression is conveniently linked to the polarizability of the molecule within its frame of reference:\nformula_7\nThe polarizability operator connecting the initial and final states expresses the transition polarizability as a matrix element, as a function of the incidence frequency \u03c90. The directions x, y, and z in the molecular frame are represented by the Cartesian tensor \u03c1 and \u03c3 here. Analyzing Raman excitation patterns requires the use of this equation, which is a sum-over-states expression for polarizability. This series of profiles illustrates the connection between a Raman active vibration's excitation frequency and intensity.\nThis method takes into account sums over Franck-Condon's active vibrational states and provides insight into electronic absorption and emission spectra. Nevertheless, the work highlights a flaw in the sum-over-states method, especially for large molecules like visible chromophores, which are commonly studied in Raman spectroscopy. The difficulty arises from the potentially infinite number of intermediary steps needed. While lowering the sum at higher vibrational states can help tiny molecules get over this issue, larger molecules find it more challenging when there are more terms in the sum, particularly in the condensed phase when individual eigenstates cannot be resolved spectrally.\nTo overcome this, two substitute techniques that do not require adding eigenstates can be considered. Among these two methods are available: the transform method. and Heller's time-dependent approach. The goal of both approaches is to take into consideration the frequency-dependent Raman cross-section \u03c3R(\u03c90) of a particular normal mode.\nVariants.\nAt least 25 variations of Raman spectroscopy have been developed. The usual purpose is to enhance the sensitivity (e.g., Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)), to improve the spatial resolution (Raman microscopy), or to acquire very specific information (resonance Raman).\nSpontaneous (or far-field) Raman spectroscopy.\nTerms such as \"spontaneous Raman spectroscopy\" or \"normal Raman spectroscopy\" summarize Raman spectroscopy techniques based on Raman scattering by using normal far-field optics as described above. Variants of normal Raman spectroscopy exist with respect to excitation-detection geometries, combination with other techniques, use of special (polarizing) optics and specific choice of excitation wavelengths for resonance enhancement.\nEnhanced (or near-field) Raman spectroscopy.\nEnhancement of Raman scattering is achieved by local electric-field enhancement by optical near-field effects (e.g. localized surface plasmons).\nNon-linear Raman spectroscopy.\nRaman signal enhancements are achieved through non-linear optical effects, typically realized by mixing two or more wavelengths emitted by spatially and temporally synchronized pulsed lasers.\nMorphologically-Directed Raman spectroscopy.\nMorphologically Directed Raman Spectroscopy (MDRS) combines automated particle imaging and Raman microspectroscopy into a singular integrated platform in order to provide particle size, shape, and chemical identification. Automated particle imaging determines the particle size and shape distributions of components within a blended sample from images of individual particles. The information gathered from automated particle imaging is then utilized to direct the Raman spectroscopic analysis. The Raman spectroscopic analytical process is performed on a randomly selected subset of the particles, allowing chemical identification of the sample's multiple components. Tens of thousands of particles can be imaged in a matter of minutes using the MDRS method, making the process ideal for forensic analysis and investigating counterfeit pharmaceuticals and subsequent adjudications.\nSimulation of Molecular Raman Spectroscopy.\nStatic (harmonic) model.\nIn the conventional \"Placzek\" framework, the Raman activity of a vibrational normal mode \"p\" , which is determined by the derivatives of the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the polarizability tensor respect to normal coordinate formula_8:\nformula_9\nWhere, formula_10 is the 3x3 polarizability tensor.\nformula_11 formula_12\nIn the double-harmonic approximations, the potential energy is expanded to the second order near equilibrium (harmonic force fields), while polarizability, is truncated at first order in the normal coordinates.\nPolarizability, Normal Coordinate and Frequencies.\nThe static polarizability tensor is calculated as the second derivative of the electronic energy formula_13 respect to the external electric field formula_14:\nformula_15\nIn practice, formula_10 can be calculated through analytical methods or by employing the finite difference method for energy under small perturbations in formula_14. The polarizability derivatives used to calculate Raman activities, which could be obtained by the chain rule that relates Cartesian coordinates formula_18 and normal coordinates formula_8:\nformula_20\nThe formula_21 is given by the normalized linear transformation between cartesian coordinate and mass-weighted normal coordinates:\nformula_22\nWhere formula_23 is the diagonal matrix of atomic masses and formula_24 is the matrix of orthonormal eigenvectors (normal modes). It is given by diagonalizing the mass-weighted Hessian matrix:\nformula_25\nThe Cartesian Hessian elements are second derivatives of the potential energy respect to atomic Cartesian coordinates:\nformula_26\nDiagonalization of the mass-weighted Hessian, we can obtain the eigenvalues formula_27 and eigenvectors formula_28; the vibrational wavenumbers formula_29 are Five (or six for nonlinear molecules) near-zero eigenvalues correspond to overall translations and rotations, which need to remove from the modes when we do vibrational analysis. Since the formula_30 is known from finite differences or gradient calculation, it will used to calculate formula_8 , and further to get the Raman activities.\nRaman intensity (Placzek\u2013Neugebauer expression).\nFinally, after get the raman activity, The Raman intensity for the mode formula_32 is provided by\nformula_33\nwhere\nSince some thermodynamic calculations ignored in the harmonic approximation, DFT-calculated harmonic frequencies are systematically too high.\nHence, an scaling factor formula_44 is applied to vibrational frequencies before comparing simulated spectrum with the experiment:\nformula_45\nFor example, the B3LYP/TZVP scaling factor is 0.965.\nIt is important to note that before to calculating the static spectrum, the structure must be optimized to its lowest energy point using the same or an approximate DFT basis set/functional. The mentioned static (harmonic) method also has been integrated into the Gaussian software as default, using the keyword Opt Freq=Raman to calculate.\nDynamic (time correlation) approach.\nThe harmonic approximation methods ignore some non-harmonic calculations. As an alternative, \"ab initio\" or machine-learned molecular-dynamics trajectories provide dynamic raman spectrum.\nAt each time step, the real-time polarizability tensor formula_46 is calculated, from the isotropic and anisotropic components we mentioned as formula_47 and formula_48, there will obtained from dynamical trajectory.\nThe time autocorrelation functions as follow:\nformula_49\nand during the Fourier transforms, the isotropic and anisotropic Raman spectra generated as:\nformula_50 formula_51\nAn isotropic media (liquids, gases), the observable Raman spectra under unpolarized detection is a rotational average of the two components:\nformula_52\nThis expression is derived from the angular momentum averaging of scattered lights from the random molecular orientations.\nThe factor 4/3 the iso/aniso probably contribution.\nAnd the depolarization ratio, often used experimentally to featurize the polarization effects, is defied by:\nformula_53\nThe ratio show the information on the symmetry of the vibrational modes.\nSo, from the time dependent polarizability tensor formula_46, the isotropic and anisotropic time series can be obtained. Their autocorrelation functions are calculated, Fourier transformed, and finally combined using the rotational averaging method to generate the total Raman spectrum.\nThis polarizability-autocorrelation Fourier transform method naturally integrates anharmonic coupling, temperature broadening, and the polarization effects. It is providing a realistic description of Raman spectroscopy beyond the harmonic approximation.\nMachine Learning approach.\nIn recent years, machine learning has to be a powerful tool in Raman spectroscopy, which enabling data-driven prediction and interpretation of spectral line characteristics. Such as machine learned interatomic potential and generative model.\nZihan Zou et al..

It was called by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in an unsuccessful attempt to force the British government to act to prevent wage reductions and worsening conditions for 1.2\u00a0million locked-out coal miners. Some 1.7\u00a0million workers went out, especially in transport and heavy industry. \nIt was a sympathy strike, with many of those who were not miners and not directly affected striking to support the locked-out miners. The government was well prepared, and enlisted middle class volunteers to maintain essential services. There was little violence and the TUC gave up in defeat.\nCauses.\nFrom 1914 to 1918, the United Kingdom participated in World War I. Heavy domestic use of coal during the war depleted once-rich seams. Britain exported less coal during the war than it would have in peacetime, allowing other countries to fill the gap. This particularly benefited the strong coal industries of the United States, Poland, and Germany. In the early 1880s, coal production was at a peak of 310 tons per man annually, but in the four years preceding the war, this amount had fallen to 247 tons. By the 1920\u20131924 period, this had fallen further to just 199 tons. Total coal output had been in decline since 1914 as well.\nIn 1924, the Dawes Plan was implemented. It allowed Germany to re-enter the international coal market by exporting \"free coal\" to France and Italy, as part of their reparations for the war. This extra supply reduced coal prices. In 1925, Winston Churchill, the chancellor of the Exchequer, reintroduced the gold standard. This made the British pound too strong for effective exporting to take place from Britain. Furthermore, because of the economic processes involved in maintaining a strong currency, interest rates were raised, which hurt some businesses.\nMine owners wanted to maintain profits even during times of economic instability, which often took the form of wage reductions for miners in their employment. Miners' weekly pay had been lowered from \u00a36 to \u00a33 18\"s.\" over seven years. Coupled with the prospect of longer working hours for miners, the industry was thrown into disarray.\nWhen mine owners announced that their intention was to reduce miners' wages, the Miners' Federation of Great Britain rejected the terms: \"Not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day.\" The Trades Union Congress responded to the news by promising to support the miners in their dispute. The Conservative government, under Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, decided to intervene by declaring that a nine-month subsidy would be provided to maintain the miners' wages and that a royal commission, under the chairmanship of Sir Herbert Samuel, would look into the problems of the mining industry and consider its impact on other industries, families, and organisations dependent on coal supply.\nThe Samuel Commission published a report on 10 March 1926 recommending that national agreements, the nationalisation of royalties, and sweeping reorganisation and improvement should be considered for the mining industry. It also recommended a reduction by 13.5% of miners' wages, along with the withdrawal of the government subsidy. Two weeks later, the prime minister announced that the government would accept the report if other parties also did.\nA previous royal commission, the Sankey Commission in 1919, had failed to reach an agreement, producing four different reports with proposals ranging from complete restoration of private ownership and control, to complete nationalisation. David Lloyd George, the then prime minister, offered reorganisation, which was rejected by the miners.\nFollowing the Samuel Commission's report, the mine owners declared that miners would be offered new terms of employment, which included lengthening the work day and reducing wages depending on various factors. The Miners' Federation of Great Britain refused the wage reduction and regional negotiation.\nGeneral strike, May 1926.\nThe final negotiations began on 1 May but failed to achieve an agreement, leading to an announcement by the TUC that a general strike \"in defence of miners' wages and hours\" was scheduled to begin on Monday, 3 May, at one minute to midnight.\nThe leaders of the Labour Party were troubled about the proposed general strike because they were aware of the revolutionary elements within the union movement and of the damage that they might do to the party's new reputation as a party of government. During the next two days, frantic efforts were made to reach an agreement between the government and the mining industry representatives. However, they failed, mainly because of an eleventh-hour decision by printers of the \"Daily Mail\" to refuse to print an editorial (\"For King and Country\") condemning the general strike. They objected to the following passage: \"A general strike is not an industrial dispute. It is a revolutionary move which can only succeed by destroying the government and subverting the rights and liberties of the people\".\nBaldwin was now concerned about the TUC and printers' action interfering with the freedom of the press.\nKing George V tried to stabilise the situation and create balance saying, \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\"\nThe TUC feared that an all-out general strike would bring revolutionary elements to the fore and limited the participants to railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers, and steelworkers, as they were regarded as pivotal in the dispute. In a rare political radio broadcast, Archbishop Francis Cardinal Bourne, the leading Catholic prelate in Britain, condemned the strike, knowing that many strikers were Catholic. He advised that, \"It is a direct challenge to lawfully constituted authority... All are bound to uphold and assist the Government, which is the lawfully constituted authority of the country and represents therefore...the authority of God himself.\"\nThe government had been preparing for the strike over the nine months in which it had provided a subsidy by creating organisations such as the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies. It was ready and able to do whatever it could to keep the country moving. It rallied support by emphasizing the revolutionary nature of the strikers. The armed forces and volunteer workers helped maintain basic services. The government used the Emergency Powers Act 1920 to maintain essential supplies.\nOn 4 May 1926, the number of workers on strike was estimated at between 1.5 million and 1.75 million. There were strikers \"from John o' Groats to Land's End\". The reaction to the strike call was immediate and overwhelming, surprising both the government and the TUC; the latter not being in control of the strike. On this first day, there were no major initiatives and no dramatic events except for the nation's transport being at a standstill.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Constitutional Government is being attacked. Let all good citizens whose livelihood and labour have thus been put in peril bear with fortitude and patience the hardships with which they have been so suddenly confronted. Stand behind the Government, who are doing their part, confident that you will cooperate in the measures they have undertaken to preserve the liberties and privileges of the people of these islands. The laws of England are the people's birthright. The laws are in your keeping. You have made Parliament their guardian. The General Strike is a challenge to Parliament and is the road to anarchy and ruin\".\n Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, 6 May 1926, \"British Gazette\"\nOn 5 May 1926, both sides gave their views. Churchill commented as editor of the government newspaper \"British Gazette\": \"I do not agree that the TUC have as much right as the Government to publish their side of the case and to exhort their followers to continue action. It is a very much more difficult task to feed the nation than it is to wreck it\". Baldwin wrote, \"The general strike is a challenge to the parliament and is the road to anarchy\". The \"British Worker\", the TUC's newspaper, wrote: \"We are not making war on the people. We are anxious that the ordinary members of the public shall not be penalized for the unpatriotic conduct of the mine owners and the government\".\nIn the meantime, the government put in place a \"militia\" of special constables called the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies (OMS) of volunteers to maintain order in the street. A special constable said: \"It was not difficult to understand the strikers' attitude toward us. After a few days I found my sympathy with them rather than with the employers. For one thing, I had never realized the appalling poverty which existed. If I had been aware of all the facts, I should not have joined up as a special constable\". It was decided that fascists would not be allowed to enlist in the OMS without first giving up their political beliefs, as the government feared a right-wing backlash so the fascists formed the so-called \"Q Division\" under Rotha Lintorn-Orman to combat the strikers.\nOn 6 May 1926, there was a change of atmosphere. The government newspaper, \"British Gazette\", suggested that means of transport into London began to improve compared to the first day with volunteers, car sharing, cyclists, private buses, as well as strikebreakers. A statement on the front page indicated 200 London General Omnibus Company buses 'on the streets'. Only 86 LGOC buses, however were operating.\nOn 7 May 1926, the TUC met with Samuel and worked out a set of proposals designed to end the dispute. The Miners' Federation rejected the proposals. The \"British Worker\" was increasingly difficult to operate, as Churchill had requisitioned the bulk of the supply of the paper's newsprint so it reduced its size from eight pages to four. In the meantime, the government took action to protect the men who decided to return to work.\nOn 8 May 1926, there was a dramatic moment on the London Docks. Lorries were protected by the Army. They broke the picket line and transported food to Hyde Park. That showed that the government was in greater control of the situation. It was also a measure of Baldwin's caution, in place of Churchill's more reactionary stance. Churchill had wanted, in a move that could have proved unnecessarily antagonistic to the strikers, to arm the soldiers. Baldwin, however, had insisted otherwise. In Plymouth, tram services were restarted, with some vehicles attacked and windows smashed. However, not all strike actions in the city were confrontational; a football match, attended by thousands, occurs between a team of policemen and strikers, with the strikers winning 2\u20130. The supporters included a delegation of 4,000 strikers, which marched to the grounds accompanied by a marching band.\nOn 10 May 1926, the \"Flying Scotsman\" was derailed by striking miners at Cramlington, a short distance North of Newcastle upon Tyne. The \"British Worker\", alarmed at the fears of the General Council of the TUC that there was to be a mass drift back to work, claimed: \"The number of strikers has not diminished; it is increasing. There are more workers out today than there have been at any moment since the strike began\".\nHowever, the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union applied for an injunction in the Chancery Division of the High Court to enjoin the General-Secretary of its Tower Hill branch from calling its members out on strike. Mr Justice Astbury granted the injunction by ruling that no trade dispute could exist between the TUC and \"the government of the nation\" and that except for the strike in the coal industry, the general strike was not protected by Trade Disputes Act 1906. In addition, he ruled that the strike in the plaintiff union had been called in contravention of its own rules. As a result, the unions involved became liable, by common law, for incitement to breach of contract and faced potential sequestration of their assets by employers.\nOn 12 May 1926, the TUC General Council visited 10 Downing Street to announce its decision to call off the strike if the proposals worked out by the Samuel Commission were respected and the government offered a guarantee there would be no victimization of strikers. The government stated that it had \"no power to compel employers to take back every man who had been on strike\". However, the TUC agreed to end the dispute without such an agreement. Various strikes continued after this as their unions negotiated deals with companies for their members to return to work.\nAftermath.\nThe miners maintained resistance for a few months before being forced by their own economic needs to return to the mines. By the end of November, most miners were back at work. However, many remained unemployed for many years. Those still employed were forced to accept longer hours, lower wages, and district wage agreements.\nThe effect on British coal mines was profound. By the late 1930s, employment in mining had fallen by more than a third from its pre-strike peak of 1.2\u00a0million miners, but productivity had rebounded from under 200 tons produced per miner, to over 300 tons by the outbreak of the Second World War.\nThe split in the miners that resulted from Spencerism and the agreement of the Nottinghamshire miners to return to work, against the policy of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, divided the coal miners as a national bargaining force until the establishment of the National Union of Mineworkers.\nThe Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 banned sympathy strikes, general strikes, and mass picketing, creating a system whereby trade union members had to 'opt-in' to paying the political levy to the Labour Party.\nIn the long run, there was little impact on trade union activity or industrial relations. The TUC and trade union movement remained intact and did not change their basic policies. Keith Laybourn says that historians mostly agree that \"In no significant way could the General Strike be considered a turning point or watershed in British industrial history.\" There have been no further general strikes in Britain, as union leaders such as Ernest Bevin, who had coordinated the strike, considered it a mistake; they decided that action by political parties was a better solution. However, the country came close to a one-day general strike on 31 July 1972 over the imprisonment of the Pentonville Five. There was a general strike amongst loyalists in Northern Ireland in 1974.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The river's basin extends from la Mancha and the eastern portion of Extremadura to the southern provinces of the Algarve; the river and its tributaries flow from east to west, then south through Portugal to the border towns of Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio (Portugal) and Ayamonte (Spain), where it flows into the Gulf of C\u00e1diz. With a course that covers a distance of , it is the fourth-longest in the Iberian Peninsula, and its hydrological basin extends over an area of approximately (the majority of which lies within Spain).\nEtymology.\nPtolemy's \"Geography\" recorded the Celtiberian name as \"Anas\", meaning a marshy area or bayou. The Romans adapted this name as , which was etymolygised as the \"River of Ducks.\" After the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the name was extended and referred to as \"Wadi Ana\", later passed on to Portuguese and Spanish settlers as the \"Ouadiana\", and later just \"Odiana\". Since the 16th century, the name slowly evolved to take on the form \"Guadiana\", a cognitive variation that developed from many Andalusi river place-names beginning in \"wadi\" using the prefix \"guad-\" such as the hydronyms Guadalquivir, Guadalete, and Guadarrama.\nWatershed.\nThe Guadiana flows east to west through Spain and south through Portugal, then forms the Spanish-Portuguese border; it flows into the Gulf of C\u00e1diz, part of the Atlantic Ocean, between Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio (Portugal) and Ayamonte (Spain). It is long, of which are within Spanish territory, within Portugal, while are shared between the two nations. About 82\u00a0percent, , of its basin is in Spain, while about 17\u00a0percent, is in Portugal.\nSources.\nThe exact source of the river in Castilla-La Mancha is disputed, but it is generally believed to spring in the Ojos del Guadiana, Villarrubia de los Ojos municipal term, Ciudad Real Province, Castile\u2013La Mancha, about in elevation.\nA classic theory introduced by Pliny the Elder, was that the river originated from the Lagunas de Ruidera and divided into two branches: the Upper Guadiana () and the Guadiana, while separated by a subterranean course. This legend developed from a misguided belief (which persisted until the 19th century) that the river appeared and disappeared over time, because of its subterranean tributary. In fact, no subterranean course exists, and the belief that the Lagunas de Ruidera is the source is also controversial. toponymically and traditionally the Upper Guadiana, which runs from Viveros (Albacete) until Argamasilla de Alba (Ciudad Real) had been identified as the main branch of the Guadiana. But even hydro-geological characteristics indicate that the Upper Guadiana may not be the principal river within the system.\nAnother of the origin theories, postulated that the Cig\u00fcela and Z\u00e1ncara rivers were the sources of the Guadiana. Today, they are considered integral parts of the river's headwaters and important tributaries, but not necessarily the exact origin. The Ciguela's source is in Altos de Cabreras (Cuenca) and pertains to the Sistema Ib\u00e9rico, at an elevation of . Its course is long, receiving contributions from the rivers Jual\u00f3n, Torrej\u00f3n, Ri\u00e1nsares, Amarguillo and Z\u00e1ncara. The union of the rivers Ciguela and Z\u00e1ncara permits the replenishment of the waters in the Tablas de Daimiel National Park, a wetland that was designated for protection by the Spanish government in 1973 (situated in the municipalities of Villarrubia de los Ojos and Daimiel, in the province of Ciudad Real).\nCourse.\nFrom its origin/spring runs from the southern Iberian plain in a direction east to west, to near the town of Badajoz, where it begins to track south leading to the Gulf of C\u00e1diz. The Guadiana marks the border of Spain and Portugal twice as it runs to the ocean: first, between the River Caia and Ribeira de Cuncos, then later from the River Chan\u00e7a until its mouth. The river is not used to completely mark the boundary between the two states; between the Oliven\u00e7a ravine and the T\u00e1liga ravine, the border still remains a disputed section claimed \"de jure\" by both countries and administered \"de facto\" by Spain (as part of the Spanish autonomous community of Extremadura).\nFor the most part, the Guadiana is navigable from the Atlantic Ocean until M\u00e9rtola, a distance of . North of M\u00e9rtola on the Guadiana is the highest waterfall is Southern Portugal called Pulo do Lobo.\nThe ecosystem has Mediterranean hydrological characteristics, including high variation in intra- and inter-annual discharge, large floods and severe droughts. This variability is a consequence of considerable variation in rainwater supply averaging around an annual mean of . The climate is semiarid with an average annual temperature of .\nEstuary.\nThe river empties into the Gulf of C\u00e1diz between Ayamonte and Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio, the two highly touristic regions of the Algarve and the sea-side of Andalusia. There it forms a saltmarsh estuary. The estuary has a maximum width of , and its depth ranges from . Tides are semi-diurnal, ranging from ; their upriver propagation is limited by falls situated from the mouth at Moinho dos Canais. In the lower estuary there are nature reserves covering a total of ; in Spain, the Marismas de Isla Cristina and, in Portugal, the Reserva Natural do Sapal de Castro Marim e Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio (English: \"Castro Marim and Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Marsh Natural Reserve\"); they give a valued nature conservation character to the region.\nHuman impact.\nIn Spain, three autonomous communities, (Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura and Andalusia) (comprising the provinces of Ciudad Real, Badajoz, and Huelva) are crossed by the Guadiana. Meanwhile, in Portugal the river crosses the regions of Alentejo and Algarve, and the districts of Portalegre, \u00c9vora, Beja and Faro. \nDams.\nThere are over 30 dams on the river basin.

It rises near Duruelo de la Sierra in the Spanish province of Soria, meanders briefly south, then flows generally west through the northern part of the Meseta Central in Castile and Le\u00f3n into northern Portugal. Its largest tributary (carrying more water than the Douro at their confluence) is the right-bank Esla. The Douro flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Porto, the second largest city of Portugal.\nThe scenic Douro railway line runs close to the river. Adjacent areas produce port (a mildly fortified wine) and other agricultural produce. A small tributary of the river has the C\u00f4a Valley Paleolithic Art site which is considered important to the archaeological pre-historic patrimony, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within Spain, it flows through the middle of the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n, with the basin spanning through the northern half of the Meseta Central. The latter includes wine producing areas such as the Ribera del Duero DOP.\nName.\nThe Latin name \"Durius\" might have been a Celtic name before the overwhelming Romanization of Iberia. If so, the Celtic root could have been \"*dubro-\" (in that family of languages the final vowel sound often changes with context, as in Latin). However, were that the case, the -\"b\"-, of which there remains no trace, would not have disappeared, as evidenced by place-names derived from Gaulish \"*dubron\" (plural \"dubra\"), such as French Douvres and English Dover (3rd/4th-century \"Dubris\"; \"Douvres\" in French), Spanish Dobra, German Tauber (\"Dubra-gave\" 807), and Gaelic/Old Irish \"dobur\" \"water\" and river name \"Dobhar\" in Ireland and Scotland. Modern Welsh \"d\u0175r\" \"water\" is cognate with modern Breton \"dour\" and Cornish \"dur\" \"water\" and results from a later typical Brittonic evolution of \"*dubro-\", unknown in the Continental Celtic languages.\nThe possible origin is the hydronymic root \"*dur-\", which is Pre-Indo-European or Pre-Celtic. Albert Dauzat linked this river name to a Pre-Celtic hydronymic root \"*dor-\", which is well attested in Western Europe: in France Doire, Doron, Douron, etc. and in Italy Dora, etc. The meaning of this element is, however, unknown.\nA folk-etymological derivation suggests that the name comes from the Portuguese or Spanish term for \"golden\".\nHistory.\nIn Roman times, the river was personified as the god Durius.\nPart of the drainage basin might have been severely depopulated in the 8th century. According to Claudio S\u00e1nchez-Albornoz this was a deliberate act by Alfonso I of Asturias for the defence of his Kingdom, which led the area to be named Repoblaci\u00f3n.\nThe Douro \"vinhateiro\" (\"vine-land\") of the Douro Valley in Portugal, long devoted to vineyards, has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The wine was taken downriver in flat-bottom boats called \"rabelos\", to be stored in barrels in cellars in Vila Nova de Gaia, just across the river from Porto. Nowadays port wine is transported there in tanker trucks.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, dams with locks were built along the river, allowing river traffic into the upper regions in Spain and along the border.\nIn 1998, Portugal and Spain signed the Albufeira Convention, an agreement on the sharing of trans-boundary rivers to include the Douro, Tagus and Guadiana. The convention superseded an agreement on the Douro, signed in 1927, that was expanded in 1964 and 1968 to include tributaries.\nGeography.\nIt is the third-longest river in the Iberian Peninsula after the Tagus and Ebro. Its total length is , of which only stretches of the Portuguese section, being below a fall/rapids line, are naturally navigable, by modest rivercraft. The Douro River basin encompasses an area of approximately .\nIn its Spanish section, the Douro crosses the great Castilian \"meseta\" and meanders through five provinces of the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n: Soria, Burgos, Valladolid, Zamora, and Salamanca, passing through the towns of Soria, Almaz\u00e1n, Aranda de Duero, Tordesillas, and Zamora.\nThe most important tributaries in this region are the Pisuerga, passing through Valladolid, and the Esla, which passes through Zamora. This region is generally semi-arid plains, with wheat and in some places, especially near \"Aranda de Duero\", with vineyards, in the Ribera del Duero wine region. Sheep rearing is also important.\nThe drainage basin borders those of Mi\u00f1o to the north, Ebro to the east, and Tajo to the south.\nFor , the river forms part of the border between Spain and Portugal, in a region of narrow canyons. It formed a historical barrier to invasions, creating a cultural/linguistic divide. In these isolated areas, in which the Aldead\u00e1vila Dam impounds the river, there are protected areas: the International Douro Natural Park (on the Portuguese side) and the Arribes del Duero Natural Park (on the Zamoran margin).\nThe Douro fully enters Portuguese territory just after the confluence with the \u00c1gueda River; once the Douro enters Portugal, major population centres are less frequent along the river. Except for Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia at the river mouth, the only population centres of any note are Foz do Tua, Pinh\u00e3o and Peso da R\u00e9gua. Tributaries here are small, merging into the Douro along the canyons; the most important are C\u00f4a, Tua, Sabor, Corgo, Tavora, Paiva, T\u00e2mega, and Sousa. None of these small, fast-flowing rivers is navigable.\nHuman geography.\nMajor Spanish riverside towns include Soria, Almaz\u00e1n, Aranda de Duero, Tordesillas, Zamora and major Portuguese towns include Miranda do Douro, Foz C\u00f4a, Peso da R\u00e9gua, Lamego, Vila Nova de Gaia, and Porto. The most populous cities along the Douro River are Valladolid and Zamora in Spain, and Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia in Portugal. The latter two are located at the mouth of the Douro at the Atlantic Ocean.\nIn Portugal, the Douro flows through the districts of Bragan\u00e7a, Guarda, Viseu, Vila Real, Aveiro and Porto. Porto is the main hub city in northern Portugal. Its historic centre has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its significant architecture and history.\nEconomy.\nThese reaches of the Douro have a mesoclimate allowing for cultivation of olives, almonds, and especially grapes, which are important for making port. The region around Pinh\u00e3o and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pesqueira is considered to be the centre of port, with its \"quintas\" (or farms/estates) that extend along the steep slopes of the river valleys. In the 21st century, many of these are owned by multinational, reputed wine companies.\nRecently, a prosperous tourist industry has developed based on river excursions from Porto to points along the Upper Douro valley.\nThe Douro railway line () was completed in 1887; it connects Porto, Rio Tinto, Ermesinde, Valongo, Paredes, Penafiel, Livra\u00e7\u00e3o, Marco de Canaveses, R\u00e9gua, Tua and Pocinho.\nPocinho is near the very small city of Foz C\u00f4a, which is close to C\u00f4a Valley Paleolithic Art site. This is considered important to the archaeological pre-historic patrimony, and it has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nDams.\nFifteen dams have been built on the Douro to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. Beginning at the headwaters, the first five dams are in Spain: Cuerda del Pozo, Los R\u00e1banos, San Jos\u00e9, Villalcampo and Castro Dams. The next five downstream are along the Portuguese-Spanish border; the first three are owned and operated by Portugal: (Miranda, Picote and Bemposta Dams), while the next two belong to Spain: (Aldead\u00e1vila and Saucelle Dams).\nThe Douro's last five dams are in Portugal, and allow for navigation: Pocinho, Valeira, R\u00e9gua, Carrapatelo, and Crestuma\u2013Lever dams. Vessels with a maximum length of and width of can pass through the five locks. The highest lock, at Carrapatelo Dam, has a maximum lift of . The waters of Pocinho lake reach above sea level. Unannounced releases of water from upstream Spanish dams occasionally causes navigation issues in these locks.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68692", "revid": "3784107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68692", "title": "Guadalquivir", "text": "River in Spain\nThe Guadalquivir (, , , ) is the fifth-longest river in the Iberian Peninsula and the second-longest river with its entire length in Spain. The Guadalquivir is the only major navigable river in Spain. Currently it is navigable from Seville to the Gulf of C\u00e1diz, but in Roman times it was navigable from C\u00f3rdoba.\nGeography.\nThe river is long and drains an area of about . It flows through C\u00f3rdoba and Seville and reaches the sea at Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, flowing into the Gulf of C\u00e1diz in the Atlantic Ocean.\nCourse.\nThe course of the Guadalquivir is divided into three parts. This division is based on the main course of the river and its confluence with other rivers.\nThe Guadalquivir originates at an elevation of about 1,350 meters above sea level in a place known as Ca\u00f1ada de las Fuentes, in the Sierra de Cazorla mountain range. The upper course of the river runs from the source of the Guadalquivir roughly to Meng\u00edbar. It includes its junction with the Guadalimar, just east of Meng\u00edbar.\nThe middle course starts near Meng\u00edbar and ends near Palma del R\u00edo. It includes the river's confluence with the Guadiana Menor and the Genil. The latter confluence is located between Palma del R\u00edo and Pe\u00f1aflor.\nThe lower course of the Guadalquivir runs from Palma del R\u00edo to the sea. On its lower course, the Guadalquivir is joined by the river Corbon\u00e9s and (from the north west) by the Rivera de Huelva. The marshy lowlands at the river's mouth are known as \"Las Marismas\". Here, the river borders the Do\u00f1ana National Park reserve.\nName.\nThe modern name of Guadalquivir comes from the Arabic \"al-w\u0101d\u012b l-kab\u012br\" (), meaning \"the great river\".\nThere were a variety of names for the Guadalquivir in Classical and pre-Classical times. According to Titus Livius (Livy), \"The History of Rome\", Book 28, the native people of Tartessians or Turdetanians called the river by two names: \"Certis\" \"(Kertis)\" and \"Rherk\u0113s\" (). Greek geographers sometimes called it \"the river of Tartessos\", after the city of that name. The Romans called it by the name (which was the basis for name of the province of Hispania Baetica).\nHistory.\nBetween Seville and Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda.\nDuring a significant portion of the Holocene, the western Guadalquivir valley was occupied by an inland sea, the Tartessian Gulf.\nThe Phoenicians established the first anchorage grounds and dealt in precious metals. The ancient city of Tartessos (that gave its name to the Tartessian Civilization) was said to have been located at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, although its site has not yet been found.\nThe Romans, whose name for the river was \"Baetis\", settled in Hispalis (Seville), in the 2nd century BC, making it into an important river port. By the 1st century BC, Hispalis was a walled city with shipyards building longboats to carry wheat. In the 1st century AD the Hispalis was home to entire naval squadrons. Ships sailed to Rome with various products: minerals, salt, fish, etc. During the Arab rule between 712 and 1248 the Moors built a stone dock and the Torre del Oro (Tower of Gold), to reinforce the port defences.\nIn the 13th century Ferdinand III expanded the shipyards and from Seville's busy port, grain, oil, wine, wool, leather, cheese, honey, wax, nuts and dried fruit, salted fish, metal, silk, linen and dye were exported throughout Europe.\nFollowing the discovery of the Americas, Seville became the economic centre of the Spanish Empire, because its port, under the jurisdiction of the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n (House of Trade), had come to hold the monopoly of the trans-oceanic trade. As early as the Middle Ages navigation of the Guadalquivir River was already becoming increasingly difficult: by the year 1500, a great deal of heavy cargo was being handled farther downstream at the harbor of Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, where the Guadalquivir exits into the sea. As a consequence, Seville finally lost its trade monopoly to C\u00e1diz.\nDuring the late 18th century, a long series of works was started to again provide Seville with a good connection to the sea. The construction of the canal known as the Corta de Merlina in 1794 marked the beginning of the modernisation of the port of Seville. After five years of work (2005\u20132010), in late November 2010 the new Seville lock designed to regulate tides was finally in operation.\nUpstream to C\u00f3rdoba.\nIn medieval times, the Guadalquivir was navigable for barges from Seville up to C\u00f3rdoba. In the city, there were piers at the Albolafia mill and near the Martos Mill. The bulky wool transports often left from the Cortijo Rubio pier about 15\u00a0km downstream. In medieval times, the river transport between Sevilla and C\u00f3rdoba was managed by the Barqueros de C\u00f3rdoba.\nIn medieval times, the navigable river gave C\u00f3rdoba a cost advantage. It had relatively cheap transport to the sea, and thence to the world markets. Main imports like iron and wood, were also cheaper in C\u00f3rdoba than in cities that lacked aquatic transport. During the 16th century, the silting up of the Guadalquivir became ever more serious and started to halt navigation on the river. In 1524 Fern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Oliva made a famous speech about navigation between Sevilla and C\u00f3rdoba.\nThe use of the river section between C\u00f3rdoba and Sevilla as a power source, was another reason for the decline of navigation on this section of the river. The weirs that stored water in order to guarantee a steady power supply for water mills, directly hindered navigation. There were openings in the weirs, but their passage caused much damage to the barges. The weirs also led to raising the river bed. Perez de Oliva proposed to build locks in these weirs as a preliminary measure to restore navigation. In the end, the above developments put an end to inland navigation in the area.\nThe iconic Albolafia is a hydropowered scoop wheel. It was originally built by the Romans and lifted water from the river to the nearby Alc\u00e1zar gardens. It was also used to mill flour.\nFlooding.\nThe Guadalquivir River Basin occupies an area of 63,085\u00a0km2 and has a long history of severe flooding.\nDuring the winter of 2010 heavy rainfall caused severe flooding in rural and agricultural areas in the provinces of Seville, C\u00f3rdoba and Ja\u00e9n in the Andalusia region. The accumulated rainfall in the month of February was above , double the precipitation for Spain for that month. In March 2010 several tributaries of the Guadalquivir flooded, causing over 1,500 people to flee their homes as a result of the increased flow of the Guadalquivir, which on 6 March 2010 reached in C\u00f3rdoba and in Seville. This was below that recorded in Seville in the flood of 1963 when . was reached. During August 2010, when flooding occurred in Ja\u00e9n, C\u00f3rdoba and Seville, three people died in C\u00f3rdoba.\nPollution.\nThe Do\u00f1ana disaster, also known as the Aznalc\u00f3llar Disaster or Guadiamar Disaster was an industrial accident in Andalusia. In April 1998 a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine, near Aznalc\u00f3llar, Seville Province, releasing of mine tailings. The Do\u00f1ana National Park was also affected by this event.\nDams and bridges.\nOf the numerous bridges spanning the Guadalquivir, one of the oldest is the Roman bridge of C\u00f3rdoba. Significant bridges at Seville include the Puente del Alamillo (1992), Puente de Isabel II or Puente de Triana (1852), and Puente del Centenario (completed in 1992).\nThe El Tranco de Beas Dam at the head of the river was built between 1929 and 1944 as a hydroelectricity project of the Franco regime.\nDo\u00f1a Aldonza Dam is located in the Guadalquivir riverbed, in the Andalusian municipalities of \u00dabeda, Peal de Becerro and Torreperogil in the province of Ja\u00e9n.\nPorts.\nThe Port of Seville is the main port on the Guadalquivir River. The Port Authority of Seville is responsible for developing, managing, operating, and marketing the Port of Seville.\nThe entrance to the Port of Seville is protected by a lock that regulates the water level, making the port free of tidal influences. The Port of Seville has over of berths for public use and of private berths. These docks and berths are used for solid and liquid bulk cargoes, roll-on/roll-off cargoes, containers, private vessels and cruise ships.\nIn 2001, the Port of Seville handled almost of cargo, including of solid bulk, of general cargo, and over of liquid bulk. Almost 1,500 vessels brought cargo into the port, including more than 101,000 TEUs of containerized cargo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the third son of Xerxes I.\nIn Greek sources he is also surnamed \"Long-handed\" ( \"Makr\u00f3kheir\"; ), allegedly because his right hand was longer than his left.\nJosephus and several ancient traditions identify him as King Ahasuerus, from the Book of Esther.\nSuccession to the throne.\nArtaxerxes was probably born in the reign of his grandfather Darius I, to the emperor's son and heir, Xerxes I. In 465 BC, Xerxes I was murdered by \"Hazarapat\" (\"commander of thousand\") Artabanus, the commander of the royal bodyguard and the most powerful official in the Persian court, with the help of a eunuch, Aspamitres. Greek historians give contradicting accounts of events. According to Ctesias (in \"Persica\" 20), Artabanus then accused Crown Prince Darius, Xerxes's eldest son, of the murder, and persuaded Artaxerxes to avenge the patricide by killing Darius. But according to Aristotle (in \"Politics\" 5.1311b), Artabanus killed Darius first and then killed Xerxes. After Artaxerxes discovered the murder, he killed Artabanus and his sons.\nEgyptian revolt.\nArtaxerxes had to face a revolt in Egypt in 460\u2013454 BC led by Inaros II, who was the son of a Libyan prince named Psamtik, presumably descended from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. In 460 BC, Inaros II revolted against the Persians with the help of his Athenian allies, and defeated the Persian army commanded by satrap Achaemenes. The Persians retreated to Memphis, and the Athenians were finally defeated in 454 BC, by the Persian army led by Megabyzus, after a two-year siege. Inaros was captured and carried away to Susa.\nRelations with Greece.\nAfter the Achaemenid Empire had been defeated at the Battle of the Eurymedon (c. 469 BC), military action between Greece and Persia was at a standstill. When Artaxerxes\u00a0I took power, he introduced a new Persian strategy of weakening the Athenians by funding their enemies in Greece. This indirectly caused the Athenians to move the treasury of the Delian League from the island of Delos to the Athenian acropolis. This funding practice inevitably prompted renewed fighting in 450\u00a0BC, where the Greeks attacked at the Battle of Cyprus. After Cimon's failure to attain much in this expedition, hostilities ceased. Later sources argue that the purported Peace of Callias was agreed among Athens, Argos and Persia in 449\u00a0BC; however, the existence of a formal treaty between the Greek States and Persia is disputed.\nArtaxerxes\u00a0I offered asylum to Themistocles, who was probably his father Xerxes's greatest enemy for his victory at the Battle of Salamis, after Themistocles was ostracized from Athens. Also, Artaxerxes I gave him Magnesia, Myus, and Lampsacus to maintain him in bread, meat, and wine. In addition, Artaxerxes I gave him Skepsis to provide him with clothes, and he also gave him Percote with bedding for his house. Themistocles would go on to learn and adopt Persian customs, Persian language, and traditions.\nPortrayal in the Book of Ezra and Nehemiah.\nA King Artaxerxes is described in the Bible (Ezra 7) as having commissioned Ezra, a kohen and scribe, by means of a letter of decree, to take charge of the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the Jewish nation.\nEzra thereby left Babylon in the first month of the seventh year of Artaxerxes' reign, at the head of a company of Jews that included priests and Levites. They arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month of the seventh year according to the Hebrew calendar. The text (Ezra 7) does not specify whether the king in the passage refers to Artaxerxes I (465\u2013424 BC) or to Artaxerxes II (404\u2013359 BC). Most scholars hold that Ezra lived during the rule of Artaxerxes I, though some have difficulties with this assumption: Nehemiah and Ezra \"seem to have no knowledge of each other; their missions do not overlap.\" However, in Nehemiah 12, both are leading processions on the wall as part of the wall dedication ceremony. So, they clearly were contemporaries working together in Jerusalem at the time the wall and the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt in contrast to the previously stated viewpoint. These difficulties have led many scholars to assume that Ezra arrived in the seventh year of the rule of Artaxerxes II, i.e. some 50 years after Nehemiah. This assumption would imply that the biblical account is not chronological. The last group of scholars regard \"the seventh year\" as a scribal error and hold that the two men were contemporaries. However, Ezra appears for the first time in Nehemiah 8, having probably been at the court for twelve years.\nThe rebuilding of the Jewish community in Jerusalem had begun under Cyrus the Great, who had permitted Jews held captive in Babylon to return to Jerusalem and rebuild Solomon's Temple. Consequently, a number of Jews returned to Jerusalem in 538 BC, and the foundation of this \"Second Temple\" was laid in 536 BC, in the second year of their return (Ezra 3:8). After a period of strife, the temple was finally completed in the sixth year of Darius, 516 BC (Ezra 6:15).\nIn Artaxerxes' twentieth year, Nehemiah, the king's cup-bearer, apparently was also a friend of the king as in that year Artaxerxes inquired after Nehemiah's sadness. Nehemiah related to him the plight of the Jewish people and that the city of Jerusalem was undefended. The king sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem with letters of safe passage to the governors in Trans-Euphrates, and to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, to make beams for the citadel by the Temple and to rebuild the city walls.\nInterpretations of actions.\nRoger Williams, a 17th-century Christian minister and founder of Rhode Island, interpreted several passages in the Old and New Testament to support limiting government interference in religious matters. Williams published \"The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience,\" arguing for a separation of church and state based on biblical reasoning. Williams believed that Israel was a unique covenant kingdom and not an appropriate model for New Testament Christians who believed that the Old Testament covenant had been fulfilled. Therefore, the more informative Old Testament examples of civil government were \"good\" non-covenant kings such as Artaxerxes, who tolerated the Jews and did not insist that they follow his state religion.\nMedical analysis.\nAccording to a paper published in 2011, the discrepancy in Artaxerxes\u2019 limb lengths may have arisen as a result of the inherited disease neurofibromatosis.\nChildren.\nBy queen Damaspia\nBy Alogyne of Babylon\nBy Cosmartidene of Babylon\nBy Andia of Babylon\nBy another(?) unknown wife\nBy various wives\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These were modified, expanded, and elaborated by the Ionian Greek colonists. Doric Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484\u2013425 BC), born in the city of Halicarnassus under the Achaemenid Empire, who gives the account of Cadmus, estimates that Semele lived either 1,000 or 1,600 years prior to his visit to Tyre in 450 BC at the end of the Greco-Persian Wars (499\u2013449 BC) or around 2050 or 1450 BC. In Rome, the goddess Stimula was identified as Semele.\nSemele was the subject of the now lost tragedy by Aeschylus called \"Semele\" (\"\u03a3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\") or \"Wool-Carders\" (\"\u039e\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\").\nEtymology.\nAccording to some linguists the name Semele is Thraco-Phrygian, derived from a PIE root meaning 'earth'. A Phrygian inscription refers to \"di\u014ds zemel\u014d\" (). The first word corresponds to Greek \"Zeus\" (genit. Dios) and the second to \"earth\" in some Indo-European languages. Julius Pokorny reconstructs her name from the PIE root \"*\" meaning 'earth' and relates it with Thracian , 'mother earth'. Compare \u017demyna (derived from \u017eem\u0117 \u2013 earth), the goddess of the earth (mother goddess) in Lithuanian mythology, and Zeme, also referred to as Zemes-m\u00e3te, a Slavic and Latvian goddess of the earth.\nMallory and Adams suggest that, although Semele is \"etymologically related\" to other mother Earth/Earth goddess cognates, her name might be a borrowing \"from another IE source\", not inherited as part of the Ancient Greek lexicon. Burkert says that while Semele is \"manifestly non-Greek\", \"it is no more possible to confirm that Semele is a Thraco-Phrygian word for earth than it is to prove the priority of the Lydian over Bacchus as a name for Dionysos\".M.L.West derives the Phrygian \"zemelo\", Old Slavonic \"zemlya\",Lithuanian \"z\u0113m\u0113\" from the Indo-European name *d\u02b0\u00e9\u01f5\u02b0\u014dm (earth). Semele seems to be a Thracian name of the earth goddess from \"g\u02b0em-el\u0101\". The pronunciation was probably Zemel\u0101.\nEtymological connections of Thraco-Phrygian with\nBalto-Slavic earth deities have been noted, since an alternate name for Baltic Zemyna is , and in Slavic languages, the word (Semele) means 'seed', and (Zemele) means 'earth'. Thus, according to Borissoff, \"she could be an important link bridging the ancient Thracian and Slavonic cults (...)\".\nMythology.\nSeduction by Zeus and birth of Dionysus.\nIn one version of the myth, Semele was a priestess of Zeus, and on one occasion was observed by Zeus as she slaughtered a bull at his altar and afterwards swam in the river Asopus to cleanse herself of the blood. Flying over the scene in the guise of an eagle, Zeus fell in love with Semele and repeatedly visited her secretly.\nZeus's wife, Hera, a goddess jealous of usurpers, discovered his affair with Semele when she later became pregnant. Appearing as an old crone, Hera befriended Semele, who confided in her that her lover was actually Zeus. Hera pretended not to believe her, and planted seeds of doubt in Semele's mind. Curious, Semele asked Zeus to grant her a boon. Zeus, eager to please his beloved, promised on the River Styx to grant her anything she wanted. She then demanded that Zeus reveal himself in all his glory as proof of his divinity. Though Zeus begged her not to ask this, she persisted and he was forced by his oath to comply. Zeus tried to spare her by showing her the smallest of his bolts and the sparsest thunderstorm clouds he could find. Mortals, however, cannot look upon the gods without incinerating, and she perished, consumed in a lightning-ignited flame.\nZeus rescued the fetal Dionysus, however, by sewing him into his thigh (whence the epithet Eiraphiotes, 'insewn', of the Homeric Hymn). A few months later, Dionysus was born. This leads to his being called \"the twice-born\".\nWhen he grew up, Dionysus rescued his mother from Hades, and she became a goddess on Mount Olympus, with the new name \"Thyone\", presiding over the frenzy inspired by her son Dionysus. At a later point in the epic \"Dionysiaca\", Semele, now resurrected, boasts to her sister Ino how Cronida ('Kronos's son', that is, Zeus), \"the plower of her field\", carried on the gestation of Dionysus and now her son gets to join the heavenly deities in Olympus, while Ino languishes with a murderous husband (since Athamas tried to kill Ino and her son), and a son that lives with maritime deities.\nImpregnation by Zeus.\nThere is a story in the \"Fabulae\" 167 of Gaius Julius Hyginus, or a later author whose work has been attributed to Hyginus. In this, Dionysus (called Liber) is the son of Jupiter and Proserpina, and was killed by the Titans. Jupiter gave his torn up heart in a drink to Semele, who became pregnant this way. But in another account, Zeus swallows the heart himself, in order to beget his seed on Semele. Hera then convinces Semele to ask Zeus to come to her as a god, and on doing so she dies, and Zeus seals the unborn baby up in his thigh.\nAs a result of this Dionysus \"was also called Dimetor [of two mothers]\u00a0... because the two \"Dionysoi\" were born of one father, but of two mothers\"\nStill another variant of the narrative is found in Callimachus and the 5th century CE Greek writer Nonnus. In this version, the first Dionysus is called Zagreus. Nonnus does not present the conception as virginal; rather, the editor's notes say that Zeus swallowed Zagreus' heart, and visited the mortal woman Semele, whom he seduced and made pregnant. Nonnus classifies Zeus's affair with Semele as one in a set of twelve, the other eleven women on whom he begot children being Io, Europa, Pluto, Dana\u00eb, Aigina, Antiope, Leda, Dia, Alcmene, Laodameia, the mother of Sarpedon, and Olympias.\nLocations.\nThe most usual setting for the story of Semele is the palace that occupied the acropolis of Thebes, called the \"Cadmeia\". When Pausanias visited Thebes in the 2nd century CE, he was shown the very bridal chamber where Zeus visited her and begat Dionysus. Since an Oriental inscribed cylindrical seal found at the palace can be dated 14th-13th centuries, the myth of Semele must be Mycenaean or earlier in origin. At the Alcyonian Lake near the prehistoric site of Lerna, Dionysus, guided by Prosymnus or Polymnus, descended to Tartarus to free his once-mortal mother. Annual rites took place there in classical times; Pausanias refuses to describe them.\nThough the Greek myth of Semele was localized in Thebes, the fragmentary Homeric Hymn to Dionysus makes the place where Zeus gave a second birth to the god a distant one, and mythically vague:\n\"For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to Zeus the thunder-lover. And others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed Hera. There is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice, near the streams of Aegyptus...\"\nSemele was worshipped at Athens at the Lenaia, when a yearling bull, emblematic of Dionysus, was sacrificed to her. One-ninth was burnt on the altar in the Hellenic way; the rest was torn and eaten raw by the votaries.\nA unique tale, \"found nowhere else in Greece\" and considered to be a local version of her legend, is narrated by geographer Pausanias in his \"Description of Greece\": after giving birth to her semi-divine son, Dionysus, fathered by Zeus, Semele was banished from the realm by her father Cadmus. Their sentence was to be put into a chest or a box () and cast in the sea. Luckily, the casket they were in washed up by the waves at Prasiae. However, it has been suggested that this tale might have been a borrowing from the story of Dana\u00eb and Perseus.\n\"Semele\" was a tragedy by Aeschylus; it has been lost, save a few lines quoted by other writers, and a papyrus fragment from Oxyrhynchus, P. Oxy. 2164.\nIn Etruscan culture.\nSemele is attested with the Etruscan name form Semla, depicted on the back of a bronze mirror from the fourth century BC.\nIn Roman culture.\nIn ancient Rome, a grove \"(lucus)\" near Ostia, situated between the Aventine Hill and the mouth of the Tiber River, was dedicated to a goddess named Stimula. W.H. Roscher includes the name \"Stimula\" among the \"indigitamenta\", the lists of Roman deities maintained by priests to assure that the correct divinity was invoked in public rituals. In his poem on the Roman calendar, Ovid (d. 17 CE) identifies this goddess with Semele:\nAugustine notes that the goddess is named after , 'goads, whips,' by means of which a person is driven to excessive actions. The goddess's grove was the site of the Dionysian scandal that led to official attempts to suppress the cult. The Romans viewed the Bacchanals with suspicion, based on reports of ecstatic behaviors contrary to Roman social norms and the secrecy of initiatory rite. In 186 BC, the Roman senate took severe actions to limit the cult, without banning it. Religious beliefs and myths associated with Dionysus were successfully adapted and remained pervasive in Roman culture, as evidenced for instance by the Dionysian scenes of Roman wall painting and on sarcophagi from the 1st to the 4th centuries AD.\nThe Greek cult of Dionysus had flourished among the Etruscans in the archaic period, and had been made compatible with Etruscan religious beliefs. One of the main principles of the Dionysian mysteries that spread to Latium and Rome was the concept of rebirth, to which the complex myths surrounding the god's own birth were central. Birth and childhood deities were important to Roman religion; Ovid identifies Semele's sister Ino as the nurturing goddess Mater Matuta. This goddess had a major cult center at Satricum that was built 500\u2013490 BC. The female consort who appears with Bacchus in the acroterial statues there may be either Semele or Ariadne. The pair were part of the Aventine Triad in Rome as Liber and Libera, along with Ceres. The temple of the triad is located near the Grove of Stimula, and the grove and its shrine \"(sacrarium)\" were located outside Rome's sacred boundary \"(pomerium)\", perhaps as the \"dark side\" of the Aventine Triad.\nIn the classical tradition.\nIn the later mythological tradition of the Christian era, ancient deities and their narratives were often interpreted allegorically. In the Neoplatonic philosophy of Henry More (1614\u20131687), for instance, Semele was thought to embody \"intellectual imagination\", and was construed as the opposite of Arachne, \"sense perception\".\nIn the 18th century, the story of Semele formed the basis for three operas of the same name, the first by John Eccles (1707, to a libretto by William Congreve), another by Marin Marais (1709), and a third by George Frideric Handel (1742). Handel's work, based on Congreve's libretto but with additions, while an opera to its marrow, was originally given as an oratorio so that it could be performed in a Lenten concert series; it premiered on February 10, 1744. The German dramatist Schiller produced a singspiel entitled \"Semele\" in 1782. Victorian poet Constance Naden wrote a sonnet in the voice of Semele, first published in her 1881 collection \"Songs and Sonnets of Springtime\". Paul Dukas composed a cantata, \"S\u00e9m\u00e9l\u00e9\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

People smuggling generally takes place with the consent of the person or persons being smuggled, and common reasons for individuals seeking to be smuggled include employment and economic opportunity, personal and/or familial betterment, and escape from persecution, violence or conflict.\nIn 2015, the ongoing civil war in Syria has led to massive displacement and reliance on people smugglers to assist people to seek sanctuary in Europe. This has also led to unprecedented movements \u2013 and deaths \u2013 across the Mediterranean. According to UNHCR statistics, there have been almost one million arrivals by sea in Europe in 2015, and more than 2900 dead or missing migrants. According to the IOM Missing Migrants Project, there have been more than 3800 deaths during migration around the world in 2015, and over 70,000 from 2014 to 2024: some 10,000 of these in the Americas and 30,000 of these in the Mediterranean. However, a 2024 UNHCR report revealed that deaths in the Sahara desert are estimated to be double those occurring in the Mediterranean Sea, with land route fatalities being significantly under-documented due to the remoteness of desert crossings.\nUnlike human trafficking, people smuggling is characterized by the consent between customer and smuggler \u2013 a contractual agreement that typically terminates upon arrival in the destination location. However, smuggling situations can nonetheless in reality descend into situations that can best be described as extreme human rights abuses, with smuggled migrants subject to threats, abuse, exploitation and torture, and even death at the hands of smugglers. People involved in smuggling operations may also be victims of trafficking, for example when they are tricked about the terms and conditions of their role for the purpose of exploiting their labour in the operation.\nSmuggling operations are complex, working within networks of many individual players. As smuggling operations and its underlying infrastructure becomes increasingly intricate, so do the issues surrounding the matter of people smuggling. With major and minor players spanning the globe, people smuggling poses a significant economic and legal impact on society, and solutions to the problem of people smuggling remain contested and under continued debate and development. Smuggling has been described as the classic \"wicked problem: one that is hard to define, keeps changing, and does not present a clear solution because of pre-existing factors that are themselves highly resistant to change \u2013 in this case the very existence of States, gross inequalities among them, and strong motivations on the part of some to keep them out.\" Because every state has different economics and governments, this problem cannot be universally defined, and this makes it more difficult for law enforcement to stop smuggling of people, as they have to adapt to the conditions in different states.\nReasons.\nMany individuals who consent to being smuggled are escaping poverty and hardship, seeking opportunities and better conditions abroad, or seeking asylum from natural disaster, conflict, or persecution, but aren't able to legally immigrate due to a weak passport, or fear of being deported or imprisoned. While many who are smuggled are poor and uneducated, there are also others who belong to the educated middle class. \nOperations.\nPeople smuggling operations range from small to large-scale actors operating in a transnational market. Small-scale smugglers generally arrange all aspects of the smuggling operations themselves. However, more commonly, smugglers engage and do business within a larger smuggling network where there is a division of work among the actors involved. In the past, smuggling rings tended to be more obscure, amateurish, and limited. As people smuggling has continued to grow, however, smuggling rings are far more extensive and organized. In Mexico, as Jim Chaparro \u2013 head of the anti-smuggling office at the US Immigration and Naturalization Service \u2013 puts it, the once small and informal smuggling business has evolved into a powerful web of \"literally hundreds of syndicates, some at a low level and some at the kingpin level\". (In fact, as the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States from Mexico has become more organized, there has opened an opportunity for smuggling groups within Mexico to market their services to non-Mexicans. Indeed, smuggling operations are often complex and smuggled persons often make stops at countries across the globe before arriving at their final destination.)\nA Lebanese-Mexican Symbiotic smuggling network involved in human smuggling into the United States of America that came to the attention of law enforcement and counterintelligence has been described in the literature.\nOver the years, smuggling has evolved into a sophisticated service industry, with certain routes and enclaves used by smugglers becoming practically institutionalized; for example: from Mexico and Central America to the United States, from West Asia through Greece and Turkey to Western Europe, and within East and Southeast Asia. Responsible for the flourishing business of people smuggling are a combination of interacting factors, from weak legislation and lax border controls to corrupt officials and the power of organized crime.\nThe complexity of the smuggling network is dependent upon the route to be taken and the nature of the journey. For routes that are well-known and tested, smugglers may function more as family enterprises and utilize fairly contained operations. The more complex the route, however, the more members of the smuggling network must be recruited. In general, the infrastructure of the people smuggling business is nontraditional, with no clearly identifiable organization and no rigid structure. The network of smugglers is diffused and decentralized. Smugglers form temporary business alliances, and the organization of smugglers can best be understood and described as ad hoc task forces, in which activities are specialized and controlled by individuals that deal with each other on a one-to-one basis. In the business of people smuggling, there is no single \"godfather\" figure who commands the activities of subordinates; rather, individuals conduct business on equal grounds and tend to consider themselves free agents. In fact, according to a Los Angeles-based smuggler, \"The division of labor is really clear and refined. Everyone involved is useful in his own way and does his own thing only. There is no leadership in any smuggling rings. Leadership will not emerge because the work involved is so specialized\".\nAccording to Frontex, people smugglers give detailed descriptions of benefits of individual EU countries so they can compare the available benefits of for instance Sweden, Denmark and Germany before applying for asylum.\nSmuggling vs. trafficking.\nA concerted international focus on defining and responding to migrant smuggling only occurred in the 1990s. This focus followed sharp rises in irregular migration to the United States, and to Europe in the 1980s and 1990s. A focus on those who facilitate irregular migration \u2013 rather than migrants themselves \u2013 was seen as a critical element of any response. The resulting legal framework was the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (Migrant Smuggling Protocol), that supplements the parent instrument, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.\nThe Migrant Smuggling Protocol does not provide a complete or self-contained legal regime. It exists as part of a \"dense web of rights, obligations and responsibilities drawn not just from the Protocol and Convention but also from the law of the sea, human rights law, and refugee law\".\nAn important distinction to make is that between human smuggling and human trafficking. Given the complex nature of human smuggling and trafficking operations, the difference between these two criminal operations is not always readily apparent. Delineating between the two involves taking closer look at the subtle differences between each.\nGenerally speaking, human trafficking involves transporting individuals from one place to another either against their will or under some sort of false pretense. With smuggling, on the other hand, there is understood to be an agreement between smuggler and customer, a meeting of the minds and a contract between the two. These differences can similarly be detected in the Trafficking and Smuggling Protocols (more commonly known as the Palermo Protocols) passed by the UN Convention on Transnational Organized Crime. The Palermo Protocols frame the difference between smuggling and trafficking around the dichotomy of coercion and consent: whereas people who are trafficked are considered \"victims\" or \"survivors\", individuals who are smuggled are seen as having engaged willingly in an enterprise that one or both of the bordering countries consider illegal. (This dichotomous framework is particularly evident in the protections afforded for each group. The Trafficking Protocol addresses the need for protection of trafficked persons and provides for a broad range of protective measures, while the Smuggling Protocol contains minimal reference to protections for smuggled persons).\nMore specifically, below are three main technical differences between smuggling and trafficking, which are as follows: \nThe recognition of trafficked persons as \"victims\" but smuggled migrants as \"objects\" of a process is a principal point of difference between how international law treats trafficked and smuggled migrants. Nonetheless, it is important to recognise that in reality and in law, smuggled migrants can still be victims of crime \u2013 whether this is theft, fraud, sexual assault, deprivation of liberty or even human trafficking.\nSometimes there is a gender dimension to the distinction between smuggling and trafficking: those who are smuggled are often assumed to be mostly men, whereas victims of trafficking are more commonly assumed to be women and children.\nMajor players.\nWith smugglers operating from numerous countries across the globe, there are myriad minor and major players within the people smuggling scene. Of wide and notable repute, however, are the Snakeheads and Coyotes, which operate in the business of smuggling Chinese and Mexican migrants, respectively.\nSnakeheads.\nThe name \"Snakehead\" refers to those underground players who operate in facilitating the illicit transport of Chinese migrants into countries like the United States and other Western countries. (The name originates from the fact that the lines of emigrants sneaking under borders is said to look like a snake.) Operating in an extensive transnational black market, Snakeheads reap considerable profits from their smuggling operations and both are regarded and consider themselves not as criminals but as resourceful guides. The earliest snakeheads went into business around the 1970s ferrying customers from Fuzhou or Changle into Hong Kong. Today, Snakehead operations have expanded enormously into other countries; however, the majority of Snakehead customers still originate from the Fujian province in China. One of the most notable Snakeheads was Sister Ping, who ran a successful and extensive smuggling operation in New York from 1984 to 2000, when she was finally caught by authorities following the disaster involving the \"Golden Venture\".\nCoyotes.\n\"Coyotes\" is the name for smugglers who facilitate the migration of people across the Mexico\u2013United States and Bolivia\u2013Chile borders. Another term used for minors who smuggle people across the Mexico\u2013United States border is \"polleros\". Once dominated by local smugglers charging relatively small sums, the business landscape has changed as larger, well-organized syndicates have entered the smuggling industry in Mexico. Over the years, Coyotes have become more sophisticated in their operations, as technological advances have allowed them to streamline and add further complexity to their business.\nFacts and figures.\nVirtually every country in the world is affected by people smuggling, be it in the capacity of country of origin, transit, or destination. While reliable data is scarce, experts note that \"current estimates place the number of irregular migrants worldwide at up to thirty million and that a substantial proportion of these persons can be expected to have used the services of smugglers at one or more points in their journey\".\nPeople smuggling between the United States and Mexico is a booming business that, as of 2003, garnered over $5\u00a0billion a year. Similarly, in the EU, profits from people smuggling operations is estimated to be around \u20ac4\u00a0billion per year.\nPeople smuggling is a dangerous operation and has frequently resulted in the death of those individuals being smuggled. In 2004, 464 recorded deaths took place during the crossing from Mexico to the United States, and each year, an estimated 2000 people drown in the Mediterranean on the journey from Africa into Europe.\nOn 14 September 2018, US media reported that Jacklyn, a seven-year-old girl from Guatemala, had died while in custody of US Customs. The girl's family denied she did not have enough food to eat before she died.\nEstimated number of smuggled individuals.\nBecause of the clandestine nature of people smuggling operations, information currently available is scattered and incomplete. As such, verifiable or even reliable figures are difficult, if not impossible to come by, and the data on the number of smuggled individuals is tenuous at best. However, as of 2005, it was estimated that upwards of 350,000 illegal immigrants are smuggled across America's border from Mexico each year, and as many as 800,000 enter the European Union.\nEstimated costs.\nSmugglers' fees vary from destination to destination, but on the whole, they have risen dramatically over the years. The prices paid to human smugglers by immigrants vary depending on the geographic location. For border crossings such as from Mexico into the United States, human smugglers can charge up to $4,000, while trans-Pacific crossings of, for example, Chinese immigrants into the United States can cost up to $75,000. These prices are significantly steeper than they were a decade ago, as demand for smuggling services continues to rise, operations become more complex, and costs of smuggling individuals become higher.\nCriminal elements.\nPeople smuggling \u2013 specifically migrant smuggling \u2013 constitutes criminal conduct. However, criminal elements of smuggling may reach beyond the sphere of human smuggling. In a testimony before Congress, William D. Cadman \u2013 INS counterterrorism coordinator \u2013 stated, \"Organized crime syndicates...are known to use alien-smuggling operations to support and further their criminal objectives\". \nGiven the dangerous and clandestine criminal nature of people smuggling operations, smuggled persons are sometimes at risk of becoming victims of other crimes. Aside from subjection to unsafe conditions in their journeys to their destinations, smuggled individuals may also be subject to physical or sexual abuse or placed in hostage-like conditions until their debts are paid off. Others might face exploitation or be forced to participate in other criminal activities during their journey as smuggled individuals. Because smuggling can generate substantial profits for those involved, which in turn can fuel corruption and organized crime in countries traveled from, through, or to during the smuggling process.\nCountries that have ratified the Migrant Smuggling Protocol are obligated to ensure migrant smuggling offences are criminal in their national laws. The UN has produced a Model Law that sets out minimum and recommended provisions for national laws on migrant smuggling. This includes model criminal offence provisions (see further, UNODC, Model Law against the Smuggling of Migrants).\nDrug trafficking.\nGiven the clandestine but booming nature of people smuggling operations \u2013 especially in places like Mexico \u2013 drug cartels have also begun tapping into the smuggling network. Cartels have made money not only by taxing Coyotes but also directly engaging in the business of smuggling. In the late 1990s, Mexican drug cartels began initially moving into people smuggling by taxing Coyotes for leading bands of smuggled people across cartel-controlled territory. As these drug cartels have gotten more directly involved, however, they are beginning to play a more central role in the business of people smuggling and often exploit individuals \u2013 seen as human cargo \u2013 and using them by loading them up with backpacks full of marijuana. Sometimes, the costs of the expensive journey may be defrayed as migrants serve as \"mules\", carrying drugs out of Mexico.\nThe questions of whether smuggling groups or syndicates would smuggle two different types of contraband at the same time (Multiple Consignment Contraband) (MCC) has been debated within and between law enforcement and intelligence analysts. Furthermore, if this type of smuggling is occurring, which types of MCC are most likely to be bundled together and which type of smuggling group (defined by level of sophistication) would engage in MCC and which regions in the world are most likely to be confronted with MCC also has been discussed by these analysts.\nThe Lichtenwald, Perri and MacKenzie article identified sixteen cases of different smuggling groups smuggling more than one type of contraband at the same time. Four of the sixteen cases involved MCC human and drug smuggling. Three of the four MCC human and drug smuggling organizations were targeting the United States of America.\nLaw enforcement and discouragement.\nThus far, global efforts to curb and stymie the growing tide of smuggled individuals have been largely focused on the apprehension and deportation of individual migrants. Little has been done in the way of dismantling the organizations behind the business of people smuggling. According to the UNODC, \"[t]ackling migrant smuggling necessitates a comprehensive, multi-dimensional response, which begins with addressing the socio-economic root causes of irregular migration to prevent it, and goes through to prosecution of criminals who commit smuggling-related crimes\". At the same time, scientific studies on the counterproductive aspects of security policies have shown \"how smugglers, as a category of actors playing a specific part in the global migration process, are directly manufactured by the migration policies\".\nOther proposals include focusing not on banning or trying to stifle the smuggling industry, but on undercutting it. Michael Jandl from the International Center for Migration Policy Development, an intergovernmental think-tank based in Vienna, has suggested that governments issue temporary visas in the smugglers' best markets at fees priced to compete with the smugglers' rates. Under this proposed plan, one-third of the visa fee could be returned to immigrants upon their departure, and opportunities to purchase additional visas in the future would be available for those who did not break any rules.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIn January 2025, the UK introduced 'world first' sanctions regime against people smugglers by cutting off the illicit financing that fuels their operations. The sanctions include measures such as asset freezes, travel bans, and social media blackouts. These actions aim to prevent and disrupt irregular migration and the smuggling of migrants into the UK.\nStatistics.\nFollowing table shows the recent annual people smuggling report rate per 100,000 population.

{"id": "68722", "revid": "42070973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68722", "title": "Bridget Jones's Diary (novel)", "text": "1996 novel by Helen Fielding\nBridget Jones's Diary is a 1996 novel by Helen Fielding. Written in the form of a personal diary, the novel chronicles a year in the life of Bridget Jones, a thirty-something single working woman living in London. She writes about her career, self-image, vices, family, friends, and romantic relationships.\nBy 2006, the book had sold over two million copies worldwide. Critics have credited Fielding's novel as the \"urtext\" of the contemporary chick lit movement. A sequel, \"\", was published in 1999, and two further novels, \"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy\" and \"Bridget Jones's Baby,\" were published in 2013 and 2016 respectively. The original novel was adapted into a popular 2001 film; it was later developed into a series with released in 2025.\nPlot.\nThe plot is focused on Bridget's love life. She regularly worries about dying being eaten by dogs when her singleness causes her death not to be discovered promptly, an obsession that a \"USA Today\" reviewer called \"one of [Bridget's] more cheerful daydreams\". However, during the course of the year, she becomes involved in two romantic relationships. The first is with her charming and handsome boss Daniel Cleaver, who eventually cheats on Bridget with a younger, more conventionally attractive woman. Bridget's second relationship is with the stuffy human-rights barrister Mark Darcy, whom she initially dislikes when they are reintroduced at a New Year's party where her mother reminds them they were childhood playmates. These two men are connected by more than their relationship with Bridget, as Fielding reveals near the end of the novel.\nBridget not only obsesses about her love life, but also details her various daily struggles with her weight, her over-indulgence in alcohol and cigarettes, and her career. Bridget's friends and family are the supporting characters in her diary. Her friends are there for her unconditionally throughout the novel; they give her advice about her relationships, and support when problems arise. Her friends are essentially her surrogate family in London.\nBridget's parents live outside of the city and, while they play a lesser role than her friends, they are important figures in Bridget's life. Her mother is an overconfident, doting woman who is constantly trying to marry Bridget off to a rich, handsome man; and her father is considerably more down-to-earth, though he is sometimes driven into uncharacteristically unstable states of mind by his wife.\nBridget often visits her parents, as well as her parents' friends, primarily Geoffrey and Una Alconbury; Geoffrey creates a mildly uncomfortable situation for Bridget by insisting she call him \"Uncle Geoffrey\" despite his propensity for groping her rear end whenever they meet. In these situations, Bridget is often plagued with that perennial question \"How's your love life?\" and exposed to the eccentricities of middle class British society, manifested in turkey curry buffets and tarts and vicars parties at which the women wear sexually provocative (\"tart\") costumes, while the men dress as Anglican priests (\"vicars\").\nPublication.\nThis novel evolved from Helen Fielding's \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" columns in \"The Independent\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\". Fielding devised the novel with the help of \"Independent\" journalist Charles Leadbeater; it is roughly based on Jane Austen's 1813 novel \"Pride and Prejudice\". As a columnist, Fielding often lampooned society's obsession with women's magazines such as \"Cosmopolitan\" and criticised wider societal trends in Britain at the time.\nThe novel was first published in 1996 by the U.K. publisher; it became an international success. As of 2006, the book had sold over two million copies worldwide. A sequel, \"\", was published in 1999, and two further novels, \"Bridget Jones: Mad about the Boy\" and \"Bridget Jones's Baby,\" were published in 2013 and 2016 respectively. \nAwards.\nThe novel won the 1998 British Book of the Year, and Tracie Bennett won the 2000 Audie Award for \"Solo Female Narration\" for her audiobook narration. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 75 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\nFilm adaptation.\nA film adaptation of the novel was released in 2001. The film stars Ren\u00e9e Zellweger (in an Academy Award nominated role) as the eponymous heroine, Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver, and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy. It was directed by Sharon Maguire (Helen Fielding's friend who was the inspiration for Shazzer) and the screenplay was written by Fielding, Andrew Davies, and Richard Curtis.\nMusical adaptation.\nA musical version was in the works, with the show due to open in London's West End in 2012, although this never happened. British pop singer Lily Allen wrote the score and lyrics, and Stephen Daldry was said to be directing, joined by his co-worker Peter Darling, who would have served as choreographer. An official cast for the production was never finalised, but workshops for the show did begin with TV actress and star of \"Legally Blonde the Musical\", Sheridan Smith, in the title role. Allen stated in 2014 that while the musical was finished, it was unlikely to see the light of day.\nCritical reception.\nOn 5 November 2019, the BBC included \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68724", "revid": "2842084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68724", "title": "Robert Hawker (poet)", "text": "British Anglican priest, poet, antiquarian and reputed eccentric\nRobert Stephen Hawker (1803\u20131875) was a British Anglican priest, poet, antiquarian and reputed eccentric, known to his parishioners as Parson Hawker. He is best known as the writer of \"The Song of the Western Men\" with its chorus line of \"And shall Trelawny die? / Here's twenty thousand Cornish men / will know the reason why!\", which he published anonymously in 1825. His name became known after Charles Dickens acknowledged his authorship of \"The Song of the Western Men\" in the serial magazine \"Household Words\".\nBiography.\nHawker was born in the clergy house of Charles Church, Plymouth, on 3 December 1803. He was the eldest male of nine children and grandson of Robert Hawker, vicar of Charles Church. When he was about ten years old his father, Jacob Stephen Hawker, took Holy Orders and left Plymouth to become curate of Altarnun, leaving him in the care of his grandparents. By this time Hawker was already reading and writing poetry. He was educated at Liskeard Grammar School and Cheltenham Grammar School (now Pate's Grammar School). As an undergraduate, aged 19, he married Charlotte Eliza I'ans, aged 41. The couple spent their honeymoon at Tintagel in 1823, a place that kindled his lifelong fascination with Arthurian legend and later inspired him to write \"The Quest of the Sangraal\". This marriage, along with a legacy, helped to finance his studies at Pembroke College, Oxford. He graduated in 1827 and won the 1827 Newdigate Prize for poetry.\nHawker was ordained in 1831, becoming curate at North Tamerton and then, in 1834, vicar of the church at Morwenstow, where he remained throughout his life. When he arrived at Morwenstow there had not been a vicar in residence for over a century. Smugglers and wreckers were apparently numerous in the area. A contemporary report says the Morwenstow wreckers \"allowed a fainting brother to perish in the sea ... without extending a hand of safety.\"\nHawker's first wife, Charlotte, died in 1863 and the following year, aged 60, he married Pauline Kuczynski, aged 20. They had three daughters, Morwenna Pauline Hawker, Rosalind Hawker and Juliot Hawker. Robert Hawker died on 15 August 1875, having become a Roman Catholic on his deathbed. He was buried in Plymouth's Ford Park Cemetery. His funeral was noteworthy because the mourners wore purple instead of the traditional black.\nAccomplishments.\nShipwrecks.\nHawker was regarded as a deeply compassionate person giving Christian burials to shipwrecked seamen washed up on the shores of the parish, and was often the first to reach the cliffs when there was a shipwreck. Formerly, the bodies of shipwrecked sailors were often either buried on the beach where they were found or left in the sea. The figurehead of the ship \"Caledonia\", which foundered in September 1842, marks the grave in Morwenstow churchyard of five of the nine-man crew. Hawker described the wrecking in his book \"Footprints of Former Men in Far Cornwall\". Nearby stands a granite cross marked \"Unknown Yet Well Known\", close to the graves of 30 or more seafarers, including the captain of the \"Alonzo\", wrecked in 1843.\nAnother notable rescue effort was occasioned by the \"Martha Quayle\" of Liverpool on 4 December 1863. This vessel was seen dismasted off Hennacliff with the crew making the best of their situation; two boats were lowered from the side of which one was driven northward by the heavy seas while the other came ashore unmanned. The first boat was seen by Hawker being rowed by five men but did not make a landing until Clovelly. An attempt to launch the Bude lifeboat or bring her along the land failed but by riding along the coast as far as Clovelly Hawker found the mate and four crewmen safe. He failed to persuade the men of Clovelly to launch a skiff but a customs officer from Bideford happened to be there and was able to send a message to the Appledore lifeboatmen to assist if they could. The \"Martha Quayle\" was unlighted by Saturday nightfall. On the Sunday he sent a man towards Clovelly and sometime later that man brought thanks for their deliverance from the captain and crew back to Hawker. A rowing boat crewed by 19 men went north and jointly with the Appledore lifeboatmen who had brought their boat by land got the \"Martha Quayle\" on shore ready to be sold by auction the next day.\nRitual innovation, eccentricity; hut and vicarage.\nThe Harvest Festival that we know today was introduced in the parish of Morwenstow in 1843 by Hawker. He invited his parishioners to a Harvest service as he wanted to give thanks to God for providing such plenty. This service took place on 1 October and bread made from the first cut of corn was taken at communion.\n\"Parson Hawker\", as he was known to his parishioners, was something of an eccentric, both in his clothes and his habits. He loved bright colours and it seems the only black things he wore were his socks. He built a small hut, that became known as Hawker's Hut, from driftwood on the cliffs overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. He spent many hours there writing his poems and letters. This driftwood hut is now the smallest property in the National Trust portfolio. Many of the more fantastic stories told about Hawker are based on an unreliable biography published by the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould in 1876, only a few months after Hawker's death. Other eccentricities attributed to him include dressing up as a mermaid and excommunicating his cat for mousing on Sundays. He dressed in a claret-coloured coat, blue fisherman's jersey, long sea boots, a pink brimless hat and a poncho made from a yellow horse blanket, which he claimed was the ancient habit of St Padarn. He talked to birds, invited his nine cats into the church and kept a pig as a pet.\nHe built himself a remarkable vicarage, with chimneys modelled on the towers of the churches in his life: Tamerton, where he had been curate; Morwenstow and Welcombe; plus that of Magdalen College, Oxford. The old kitchen chimney is a replica of Hawker's mother's tomb.\nOf his interesting life, Hawker himself wrote: \"What a life mine would be if it were all written and published in a book.\"\nThe American poet Joyce Kilmer described him as \"a coast life-guard in a cassock\" and was to some extent influenced by Hawker's poetry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His notable roles include Clang in \"Help!\" (1965), Thomas Cromwell in \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1966), Tom Ryan in \"Ryan's Daughter\" (1970), Harry Bundage in \"Candleshoe\" (1977), Paddy Button in \"The Blue Lagoon\" (1980), Dr. Grogan in \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1981), Father Imperius in \"Ladyhawke\" (1985), and the role that made him a household name as an actor, Horace Rumpole, whom he played in the British television series \"Rumpole of the Bailey\". He also portrayed Carl Bugenhagen in the first and second installments of \"The Omen\" series and Number Two in the TV series \"The Prisoner\".\nEarly life.\nReginald McKern was born 16 March 1920 in Sydney, New South Wales, the son of Vera (n\u00e9e Martin) and Norman Walton McKern. Known as \"Leo\" from a young age, he attended Sydney Technical High School. On leaving school, he initially worked in a factory, where at the age of 15, he suffered an accident which resulted in the removal of his left eye. He first worked as an engineering apprentice, then as an artist, followed by service as a sapper with the Australian Army's Royal Australian Engineers during World War II. In 1944, in Sydney, he performed in his first stage role.\nCareer.\nTheatre.\nMcKern fell in love with Australian actress Jane Holland, moved to the United Kingdom to be with her, and married her in 1946. Despite the difficulties posed by his glass eye and Australian accent, he soon became a regular performer at London's Old Vic theatre and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (now the Royal Shakespeare Theatre) in Stratford-upon-Avon. \nMcKern's most notable Shakespearean role was as Iago in \"Othello\", in 1952. In 1955 he appeared in \"The Burnt Flower Bed\" by Ugo Betti directed by Peter Hall at the Arts Theatre Club in London. He played Big Daddy in Peter Hall's production of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" at the Comedy Theatre in 1958, and went on to play the German ambassador in another Peter Hall production, \"Brouhaha\" starring Peter Sellers at the Aldwych Theatre. He originated the role of Common Man in Robert Bolt's \"A Man for All Seasons\" in the West End in 1960, but for the show's Broadway production appeared as Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, a role he would reprise for the 1966 film version. He also portrayed Subtle in Ben Jonson's \"The Alchemist\" in 1962. In 1965, he played the lead in Bolt's \"The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew\", and Disson in Harold Pinter's \"Tea Party\".\nHe appeared at the Royal Exchange, Manchester in \"Uncle Vanya\" in 1977 and in \"Crime and Punishment\" in 1978.\nIn 1989, he played James Boswell in the one-man show, \"Boswell for the Defence\" in theatres in Melbourne, Hong Kong and London.\nFilm.\nMcKern's film debut was in \"Murder in the Cathedral\" (1952). His more notable film appearances included the science-fiction classics \"X the Unknown\" (1956), \"The Day the Earth Caught Fire\" (1961), the World War I drama \"King and Country\" (1964), \"Help!\" (1965), the Academy Award-winning adaptation of \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1966), \"The Shoes of the Fisherman\" (1968), \"Ryan's Daughter\" (1970), \"Massacre in Rome\" (1973), \"The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother\" (1975), \"The Omen\" (1976), \"The Blue Lagoon\" (1980),\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1981) and \"Ladyhawke\" (1985). He was presented with the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for \"Travelling North\" (1987). He co-starred as Sancho Zancas opposite Alec Guinness as Father Quixote, in \"Monsignor Quixote\" (1985).\nTelevision.\nTwo of McKern's earliest television roles were Sir Roger DeLisle (usurper of the Locksley manor and lands) and Herbert of Doncaster (a corrupt moneylender) in the 1950s black-and-white series \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\".\nDuring the 1960s, he was one of several Number Twos in the TV series \"The Prisoner\". Along with Colin Gordon, McKern was one of only two actors to play Number Two more than once. He first played the character in the episodes \"The Chimes of Big Ben\" and \"Once Upon a Time\", and reprised the role in the final episode, \"Fall Out\". The filming of \"Once Upon a Time\" was a particularly intense experience for McKern; according to one biographer, the stress caused him to suffer either a nervous breakdown or a heart attack (accounts differ), forcing production to stop for a time. \nIn 1976, McKern narrated and presented \"The Battle of the Somme\", a BBC documentary marking the 60th anniversary of the World War I battle. He played the Earl of Gloucester in Granada Television's production of \"King Lear\" (1983). Also in 1983, he starred in episodes of the mini-series \"Reilly, Ace of Spies\" as Zaharov, director of Vickers.\n\"Rumpole of the Bailey\".\nIn 1975, McKern made his first appearance in the role that would make him a household name as an actor, Horace Rumpole, whom he played in \"Rumpole of the Bailey\", originally an episode of the BBC's \"Play for Today\". A series of the same name, comprising 44 episodes, was produced for ITV between 1978 and 1992. According to Rumpole's creator, author John Mortimer, McKern \"not only played the character Rumpole\u2014he added to it, brightened it and brought it fully to life.\"\nAlthough he enjoyed the role, McKern expressed doubts about its popularity and the extent to which his life was becoming intertwined with Rumpole's. \"McKern was often unhappy, decrying his television fame as an 'insatiable monster'. He stressed that his Peer Gynt was a greater performance and lamented: 'If I get an obit in any paper, they will say, \"...\u00a0of course, known to millions as Rumpole.\"'\" In the later series, his daughter Abigail McKern joined the cast as Liz Probert.\nCommercial work.\nStarting in 1985, McKern appeared in a series of advertisements for Lloyds Bank, playing the upholder of quality standards. In 1987, investment firm Smith Barney selected McKern to succeed John Houseman as its spokesman. The move was part of a broader shift in their TV commercials, including hiring Dinah Sheridan to play McKern's wife. In 1989, Smith Barney again changed spokesmen, dropping McKern for American actor George C. Scott.\nRadio.\nMcKern wrote one radio play, \"London Story\", which became the film \"Chain of Events\" (1958). He also provided the voice of Captain Haddock in the 1992 and 1993 BBC Radio adaptation of \"Herg\u00e9's The Adventures of Tintin\".\nPersonal life and death.\nIn 1983, McKern was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for his services to the performing arts.\nHe frequently travelled between England and Australia, both to visit family and friends and to appear in various films and plays. As he was frightened of flying, he booked tickets to travel on cargo ships. This gave him time and peace to read scripts and contracts, with the added benefit of feeling he was on holiday.\nWorried that his stout frame would not appeal to audiences, McKern suffered from stage fright, which became harder to control with age.\nIn 1997 he appeared in a party political broadcast for the United Kingdom Independence Party.\nMcKern and his wife, fellow Australian actor Jane Holland (\"A Son Is Born\", 1946), had two daughters, Abigail and Harriet.\nSuffering in his final years from ill health, McKern moved into a nursing home near Bath in Somerset in 2002, where he died a few weeks later, on 23 July, at the age of 82; his body was cremated at Haycombe Cemetery in Bath.\nSelected filmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68736", "revid": "49705027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68736", "title": "Glasgow", "text": "Largest city in Scotland\nGlasgow is the most populous city in Scotland, located on the banks of the River Clyde in west central Scotland. It is the fourth-most populous city in the United Kingdom and the 27th-most populous city in Europe, and comprises 23 wards which represent the areas of the city within Glasgow City Council. Glasgow is a leading city in Scotland for finance, shopping, industry, culture and fashion, and was commonly referred to as the \"second city of the British Empire\" for much of the Victorian and Edwardian eras.\nIn 2020, it had an estimated population as a defined locality of \n. More than 1,000,000 people live in the Greater Glasgow contiguous urban area, while the wider Glasgow City Region is home to more than 1,800,000 people (its defined functional urban area total was almost the same in 2020), around a third of Scotland's population. The city has a population density of 3,562 people per km2, much higher than the average of 70/km2 for Scotland as a whole. Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement close to Glasgow Cathedral and descending to the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and the tenth-largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and episcopal burgh (subsequently royal burgh), and the later establishment of the University of Glasgow in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century.\nGlasgow became a county in 1893, the city having previously been in the historic county of Lanarkshire, and later growing to also include settlements that were once part of Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire. It now forms the Glasgow City Council area, one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, and is administered by Glasgow City Council. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 (with a higher density and within a smaller territory than in subsequent decades). The population was greatly reduced following comprehensive urban renewal projects in the 1960s which resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated new towns, such as Cumbernauld, Livingston, East Kilbride and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes.\nGlasgow's major cultural institutions enjoy international reputations. They include Glasgow School of Art, the Burrell Collection, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Scottish Ballet, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the Citizens Theatre and Scottish Opera. The city was the European Capital of Culture in 1990 and is notable for its architecture, culture, media, music scene, sports clubs and transport connections. It is the fifth-most-visited city in the United Kingdom. The city is also well known in the sporting world for association football, particularly for the Old Firm rivalry.\nEtymology and heraldry.\nThe name Glasgow is Brittonic in origin. The first element \"glas\", meaning \"grey-green, grey-blue\" both in Brittonic, Scottish Gaelic and modern day Welsh and the second \"*c\u00f6\u00fc\", \"hollow\" (cf. Welsh \"glas-cau\"), giving a meaning of \"green-hollow\". It is often said that the name means \"dear green place\" or that \"dear green place\" is a translation from Gaelic \"Glas Caomh\". \"The dear green place\" remains an affectionate way of referring to the city. The modern Gaelic is \"Glaschu\" and derived from the same roots as the Brittonic.\nThe settlement may have an earlier Brittonic name, Cathures; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as \"Glasgu\". It is also recorded that the King of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the Molendinar Burn where Glasgow Cathedral now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as \"Glasgu\". The coat of arms of the City of Glasgow was granted to the royal burgh by the Lord Lyon on 25 October 1866. It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow's patron saint, Mungo, which had been used on official seals prior to that date. The emblems represent miracles supposed to have been performed by Mungo and are listed in the traditional rhyme:\n\"Here's the bird that never flew\"\n\"Here's the tree that never grew\"\n\"Here's the bell that never rang\"\n\"Here's the fish that never swam\"\nSt Mungo is also said to have preached a sermon containing the words \"Lord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy name\". This was abbreviated to \"Let Glasgow Flourish\" and adopted as the city's motto. In 1450, John Stewart, the first Lord Provost of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a \"St Mungo's Bell\" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the People's Palace Museum, near Glasgow Green. The supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half-length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in \"the act of benediction\". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold mural crown between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.\nThe arms were re-matriculated by the City of Glasgow District Council on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996. The only change made on each occasion was in the type of coronet over the arms.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the River Clyde providing a natural location for fishing. The Romans later built outposts in the area and, to protect Roman Britannia from the Brittonic speaking (Celtic) Caledonians, constructed the Antonine Wall. Items from the wall, such as altars from Roman forts of Balmuildy, are now located at the Hunterian Museum.\nGlasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian missionary Saint Mungo in the 6th century. He established a church on the Molendinar Burn, where the present Glasgow Cathedral stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.\nGlasgow grew over the following centuries as part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Kingdom of Scotland. The Glasgow Fair reportedly began in 1190. A bridge over the River Clyde was recorded from around 1285, where Victoria Bridge now stands. As the lowest bridging point on the Clyde it was an important crossing. The area around the bridge became known as Briggait. The founding of the University of Glasgow adjoining the cathedral in 1451 and elevation of the bishopric to become the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean. By the fifteenth century the urban area stretched from the area around the cathedral and university in the north down to the bridge and the banks of the Clyde in the south along High Street, Saltmarket and Bridgegate, crossing an east\u2013west route at Glasgow Cross which became the commercial centre of the city.\nScottish Reformation.\nFollowing the European Protestant Reformation and with the encouragement of the Convention of Royal Burghs, the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their Merchants House in the same year. Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of Royal Burgh in 1611. Daniel Defoe visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book \"A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain\", that Glasgow was \"the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted\". At that time the city's population was about 12,000, and the city was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to its economy and urban fabric, brought about by the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.\nThe city prospered from its involvement in the triangular trade and the Atlantic slave trade that the former depended upon. Glasgow merchants dealt in slave-produced cash crops such as sugar, tobacco, cotton and linen. From 1717 to 1766, Scottish slave ships operating out of Glasgow transported approximately 3,000 enslaved Africans to the Americas (out of a total number of 5,000 slaves carried by ships from Scotland). The majority of these slaving voyages left from Glasgow's satellite ports, Greenock and Port Glasgow.\nEconomic growth.\nAfter the Acts of Union in 1707, Scotland gained further access to the vast markets of the new British Empire, and Glasgow became prominent as a hub of international trade to and from the Americas, especially in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and manufactured goods. Starting in 1668, the city's Tobacco Lords created a deep water port at Port Glasgow about down the River Clyde, as the river from the city to that point was then too shallow for seagoing merchant ships. By the late 18th century more than half of the British tobacco trade was concentrated on the River Clyde, with more than of tobacco being imported each year at its peak. At the time, Glasgow held a commercial importance as the city participated in the trade of sugar, tobacco and later cotton. From the mid-eighteenth century the city began expanding westwards from its medieval core at Glasgow Cross, with a grid-iron street plan starting from the 1770s and eventually reaching George Square to accommodate much of the growth, with that expansion much later becoming known in the 1980s onwards as the Merchant City. The largest growth in the city centre area, building on the wealth of trading internationally, was the next expansion being the grid-iron streets west of Buchanan Street riding up and over Blythswood Hill from 1800 onwards.\nThe opening of the Monkland Canal and basin linking to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port Dundas in 1795, facilitated access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in Lanarkshire. After extensive river engineering projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier, John Elder, George Thomson, Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow. The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw, John Knox, James Kay, Sir Muirhead Bone, Robert Eadie and L.S. Lowry, willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world, as did Stanley Spencer downriver at Port Glasgow.\nPopulation growth.\nWith the population growing, the first scheme to provide a public water supply was by the Glasgow Company in 1806. A second company was formed in 1812, and the two merged in 1838, but there was some dissatisfaction with the quality of the water supplied. The Gorbals Gravitation Water Company began supplying water to residents living to the south of the River Clyde in 1846, obtained from reservoirs, which gave 75,000 people a constant water supply, but others were not so fortunate, and some 4,000 died in an outbreak of cholera in 1848/1849. This led to the development of the Glasgow Corporation Water Works, with a project to raise the level of Loch Katrine and to convey clean water by gravity along a aqueduct to a holding reservoir at Milngavie, and then by pipes into the city. The project cost \u00a3980,000 and was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859.\nIn the early 19th century an eighth of the people lived in single-room accommodation.\nThe engineer for the project was John Frederick Bateman, while James Morris Gale became the resident engineer for the city section of the project, and subsequently became Engineer in Chief for Glasgow Water Commissioners. He oversaw several improvements during his tenure, including a second aqueduct and further raising of water levels in Loch Katrine. Additional supplies were provided by Loch Arklet in 1902, by impounding the water and creating a tunnel to allow water to flow into Loch Katrine. A similar scheme to create a reservoir in Glen Finglas was authorised in 1903, but was deferred, and was not completed until 1965. Following the 2002 Glasgow floods, the waterborne parasite cryptosporidium was found in the reservoir at Milngavie, and so the new Milngavie water treatment works was built. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth in 2007, and won the 2007 Utility Industry Achievement Award, having been completed ahead of its time schedule and for \u00a310 million below its budgeted cost.\nGood health requires both clean water and effective removal of sewage. The Caledonian Railway rebuilt many of the sewers, as part of a deal to allow them to tunnel under the city, and sewage treatment works were opened at Dalmarnoch in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910. The works experimented to find better ways to treat sewage, and a number of experimental filters were constructed, until a full activated sludge plant was built between 1962 and 1968 at a cost of \u00a34 million. Treated sludge was dumped at sea, and Glasgow Corporation owned six sludge ships between 1904 and 1998, when the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive ended the practice. The sewerage infrastructure was improved significantly in 2017, with the completion of a tunnel long, which provides of storm water storage. It will reduce the risk of flooding and the likelihood that sewage will overflow into the Clyde during storms. Since 2002, clean water provision and sewerage have been the responsibility of Scottish Water.\nGlasgow's population had surpassed that of Edinburgh by 1821. The development of civic institutions included the City of Glasgow Police in 1800, one of the first municipal police forces in the world. Despite the crisis caused by the City of Glasgow Bank's collapse in 1878, growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the \"Second City of the Empire\" and was producing more than half Britain's tonnage of shipping and a quarter of all locomotives in the world. In addition to its pre-eminence in shipbuilding, engineering, industrial machinery, bridge building, chemicals, explosives, coal and oil industries it developed as a major centre in textiles, garment-making, carpet manufacturing, leather processing, furniture-making, pottery, food and drink, cigarette making, printing and publishing. Shipping, banking, insurance and professional services expanded at the same time.\nGlasgow became one of the first cities in Europe to reach a population of one million. The city's new trades and sciences attracted new residents from across the Lowlands and the Highlands of Scotland, from Ireland and other parts of Britain and from Continental Europe. During this period, the construction of many of the city's greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects, such as the Milngavie water treatment works, Glasgow Subway, Glasgow Corporation Tramways, City Chambers, Mitchell Library and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum were being funded by its wealth. The city also held a series of International Exhibitions at Kelvingrove Park, in 1888, 1901 and 1911, with Britain's last major International Exhibition, the Empire Exhibition, being subsequently held in 1938 at Bellahouston Park, which drew 13 million visitors.\nWar years and regeneration.\nDuring the First World War, Glasgow raised 28 new battalions of men. By the end of the conflict, approximately 18,000 Glaswegian soldiers had been lost. As so many men left their jobs to join up, women were employed in shipyards, munitions factories and other industries and contributed a vital service to the war effort. In 1917, this was acknowledged publicly when King George V presented an OBE to a munitions worker, Lizzie Robertson, who was cheered by many other female munitions workers, during a ceremony held in Ibrox Stadium. Women from the city also served with the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service; for example, Louisa Jordan, a nurse from Maryhill who was posted to Serbia, and Norah Neilson Gray from Hillhead who served as an orderly in Royaumont. Victiria Crosses were awarded to several Glaswegian men during World War One: Private Henry May, Sergeant Robert Downie, Sergeant John Meikle, drummer Walter Potter Ritchie, Company Serjeant Major John Kendrick Skinner, Doctor Harry Ranken, Sergeant James Youill Turnbull and Lieutenant Donald MacKintosh.\nThe 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the city. After World War I, the city suffered from the impact of the Post\u2013World War I recession and from the later Great Depression, this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the \"Red Clydeside\" movement. The city had recovered by the outbreak of World War II. The city saw aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe during the Clydebank Blitz, during the war, then grew through the post-war boom that lasted through the 1950s. By the 1960s, growth of industry in countries like Japan and West Germany, weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city's industries. As a result of this, Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation, leading to high unemployment, urban decay, population decline, welfare dependency and poor health for the city's inhabitants. There were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial \"Bruce Report\", which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city. The report led to a huge and radical programme of rebuilding and regeneration efforts that started in the mid-1950s and lasted into the late 1970s. This involved the mass demolition of the city's infamous slums and their replacement with large suburban housing estates and tower blocks.\nThe city invested heavily in roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial roads and motorways that bisected the central area. There are also accusations that the Scottish Office had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and politonald MacKintoshical influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the Silicon Glen boom and creating the new towns of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and East Kilbride, dispersed across the Scottish Lowlands to halve the city's population base. By the late 1980s, there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow's economic fortunes. The \"Glasgow's miles better\" campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the Burrell Collection in 1983 and Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investment. The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, its status as European Capital of Culture in 1990, and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy. However, it is the industrial heritage that serves as key tourism enabler. Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas, including the large-scale Clyde Waterfront Regeneration, has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of gentrification. In 2008, the city was listed by Lonely Planet as one of the world's top 10 tourist cities.\nRecent and contemporary history.\nIn 2007, the city's primary airport was the target of a terrorist attack when a Jeep Cherokee filled with propane gas cylinders and petrol cans was driven at considerable speed into the entrance of the main terminal building. This was the first time that a terrorist attack had targeted Scotland specifically, and was the second terrorist attack to occur in Scotland following the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over the town of Lockerbie in the Scottish Borders in December 1988. Immediately following the incident, a close link was established between the attack in Glasgow and an attack in London the previous day. One of the perpetrators of the attack, Kafeel Ahmed, was the only reported casualty, with a following five people sustaining injuries from the attack.\nIn 2008 the city was ranked at 43 for Personal Safety in the Mercer index of top 50 safest cities in the world. The Mercer report was specifically looking at Quality of Living, yet by 2011 within Glasgow, certain areas were (still) \"failing to meet the Scottish Air Quality Objective levels for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10)\".\nThe city hosted the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) at its main events venue, the SEC Centre. Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and will host the 2026 edition of the games. Glasgow also hosted the first European Championships in 2018, was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020, and will be a host city of the UEFA Euro 2028. The UK's first official consumption room, the Thistle, for illegal drugs including heroin and cocaine was set to open on 21 October 2024, however this was delayed, eventually opening on 13 January 2025.\nGovernment and politics.\nGovernment.\nAlthough Glasgow Corporation had been a pioneer in the municipal socialist movement from the late-nineteenth century, since the Representation of the People Act 1918, Glasgow increasingly supported left-wing ideas and politics at a national level. The city council was controlled by the Labour Party for more than thirty years, since the decline of the Progressives. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the single transferable vote rather than the first-past-the-post system, the dominance of the Labour Party within the city started to decline. As a result of the 2017 United Kingdom local elections, the SNP was able to form a minority administration ending Labour's thirty-seven years of uninterrupted control.\nIn the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, the city's frequent strikes and militant organisations caused serious alarm at Westminster. A huge demonstration in the city's George Square on 31 January 1919 ended in violence, known as the Battle of George Square, and the Riot Act was read. The Sheriff of Lanarkshire called for military aid and 10,000 troops were deployed.\nIndustrial action at the shipyards gave rise to the \"Red Clydeside\" epithet. During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the Independent Labour Party. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the poll tax; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the Scottish Socialist Party, another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a Conservative MP since the 1982 Hillhead by-election, when the SDP took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in 2012, despite having been the controlling party (as the Progressives) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour Lord Provost.\nPolitics.\nGlasgow is represented in both the House of Commons in London, and the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh. At Westminster, it is represented by seven Members of Parliament (MPs), all elected at least once every five years to represent individual constituencies, using the first-past-the-post system of voting. In Holyrood, Glasgow is represented by sixteen Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), of whom nine are elected to represent individual constituencies once every four years using first-past-the-post, and seven are elected as additional regional members, by proportional representation. Since the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Glasgow is represented at Holyrood by 9 Scottish National Party MSPs, 4 Labour MSPs, 2 Conservative MSPs and 1 Scottish Green MSP. In the European Parliament, the city formed part of the Scotland constituency, which elected six Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) prior to Brexit.\nSince Glasgow is covered and operates under two separate central governments, the Scottish Government and the UK Government, they determine various matters that Glasgow City Council is not responsible for. The Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament covers the Glasgow City council area, a north-western part of South Lanarkshire and a small eastern portion of Renfrewshire. It elects nine of the parliament's 73 first past the post constituency members and seven of the 56 additional members. Both kinds of member are known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The system of election is designed to produce a form of proportional representation.\nThe first past the post seats were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of then existing Westminster (House of Commons) constituencies. In 2005, the number of Westminster Members of Parliament (MPs) representing Scotland was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of MSPs was retained at Holyrood. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the boundaries of the Glasgow region were redrawn. In the Scottish independence referendum, Glasgow voted \"Yes\" by a margin of 53.5% to 46.5%. In the Brexit referendum, results varied from constituency to constituency. Glasgow North recorded the biggest remain vote with 78% opting to stay in the EU whilst in Glasgow East this figure dropped to 56%. The city as a whole voted to remain in the EU, by 66.6% to 33.3%. Following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in which 53.49% of the electorate of Glasgow voted in favour of Scottish independence; the SNP won every seat in the city at the 2015 general election, including a record-breaking 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP in the Glasgow North East constituency. At the 2017 snap general election, Glasgow was represented by 6 Scottish National Party MPs and 1 Labour MP; the Glasgow North East constituency which had a record 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP at the previous general election, was regained by Paul Sweeney of the Scottish Labour Party, who narrowly defeated sitting SNP MP Anne McLaughlin by 242 votes.\nGeography and climate.\nGlasgow is located on the banks of the River Clyde, in West Central Scotland. Another important river is the Kelvin, a tributary of the River Clyde, whose name was used in creating the title of Baron Kelvin the renowned physicist for whom the SI unit of temperature, Kelvin, is named. The burgh of Glasgow was historically in Lanarkshire, but close to the border with Renfrewshire. When elected county councils were established in 1890, Glasgow was deemed capable of running its own affairs and so was excluded from the administrative area of Lanarkshire County Council, whilst remaining part of Lanarkshire for lieutenancy and judicial purposes.\nThe burgh was substantially enlarged in 1891 to take in areas from both Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire where the urban area had grown beyond the old burgh boundary. In 1893, the burgh became its own county for lieutenancy and judicial purposes too, being made a county of itself. From 1975 to 1996 the city was part of Strathclyde Region, with the city's council becoming a lower-tier district council. Strathclyde was abolished in 1996, since when the city has again been responsible for all aspects of local government, being one of the 32 council areas in Scotland.\nLike much of lowland Britain, Glasgow's climate is oceanic (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfb\"). Although Glasgow's latitude is similar to that of Moscow, the climate is strongly influenced by proximity to the Celtic Sea and the warm water of the North Atlantic Drift. Glasgow is the rainiest city in the UK, with an average of more than 170 days of rain a year. The coldest month on record since the data series began is December 2010, during a severe cold wave affecting the British Isles. Even then, the December high was above freezing at with a low of . This still ensured Glasgow's coldest month of 2010 remained milder than the isotherm of normally used to determine continental climate normals. The warmest day in Glasgow was recorded in 2018, when temperatures reached .\nDemography.\nPopulation.\nIn the 1950s, the population of the City of Glasgow area peaked at 1,089,000. Glasgow was then one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearances of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the Gorbals and relocation to \"new towns\" such as East Kilbride and Cumbernauld led to population decline. In addition, the boundaries of the city were changed twice during the late-twentieth century, making direct comparisons difficult.\nThe urban area continues to expand beyond the city council boundaries into surrounding suburban areas, encompassing around of all adjoining suburbs, if commuter towns and villages are included. There are two distinct definitions for the population of Glasgow: the Glasgow City Council Area which lost the districts of Rutherglen and Cambuslang to South Lanarkshire in 1996, and the Greater Glasgow Urban Area which includes the conurbation around the city (however in the 2016 definitions the aforementioned Rutherglen and Cambuslang were included along with the likes of Paisley, Clydebank, Newton Mearns, Bearsden and Stepps but not others with no continuity of populated postcodes \u2013 although in some cases the gap is small \u2013 the excluded nearby settlements including Barrhead, Erskine and Kirkintilloch plus a large swathe of Lanarkshire which had been considered contiguous with Glasgow in previous definitions: the 'settlements' named Coatbridge &amp; Airdrie, Hamilton and Motherwell &amp; Wishaw, each containing a number of distinct smaller localities).\nGlasgow's population influx in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was related to economic expansion as well as internally generated growth with the vast majority of newcomers to the city from outside Scotland being from Ireland, especially the north western counties of Donegal, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Londonderry. In the 1881 UK Census, 83% of the population was born in Scotland, 13% in Ireland, 3% in England and 1% elsewhere. By 1911, the city was no longer gaining population by migration. The demographic percentages in the 1951 UK census were: born in Scotland 93%, Ireland 3%, England 3% and elsewhere 1%. In the early twentieth century, many Lithuanian refugees began to settle in Glasgow and at its height in the 1950s; there were around 10,000 in the Glasgow area. Many Italian Scots also settled in Glasgow, originating from provinces like Frosinone in Lazio and Lucca in north-west Tuscany at this time, many originally working as \"Hokey Pokey\" men.\nLanguages.\nThe 2022 Scottish Census reported that out of 603,199 residents aged three and over, 170,403 (28.2%) considered themselves able to speak or read the Scots language. \nEthnicity.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many Asians also settled in Glasgow, mainly in the Pollokshields area. These number 30,000 Pakistanis, 15,000 Indians and 3,000 Bangladeshis as well as Chinese people, many of whom settled in the Garnethill area of the city. The city is also home to some 8,406 (1.42%) Poles. Since 2000, the UK government has pursued a policy of dispersal of asylum seekers to ease pressure on social housing in the London area. In 2023, 88% of the near 5,100 asylum seekers in the whole of Scotland were living in Glasgow.\nSince the United Kingdom Census 2001 the population decline has been reversed. The population was static for a time; but due to migration from other parts of Scotland as well as immigration from overseas, the population has begun to grow. The population of the city council area was 593,245 in 2011 and around 2,300,000 people live in the Glasgow travel to work area. This area is defined as consisting of more than 10% of residents travelling into Glasgow to work and is without fixed boundaries.\nThe population density of London following the 2011 census was recorded as 5,200 people per square kilometre, while 3,395 people per square kilometre were registered in Glasgow. In 1931, the population density was , highlighting the \"clearances\" into the suburbs and new towns that were built to reduce the size of one of Europe's most densely populated cities.\nIn 2005, Glasgow had the lowest life expectancy of any UK city at 72.9 years. Much was made of this during the 2008 Glasgow East by-election. In 2008, a World Health Organization report about health inequalities revealed that male life expectancy varied from 54 years in Calton to 82 years in nearby Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire.\nReligion.\nGlasgow is a city of significant religious diversity. As per the 2022 census, the largest group with 43% has no religion followed by the Roman Catholic Church which represents nearly 21% of the population.\nThe following table shows the religion of respondents in the 2001, 2011 and 2022 censuses in Glasgow.\nThere are 147 congregations in the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow (of which 104 are within the city boundaries, the other 43 being in adjacent areas). Within the city boundaries there are 65 parishes of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow and four parishes of the Diocese of Motherwell. The city has four Christian cathedrals: Glasgow Cathedral, of the Church of Scotland; St Andrew's Cathedral, of the Roman Catholic Church; St Mary's Cathedral, of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and St Luke's Cathedral, of the Greek Orthodox Church. The Baptist Church and Salvation Army are well represented.\nMuch of the city's Roman Catholic population are those of Irish ancestry.\nBiblical unitarians are represented by three Christadelphian ecclesias, referred to geographically, as \"South\", \"Central\" and \"Kelvin\".\nThe Sikh community is served by four Gurdwaras. Two are situated in the West End (\"Central Gurdwara Singh Sabha\" in Sandyford and \"Guru Nanak Sikh Temple\" in Kelvinbridge) and two in the Southside area of Pollokshields (\"Guru Granth Sahib Gurdwara\" and \"Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Gurdwara\"). In 2013, Scotland's first purpose-built Gurdwara opened in a massive opening ceremony. Built at a cost of \u00a33.8M, it can hold 1,500 worshippers. Central Gurdwara is currently constructing a new building in the city. There are almost 10,000 Sikhs in Scotland and the majority live in Glasgow.\nGlasgow Central Mosque in the Gorbals district is the largest mosque in Scotland and, along with twelve other mosques in the city, caters for the city's Muslim population, estimated to number 33,000. Glasgow also has a Hindu mandir.\nGlasgow has seven synagogues, including the Romanesque-revival Garnethill Synagogue in the city centre. Glasgow currently has the seventh largest Jewish population in the United Kingdom after London, Manchester, Leeds, Gateshead, Brighton and Bournemouth but once had a Jewish population second only to London, estimated at 20,000 in the Gorbals alone.\nIn 1993, the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art opened in Glasgow. It is believed to be the only public museum to examine all the world's major religious faiths.\nAreas and suburbs.\nCity centre.\nThe city centre is bounded by High Street at Glasgow Cross the historic centre of civic life, up to Glasgow Cathedral at Castle Street; Saltmarket including Glasgow Green and St Andrew's Square to the east; Clyde Street and Broomielaw (along the River Clyde) to the south; and Charing Cross and Elmbank Street, beyond Blythswood Square to the west. The northern boundary (from east to west) follows Cathedral Street to North Hanover Street and George Square. The city centre is based on a grid system of streets on the north bank of the River Clyde. The heart of the city is George Square, site of many of Glasgow's public statues and the elaborate Victorian Glasgow City Chambers, headquarters of Glasgow City Council.\nMost offices, and the largest offices and international headquarters, are in the distinctive streets immediately west of Buchanan Street, starting around 1800 as townhouses, in the architecturally important streets embracing Blythswood Hill, Blythswood Holm further down and now including the Broomielaw next to the Clyde. To the south and west are the shopping precincts of Argyle Street, Sauchiehall Street and Buchanan Street, the last featuring more upmarket retailers and winner of the Academy of Urbanism \"Great Street Award\" 2008. The collection of shops around these streets accumulate to become known as \"The Style Mile\".\nThe main shopping areas include Buchanan Street, Buchanan Galleries, linking Buchanan Street and Sauchiehall Street, and the St. Enoch Centre linking Argyle Street and St Enoch Square, with the up-market Princes Square, which specifically features shops such as Ted Baker, Radley and Kurt Geiger. Buchanan Galleries and other city centre locales were chosen as locations for the 2013 film Under the Skin directed by Jonathan Glazer. Although the Glasgow scenes were shot with hidden cameras, star Scarlett Johansson was spotted around town. The Italian Centre in Ingram Street also specialises in designer labels. Glasgow's retail portfolio forms the UK's second largest and most economically important retail sector after Central London.\nThe city centre is home to most of Glasgow's main cultural venues: the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow City Hall, Theatre Royal (performing home of Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet), the Pavilion Theatre, the King's Theatre, Glasgow Film Theatre, Tron Theatre, Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA), Mitchell Library and Theatre, the Centre for Contemporary Arts, McLellan Galleries and the Lighthouse Museum of Architecture. The world's tallest cinema, the eighteen-screen Cineworld, is situated on Renfrew Street. The city centre is also home to four of Glasgow's higher education institutions: the University of Strathclyde, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow School of Art and Glasgow Caledonian University, and to the largest college in Britain \u2013 the City of Glasgow College in Cathedral Street.\nMerchant City.\nThe Merchant City is the commercial and part-residential district of the Merchant City, a name coined by the historian Charles Oakley in the 1960s. This had started as a residential district of the wealthy city merchants involved in international trade and the textile industries in the 18th and early 19th centuries, with their warehouses nearby, including the Tobacco Lords from whom many of the streets take their name. With its mercantile wealth, and continuing growth even before the Industrial Revolution, the city expanded by creating the New Town around George Square, soon followed by the New Town of Blythswood on Blythswood Hill which includes Blythswood Square. The original medieval centre around Glasgow Cross and the High Street was left behind.\nGlasgow Cross, situated at the junction of High Street, leading up to Glasgow Cathedral, Gallowgate, Trongate and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its Mercat cross. Glasgow Cross encompasses the Tolbooth Steeple, all that remains of the original Glasgow Tolbooth, which was demolished in 1921. Moving northward up High Street towards Rottenrow and Townhead lies the 15th century Glasgow Cathedral and the Provand's Lordship. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the Merchant City has been rejuvenated with luxury city centre flats and warehouse conversions. This regeneration has supported an increasing number of caf\u00e9s and restaurants. The area is also home to a number of high end boutique style shops and some of Glasgow's most upmarket stores.\nThe Merchant City is one centre of Glasgow's growing \"cultural quarter\", based on King Street, the Saltmarket and Trongate, and at the heart of the annual Merchant City Festival. The area has supported a growth in art galleries, the origins of which can be found in the late 1980s when it attracted artist-led organisations that could afford the cheap rents required to operate in vacant manufacturing or retail spaces. The artistic and cultural potential of the Merchant City as a \"cultural quarter\" was harnessed by independent arts organisations and Glasgow City Council, and the recent development of Trongate 103, which houses galleries, workshops, artist studios and production spaces, is considered a major outcome of the continued partnership between both. The area also contains a number of theatres and concert venues, including the Tron Theatre, the Old Fruitmarket, the Trades Hall, St. Andrew's in the Square, Merchant Square, and the City Halls.\nWest End.\nGlasgow's West End grew firstly to and around Blythswood Square and Garnethill, extending then to Woodlands Hill and Great Western Road. It is a district of elegant townhouses and tenements with caf\u00e9s, tea rooms, bars, boutiques, upmarket hotels, clubs and restaurants in the hinterland of Kelvingrove Park, the University of Glasgow, Glasgow Botanic Gardens and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, focused especially on the area's main thoroughfares of Argyle Street (Finnieston), Great Western Road and Byres Road. The area is popular with tourists and students. The West End includes residential areas of Hillhead, Dowanhill, Kelvingrove, Kelvinside, Hyndland, Broomhill, Scotstoun, Jordanhill, Kelvindale, Anniesland\nand Partick. The name is also increasingly being used to refer to any area to the west of Charing Cross. The West End is bisected by the River Kelvin, which flows from the Campsie Fells in the north and confluences with the River Clyde at Yorkhill Quay.\nThe spire of Sir George Gilbert Scott's Glasgow University main building (the second largest Gothic Revival building in Great Britain) is a major landmark, and can be seen from miles around, sitting atop Gilmorehill. The university itself is the fourth oldest in the English-speaking world. Much of the city's student population is based in the West End, adding to its cultural vibrancy. The area is also home to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Kelvin Hall museums and research facilities, stores, and community sport in Yorkhill. Adjacent to the Kelvin Hall was the Museum of Transport, which reopened in 2011 as the Riverside Museum after moving to a new location on a former dockland site at Glasgow Harbour in Partick where the River Kelvin flows into the Clyde. The new building is built to a design by Zaha Hadid. The West End Festival, one of Glasgow's largest festivals, is held annually in June.\nGlasgow is the home of the SEC Centre, Great Britain's largest exhibition and conference centre. On 30 September 2013, a major expansion of the SECC facilities at the former Queen's Dock by Foster and Partners officially opened \u2013 the 13,000-seat Hydro arena. Adjacent to the SECC at Queen's Dock is the Clydeside Distillery, a Scotch whisky distillery that opened in 2017 in the former dock pump house.\nEast End.\nThe East End extends from Glasgow Cross in the City Centre to the boundary with North and South Lanarkshire. It is home to the Glasgow Barrowland market, popularly known as \"The Barras\", Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow Green, and Celtic Park, home of Celtic FC. Many of the original sandstone tenements remain in this district. The East End was once a major industrial centre, home to Sir William Arrol &amp; Co., James Templeton &amp; Co and William Beardmore and Company. A notable local employer continues to be the Wellpark Brewery, home of Tennent's Lager.\nThe Glasgow Necropolis Garden Cemetery was created by the Merchants House on a hill above the cathedral in 1831. Routes curve through the landscape uphill to the statue of John Knox at the summit. There are two late 18th century tenements in Gallowgate. Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by David Dale, whose former scale can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the National Trust for Scotland. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as \"Homes for the Future\", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.\nEast of Glasgow Cross is St Andrew's in the Square, the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland, built in 1739\u20131757 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city's wealthy tobacco merchants. Also close by is the more modest Episcopalian St Andrew's-by-the-Green, the oldest Episcopal church in Scotland. The Episcopalian St Andrew's was also known as the \"Whistlin' Kirk\" due to it being the first church after the Reformation to own an organ. Overlooking Glasgow Green is the fa\u00e7ade of Templeton On The Green, featuring vibrant polychromatic brickwork intended to evoke the Doge's Palace in Venice. The extensive Tollcross Park was originally developed from the estate of James Dunlop, the owner of a local steelworks. His large baronial mansion was built in 1848 by David Bryce, which later housed the city's Children's Museum until the 1980s. Today, the mansion is a sheltered housing complex. The new Scottish National Indoor Sports Arena, a modern replacement for the Kelvin Hall, is in Dalmarnock. The area was the site of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, located adjacent to the new indoor sports arena.\nThe East End Healthy Living Centre (EEHLC) was established in mid-2005 at Crownpoint Road with Lottery Funding and City grants to serve community needs in the area. Now called the Glasgow Club Crownpoint Sports Complex, the centre provides service such as sports facilities, health advice, stress management, leisure and vocational classes. To the north of the East End lie the two large gasometers of Provan Gas Works, which stand overlooking Alexandra Park and a major interchange between the M8 and M80 motorways.\nSouth Side.\nGlasgow's South Side sprawls out south of the Clyde. The adjoining urban area includes some of Greater Glasgow's most affluent suburban towns, such as Newton Mearns, Clarkston, and Giffnock, all of which are in East Renfrewshire, as well as Thorntonhall in South Lanarkshire. Newlands and Dumbreck are examples of high-value residential districts within the city boundaries. There are many areas containing a high concentration of sandstone tenements like Shawlands, which is considered the \"Heart of the Southside\", with other examples being Battlefield, Govanhill and Mount Florida. The large suburb of Pollokshields comprises both a quiet western part with undulating tree-lined boulevards lined with expensive villas, and a busier eastern part with a high-density grid of tenements and small shops. The south side also includes some post-war housing estates of various sizes such as Toryglen, Pollok, Castlemilk and Arden. The towns of Cambuslang and Rutherglen were included in the City of Glasgow district from 1975 to 1996, but are now in the South Lanarkshire council area.\nAlthough predominantly residential, the area does have several notable public buildings including, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Scotland Street School Museum and House for an Art Lover; the Burrell Collection in Pollok Country Park; Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson's Holmwood House villa; the National Football Stadium Hampden Park in Mount Florida (home of Queens Park FC) and Ibrox Stadium (home of Rangers FC). The former docklands site at Pacific Quay on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the Glasgow Science Centre and the headquarters of BBC Scotland and STV Group (owner of STV), in a new purpose-built digital media campus. In addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built, including the Clyde Arc known by locals as the Squinty Bridge at Pacific Quay and others at Tradeston and Springfield Quay.\nThe South Side also includes many public parks, including Linn Park, Queen's Park, and Bellahouston Park and several golf clubs, including the championship course at Haggs Castle. The South Side is also home to the large Pollok Country Park, which was awarded the accolade of Europe's Best Park 2008. The southside also directly borders Rouken Glen Park in neighbouring Giffnock. Pollok Park is Glasgow's largest park and until the early 2000s was the only country park in the city's boundary. In the early 2000s the Dams to Darnley Country Park was designated, although half of the park is in East Renfrewshire. As of 2021 the facilities at the still new park are quite lacking.\nGovan is a district and former burgh in the south-western part of the city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding centre of international repute and is home to one of two BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards on the River Clyde and the precision engineering firm, Thales Optronics. It is also home to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the Glasgow Subway system. The wider Govan area includes the districts of Ibrox, Cessnock, Kinning Park and Kingston.\nNorth Glasgow.\nNorth Glasgow extends out from the north of the city centre towards the affluent suburbs of Bearsden, Milngavie and Bishopbriggs in East Dunbartonshire and Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire. The area also contains some of the city's poorest residential areas.\nThis has led to large-scale redevelopment of much of the poorer housing stock in north Glasgow, and the wider regeneration of many areas, such as Ruchill, which have been transformed; many run-down tenements have now been refurbished or replaced by modern housing estates. Much of the housing stock in north Glasgow is rented social housing, with a high proportion of high-rise tower blocks, managed by the North Glasgow Housing Association trading as NG Homes and Glasgow Housing Association.\nMaryhill consists of well maintained traditional sandstone tenements. Although historically a working class area, its borders with the upmarket West End of the city mean that it is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the north of the city, containing affluent areas such as Maryhill Park and North Kelvinside. Maryhill is also the location of Firhill Stadium, home of Partick Thistle F.C. since 1909. The junior team, Maryhill F.C. are also located in this part of north Glasgow.\nThe Forth and Clyde Canal passes through this part of the city, and at one stage formed a vital part of the local economy. It was for many years polluted and largely unused after the decline of heavy industry, but recent efforts to regenerate and re-open the canal to navigation have seen it rejuvenated, including art campuses at Port Dundas.\nSighthill was home to Scotland's largest asylum seeker community but the area is now regenerated as part of the Youth Olympic Games bid.\nA huge part of the economic life of Glasgow was once located in Springburn, where the Saracen Foundry, engineering works of firms like Charles Tennant and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to the headquarters of the North British Locomotive Company. Today part of the Glasgow Works continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all that is left of the industry in Springburn. It is proposed for closure in 2019. Riddrie in the north east was intensively developed in the 1920s and retains several listed developments in the Art Deco style.\nCulture.\nThe city has many amenities for a wide range of cultural activities, from curling to opera and ballet and from football to art appreciation; it also has a large selection of museums that include those devoted to transport, religion, and modern art. Many of the city's cultural sites were celebrated in 1990 when Glasgow was designated European Capital of Culture.\nThe city's principal municipal library, the Mitchell Library, has grown into one of the largest public reference libraries in Europe, currently housing some 1.3\u00a0million books, an extensive collection of newspapers and thousands of photographs and maps.\nOf academic libraries, Glasgow University Library started in the 15th century and is one of the oldest and largest libraries in Europe, with unique and distinctive collections of international status.\nMost of Scotland's national arts organisations are based in Glasgow, including Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, National Theatre of Scotland, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Scottish Youth Theatre.\nGlasgow has its own \"Poet Laureate\", a post created in 1999 for Edwin Morgan and occupied by Liz Lochhead from 2005 until 2011, when she stood down to take up the position of Scots Makar. Jim Carruth was appointed to the position of Poet Laureate for Glasgow in 2014 as part of the 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy.\nIn 2013, PETA declared Glasgow to be the most vegan-friendly city in the UK.\nRecreation.\nGlasgow is home to major theatres including the Theatre Royal, the King's Theatre, Pavilion Theatre and the Citizens Theatre and home to many museums and art galleries, the largest and most famous being the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Burrell Collection, and the Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA). Most of the museums and galleries in Glasgow are publicly owned and free to enter.\nThe city has hosted many exhibitions over the years from the 1888 International Exhibition and 1901 International Exhibition to the Empire Exhibition 1938, including more recently The Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, being the UK City of Architecture 1999, European Capital of Culture 1990, National City of Sport 1995\u20131999 and European Capital of Sport 2003. Glasgow has also hosted the National M\u00f2d no less than twelve times since 1895.\nIn addition, unlike the older and larger Edinburgh Festival (where all Edinburgh's main festivals occur in the last three weeks of August), Glasgow's festivals fill the calendar. Festivals include the Glasgow International Comedy Festival, Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art, Glasgow International Jazz Festival, Celtic Connections, Glasgow Fair, Glasgow Film Festival, West End Festival, Merchant City Festival, Glasgay, and the World Pipe Band Championships.\nMusic scene.\nThe city is home to numerous orchestras, ensembles and bands including those of Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and related to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and the Universities and Colleges. Choirs of all type are well supported.\nGlasgow has many live music venues, pubs, and clubs. Some of the city's more well-known venues include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, The OVO Hydro, the SECC, Glasgow Cathouse, The Art School, King Tut's Wah Wah Hut (where Oasis were spotted and signed by Glaswegian record mogul Alan McGee), the Queen Margaret Union (who have Kurt Cobain's footprint locked in a safe), the Barrowland, a ballroom converted into a live music venue as well as The Garage, which is the largest nightclub in Scotland. More recent mid-sized venues include ABC, destroyed in the art school fire of 15 June 2018, and the O2 Academy, which play host to a similar range of acts. There are also a large number of smaller venues and bars, which host many local and touring musicians, including Stereo, 13th Note and Nice N Sleazy. Most recent recipient of the SLTN Music Pub of the Year award was Bar Bloc, awarded in November 2011. In 2010, Glasgow was named the UK's fourth \"most musical\" city by PRS for Music. Glasgow is also the \"most mentioned city in the UK\" in song titles, outside London according, to a chart produced by PRS for music, with 119, ahead of closest rivals Edinburgh who received 95 mentions.\nSince the 1980s, the success of bands such as The Blue Nile, Gun, Simple Minds, Del Amitri, Texas, Hipsway, Love &amp; Money, Idlewild, Deacon Blue, Orange Juice, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, Teenage Fanclub, Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, Franz Ferdinand, Mogwai, Travis, and Primal Scream has significantly boosted the profile of the Glasgow music scene, prompting \"Time\" magazine to liken Glasgow to Detroit during its 1960s Motown heyday. Artists to achieve success from Glasgow during the 2000s and 2010s include The Fratellis, Chvrches, Rustie, Vukovi, Glasvegas and Twin Atlantic. The city of Glasgow was appointed a UNESCO City of Music on 20 August 2008 as part of the Creative Cities Network.\nGlasgow's contemporary dance music scene has been spearheaded by Slam, and their record label Soma Quality Recordings, with their Pressure club nights attracting DJs and clubbers from around the world; these nights were hosted by The Arches but moved to Sub Club after the closure of the former in 2015, also taking place at the SWG3 arts venue. The Sub Club has regularly been nominated as one of the best clubs in the world.\nThe MOBO Awards were held at the SECC on 30 September 2009, making Glasgow the first city outside London to host the event since its launch in 1995. On 9 November 2014, Glasgow hosted the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards at The OVO Hydro, it was the second time Scotland hosted the show since 2003 in Edinburgh and overall the fifth time that the United Kingdom has hosted the show since 2011 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The event was hosted by Nicki Minaj and featured performances from Ariana Grande, Enrique Iglesias, Ed Sheeran, U2 and Slash.\nMedia.\nThere has been a considerable number of films made about Glasgow or in Glasgow. Both BBC Scotland and STV have their headquarters in Glasgow. Television programs filmed in Glasgow include \"Rab C. Nesbitt\", \"Taggart\", \"Tutti Frutti\", \"High Times\", \"River City\", \"City Lights\", \"Chewin' the Fat\", \"Still Game\", \"Limmy's Show\" and \"Lovesick\". Most recently, the long-running series \"Question Time\" and the early-evening quiz programme \"Eggheads\" moved its production base to the city. Most National Lottery game shows are also filmed in Glasgow. Children's game show \"Copycats\" is filmed there, and the Irish/UK programme \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\" is filmed at BBC Scotland.\nThe Scottish press publishes various newspapers in the city such as \"The Evening Times\", \"The Herald\", \"The Sunday Herald\", the \"Sunday Mail\" and the \"Daily Record\". Scottish editions of Trinity Mirror and News International titles are printed in the city. STV Group is a Glasgow-based media conglomerate with interests in television, and publishing advertising. STV Group owns and operates both Scottish ITV franchises (Central Scotland and Grampian), both branded STV. Glasgow also had its own television channel, STV Glasgow, which launched in June 2014, which also shows some of Glasgow's own programs filmed at the STV headquarters in Glasgow. Shows included \"The Riverside Show\", \"Scottish Kitchen\", \"City Safari\", \"Football Show\" and \"Live at Five\". STV Glasgow merged with STV Edinburgh to form STV2 in April 2017 which eventually closed in June 2018.\nVarious radio stations are also located in Glasgow. BBC Radio Scotland, the national radio broadcaster for Scotland, is located in the BBC's Glasgow headquarters alongside its Gaelic-language sister station, which is also based in Stornoway. Bauer Radio owns the principal commercial radio stations in Glasgow: Clyde 1 and Greatest Hits Radio Glasgow &amp; The West, which can reach more than 2.3\u00a0million listeners. In 2004, STV Group plc (then known as SMG plc) sold its 27.8% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings to the broadcasting group EMAP for \u00a390.5\u00a0million. Other stations broadcasting from Glasgow include Smooth Scotland, Heart Scotland, which are owned by Global. Global Radio's Central Scotland radio station Capital Scotland also broadcasts from studios in Glasgow. Nation Radio Scotland, owned by Nation Broadcasting, also broadcasts from the city. The city has a strong community radio sector, including Celtic Music Radio, Subcity Radio, Radio Magnetic, Sunny Govan Radio, AWAZ FM and Insight Radio.\nLanguage.\nGlasgow is Scotland's main locus of Gaelic language use outside the Highlands and Islands. In 2011, 5,878 residents of the city over age 3 spoke Gaelic, amounting to 1.0% of the population. Of Scotland's 25 largest cities and towns, only Inverness, the unofficial capital of the Highlands, has a higher percentage of Gaelic speakers. In the Greater Glasgow area there were 8,899 Gaelic-speakers, amounting to 0.8% of the population. Both the Gaelic language television station BBC Alba and the Gaelic language radio station BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal have studios in Glasgow, their only locations outside the Highlands and Islands.\nThe 2022 Scottish Census reported that out of 603,203 residents aged three and over, 10,989 (1.8%) considered themselves able to speak or read Gaelic. \nArchitecture.\nVery little of medieval Glasgow remains; the two main landmarks from this period being the 15th-century Provand's Lordship and 13th-century St. Mungo's Cathedral, although the original medieval street plan (along with many of the street names) on the eastern side of the city centre has largely survived intact. Also in the 15th century began the building of Cathcart Castle, completed c.\u20091450 with a view over the landscape in all directions. It was at this castle Mary Queen of Scots supposedly spent the night before her defeat at the Battle of Langside in May 1568. The castle was demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. The vast majority of the central city area as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has a heritage of Victorian architecture: the Glasgow City Chambers; the main building of the University of Glasgow, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott; and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, designed by Sir John W. Simpson, are notable examples.\nThe city is notable for architecture designed by the Glasgow School, the most notable exponent of that style being Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Mackintosh was an architect and designer in the Arts and Crafts Movement and the main exponent of Art Nouveau in the United Kingdom, designing numerous noted Glasgow buildings such as the Glasgow School of Art, Willow Tearooms and the Scotland Street School Museum. A hidden gem of Glasgow, also designed by Mackintosh, is the Queen's Cross Church, the only church by the renowned artist to be built.\nAnother architect who has had an enduring impact on the city's appearance is Alexander Thomson, with notable examples including the Holmwood House villa, and likewise Sir John James Burnet, awarded the R.I.B.A.'s Royal Gold Medal for his lifetime's service to architecture. The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the \"Second City of the Empire\". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The shipyards, marine engineering, steel making, and heavy industry all contributed to the growth of the city.\nMany of the city's buildings were built with red or blond sandstone, but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the furnaces, until the Clean Air Act was introduced in 1956. There are more than 1,800 listed buildings in the city, of architectural and historical importance, and 23 Conservation Areas extending over . Such areas include the Central Area, Dennistoun, the West End, Pollokshields \u2013 the first major planned garden suburb in Britain \u2013 Newlands and the village of Carmunnock.\nModern buildings in Glasgow include the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and along the banks of the Clyde are the Glasgow Science Centre, The OVO Hydro and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, whose Clyde Auditorium was designed by Sir Norman Foster, and is colloquially known as the \"Armadillo\". In 2004 Zaha Hadid won a competition to design the new Museum of Transport. Hadid's museum opened on the waterfront in 2011 and has been renamed the Riverside Museum to reflect the change in location and to celebrate Glasgow's rich industrial heritage stemming from the Clyde.\nGlasgow's historical and modern architectural traditions were celebrated in 1999 when the city was designated UK City of Architecture and Design, winning the accolade over Liverpool and Edinburgh.\nEconomy.\nGlasgow has the largest economy in Scotland and is at the hub of the metropolitan area of West Central Scotland. The city itself sustains more than 410,000 jobs in more than 12,000 companies. More than 153,000 jobs were created in the city between 2000 and 2005\u00a0\u2013 a growth rate of 32%. Glasgow's annual economic growth rate of 4.4% is now second only to that of London. In 2005, more than 17,000 new jobs were created, and 2006 saw private-sector investment in the city reaching \u00a34.2\u00a0billion, an increase of 22% in a single year. 55% of the residents in the Greater Glasgow area commute to the city every day.\nOnce dominant export orientated manufacturing industries such as shipbuilding and other heavy engineering have been gradually replaced in importance by more diversified forms of economic activity, although major manufacturing firms continue to be headquartered in the city, such as Aggreko, Weir Group, Clyde Blowers, Howden, Linn Products, Firebrand Games, William Grant &amp; Sons, Whyte and Mackay, The Edrington Group, British Polar Engines and Albion Motors.\nIn 2023, major industries in the Glasgow City Region contributing to the economy of the city were public administration, education &amp; health, distribution, hotels &amp; restaurants, banking, finance and insurance services and transport and communication.\nTransport.\nPublic transport.\nGlasgow has a large urban transport system, mostly managed by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT). The city has many bus services; since bus deregulation almost all are provided by private operators, though SPT part-funds some services. The principal bus operators within the city are: First Glasgow, McGill's Bus Services, Stagecoach West Scotland and West Coast Motors. The main bus terminal in the city is Buchanan bus station.\nGlasgow has the most extensive urban rail network in the UK outside London, with rail services travelling to a large part of the West of Scotland. Most lines were electrified under British Rail. All trains running within Scotland, including the local Glasgow trains, are operated by ScotRail, which is owned by the Scottish Government. Central station and Queen Street station are the two main railway terminals. Glasgow Central is the terminus of the long West Coast Main Line from London Euston, as well as TransPennine Express services from Manchester and CrossCountry services from Birmingham, Bristol, Plymouth and various other destinations in England. Glasgow Central is also the terminus for suburban services on the south side of Glasgow, Ayrshire and Inverclyde, as well as being served by the cross city link from Dalmuir to Motherwell. Most other services within Scotland\u00a0\u2013 the main line to Edinburgh, plus services to Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and the Western Highlands\u00a0\u2013 operate from Queen Street station.\nThe city's suburban network is almost completely divided by the River Clyde. Over the years there have been proposed initiatives such as Crossrail to better connect the suburban network. The city is linked to Edinburgh by four direct railway links. In addition to the suburban rail network, SPT operates the Glasgow Subway. The Subway is the United Kingdom's only completely underground metro system and is the world's third oldest underground railway after the London Underground and the Budapest Metro. Both railway and subway stations have a number of park and ride facilities.\nAs part of the wider regeneration along the banks of the River Clyde, a bus rapid transit system called Clyde Fastlink is operational between Glasgow City Centre to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.\nRoads.\n The main M8 motorway passes around the city centre and connects with the M77, M74, M73 and M80 motorways, all of which pass within the city's boundaries. The A82 connects Glasgow to Argyll and the western Highlands. The M74 runs directly south towards Carlisle.\nOther strategic roads in the city include the East End Regeneration Route, which provides easier access to areas of the East End, linking the M8 to the extended M74.\nShipping.\nGlobal-ship-management is carried out by maritime and logistics firms in Glasgow, in client companies employing more than 100,000 seafarers. This reflects maritime skills over many decades and the training and education of deck officers and marine engineers from around the world at the City of Glasgow College, Nautical Campus, from which graduate around one third of all such graduates in the United Kingdom.\nThe main operational dock within Glasgow operated by Clydeport is the King George V Dock, near Braehead. Since the advent of containerisation, most other facilities, such as Hunterston Terminal, are located in the deep waters of the Firth of Clyde, which together handle some 7.5\u00a0million tonnes of cargo each year. Longer distant commercial sea shipping from Glasgow occurs regularly to many European destinations, including Mediterranean and Baltic ports via passage through the Sea of the Hebrides.\nLeisure and tourist sailing is important, at marinas and towns of the Clyde, including the PS \"Waverley\", the world's last operational seagoing paddle-steamer.\nAirports.\nThere are three international airports within 45 minutes travel of the city centre, as well as a centrally located seaplane terminal. Two airports are dedicated to Glasgow, and Edinburgh Airport, situated on the west side of Edinburgh, is not far from Glasgow. These airports are Glasgow Airport (GLA) ( west of the city centre) in Renfrewshire, Glasgow Prestwick Airport (PIK) ( southwest) in South Ayrshire, Edinburgh Airport (EDI), ( east) in Edinburgh and Glasgow Seaplane Terminal, by the Glasgow Science Centre on the River Clyde.\nThere are also several smaller, domestic and private airports around the city. There is a heliport, Glasgow City Heliport, located at Stobcross Quay on the banks of the Clyde.\nAll of the international airports are easily accessible by public transport, with Glasgow Airport and Edinburgh Airport directly linked by bus routes from the main bus station and a direct rail connection to Glasgow Prestwick Airport from Glasgow Central Station. A series of proposals to provide a direct rail link to Glasgow International Airport have ended unsuccessfully, beginning with the Glasgow Airport Rail Link in 2009. As of 2019, local authorities have approved plans for a \"Glasgow Metro\", including a connection to the International Airport.\nHousing.\nGlasgow is known for its tenements; the red and blond sandstone buildings are some of the most recognisable features of the city. These were the most popular form of housing in 19th- and 20th-century Glasgow, and remain the most common form of dwelling in Glasgow today. Tenements are commonly bought by a wide range of social types and are favoured for their large rooms, high ceilings and original period features. The Hyndland area of Glasgow became the first tenement conservation area in the UK and includes some tenement houses with as many as six bedrooms.\nLike many cities in the UK, Glasgow witnessed the construction of high-rise housing in tower blocks in the 1960s, along with large overspill estates on the periphery of the city, in areas like Pollok, Nitshill, Castlemilk, Easterhouse, Milton and Drumchapel. These were built to replace the decaying inner-city tenement buildings originally built for workers who migrated from the surrounding countryside, the Highlands, and the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland, to feed the local demand for labour. The massive demand at that time outstripped the pace of new building, and many originally fine tenements often became overcrowded and unsanitary. Many degenerated into infamous slums, such as the Gorbals.\nEfforts to improve this housing situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust in the late 19th century, cleared the slums of the old town areas such as the Trongate, High Street and Glasgow Cross. Subsequent urban renewal initiatives, such as those motivated by the Bruce Report, entailed the comprehensive demolition of slum tenement areas, the development of new towns on the periphery of the city, and the construction of tower blocks.\nThe policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed many fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style. The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396\u00a0million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.\nHealthcare.\nMedical care in and around Glasgow is provided by NHS Scotland and is directly administered by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Major hospitals, including those with Accident &amp; Emergency provision, are: the Western Infirmary, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Dental Hospital in the city Centre, Stobhill Hospital in the North and the Victoria Infirmary and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in the South Side. Gartnavel Royal Hospital and The Priory are the two major psychiatric hospitals based in Glasgow.\nThe Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) Campus is a 1,677-bed acute hospital located in Govan in the south-west of Glasgow. The hospital is built on the site of the former Southern General Hospital and opened at the end of April 2015. The hospital comprises a newly built 1,109-bed adult hospital, a 256-bed children's hospital and two major A&amp;E departments, one for adults and one for children in addition to buildings retained from the former hospital. The QEUH is the Regional Major Trauma Centre for the west of Scotland and is also the largest hospital campus in Europe.\nThere is also an emergency telephone service provided by NHS 24 and 24-hour access to general practitioners through out-of-hours centres. Paramedic services are provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service and supported by voluntary bodies like the St. Andrew's Ambulance Association. A strong teaching tradition is maintained between the city's main hospitals and the University of Glasgow Medical School.\nAll pharmacies provide a wide range of services including minor ailment advice, emergency hormonal contraception and public health advice; some provide oxygen and needle exchange.\nThere are private clinics and hospitals at the Nuffield in the west end and Ross Hall in the south side of the city.\nEducation.\nGlasgow is a major centre of higher and academic research, with the following universities and colleges within of the city centre:\nIn 2011 Glasgow had 53,470 full-time students aged 18\u201374 resident in the city during term time, more than any other city in Scotland and the fifth-highest number in the United Kingdom outside London. The majority of those who live away from home reside in Shawlands, Dennistoun and the West End of the city.\nThe City Council operates 29 secondary schools, 149 primary schools and three specialist schools\u00a0\u2013 the Dance School of Scotland, Glasgow School of Sport and the Glasgow Gaelic School (\"Sgoil Gh\u00e0idhlig Ghlaschu\"), the only secondary school in Scotland to teach exclusively in Gaelic. Outdoor Education facilities are provided by the city council at the Blairvadach Centre, near Helensburgh. Jordanhill School is operated directly by the Scottish Government. Glasgow also has a number of Independent schools, including The High School of Glasgow, founded in 1124 and the oldest school in Scotland; Hutchesons' Grammar School, founded in 1639 and one of the oldest school institutions in Scotland; and others such as Craigholme School (closed 2020), Glasgow Academy, Kelvinside Academy and St. Aloysius' College. Glasgow is part of the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities.\nSport.\nFootball.\nThe world's first international football match was held in 1872 at the West of Scotland Cricket Club's Hamilton Crescent ground in the Partick area of the city. The match, between Scotland and England finished 0\u20130. Glasgow was the first city (since joined by Liverpool in 1985, Madrid in 1986, 2014, 2016 and 2018, Milan in 1994 and London in 2019, 2025) to have had two football teams in European finals in the same season: in 1967, Celtic competed in and won the European Cup final, with rivals Rangers competing in the Cup Winners' Cup final. Rangers were the first football club from the United Kingdom to reach a European final, doing so in 1961. Celtic were the first non-Latin club to win the European Cup, under the management of Jock Stein in 1967, before Manchester United the following year. Celtic also went on to reach another European Cup Final in 1970, losing to Feyenoord, and also the final of the UEFA Cup in 2003, where they lost an enthralling match which finished 3\u20132 to Portuguese club Porto. Rangers also reached the final of the same competition in 2008 and 2022, where they lost to Zenit Saint Petersburg of Russia, and Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany.\nHampden Park, which is Scotland's national football stadium, holds the European record for attendance at a football match: 149,547 saw Scotland beat England 3\u20131 in 1937, in the days before leading British stadia became all-seated. Hampden Park has hosted the final of the UEFA Champions League on three occasions, most recently in 2002 and hosted the UEFA Cup Final in 2007. Celtic Park (60,411 seats) is located in the east end of Glasgow, and Ibrox Stadium (51,700 seats) on the south side.\nGlasgow has four professional football clubs, who all play in the SPFL: Celtic, Rangers, Partick Thistle, and Queen's Park (after their move from amateur status in November 2019). Prior to this, Glasgow had two other professional teams: Clyde (now playing in Hamilton) and Third Lanark (liquidated in 1967), plus four others active in the league in the 19th century: Thistle, Cowlairs, Northern and Linthouse. There are a number of West of Scotland Football League clubs within the city as well, such as Pollok, Maryhill, Benburb, Ashfield, Glasgow Perthshire F.C., Glasgow United (formerly Shettleston Juniors), and Petershill, plus numerous amateur teams.\nThe history of football in the city, as well as the status of the Old Firm, attracts many visitors to football matches in the city throughout the season. The Scottish Football Association, the national governing body, and the Scottish Football Museum are based in Glasgow, as are the Scottish Professional Football League, Scottish Junior Football Association and Scottish Amateur Football Association. The Glasgow Cup was a once popular tournament, which was competed for by Rangers, Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle and Queen's Park. The competition is now played for by the youth sides of the five teams.\nGlasgow is also home to six women's football teams. Currently, Glasgow City are the champions of the Scottish Women's Premier League. Other local teams include Glasgow Girls and the women's sections of the men's clubs: Celtic and Rangers play in the top division.\nRugby union.\nGlasgow has a professional rugby union club, the Glasgow Warriors, which plays in the European Rugby Champions Cup and United Rugby Championship alongside teams from Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Italy and South Africa. The Warriors current home is Scotstoun Stadium and has been since 2012, previously they played at Firhill Stadium. They have won the Melrose 7s in both 2014 and 2015 and were also crowned champions of the Pro12 (later rebranded as the United Rugby Championship) at the end of the 2014/15 season after beating Irish side Munster in Belfast. Warriors won URC in the 2023/24 season after defeating South African team Bulls in the Grand Final in Pretoria.\nIn the Scottish League, Glasgow Hawks RFC was formed in 1997 by the merger of two of Glasgow's oldest clubs: Glasgow Academicals and Glasgow High Kelvinside (GHK). Despite the merger, the second division teams of Glasgow Academicals and Glasgow High Kelvinside re-entered the Scottish rugby league in 1998. Another of the Glasgow area's most prominent clubs Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians RFC (GHA) has its roots in the south of the city (nowadays technically they are based just outside the city in the suburb of Giffnock in East Renfrewshire). GHA was formed in 2002 with the merger of two of Glasgow's leading clubs at the time, Glasgow Southern RFC and Hutchesons Aloysians RFC.\nCartha Queen's Park play at Dumbreck, within the city. Glasgow was also home to one of the oldest rugby clubs in the country, West of Scotland F.C., which was formed in 1865 and was a founding member of the Scottish Rugby Union. The club was originally based in Partick at Hamilton Crescent but is now based outside the city, at Milngavie in East Dunbartonshire.\nOther sports.\nThe Easterhouse Panthers based in the East End of Glasgow are a rugby league team who play in the Rugby League Conference Scotland Division. From 1966 to 1986, the Glasgow Dynamos played at Crossmyloof Ice Rink. Since October 2010 a team called the Glasgow Clan based in the nearby Braehead Arena in Renfrewshire has played in the professional Elite Ice Hockey League alongside two other Scottish teams, the Fife Flyers and the Dundee Stars.\nThe Arlington Baths Club was founded in 1870. It is situated in the Woodlands area of the city and is still in use today. It is believed the club's first Baths Master William Wilson invented water polo at the club. The Arlington inspired other Swimming Clubs and the Western Baths, which opened in 1876, is also still in existence in nearby Hillhead.\nGlasgow hosts Scotland's only professional basketball team, the Caledonia Gladiators, who compete in the British Basketball League. Previously based in Renfrewshire's Braehead Arena and the 1,200-seat Kelvin Hall, the team has been based at the Emirates Arena since the 2012/13 season. Major international sporting arenas include the Kelvin Hall and Scotstoun Sports Centre. In 2003 the National Academy for Badminton was completed in Scotstoun. In 2003, Glasgow was also given the title of European Capital of Sport.\nGlasgow is also host to many cricket clubs including Clydesdale Cricket Club who have been title winners for the Scottish Cup many times. This club also acted as a neutral venue for a One Day International match between India and Pakistan in 2007, but due to bad weather it was called off. Smaller sporting facilities include an abundance of outdoor playing fields, as well as golf clubs such as Haggs Castle and artificial ski slopes. Between 1998 and 2004, the Scottish Claymores American football team played some or all of their home games each season at Hampden Park and the venue also hosted World Bowl XI. Glasgow Green and the Gorbals are home to a number of rowing clubs, some with open membership the rest belonging to universities or schools. Historically, rowing races on the River Clyde here attracted huge crowds of spectators to watch regattas in the late 19th century and early 20th century; before football caught the public imagination. Two of Glasgow's rowing clubs separately claim that it was their members who were among the founders of Rangers Football Club.\nMotorcycle speedway racing was first introduced to Glasgow in 1928 and is currently staged at Ashfield Stadium in the North of the city. The home club, Glasgow Tigers, compete in the SGB Championship, the second tier of motorcycle speedway in Britain. Glasgow is also one of five places in Scotland that hosts the final of the Scottish Cup of Shinty, better known as the Camanachd Cup. This is usually held at Old Anniesland. Once home to numerous Shinty clubs, there is now only one senior club in Glasgow, Glasgow Mid-Argyll.\nSporting events host city.\nGlasgow bid to host the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics but lost to Buenos Aires in the 4 July 2013 vote. Glasgow was the host of the 2018 European Sports Championships along with Berlin (hosts of the 2018 European Athletics Championships). In August 2023, the city hosted the inaugural UCI Cycling World Championships. Glasgow played host to five venues for the event, whilst some events were held in Dumfries &amp; Galloway (para-cycling road) and Stirling (time trial).\nOn 9 November 2007, Glasgow was selected to be the host city of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The games were held at a number of existing and newly constructed sporting venues across the city, including a refurbished Hampden Park, Kelvingrove Park, Kelvin Hall, and the OVO Hydro at the SECC. The opening ceremony was held at Celtic Park. 2014 was the third time the Games have been held in Scotland.\nOn 17 September 2024, Glasgow was chosen as host for the 2026 Commonwealth Games, due to Victoria (the original host) pulling out due to unexpected cost increases.\nGlasgow was the Scottish host city for the pan\u2013European UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, with the group of 16 matches being played at the city's Hampden Park. In 2023, Scotland, along with England, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales, were confirmed hosts for the UEFA Euro 2028 tournament, again with Hampden Stadium being the selected Scottish stadium to host matches.\nNamesake area on Mars.\nThere is an area on Planet Mars which NASA has named Glasgow, after Scotland's largest city. The Mars rover Curiosity, which landed on the planet in August 2012, has drilled at the site.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nGlasgow is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrom 1986 to 2022, Glasgow was also twinned with Rostov-on-Don, Russia.\nPartnerships.\nThe city is also in a partnership with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68742", "revid": "36045631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68742", "title": "Supper", "text": "Evening meal\nSupper is a term commonly used to refer to the main evening meal, although its meaning varies considerably. While it can also denote a light or late-evening snack either after or instead of the main meal, in the United Kingdom it is traditionally used to describe an informal main evening meal, as opposed to a dinner or a dinner party, which are a more formal meal with guests.\nEtymology.\nThe term is derived from the French \"souper\", which is used for this meal in Canadian French, Swiss French, and in Belgian French. It is related to soup. It is also related to the Scandinavian words for soup, \"soppa\" or s\"uppe\", the German word for soup, \"Suppe\" and the Catalan word for soup \"sopa\", in Catalan dinner is also called \"sopar\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\", however, suggests that the root, sup, remains obscure in origin.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"White-Jacket\", Chapter VII: Breakfast, Dinner, and Supper.\nThough in respect of the dinner hour on board a man-of-war, [sailors] have no reason to complain; yet they have just cause, almost for mutiny, in the outrageous hours assigned for their breakfast and supper.\nEight o'clock for breakfast; twelve for dinner; four for supper; and no meals but these; no lunches and no cold snacks.\nHerman Melville, 1850\nSupper was originally a secondary lighter evening meal. The main meal of the day, called dinner, used to be served closer to what is known as lunchtime, around the middle of the day, but crept later over the centuries, mostly over the course of the 19th century. When dinner was still at the early time, eating a lighter supper in the evening was very common; it was not always the last meal of the day, as there might be a tea later. Reflecting the typical custom of 17th century elites, Louis XIV dined at noon, with a supper at 10\u00a0pm. Even when dinner was in the early evening, supper was served at a ball, or after returning from it, and might be after other evening excursions. At an English ball in 1791, supper was served to 140 guests at 1:00\u00a0am. They would all have had dinner at home many hours earlier, before coming out. Other, grander, balls served supper even later, up to 3:30\u00a0am, at a London ball given in 1811 by the Duchess of Bedford.\nModern usage.\nIn modern usage \"supper\" may refer to, on largely class-based distinctions, either a late-evening snack (working- and middle-class usage) or else to make a distinction between \"supper\" as an informal family meal (which would be eaten in the kitchen or family dining room) as opposed to \"dinner\", especially as a \"dinner party\", a generally grander affair with guests from outside the household, which would be eaten in the best dining room.\nDifferent cultures can usually bring supper to the table at different times. For example, According to The Daily Meal, in Norway it is customary to start eating at about four in the afternoon and in Australia between five and seven in the evening. In South African English, \"supper\" is used for the main evening meal, and \"dinner\" tends to be reserved for a formal meal.\nNorth America.\nThe distinction between dinner and supper was common in North American farming communities into the 20th century, especially in the Midwest and the American South, though today, most Americans consider the two synonyms and strongly prefer the term dinner for the evening meal. During World War II, rations in the U.S. military were still divided into breakfast, dinner, and supper, using the traditional designations for meals. In most parts of the United States and Canada today, \"supper\" and \"dinner\" are considered synonyms (although supper is a more antiquated term). \nIn Saskatchewan, and much of Atlantic Canada, \"supper\" means the main meal of the day, usually served in the late afternoon, while \"dinner\" is served around noon. \"Dinner\" is used in some areas, such as Newfoundland and Labrador, to describe the noon meal as well as special meals, such as \"Thanksgiving dinner\", \"Flipper dinner\" or \"Christmas dinner\", the evening meal being \"supper\". The word \"supper\" is also regionally reserved for harvest meals put on by churches and other community organizations: \"fowl suppers\" or \"fall suppers\" (featuring turkey) are common in Canada; \"pancake suppers\" given by church groups were once a tradition in the United States; and \"bean suppers\" (featuring baked beans) were traditional in New England and especially the state of Maine.\nBritish Isles.\nIn Scotland, the traditional British dish of fish and chips is known as a \"fish supper\". In this context, supper refers to a meal typically enjoyed in the evening, consisting of a main course accompanied by thick-cut chips. In place of the fish, it may also feature other items, such as deep-fried pizza.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68743", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68743", "title": "East Prussia", "text": "Historic province of Prussia and Germany\nEast Prussia ( ) was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1772 to 1829 and again from 1878 (with the Kingdom itself being part of the German Empire from 1871); following World War I it formed part of the Weimar Republic's Free State of Prussia, until 1945. Its capital city was K\u00f6nigsberg (present-day Kaliningrad). East Prussia was the main part of the region of Prussia along the southeastern Baltic Coast.\nThe bulk of the ancestral lands of the Baltic Old Prussians were enclosed within the later province of East Prussia. During the 13th century, the native Prussians were conquered by the crusading Teutonic Knights. After the conquest they were gradually converted to Christianity. As a result of the medieval , Germans became the dominant ethnic group, while Poles and Lithuanians formed sizeable minorities. From the 13th century, the region of Prussia was part of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. After the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466 it became a part of the Kingdom of Poland, either directly (Warmia) or as a fief (remainder). In 1525, with the Prussian Homage, the territory became the Duchy of Prussia, a vassal duchy of Poland. It gained full sovereignty in 1657, when Poland renounced its feudal rights in the Treaty of Bromberg.\nBecause the duchy was outside of the core Holy Roman Empire, the prince-electors of Brandenburg were able to proclaim themselves King beginning in 1701. After the annexation of most of Royal Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772, eastern (Ducal) Prussia was connected by land with the rest of the Prussian state and was reorganized as a province the following year. Between 1829 and 1878, the Province of East Prussia was joined with West Prussia to form the Province of Prussia. The Polish and Lithuanian minorities were subjected to Germanisation policies.\nThe Kingdom of Prussia became the leading state of the German Empire after its creation in 1871. However, the Treaty of Versailles following World War I granted West Prussia to Poland and made East Prussia an exclave of Weimar Germany (the so-called Polish Corridor separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany), while the Memel Territory, part of the Lithuania Minor region, was detached and annexed by Lithuania in 1923. Following Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II in 1945, war-torn East Prussia was divided at Joseph Stalin's insistence between the Soviet Union (the Kaliningrad Oblast became part of the Russian SFSR, and the constituent counties of the Klaip\u0117da Region in the Lithuanian SSR) and the People's Republic of Poland (the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship). The capital city K\u00f6nigsberg was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946. The German and the Masurian population of the province was largely evacuated during the war or expelled shortly afterwards in the expulsion of Germans after World War II. An estimated 300,000 died either in wartime bombing raids, in the battles to defend the province, through mistreatment by the Red Army, or from hunger, cold and disease.\nGeography.\nThe landscape of East Prussia consisted of gently rolling plains and small hills, with flatter terrain in the north and more hills in the south. The province had a humid continental climate which was most pronounced in Lithuania Minor and at higher elevations in the south in the region of Masuria, while the northwesternmost coastal parts approached an oceanic climate.\nIn the northwest, the province bordered the Baltic Sea, with the Vistula Spit and Curonian Spit separating the sea itself from the Vistula Lagoon and Curonian Lagoon, respectively. The Sambia Peninsula () juts into the Baltic Sea between these two lagoons. Most of the rivers of East Prussia emptied into the two lagoons; the Pregolya (), Pas\u0142\u0119ka (), and Prokhladnaya () into the Vistula Lagoon, and the Neman () and Minija () into the Curonian Lagoon.\nIn the northeast of the province, the river \u0160e\u0161up\u0117 (), a left-tributary of the Neman, formed the border with the Russian Empire, and today forms the border between Kaliningrad Oblast and Lithuania. The Klaip\u0117da Region () was a portion of the province to the north of the Neman river. Adjacent to the Curonian Lagoon and the lower reaches of the Neman river could be found the Elchniederung, a vast partially-drained bog, much of it below sea-level.\nFurther south, the region becomes more hilly, with fewer bogs and more lakes. To the east, near the modern Polish-Russian border, was the Romincka Forest (), a famous hunting-ground for Prussian nobility. On the eastern end of the forest is Lake Vi\u0161tytis (), and to the south are the Szeskie Hills (). The Angrapa river (), a tributary of the Pregel, flows out Lake Mamry () on the northern end of the Masurian Lake District. The largest lake in the province was \u015aniardwy (), at 113.8 square kilometers in area.\nThe headwaters of the Pregel's numerous tributaries were found in southern East Prussia, with the longest, the \u0141yna (), extending almost to the southern border with Congress Poland, winding its course northward through southern Warmia and the central portion of the province. In the southernmost regions, the rivers flow to the south, emptying into the Narew and Vistula rivers. The highest elevation of East Prussia at 312 meters above sea level was Dylewska G\u00f3ra (), found in the southwest near the border with West Prussia.\nBackground.\nAt the instigation of Duke Konrad I of Masovia, the Teutonic Knights took possession of Prussia in the 13th century and created a monastic state to administer the conquered Old Prussians. Local Old-Prussian (north) and Polish (south) toponyms were gradually Germanised. The Knights' expansionist policies, including occupation of Polish Pomerania with Gda\u0144sk/Danzig and western Lithuania, brought them into conflict with the Kingdom of Poland and embroiled them in several wars, culminating in the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War, whereby the united armies of Poland and Lithuania, defeated the Teutonic Order at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. In 1440, the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation was founded, and various cities and nobles of the region joined it. In 1454, upon the Confederation's request King Casimir IV of Poland signed the act of incorporation of the entire region into the Kingdom of Poland. The Teutonic Knights' defeat was formalised in the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466 ending the Thirteen Years' War. The restoration of Pomerelia to Poland was confirmed, and Warmia also was confirmed part of Poland, with both co-forming the newly created autonomous province of Royal Prussia (from 1569 within the larger Greater Poland Province). The remainder of historic Prussia (the bulk of the territory that later formed East Prussia) also became a part of \"one and indivisible\" Kingdom of Poland as a fief and protectorate held by the Teutonic Knights. 1466 and 1525 arrangements by kings of Poland were not verified by the Holy Roman Empire, as well as the previous gains of the Teutonic Knights, were not verified.\nThe Teutonic Order lost eastern Prussia when Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach converted to Lutheranism and secularized the Prussian branch of the Teutonic Order in 1525. Albert established himself as the first duke of the Duchy of Prussia and a vassal of the Polish crown by the Prussian Homage. Walter von Cronberg, the next Grand Master, was enfeoffed with the title to Prussia after the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, but the Order never regained possession of the territory. In 1569 the Hohenzollern prince-electors of the Margraviate of Brandenburg became co-regents with Albert's son, the feeble-minded Albert Frederick.\nThe Administrator of Prussia, the grandmaster of the Teutonic Order Maximilian III, son of emperor Maximilian II died in 1618. When Maximilian died, Albert's line died out, and the Duchy of Prussia passed to the Electors of Brandenburg, forming Brandenburg-Prussia. Taking advantage of the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1655, and instead of fulfilling his vassal's duties towards the Polish Kingdom, by joining forces with the Swedes and subsequent treaties of Wehlau, Labiau, and Oliva, Elector and Duke Frederick William succeeded in revoking the king of Poland's sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia in 1660. There was strong opposition to the separation of the region from Poland, especially in K\u00f6nigsberg (). A confederation was formed in the city to maintain Poland's sovereignty over the city and region. The Brandenburg Elector and his army, however, entered the city and abducted and imprisoned the leader of the city's anti-Elector opposition Hieronymus Roth. In 1663, the city burghers, forced by Elector Frederick William, swore an oath of allegiance to him, however, in the same ceremony they still also pledged allegiance to Poland. The absolutist elector also subdued the noble estates of Prussia.\nAlthough Brandenburg was a part of the Holy Roman Empire, the Prussian lands were not within the Holy Roman Empire and were with the administration by the Teutonic Order grandmasters under jurisdiction of the Emperor. In return for supporting Emperor Leopold I in the War of the Spanish Succession, Elector Frederick III was allowed to crown himself \"King in Prussia\" in 1701. The new kingdom ruled by the Hohenzollern dynasty became known as the Kingdom of Prussia. The designation \"Kingdom of Prussia\" was gradually applied to the various lands of Brandenburg-Prussia. To differentiate it from the larger entity, the former Duchy of Prussia became known as \"Altpreu\u00dfen\" (\"Old Prussia\"), the province of Prussia, or \"East Prussia\".\nApproximately one-third of East Prussia's population died in the Great Northern War plague outbreak and famine of 1709\u20131711, including the last speakers of Old Prussian. The plague, probably brought by foreign troops during the Great Northern War, killed 250,000 East Prussians, especially in the province's eastern regions. Crown Prince Frederick William I led the rebuilding of East Prussia, founding numerous towns. In 1724, Frederick William I prohibited Poles, Samogitians and Jews from settling in Lithuania Minor, and initiated German colonization to change the region's ethnic composition. Thousands of Protestants expelled from the Archbishopric of Salzburg were allowed to settle in depleted East Prussia. In 1756 Russia decided to go to war with the Kingdom of Prussia and annex the territory, which was then to be offered to Poland as part of a territorial exchange desired by Russia, however, ultimately Russia only occupied the region for four years during the Seven Years' War before withdrawing in 1762 and did not make Poland an offer of territorial exchange.\nHistory as a province.\nIn the 1772 First Partition of Poland, King Frederick the Great annexed neighbouring Royal Prussia\u2014the Polish voivodeships of Pomerania (Pomerelia), Malbork, Che\u0142mno and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia. This connected his Prussian and Farther Pomeranian lands and cut the remainder of Poland off from the Baltic coast. The territory of Warmia was incorporated into former Ducal Prussia, which by administrative decree of 31 January 1772 was designated \"East Prussia\". The former Polish Pomerelian lands beyond the Vistula together with Marienburg and the Culmer Land formed the Province of West Prussia with its capital at Marienwerder. The Polish Partition Sejm ratified the cession on 30 September 1772, after which Frederick styled himself King \u2018\u2018of\u2019\u2019 Prussia.\nSeveral former Ducal Prussian districts\u2014Eylau (now I\u0142awa), Marienwerder, Riesenburg (now Prabuty) and Sch\u00f6nberg (now Szymbark)\u2014were also transferred to West Prussia. Until the Prussian reforms of 1808, the government of East Prussia was administered through the General War and Finance Directorate in Berlin, represented locally by two chamber departments:\nOn 31 January 1773, Frederick II confirmed the final division: the newly annexed lands became the Province of West Prussia, while former Ducal Prussia together with Warmia became the Province of East Prussia.\nThese administrative reorganizations shaped the political and economic structure of the Prussian state, integrating Polish, Baltic and German territories under a unified system that laid the foundation for later nineteenth-century reforms. They also set the stage for the significant restructuring that followed the post-1808 Prussian reform era.\nNapoleonic Wars.\nAfter the disastrous defeat of the Royal Prussian Army at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806, Napoleon occupied Berlin and had the officials of the Prussian General Directorate swear an oath of allegiance to him, while King Frederick William III and his consort Louise fled via K\u00f6nigsberg and the Curonian Spit to Memel. The French Grande Arm\u00e9e troops immediately took up pursuit but were delayed in the Battle of Eylau on 9 February 1807 by an East Prussian contingent under General Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq. Napoleon had to stay at the Finckenstein Palace, but in May, after a siege of 75 days, his troops led by Marshal Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Lefebvre were able to capture the city of Danzig, which had been tenaciously defended by General Count Friedrich Adolf von Kalkreuth. On 14 June, Napoleon ended the War of the Fourth Coalition with his victory at the Battle of Friedland. Frederick William and Queen Louise met with Napoleon for peace negotiations, and on 9 July the Prussian king signed the Treaty of Tilsit.\nThe succeeding Prussian reforms instigated by Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg included the implementation of an appellation court at K\u00f6nigsberg, a municipal corporation, economic freedom as well as emancipation of the serfs and Jews. In the course of the Prussian restoration by the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the East Prussian territories were re-arranged in the of Gumbinnen and K\u00f6nigsberg. From 1905, the southern districts of East Prussia formed the separate \"Regierungsbezirk\" of Allenstein. East and West Prussia were first united in personal union in 1824 and then merged in a real union in 1829 to form the Province of Prussia. The united province was again split into separate East and West Prussian provinces in 1878.\nGerman Empire.\nFrom 1824 to 1878, East Prussia was combined with West Prussia to form the Province of Prussia, after which they were reestablished as separate provinces. Along with the rest of the Kingdom of Prussia, East Prussia became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany in 1871.\nFrom 1885 to 1890 Berlin's population grew by 20%, Brandenburg and the Rhineland gained 8.5%, Westphalia 10%, while East Prussia lost 0.07% and West Prussia 0.86%. This stagnancy in population despite a high birth surplus in eastern Germany was because many people from the East Prussian countryside moved westward to seek work in the expanding industrial centres of the Ruhr Area and Berlin (see \"Ostflucht\").\nThe population of the province in 1900 was 1,996,626 people, with a religious makeup of 1,698,465 Protestants, 269,196 Roman Catholics, and 13,877 Jews. The Low Prussian dialect predominated in East Prussia, although High Prussian was spoken in Warmia. The numbers of Masurians, Kursenieki and Prussian Lithuanians decreased over time due to the process of Germanization. The Polish-speaking population concentrated in the south of the province (Masuria and Warmia) and all German geographic atlases at the start of 20th century showed the southern part of East Prussia as Polish with the number of Polish-speakers estimated at the time to be 300,000. Kursenieki inhabited the areas around the Curonian lagoon, while Lithuanian-speaking Prussians concentrated in the northeast in (Lithuania Minor). The Old Prussian ethnic group became completely Germanized over time and the Old Prussian language died out in the 18th century.\nWorld War I.\nAt the German entry into World War I, East Prussia became a theatre of war when the Russian Empire invaded the country. The Imperial Russian Army encountered at first little resistance because the bulk of the Imperial German Army had been directed towards the Western Front according to the Schlieffen Plan. Despite early success and the capture of the towns of Rastenburg and Gumbinnen, in the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914 and the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes in 1915, the Russians were decisively defeated and forced to retreat. The Russians were followed by the German Army advancing into Russian territory.\nAfter the Russian army's first invasion the majority of the civilian population fled westwards, while several thousand remaining civilians were deported to Russia. Treatment of civilians by both armies was mostly disciplined, although 74 civilians were killed by Russian troops in the Abschwangen massacre on 8/29/1914. The region had to be rebuilt because of damage caused by the war.\nWeimar Republic.\nWith the forced abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II in the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, Germany became a republic. Most of the former Prussian provinces of West Prussia and Posen, territories annexed by Prussia in the 18th century Partitions of Poland, were ceded to the Second Polish Republic according to the Treaty of Versailles. East Prussia became an exclave, being separated from mainland Germany. The Klaip\u0117da Region was also separated from the province. Because most of West Prussia became part of the Second Polish Republic as the Polish Corridor, the formerly West Prussian Marienwerder region became part of East Prussia as the administrative district (\"Regierungsbezirk\") of West Prussia. Also, the Dzia\u0142dowo district in the Allenstein region became part of the Second Polish Republic. The Seedienst Ostpreu\u00dfen (Sea Service East Prussia) was established to provide an independent transport service to East Prussia.\nOn 11 July 1920, amidst the backdrop of the Polish-Soviet War in which the Second Polish Republic appeared to be on the brink of defeat, the East Prussian plebiscite in eastern West Prussia and southern East Prussia was held under Allied supervision to determine if the areas should join Poland or remain in the Weimar Germany Province of East Prussia. 96.7% of the people voted to remain within Germany (97.89% in the East Prussian plebiscite district).\nThe Klaip\u0117da Territory (Memelland), a League of Nations mandate since 1920, was occupied by the Lithuanian Armed Forces in 1923 and annexed without giving the inhabitants a choice by ballot.\nNazi Germany.\nAfter Adolf Hitler's rise to power, opposition politicians were persecuted and newspapers banned. Erich Koch, who headed the East Prussian Nazi party from 1928, led the district from 1932. The Otto-Braun-House was requisitioned to become the headquarters of the SA, which used the house to imprison and torture its opponents. Walter Sch\u00fctz, a communist member of the Reichstag, was murdered here. This period was characterized by efforts to collectivize the local agriculture and ruthlessness in dealing with Koch's critics inside and outside the Nazi Party. He also had long-term plans for mass-scale industrialization of the largely agricultural province. These actions made him unpopular among the local peasants. In 1932 the local paramilitary SA had already started to terrorise their political opponents. On the night of 31 July 1932 there was a bomb attack on the headquarters of the Social Democrats in K\u00f6nigsberg, the Otto-Braun-House. The Communist politician Gustav Sauf was killed; the executive editor of the Social Democratic newspaper \"K\u00f6nigsberger Volkszeitung\", Otto Wyrgatsch; and the German People's Party politician Max von Bahrfeldt were all severely injured. Members of the Reichsbanner were assaulted while the local Reichsbanner Chairman of L\u00f6tzen, Kurt Kotzan, was murdered on 6 August 1932.\nIn the March 1933 German federal election, the last contested pre-war German election, the local population of East Prussia voted overwhelmingly for Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party.\nThrough publicly funded emergency relief programs concentrating on agricultural land-improvement projects and road construction, the \"Erich Koch Plan\" for East Prussia allegedly made the province free of unemployment: on 16 August 1933 Koch reported to Hitler that unemployment had been banished entirely from the province, a feat that gained admiration throughout the Reich. In actuality, the Erich Koch Plan had been a staged propaganda event organized by Walther Funk and the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda to promote the Nazi Party's work creation policies, with East Prussia chosen because it already had relatively low unemployment due to its agrarian economy. Koch's industrialization plans provoked conflict with Richard Walther Darr\u00e9, who held the office of the Reich Peasant Leader (\"Reichsbauernf\u00fchrer\") and Minister of Agriculture. Darr\u00e9, a neopaganist rural romantic, wanted to enforce his vision of an agricultural East Prussia. When his \"Land\" representatives challenged Koch's plans, Koch arrested them.\nIn 1938 the Nazis changed about one-third of the toponyms of the area, eliminating, Germanizing, or simplifying a number of Old Prussian, as well as those Polish or Lithuanian names originating from colonists and refugees to Prussia during and after the Protestant Reformation. More than 1,500 places were ordered to be renamed by 16 July 1938 following a decree issued by Gauleiter and Oberpr\u00e4sident Erich Koch and initiated by Adolf Hitler. Many who would not cooperate with the rulers of Nazi Germany were sent to concentration camps and held prisoner there until their death or liberation.\nAfter the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania, the Klaip\u0117da region was integrated again into East Prussia.\nWorld War II.\nAfter the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany opening World War II, the borders of East Prussia were revised. Regierungsbezirk Westpreu\u00dfen became part of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, while Regierungsbezirk Zichenau (Ciechan\u00f3w) was added to East Prussia. Originally part of the Zichenau region, the Sudauen (Suwa\u0142ki) district in Sudovia was later transferred to the Gumbinnen region.\nIn 1939 East Prussia had 2.49\u00a0million inhabitants, 85% of them ethnic Germans, the others Poles in the south who, according to Polish estimates numbered in the interwar period around 300,000\u2013350,000, the Latvian speaking Kursenieki, and Lietuvininkai who spoke Lithuanian in the northeast. Most German East Prussians, Masurians, Kursieniki, and Lietuvininkai were Lutheran, while the population of Warmia was mainly Roman Catholic due to the history of its bishopric. The East Prussian Jewish Congregation declined from about 9,000 in 1933 to 3,000 in 1939, as most fled from Nazi rule.\nDuring World War II, the Polish ethnic minorities of Catholic Warmians and Lutheran Masurians were persecuted by the Nazi German government, which wanted to erase all aspects of Polish culture and Polish language in Warmia and Masuria. The Jews who remained in East Prussia in 1942 were shipped to concentration camps, including Theresienstadt in occupied Czechoslovakia, Kaiserwald in occupied Latvia, and camps in Minsk in occupied Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Deportations began 24 June 1942 and continued throughtout the war. Most of those deported were killed in the Holocaust.\nIn 1939 the Regierungsbezirk Zichenau was annexed by Germany and incorporated into East Prussia. Parts of it were transferred to other regions, e.g. Suwa\u0142ki Region to Regierungsbezirk Gumbinnen and Soldau (Dzia\u0142dowo) to Regierungsbezirk Allenstein.\nIn the annexed pre-war Polish territory, the Polish population was subjected to various crimes, including mass arrests, roundups, deportations to forced labour and concentration camps (including teenagers), executions, massacres (also as part of the \"Intelligenzaktion\" and \"Aktion T4\") and expulsions. The Jews were confined in ghettos and afterwards deported either deported to extermination camps or massacred in the region.\nGermany operated the Soldau and Hohenbruch concentration camps, mostly for Poles, multiple subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp and several prisoner-of-war camps, including Stalag I-A, Stalag I-B, Stalag I-C, Stalag I-D, Stalag I-E, Stalag I-F, Stalag Luft VI, Oflag 52, Oflag 53, Oflag 60, Oflag 63 and Oflag 68 with multiple subcamps, for Polish, Belgian, French, British, Serbian, Soviet, Italian, American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, South African, Czech and other Allied POWs in the province. Pre-war Polish citizens made up the majority of forced laborers in the province, with their numbers gradually increasing, but due to the influx of forced laborers of other nationalities, their overall percentage declined from 90% in 1940 to 62% in 1944. Most Polish forced laborers in the province were deported from the pre-war Polish territories annexed into the province by Germany, with German labor offices recruiting forced laborers established in the cities of Ciechan\u00f3w, Ostro\u0142\u0119ka, P\u0142ock and Suwa\u0142ki.\nHitler's top-secret Eastern front headquarters during the war, the \"Wolf's Lair\", was located in the village of Gier\u0142o\u017c.\nThe Polish resistance was active in the province, both in the annexed pre-war territory of Poland, and in the pre-war territory of East Prussia, with activities in the latter including distribution of Polish underground press, sabotage actions, executions of Nazis, theft of German weapons, ammunition and equipment, and organization of transports of POWs who escaped German POW camps via the ports of Danzig and Gdynia to neutral Sweden.\nEast Prussia was only slightly affected by the war until January 1945, when it was devastated during the East Prussian Offensive. Most of its inhabitants became refugees in bitterly cold weather during the Evacuation of East Prussia.\nEvacuation of East Prussia.\nIn 1944 the medieval city of K\u00f6nigsberg, which had never been severely damaged by warfare in its 700 years of existence, was almost completely destroyed by two RAF Bomber Command raids \u2013 the first on the night of 26/27 August 1944, with the second one three nights later, overnight on 29/30 August 1944. Winston Churchill (\"The Second World War\", Book XII) had erroneously believed it to be \"a modernized heavily defended fortress\" and ordered its destruction.\nGauleiter Erich Koch delayed the evacuation of the German civilian population until the Eastern Front approached the East Prussian border in 1944. The population had been systematically misinformed by \"Endsieg\" Nazi propaganda about the real state of military affairs. As a result, many civilians fleeing westward were overtaken by retreating Wehrmacht units and the rapidly advancing Red Army.\nReports of Soviet atrocities in the Nemmersdorf massacre of October 1944 and organized rape spread fear and desperation among the civilians. Thousands lost their lives during the sinkings (by Soviet submarine) of the evacuation ships \"Wilhelm Gustloff\", the \"Goya\", and the \"General von Steuben\". K\u00f6nigsberg surrendered on 9 April 1945, following the desperate four-day Battle of K\u00f6nigsberg. An estimated 300,000 died either in wartime bombing raids, in the battles to defend the province, or through mistreatment by the Red Army or from hunger, cold and disease.\nHowever, most of the German inhabitants, which then consisted primarily of women, children and old men, did manage to escape the Red Army as part of the largest exodus of people in human history: \"A population which had stood at 2.2 million in 1940 was reduced to 193,000 at the end of May 1945.\"\nHistory after partition and annexation.\nFollowing Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II in 1945, East Prussia was partitioned between Poland and the Soviet Union according to the Potsdam Conference, pending a final peace conference with Germany. Since a peace conference never took place, the region was effectively ceded by Germany. Southern East Prussia was placed under Polish administration, while northern East Prussia was divided between the Soviet republics of Russia (the Kaliningrad Oblast) and Lithuania (the constituent counties of the Klaip\u0117da Region). The city of K\u00f6nigsberg was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946. Most of the German population of the province had left during the evacuation at the end of the war, but several hundreds of thousands died during the years 1944\u201346 and the remainder was subsequently expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.\nExpulsion of Germans from East Prussia after World War II.\nShortly after the end of the war in May 1945, Germans who had fled in early 1945 tried to return to their homes in East Prussia. An estimated number of 800,000 Germans were living in East Prussia during the summer of 1945. Many more were prevented from returning, and the German population of East Prussia was almost completely expelled by the Communist regimes of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Poland. During the war and for some time thereafter 45 camps were established for about 200,000\u2013250,000 forced labourers, the vast majority of whom were deported to the interior of the newly proclaimed Kaliningrad Oblast, including the Gulag camp system. The largest camp with about 48,000 inmates was established at Deutsch Eylau (I\u0142awa). Orphaned children who were left behind in the zone occupied by the Soviet Union were referred to as Wolf children.\nSouthern East Prussia to Poland.\nRepresentatives of the Polish government officially took over the civilian administration of the southern part of East Prussia on 23 May 1945. Subsequently, Polish expatriates from Polish lands annexed by the Soviet Union as well as Ukrainians and Lemkos from southern Poland, expelled in Operation Vistula, were settled in the area, initially organised as the Masurian District, later replaced by the Olsztyn Voivodeship in 1947, with a few counties incorporated into Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship and to Gda\u0144sk Voivodeship. The latter counted in 1950 689,000 inhabitants, 22.6% of them coming from areas annexed by the Soviet Union, 10% Ukrainians, and 18.5% of them pre-war inhabitants. It was dissolved in 1975 to form three smaller units: a much smaller homonymous Olsztyn Voivodeship, the bulk of Elbl\u0105g Voivodeship and a significant part of the Suwa\u0142ki Voivodeship.\nThe remaining pre-war population was treated as Germanized Poles and a policy of re-Polonization was pursued throughout the country Most of these \"Autochthons\" chose to emigrate to West Germany from the 1950s through 1980s (between 1970 and 1988 55,227\u00a0persons from Warmia and Masuria moved to Western Germany). Local toponyms were Polonised by the Polish Commission for the Determination of Place Names, though in most cases it was a restoration of historic Polish names.\nOrigin of the post-war population.\nDuring the Polish post-war census of December 1950, data about the pre-war places of residence of the inhabitants as of August 1939 was collected. In case of children born between September 1939 and December 1950, their origin was reported based on the pre-war places of residence of their mothers. Thanks to this data it is possible to reconstruct the pre-war geographical origin of the post-war population. The same area corresponding to pre-war southern parts of East Prussia (which became Polish in 1945) was inhabited in December 1950 by:\nOver 80% of the 1950 inhabitants were new in the region, less than 20% had resided in the province already back in 1939 (so called autochthons, who had German citizenship before World War II and were granted Polish citizenship after 1945). Over 20% of all inhabitants were Poles expelled from areas of Eastern Poland annexed by the USSR. The rest were mostly people from neighbouring areas located right next to East Prussia (almost 44% came from Masovia, Sudovia, Podlachia and pre-war Polish Pomerania) and southern Poland (\u224816%).\nNorthern part to the Soviet Union.\nIn April 1946, northern East Prussia became an official province of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as the \"Kyonigsbergskaya Oblast\", with the Klaip\u0117da Region becoming part of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. In June 1946 114,070 German and 41,029 Soviet citizens were registered in the Oblast, with an unknown number of disregarded unregistered persons. In July of that year, the historic city of K\u00f6nigsberg was renamed Kaliningrad to honour Mikhail Kalinin and the area named the Kaliningrad Oblast. Between 24 August and 26 October 1948 21 transports with in total 42,094 Germans left the Oblast to the Soviet Occupation Zone (which became East Germany). The last remaining Germans left in November 1949 (1,401 persons) and January 1950 (7 persons).\nThe Prussian Lithuanians also experienced the same fate.\nA similar fate befell the Curonians who lived in the area around the Curonian Lagoon. While many fled from the Red Army during the evacuation of East Prussia, Curonians that remained behind were subsequently expelled by the Soviet Union. Only 219 lived along the Curonian Spit in 1955. Many had German names such as Fritz or Hans, a cause for anti-German discrimination. The Soviet authorities considered the Curonians fascists. Because of this discrimination, many immigrated to West Germany in 1958, where the majority of Curonians now live.\nAfter the expulsion of the German population ethnic Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians were settled in the northern part. In the Soviet part of the region, a policy of eliminating all remnants of German history was pursued. All German place names were replaced by new Russian names, with only a few instances of use of historical names, such as Domnovo and Talpaki, based on historical Polish names. The exclave was a military zone, which was closed to foreigners; Soviet citizens could only enter with special permission. In 1967 the remnants of K\u00f6nigsberg Castle were demolished on the orders of Leonid Brezhnev to make way for a new \"House of the Soviets\".\nModern status.\nAlthough the 1945\u20131949 expulsion of Germans from the northern part of former East Prussia was often conducted in a violent and aggressive way by Soviet officials, the present Russian inhabitants of the Kaliningrad Oblast have much less animosity towards Germans. German names have been revived in commercial Russian trade and there is sometimes talk of reverting Kaliningrad's name to its historical name of K\u00f6nigsberg. The city centre of Kaliningrad was completely rebuilt, as Royal Air Force bombs in 1944 and the Soviet siege in 1945 had left it in ruins.\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some German groups have tried to help settle the Volga Germans from eastern parts of European Russia in the Kaliningrad Oblast. This effort was only a minor success, however, as most impoverished Volga Germans preferred to emigrate to the richer Federal Republic of Germany, where they could become German citizens through the right of return.\nThe Polish part of the region, divided in 1975 to form three units: the Olsztyn Voivodeship, the Elbl\u0105g Voivodeship, and the Suwa\u0142ki Voivodeship, has been reestablished as a single entity in 1999 under the name of Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, whose borders correspond closely to those of southern East Prussia. Since 2004, Poland and Lithuania have become European Union member states, and both the Polish part of the region as well as the Lithuanian Klaip\u0117da Region, has thereafter become freely accessible by Germans, in line with the free movement of people policy.\nDemographics.\nHistorical ethnic and religious structure.\nIn year 1824, shortly before its merger with West Prussia, the population of East Prussia was 1,080,000 people. Of that number, according to Karl Andree, ethnic Germans were slightly more than half, while 280,000 (\u224826%) were ethnically Polish and 200,000 (\u224819%) were ethnically Lithuanian. As of year 1819, there were also 20,000 strong ethnic Curonian and Latvian minorities as well as 2,400 Jews, according to Georg Hassel. Similar numbers are given by August von Haxthausen in his 1839 book, with a breakdown by county. However, the majority of East Prussian Polish and Lithuanian inhabitants were Lutherans, not Roman Catholics like their ethnic kinsmen across the border in the Russian Empire. Only in southern Warmia Catholic Poles \u2013 so called Warmiaks (not to be confused with predominantly Protestant Masurians) \u2013 comprised the majority of population, numbering 26,067 people (\u224881%) in county Allenstein (Polish: Olsztyn) in 1837. Another minority in pre-war East Prussia were ethnically Russian Old Believers, also known as Philipponnen \u2013 their main town was Eckertsdorf (Wojnowo), in Sensburg district.\nIn year 1817, East Prussia had 796,204 Evangelical Christians, 120,123 Roman Catholics, 864 Mennonites and 2,389 Jews.\nThe Old Prussian language had become extinct by the 17th or early 18th century.\nEthnolinguistic composition by district.\nAs of 1905, the province of East Prussia was divided into three government regions, known as \"Regierungsbezirke.\" These were the regions of K\u00f6nigsberg, Gumbinnen and Allenstein.\nAdministration.\nThe Prussian central government appointed for every province an \"Oberpr\u00e4sident\" (\"Upper President\") carrying out central prerogatives on the provincial level and supervising the implementation of central policy on the lower levels of administration.\nSince 1875, with the strengthening of self-rule, the urban and rural districts (\"Kreise\") within each province (sometimes within each governorate) formed a corporation with common tasks and assets (schools, traffic installations, hospitals, cultural institutions, jails etc.) called the Provinzialverband (provincial association). Initially the assemblies of the urban and rural districts elected representatives for the provincial diets (\"Provinziallandtage\"), which were thus indirectly elected. As of 1919 the provincial diets (or as to governorate diets, the so-called Kommunallandtage) were directly elected by the citizens of the provinces (or governorates, respectively). These parliaments legislated within the competences transferred to the provincial associations. The provincial diet of East Prussia elected a provincial executive body (government), the provincial committee (\"Provinzialausschuss\"), and a head of province, the \"Landeshauptmann\" (\"Land Captain\"; till the 1880s titled Landdirektor, land director).\nUpper presidents of East Prussia and the Province of Prussia.\nThe office of \"Oberpr\u00e4sident\" (Upper President) served as the senior civil administrator in a Prussian province. Before 1815, similar duties were carried out by the presidents of the Gumbinnen and K\u00f6nigsberg War and Demesnes Chambers.

It was a part of the Province of West Prussia from 1815 to 1829, and again 1878\u20131920, belonging to the Province of Prussia in the intervening years, and to the Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia in the years 1939-1945. The regional capital was Marienwerder in West Prussia (now Kwidzyn).\nHistory.\nMost of Polish Royal Prussia was annexed by King Frederick the Great of Prussia in the 1772 First Partition of Poland. The town of Marienwerder, previously in Ducal Prussia, became an administrative capital of the newly acquired territory, which became the Province of West Prussia on 31 January 1773.\nWest Prussia was divided into the regions of Danzig and Marienwerder in 1815, following the Napoleonic Wars. While the governor and provincial authorities were based in Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), the provincial supreme court of Marienwerder (1772-1943) was in the homonymous town.\nFrom 1815 to 1818, West Prussia was reorganised into \"districts\" (or Kreise), within each government region. The Marienwerder Region included the rural districts (\"Kreise\") of Culm (1818-1920), Briesen (1887-1920), Deutsch-Krone (1772-1945), Flatow (1818-1945), Graudenz-Land (1818-1920), Konitz (1772-1920), L\u00f6bau in West Prussia (1818-1920), Marienwerder (1752-1945), Rosenberg in West Prussia (1818-1945), Schlochau (1818-1945), Schwetz (1818-1920), Strasburg in West Prussia (1818-1920), Stuhm (1818-1945), Thorn-Land (1818-1920), and Tuchel (1875-1920).\nUp until 1920, the Marienwerder Region comprised the urban districts (\"Stadtkreise\") of Graudenz (Grudzi\u0105dz) and Thorn (Toru\u0144), both established on 1 January 1900.\nThe Marienwerder Region was placed under an inter-Allied commission from 1920 to 1922 and was eventually divided, with the western districts included within the newly established Polish Republic as part of the so-called Polish Corridor. The eastern part of Marienwerder that voted to be incorporated within the Weimar Republic was named the Region of West Prussia () while it was joined to the Province of East Prussia from 1922 to 1939, after which the original Marienwerder Region was restored until its dissolution in 1945.\nDemographics.\nRegierungsbezirk Marienwerder had a majority German population, with a large Polish minority.\nRegional presidents.\nEach of the nineteen \"Regierungsbezirke\" featured a non-legislative governing body called a \"Regierungspr\u00e4sidium\" or \"Bezirksregierung\" (regional government) headed by a \"Regierungspr\u00e4sident\" (regional president), concerned mostly with applying state law to administrative decisions on municipalities within their jurisdiction and their umbrella organisations (the districts).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68747", "revid": "38056903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68747", "title": "Rioja DOCa", "text": "Spanish wine region\nRioja () is a wine region in Spain, with \"denominaci\u00f3n de origen calificada\" (D.O.Ca., 'Qualified Designation of Origin', the highest category in Spanish wine regulation). Rioja wine is made from grapes grown in the autonomous communities of La Rioja and Navarre, and the Basque province of \u00c1lava. Rioja is further subdivided into three zones: Rioja Alta, Rioja Oriental and Rioja Alavesa. Many wines have traditionally blended fruit from all three regions, though there is a slow growth in single-zone wines.\nSub-regions.\nRioja Alta.\nLocated on the western edge of the region and at higher elevations than the other areas, the Rioja Alta is known more for its \"old world\" style of wine. A higher elevation equates to a shorter growing season, which in turn produces brighter fruit flavors and a wine that is lighter on the palate.\nRioja Alavesa.\nThe region of Rioja Alavesa is in the province of \u00c1lava in the Basque Country, on the northern bank of the River Ebro. Despite sharing a similar climate as the Alta region, the Rioja Alavesa produces wines with a fuller body and higher acidity. Vineyards in the area have a low vine density with large spacing between rows. This is due to the relatively poor conditions of the soil with the vines needing more distance from each other and less competition for the nutrients in the surrounding soil.\nRioja Oriental (formerly Rioja Baja).\nUnlike the more continental climate of the Alta and Alavesa, the Rioja Oriental is strongly influenced by a Mediterranean climate which makes this area the warmest and driest of the Rioja. In the summer months, drought can be a significant viticultural hazard, though since the late 1990s irrigation has been permitted. Temperatures in the summer typically reach 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). A number of the vineyards are actually located in nearby Navarra but the wine produced from those grapes belongs to the Rioja appellation. Unlike the typically pale Rioja wine, Oriental wines are very deeply coloured and can be highly alcoholic. They typically do not have much acidity or aroma and are generally used as blending components with wines from other parts of the Rioja.\nGrapes.\nTraditional varieties.\nThe traditional varieties authorized by the Regulating Council of the D.O.Ca. Rioja since its foundation in 1925 have been seven, four red and three white:\nNew authorized varieties.\nIn 2007, the Regulating Council of the D.O.Ca. Rioja authorized, for the first time since 1925, the incorporation of some additional varieties within the limits of the denomination, changes that were reflected in two modifications of the existing Regulation approved in 2004: BOE-A-2008-4991 and BOE -A-2009-8950, but this has been subject to subsequent amendment.\nThe currently permitted additional varieties are the following:\nThese new authorized varieties can only be planted in substitution, so as not to increase the vegetable mass of the Denomination.\nIn the case of the new autochthonous varieties, both red and white, no limit is set on the percentage that the wines must carry, which is why the production of single varietal wines of these grapes is allowed. On the contrary, in the foreign white varieties (Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc and Verdejo) it is established that they can not be the predominant ones in the final composition of the wine. Therefore, if the varieties are indicated on the label, the autochthonous white variety (Viura, Garnacha blanca, Malvas\u00eda de Rioja, Maturana blanca, Tempranillo blanco or Turrunt\u00e9s) must always be listed first.\nThe incorporation of these new varieties was made with the aim of recovering Rioja's viticultural heritage, in the case of autochthonous grapes, and to increase the competitiveness of Rioja whites in the international market, in the case of foreign white varieties.\nCultivated area.\nThe area cultivated in 2018, in hectares, according to the grape varieties and by Autonomous Communities is as follows:\nAs can be seen, red grapes represent 90.85% and white grapes represent 9.15%.\nThe red grapes are distributed as follows: Tempranillo: 87.67%, Garnacha: 7.58%, Mazuelo: 2.07%, Graciano: 2.15%, Maturana tinta: 0.30% and others: 0.23%.\nThe percentage among whites is determined as follows: Viura: 69.17%, Malvasia: 2.22%, Garnacha blanca: 3.61%, Tempranillo blanco: 12.48%, Maturana blanca: 0.58%, Verdejo: 5, 44%, Turrunt\u00e9s: 0.08%, Chardonnay: 2.49%, Sauvignon Blanc: 3.31% and others: 0.61%.\nViticulture.\nThe pruning consists in forming the stump with three arms and two thumbs in each arm. Each thumb will have two buds from which the shoots will sprout. The grape harvest is done manually in the month of October. To ensure quality, the quantity is restricted to 6,500\u00a0kg / ha for red varieties and 9,000\u00a0kg / ha for white.\nProduction.\nProportion of varieties according to the type of wine.\nTraditionally, Rioja wine has been made by assembling different types of grape varieties, although nowadays it is also very common to find monovarietal wines.\nIn accordance with the Regulation of the D.O.Ca. Rioja (BOE-A-2004-1838410) and its latest modification (BOE-A-2009-895014), the different types of wine must use the authorised varieties in the following proportions:\nClassification.\nThe aging is carried out in 225-litre oak barrels for a period ranging from 1 to 3 years, and later in the bottle itself for a period of 6 months to 6 years.\nDepending on the time the wine remains in the barrel it is classified as:\nIn 2018, the Regulating Council released new classification rules for Rioja, in an attempt to encourage championship of regional microclimates and put a greater focus on singular vineyard sites. This amended system, similar to Burgundy grading, moves Rioja from being focused primarily on aging and oaking to a more all encompassing system inspecting the terroir of the wine \u2013 such as allowing labels to display the village or municipality of origin on the front label.\nCrop qualifications.\nThe harvest ratings of the D.O.Ca. Rioja granted by its Regulating Council since its founding in 1926 are the following:\nWinemaking and styles.\nA distinct characteristic of Rioja wine is the effect of oak aging. First introduced in the early 18th century by Bordeaux influenced winemakers, the use of oak and the pronounced vanilla flavors in the wines has been a virtual trademark of the region though some modern winemakers are experimenting with making wines less influenced by oak. Originally French oak was used but as the cost of the barrels increased many bodegas began to buy American oak planks and fashion them into barrels at Spanish cooperages in a style more closely resembling the French method. This included hand splitting the wood, rather than sawing, and allowing the planks time to dry and \"season\" in the outdoors versus drying in the kiln. In recent times, more bodegas have begun using French oak again and many will age wines in both American and French oak for blending purposes.\nIn the past, it was not uncommon for some bodegas to age their red wines for 15\u201320 years or even more before their release. One notable example of this the Marqu\u00e9s de Murrieta which released its 1942 vintage \"gran reserva\" in 1983 after 41 years of aging. Today most bodegas have shifted their winemaking focus to wines that are ready to drink sooner, with the top wines typically aging for 4\u20138 years prior to release, though some traditionalists still age longer. The typical bodega owns anywhere from 10,000 to 40,000 oak barrels.\nThe use of oak in white wine has declined significantly in recent times when before the norm was traditionally 2\u20135 years in oak. This created slightly oxidized wines with flavors of caramel, coffee, and roasted nuts that did not appeal to a large market of consumers with some of the more negative examples showing characteristics of rubber and petrol flavors. Today the focus of white wine makers has been to enhance the vibrancy and fruit flavors of the wine.\nSome winemakers utilize a derivative of carbonic maceration in which whole clusters are placed in large open vats and allowed to ferment inside the individual grape berries, without the addition of yeast, for a few days before they are crushed.\nIn the 1960s, Bodegas Rioja Santiago developed the first bottled version of the wine punch Sangr\u00eda, based on Rioja wine, and exhibited it at the 1964 New York World's Fair. An import subsidiary of Pepsi Cola purchased the rights to the wine and began marketing it worldwide.\nWineries.\nIn Spain, wineries are commonly referred to as \"bodegas\" though this term may also refer to a wine cellar or warehouse. For quite some time, the Rioja wine industry has been dominated by local family vineyards and co-operatives that have bought the grapes and make the wine. Some bodegas would buy fermented wine from the co-ops and age the wine to sell under their own label. In recent times there has been more emphasis on securing vineyard land and making estate bottled wines from the bodegas.\nCulture.\nLike most Spanish wine regions, Rioja is an integral part of Spanish culture and cuisine. In the town of Haro there is an annual Wine Festival that is noted for its \"Batalla de Vino\" where participants conduct a food fight of sorts with wine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The nature of that directedness has been conceptualized differently in various disciplines, ranging from philosophy to advertising. In cognitive psychology, attention has been described as the allocation of cognitive resources. In neuropsychology, attention involves a mechanism from sensory cues to neuronal tuning that orients behavioral and cognitive processes.\nAttention varies across cultures.\nHistory.\n16th century.\nJohn B. Watson calls Juan Luis Vives the father of modern psychology. In his book \"De Anima et Vita\", Vives found that the more closely one attends to stimuli, the better they will be retained.\n17th century.\nDaniel E. Berlyne credited the first extended treatment of attention to Nicolas Malebranche, for whom attention is necessary \"to keep our perceptions from being confused and imperfect\".\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz introduced the concept of apperception to this philosophical approach to attention. Apperception refers to \"the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole.\" Apperception is required for a perceived event to become a conscious event. Leibniz emphasized a reflexive involuntary view of attention known as exogenous orienting. However, there is also endogenous orienting which is voluntary and directed attention.\nJohann Friedrich Herbart agreed with Leibniz's view of apperception; however, he expounded on it in by saying that new experiences had to be tied to ones already existing in the mind. Herbart was also the first person to stress the importance of applying mathematical modeling to the study of psychology.\n19th century.\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, it was thought that people were not able to attend to more than one stimulus at a time. However, with research contributions by William Hamilton proposed a view of attention that likened its capacity to holding marbles. You can only hold a certain number of marbles at a time before it starts to spill over. His view states that we can attend to more than one stimulus at once. William Stanley Jevons later expanded this view and stated that we can attend to up to four items at a time.\nWilhelm Wundt introduced the study of attention to the field of psychology. Wundt measured mental processing speed by likening it to differences in stargazing measurements. Astronomers in this time would measure the time it took for stars to travel. Among these measurements when astronomers recorded the times, there were personal differences in calculation. These different readings resulted in different reports from each astronomer. To correct for this, a personal equation was developed. Wundt applied this to mental processing speed. Wundt realized that the time it takes to see the stimulus of the star and write down the time was being called an \"observation error\" but actually was the time it takes to switch voluntarily one's attention from one stimulus to another.\nFranciscus Donders used mental chronometry to study attention and it was considered a major field of intellectual inquiry by authors such as Sigmund Freud. Donders and his students conducted the first detailed investigations of the speed of mental processes. Donders measured the time required to identify a stimulus and to select a motor response. This was the time difference between stimulus discrimination and response initiation. Donders also formalized the subtractive method which states that the time for a particular process can be estimated by adding that process to a task and taking the difference in reaction time between the two tasks. He also differentiated between three types of reactions: simple reaction, choice reaction, and go/no-go reaction.\nHermann von Helmholtz also contributed to the field of attention relating to the extent of attention. Von Helmholtz stated that it is possible to focus on one stimulus and still perceive or ignore others. An example of this is being able to focus on the letter u in the word house and still perceiving the letters h, o, s, and e.\nOne major debate in this period was whether it was possible to attend to two things at once (split attention). William James, in his textbook \"The Principles of Psychology\", remarked:\nJames differentiated between sensorial attention and intellectual attention. Sensorial attention is when attention is directed to objects of sense, stimuli that are physically present. Intellectual attention is attention directed to ideal or represented objects; stimuli that are not physically present. James also distinguished between immediate or derived attention: attention to the present versus to something not physically present. According to James, attention has five major effects. Attention works to make us perceive, conceive, distinguish, remember, and shorten reactions time.\n20th century.\n1910\u20131949.\nDuring this period, research in attention waned and interest in behaviorism flourished, leading some to believe, like Ulric Neisser, that in this period, \"There was no research on attention\". However, Jersild published very important work on \"Mental Set and Shift\" in 1927. He stated, \"The fact of mental set is primary in all conscious activity. The same stimulus may evoke any one of a large number of responses depending upon the contextual setting in which it is placed\". This research found that the time to complete a list was longer for mixed lists than for pure lists. For example, if a list was names of animals versus a list of the same size with names of animals, books, makes and models of cars, and types of fruits, it takes longer to process the second list. This is task switching.\nIn 1931, C.W. Telford discovered the psychological refractory period. The stimulation of neurons is followed by a refractory phase during which neurons are less sensitive to stimulation.\nIn 1935, John Ridley Stroop developed a task showing that irrelevant stimulus information can have a major impact on performance.\n1950\u20131999.\nIn the 1950s, research psychologists renewed their interest in attention when the dominant epistemology shifted from positivism (i.e., behaviorism) to realism during what has come to be known as the \"cognitive revolution\". The cognitive revolution admitted unobservable cognitive processes like attention as legitimate objects of scientific study.\nModern research on attention began with the analysis of the \"cocktail party problem\" by Colin Cherry in 1953. At a cocktail party how do people select the conversation that they are listening to and ignore the rest? This problem is at times called \"focused attention\", as opposed to \"divided attention\". Cherry performed a number of experiments which became known as dichotic listening and were extended by Donald Broadbent and others. In a typical experiment, subjects would use a set of headphones to listen to two streams of words in different ears and selectively attend to one stream. After the task, the experimenter would question the subjects about the content of the unattended stream.\nBy the 1990s, psychologists began using positron emission tomography (PET) and later functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to image the brain while monitoring tasks involving attention. Considering this expensive equipment was generally only available in hospitals, psychologists sought cooperation with neurologists. Psychologist Michael Posner (then already renowned for his influential work on visual selective attention) and neurologist Marcus Raichle pioneered brain imaging studies of selective attention. Their results soon sparked interest from the neuroscience community, which until then had been focused on monkey brains. With the development of these technological innovations, neuroscientists became interested in this type of research that combines sophisticated experimental paradigms from cognitive psychology with these new brain imaging techniques. Although the older technique of electroencephalography (EEG) had long been used to study the brain activity underlying selective attention by cognitive psychophysiologists, the ability of the newer techniques to measure precisely localized activity inside the brain generated renewed interest by a wider community of researchers. A growing body of such neuroimaging research has identified a frontoparietal attention network which appears to be responsible for control of attention.\nComponents.\nAttention is conditioned by the number of elements and the duration of exposition. Decades of research on subitizing have supported Wundt's findings about the limits of a human ability to concentrate awareness on a task. The scope of attention is related to cognitive development. As the mind grasps more details about an event, it also increases the number of reasonable combinations within that event, enhancing the probability of better understanding its features and particularity. For example, three items in the focal point of consciousness have six possible combinations (3 factorial), and four items have 24 (4 factorial) combinations. This number of combinations becomes significantly prominent in the case of a focal point with six items with 720 possible combinations (6 factorial). Empirical evidence suggests that the scope of attention in young children develops from two items in the focal point at age up to six months to five or more items in the focal point at age about five years. As follows from the most recent studies in relation to teaching activities in school, \"attention\" should be understood as \"the state of concentration of an individual's consciousness on the process of selecting by his own psyche the information he requires and on the process of choosing an algorithm for response actions, which involves the intensification of sensory and intellectual activities\".\nIntentionality.\nA definition of a psychological construct forms a research approach to its study. In scientific works, attention often coincides and substitutes the notion of intentionality due to the extent of semantic uncertainty in the linguistic explanations of these notions' definitions. Intentionality has in turn been defined as \"the power of minds to be about something: to represent or to stand for things, properties and states of affairs\". Although these two psychological constructs (attention and intentionality) appear to be defined by similar terms, they are different notions. To clarify the definition of attention, it would be correct to consider the origin of this notion to review the meaning of the term given to it when the experimental study on attention was initiated. It is thought that the experimental approach began with famous experiments with a 4 x 4 matrix of sixteen randomly chosen letters \u2013 the experimental paradigm that informed Wundt's theory of attention. Wundt interpreted the experimental outcome introducing the meaning of attention as \"that psychical process, which is operative in the clear perception of the narrow region of the content of consciousness.\" These experiments showed the physical limits of attention threshold, which were 3-6 letters observing the matrix during 1/10 s of their exposition. \"We shall call the entrance into the large region of consciousness - apprehension, and the elevation into the focus of attention - apperception.\" Wundt's theory of attention postulated one of the main features of this notion that attention is an active, voluntary process realized during a certain time. In contrast, neuroscience research shows that intentionality may emerge instantly, even unconsciously; research reported to register neuronal correlates of an intentional act that preceded this conscious act (also see shared intentionality). Therefore, while intentionality is a mental state (\"the power of the mind to be about something\", arising even unconsciously), the description of the construct of attention should be understood in the dynamical sense as the ability to elevate the clear perception of the narrow region of the content of consciousness and to keep in mind this state for a time. The attention threshold would be the period of minimum time needed for employing perception to clearly apprehend the scope of intention. From this perspective, a scientific approach to attention is relevant when it considers the difference between these two concepts (first of all, between their statical and dynamical statuses).\nOrienting.\nOrienting attention can be controlled through external (exogenous) or internal (endogenous) processes. However, comparing these two processes is challenging because external signals do not operate completely exogenously, but will only summon attention and eye movements if they are important to the subject.\nExogenous orienting is frequently described as being under control of a stimulus. Exogenous orienting is considered to be reflexive and automatic and is caused by a sudden change in the periphery. This often results in a reflexive saccade. Since exogenous cues are typically presented in the periphery, they are referred to as \"peripheral cues\". Exogenous orienting can even be observed when individuals are aware that the cue will not relay reliable, accurate information about where a target is going to occur. This means that the mere presence of an exogenous cue will affect the response to other stimuli that are subsequently presented in the cue's previous location.\nSeveral studies have investigated the influence of valid and invalid cues. They concluded that valid peripheral cues benefit performance, for instance when the peripheral cues are brief flashes at the relevant location before the onset of a visual stimulus. Psychologists Michael Posner and Yoav Cohen (1984) noted a reversal of this benefit takes place when the interval between the onset of the cue and the onset of the target is longer than about 300 ms. The phenomenon of valid cues producing longer reaction times than invalid cues is called inhibition of return.\nEndogenous orienting is the intentional allocation of attentional resources to a predetermined location or space. Simply stated, endogenous orienting occurs when attention is oriented according to an observer's goals or desires, allowing the focus of attention to be manipulated by the demands of a task. In order to have an effect, endogenous cues must be processed by the observer and acted upon purposefully. These cues are frequently referred to as \"central cues\". This is because they are typically presented at the center of a display, where an observer's eyes are likely to be fixated. Central cues, such as an arrow or digit presented at fixation, tell observers to attend to a specific location.\nWhen examining differences between exogenous and endogenous orienting, some researchers suggest that there are four differences between the two kinds of cues: \nThere exist both overlaps and differences in the areas of the brain that are responsible for endogenous and exogenous orientating. Another approach to this discussion has been covered under the topic heading of \"bottom-up\" versus \"top-down\" orientations to attention. Researchers of this school have described two different aspects of how the mind focuses attention to items present in the environment. The first aspect is called bottom-up processing, also known as stimulus-driven attention or exogenous attention. These describe attentional processing which is driven by the properties of the objects themselves. Some processes, such as motion or a sudden loud noise, can attract our attention in a pre-conscious, or non-volitional way. We attend to them whether we want to or not. These aspects of attention are thought to involve parietal and temporal cortices, as well as the brainstem. More recent experimental evidence support the idea that the http:// creates a bottom-up saliency map, which is received by the superior colliculus in the midbrain area to guide attention or gaze shifts.\nThe second aspect is called top-down processing, also known as goal-driven, endogenous attention, attentional control or executive attention. This aspect of our attentional orienting is under the control of the person who is attending. It is mediated primarily by the frontal cortex and basal ganglia as one of the executive functions. Research has shown that it is related to other aspects of the executive functions, such as working memory, and conflict resolution and inhibition.\nLoad.\nSome people can process multiple stimuli, e.g. trained Morse code operators have been able to copy 100% of a message while carrying on a meaningful conversation. This relies on the reflexive response due to \"overlearning\" the skill of morse code reception/detection/transcription so that it is an autonomous function requiring no specific attention to perform. This overtraining of the brain comes as the \"practice of a skill [surpasses] 100% accuracy,\" allowing the activity to become autonomic, while your mind has room to process other actions simultaneously.\nBased on the primary role of the perceptual load theory, assumptions regarding its functionality surrounding that attentional resources are that of limited capacity which signify the need for all of the attentional resources to be used. This performance, however, is halted when put hand in hand with accuracy and reaction time (RT). This limitation arises through the measurement of literature when obtaining outcomes for scores. This affects both cognitive and perceptual attention because there is a lack of measurement surrounding distributions of temporal and spatial attention. Only a concentrated amount of attention on how effective one is completing the task and how long they take is being analyzed making a more redundant analysis on overall cognition of being able to process multiple stimuli through perception.\nNeural correlates.\nEric Knudsen identifies the fundamental components of attention: (a) working memory, (b) competitive selection, (c) top-down sensitivity control, and salience filters.\nNeurally, at different hierarchical levels spatial maps can enhance or inhibit activity in sensory areas, and induce orienting behaviors like eye movement.\nIn many cases attention produces changes in the EEG. Many animals, including humans, produce gamma waves (40\u201360\u00a0Hz) when focusing attention on a particular object or activity.\nAnother commonly used model for the attention system has been put forth by researchers such as Michael Posner. He divides attention into three functional components: alerting, orienting, and executive attention that can also interact and influence each other.\nTypes.\nVigilant.\nRemaining focused on a non-arousing stimulus or uninteresting task for a sustained period is far more difficult than attending to arousing stimuli and interesting tasks, and requires a specific type of attention called 'vigilant attention'. Thereby, vigilant attention is the ability to give sustained attention to a stimulus or task that might ordinarily be insufficiently engaging to prevent our attention being distracted by other stimuli or tasks. ===\nDivided.\nMultitasking can be defined as the attempt to perform two or more tasks simultaneously; however, research shows that when multitasking, people make more mistakes or perform their tasks more slowly. Attention must be divided among all of the component tasks to perform them. In divided attention, individuals attend or give attention to multiple sources of information at once or perform more than one task at the same time.\nOlder research involved looking at the limits of people performing simultaneous tasks like reading stories, while listening and writing something else, or listening to two separate messages through different ears (i.e., dichotic listening). Generally, classical research into attention investigated the ability of people to learn new information when there were multiple tasks to be performed, or to probe the limits of our perception (cf. Donald Broadbent). There is also older literature on people's performance on multiple tasks performed simultaneously, such as driving a car while tuning a radio or driving while being on the phone.\nThe vast majority of current research on human multitasking is based on performance of doing two tasks simultaneously, usually that involves driving while performing another task, such as texting, eating, or even speaking to passengers in the vehicle, or with a friend over a cellphone. This research reveals that the human attentional system has limits for what it can process: driving performance is worse while engaged in other tasks; drivers make more mistakes, brake harder and later, get into more accidents, veer into other lanes, and/or are less aware of their surroundings when engaged in the previously discussed tasks.\nThere has been little difference found between speaking on a hands-free cell phone or a hand-held cell phone, which suggests that it is the strain of attentional system that causes problems, rather than what the driver is doing with his or her hands. While speaking with a passenger is as cognitively demanding as speaking with a friend over the phone, passengers are able to change the conversation based upon the needs of the driver. For example, if traffic intensifies, a passenger may stop talking to allow the driver to navigate the increasingly difficult roadway; a conversation partner over a phone would not be aware of the change in environment.\nThere have been multiple theories regarding divided attention. One, conceived by cognitive scientist Daniel Kahneman, explains that there is a single pool of attentional resources that can be freely divided among multiple tasks. This model seems oversimplified, however, due to the different modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, verbal) that are perceived. When the two simultaneous tasks use the same modality, such as listening to a radio station and writing a paper, it is much more difficult to concentrate on both because the tasks are likely to interfere with each other. The specific modality model was theorized by cognitive psychologists David Navon and Daniel Gopher in 1979. However, more recent research using well controlled dual-task paradigms points at the importance of tasks.\nAs an alternative, resource theory has been proposed as a more accurate metaphor for explaining divided attention on complex tasks. Resource theory states that as each complex task is automatized, performing that task requires less of the individual's limited-capacity attentional resources. Other variables play a part in our ability to pay attention to and concentrate on many tasks at once. These include, but are not limited to, anxiety, arousal, task difficulty, and skills.\nSimultaneous.\nSimultaneous attention is a type of attention, classified by attending to multiple events at the same time. Simultaneous attention is demonstrated by children in Indigenous communities, who learn through this type of attention to their surroundings. Simultaneous attention is present in the ways in which children of indigenous backgrounds interact both with their surroundings and with other individuals. Simultaneous attention requires focus on multiple simultaneous activities or occurrences. This differs from multitasking, which is characterized by alternating attention and focus between multiple activities, or halting one activity before switching to the next.\nSimultaneous attention involves uninterrupted attention to several activities occurring at the same time. Another cultural practice that may relate to simultaneous attention strategies is coordination within a group. Indigenous heritage toddlers and caregivers in San Pedro were observed to frequently coordinate their activities with other members of a group in ways parallel to a model of simultaneous attention, whereas middle-class European-descent families in the U.S. would move back and forth between events. Research concludes that children with close ties to Indigenous American roots have a high tendency to be especially wide, keen observers. This points to a strong cultural difference in attention management.\nSocial.\nSocial attention involves the allocation of limited processing resources in a social context. Previous studies on social attention often regard how attention is directed toward socially relevant stimuli such as faces and gaze directions of other individuals. In contrast to attending-to-others, a different line of researches has shown that self-related information such as own face and name automatically captures attention and is preferentially processed comparing to other-related information. These contrasting effects between attending-to-others and attending-to-self prompt a synthetic view in a recent Opinion article proposing that social attention operates at two polarizing states: In one extreme, individual tends to attend to the self and prioritize self-related information over others', and, in the other extreme, attention is allocated to other individuals to infer their intentions and desires. Attending-to-self and attending-to-others mark the two ends of an otherwise continuum spectrum of social attention. For a given behavioral context, the mechanisms underlying these two polarities might interact and compete with each other in order to determine a saliency map of social attention that guides our behaviors. An imbalanced competition between these two behavioral and cognitive processes will cause cognitive disorders and neurological symptoms such as autism spectrum disorders and Williams syndrome.\nModels.\nClinical.\nIn cognitive psychology there are at least two models which describe how visual attention operates. These models may be considered metaphors which are used to describe internal processes and to generate hypotheses that are falsifiable. Generally speaking, visual attention is thought to operate as a two-stage process. In the first stage, attention is distributed uniformly over the external visual scene and processing of information is performed in parallel. In the second stage, attention is concentrated to a specific area of the visual scene (i.e., it is focused), and processing is performed in a serial fashion.\nIn the twentieth century, the pioneering research of Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria led to the three-part model of neuropsychology defining the working brain as being represented by three co-active processes listed as Attention, Memory, and Activation. A.R. Luria published his well-known book \"The Working Brain\" in 1973 as a concise adjunct volume to his previous 1962 book \"Higher Cortical Functions in Man\". In this volume, Luria summarized his three-part global theory of the working brain as being composed of three constantly co-active processes which he described as the; (1) Attention system, (2) Mnestic (memory) system, and (3) Cortical activation system. The two books together are considered by Homskaya's account as \"among Luria's major works in neuropsychology, most fully reflecting all the aspects (theoretical, clinical, experimental) of this new discipline.\" The product of the combined research of Vygotsky and Luria have determined a large part of the contemporary understanding and definition of attention as it is understood at the start of the 21st century.\nAttention is a very basic function that often is a precursor to all other neurological/cognitive functions. As is frequently the case, clinical models of attention differ from investigation models. One of the most used models for the evaluation of attention in patients with very different neurologic pathologies is the model of Sohlberg and Mateer. This hierarchic model is based in the recovering of attention processes of brain damage patients after coma. Five different kinds of activities of growing difficulty are described in the model; connecting with the activities those patients could do as their recovering process advanced.\nThis model has been shown to be very useful in evaluating attention in very different pathologies, correlates strongly with daily difficulties and is especially helpful in designing stimulation programs such as attention process training, a rehabilitation program for neurological patients of the same authors.\nFilter.\nBroadbent's Filter Model of Attention states that information is held in a pre-attentive temporary store, and only sensory events that have some physical feature in common are selected to pass into the limited capacity processing system. This implies that the meaning of unattended messages is not identified. Also, a significant amount of time is required to shift the filter from one channel to another. Experiments by Gray and Wedderburn and later Anne Treisman pointed out various problems in Broadbent's early model and eventually led to the Deutsch\u2013Norman model in 1968. In this model, no signal is filtered out, but all are processed to the point of activating their stored representations in memory. The point at which attention becomes \"selective\" is when one of the memory representations is selected for further processing. At any time, only one can be selected, resulting in the \"attentional bottleneck\".\nSelection.\nThis debate became known as the early-selection vs. late-selection models. In the early selection models (first proposed by Donald Broadbent), attention shuts down (in Broadbent's model) or attenuates (in Treisman's refinement) processing in the unattended ear before the mind can analyze its semantic content. In the late selection models (first proposed by J. Anthony Deutsch and Diana Deutsch), the content in both ears is analyzed semantically, but the words in the unattended ear cannot access consciousness. Lavie's perceptual load theory, however, \"provided elegant solution to\" what had once been a \"heated debate\".\nSpotlight.\nThe first of these models to appear in the literature is the spotlight model. The term \"spotlight\" was inspired by the work of William James, who described attention as having a focus, a margin, and a fringe. The focus is an area that extracts information from the visual scene with a high-resolution, the geometric center of which being where visual attention is directed. Surrounding the focus is the fringe of attention, which extracts information in a much more crude fashion (i.e., low-resolution). This fringe extends out to a specified area, and the cut-off is called the margin.\nZoom-lens.\nThe model and was first introduced in 1986. This model inherits all properties of the spotlight model (i.e., the focus, the fringe, and the margin), but it has the added property of changing in size. This size-change mechanism was inspired by the zoom lens one might find on a camera, and any change in size can be described by a trade-off in the efficiency of processing. The zoom-lens of attention can be described in terms of an inverse trade-off between the size of focus and the efficiency of processing: because attention resources are assumed to be fixed, then it follows that the larger the focus is, the slower processing will be of that region of the visual scene, since this fixed resource will be distributed over a larger area. It is thought that the focus of attention can subtend a minimum of 1\u00b0 of visual angle, however the maximum size has not yet been determined.\nTheories.\nAttentional engagement.\nThe attentional engagement theory posits that \"there is an initial pre-attentive parallel phase of perceptual segmentation and analysis that encompasses all of the visual items present in a scene. At this phase, descriptions of the objects in a visual scene are generated into structural units; the outcome of this parallel phase is a multiple-spatial-scale structured representation. Selective attention intervenes after this stage to select information that will be entered into visual short-term memory.\"\nCultural variation.\nChildren appear to develop patterns of attention related to the cultural practices of their families, communities, and the institutions in which they participate.\nIn 1955, Jules Henry suggested that there are societal differences in sensitivity to signals from many ongoing sources that call for the awareness of several levels of attention simultaneously. He tied his speculation to ethnographic observations of communities in which children are involved in a complex social community with multiple relationships.\nMany Indigenous children in the Americas predominantly learn by observing and pitching in. There are several studies to support that the use of keen attention towards learning is much more common in Indigenous Communities of North and Central America than in a middle-class European-American setting. This is a direct result of the observational learning model.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68754", "revid": "32990417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68754", "title": "Market failure", "text": "Inefficiently allocated markets\nIn neoclassical economics, market failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not Pareto efficient, often leading to a net loss of economic value. The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958, but the concept has been traced back to the Victorian writers John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick.\nMarket failures are often associated with public goods, time-inconsistent preferences, information asymmetries, failures of competition, principal\u2013agent problems, externalities, unequal bargaining power, behavioral irrationality (in behavioral economics), and macro-economic failures (such as unemployment and inflation).\nThe neoclassical school attributes market failures to the interference of self-regulatory organizations, governments or supra-national institutions in a particular market, although this view is criticized by heterodox economists. Economists, especially microeconomists, are often concerned with the causes of market failure and possible means of correction. Such analysis plays an important role in many types of public policy decisions and studies.\nHowever, government policy interventions, such as taxes, subsidies, wage and price controls, and regulations, may also lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, sometimes called government failure. Most mainstream economists believe that there are circumstances (like building codes, fire safety regulations or endangered species laws) in which it is possible for government or other organizations to improve the inefficient market outcome. Several heterodox schools of thought disagree with this as a matter of ideology.\nAn \"ecological\" market failure exists when human activity in a market economy is exhausting critical non-renewable resources, disrupting fragile ecosystems, or overloading biospheric waste absorption capacities. In none of these cases does the criterion of Pareto efficiency obtain.\nCategories.\nDifferent economists have different views about what events are the sources of market failure. Mainstream economic analysis widely accepts that a market failure in relation to several causes. These include if the market is \"monopolised\" or a small group of businesses hold significant market power resulting in a \"failure of competition\"; if production of the good or service results in an externality (external costs or benefits); if the good or service is a \"public good\"; if there is a \"failure of information\" or information asymmetry; if there is unequal bargaining power; if there is bounded rationality or irrationality; and if there are macro-economic failures such as unemployment or inflation.\nFailure of competition.\nAgents in a market can gain market power, allowing them to block other mutually beneficial gains from trade from occurring. This can lead to inefficiency due to imperfect competition, which can take many different forms, such as monopolies, monopsonies, or monopolistic competition, if the agent does not implement perfect price discrimination.\nIt is then a further question about what circumstances allow a monopoly to arise. In some cases, monopolies can maintain themselves where there are \"barriers to entry\" that prevent other companies from effectively entering and competing in an industry or market. Or there could exist significant first-mover advantages in the market that make it difficult for other firms to compete. Moreover, monopoly can be a result of geographical conditions created by huge distances or isolated locations. This leads to a situation where there are only few communities scattered across a vast territory with only one supplier. Australia is an example that meets this description. A natural monopoly is a firm whose per-unit cost decreases as it increases output; in this situation it is most efficient (from a cost perspective) to have only a single producer of a good. Natural monopolies display so-called increasing returns to scale. It means that at all possible outputs marginal cost needs to be below average cost if average cost is declining. One of the reasons is the existence of fixed costs, which must be paid without considering the amount of output, what results in a state where costs are evenly divided over more units leading to the reduction of cost per unit.\nPublic goods.\nSome markets can fail due to the nature of the goods being exchanged. For instance, some goods can display the attributes of public goods or common goods, wherein sellers are unable to exclude non-buyers from using a product, as in the development of inventions that may spread freely once revealed, such as developing a new method of harvesting. This can cause underinvestment because developers cannot capture enough of the benefits from success to make the development effort worthwhile. This can also lead to resource depletion in the case of common-pool resources, whereby the use of the resource is rival but non-excludable, there is no incentive for users to conserve the resource. An example of this is a lake with a natural supply of fish: if people catch the fish faster than the fish can reproduce, then the fish population will dwindle until there are no fish left for future generations.\nExternalities.\nA good or service could also have significant externalities, where gains or losses associated with the product, production or consumption of a product, differ from the private cost. These gains or losses are imposed on a third-party that did not take part in the original market transaction. These externalities can be innate to the methods of production or other conditions important to the market.\n\"The Problem of Social Cost\" illuminates a different path towards social optimum showing the Pigouvian tax is not the only way towards solving externalities. It is hard to say who discovered externalities first since many classical economists saw the importance of education or a lighthouse, but it was Alfred Marshall who wanted to explore this more. He wondered why long-run supply curve under perfect competition could be decreasing so he founded \"external economies\" (). Externalities can be positive or negative depending on how a good/service is produced or what the good/service provides to the public. Positive externalities tend to be goods like vaccines, schools, or advancement of technology. They usually provide the public with a positive gain. Negative externalities would be like noise or air pollution. Coase shows this with his example of the case \"Sturges v. Bridgman\" involving a confectioner and doctor. The confectioner had lived there many years and soon the doctor several years into residency decides to build a consulting room; it is right by the confectioner's kitchen which releases vibrations from his grinding of pestle and mortar ( ). The doctor wins the case by a claim of nuisance so the confectioner would have to cease from using his machine. Coase argues there could have been bargains instead the confectioner could have paid the doctor to continue the source of income from using the machine hopefully it is more than what the Doctor is losing ( ). Vice versa the doctor could have paid the confectioner to cease production since he is prohibiting a source of income from the confectioner. Coase used a few more examples similar in scope dealing with social cost of an externality and the possible resolutions.\nTraffic congestion is an example of market failure that incorporates both non-excludability and externality. Public roads are common resources that are available for the entire population's use (non-excludable), and act as a complement to cars (the more roads there are, the more useful cars become). Because there is very low cost but high benefit to individual drivers in using the roads, the roads become congested, decreasing their usefulness to society. Furthermore, driving can impose hidden costs on society through pollution (externality). Solutions for this include public transportation, congestion pricing, tolls, and other ways of making the driver include the social cost in the decision to drive.\nPerhaps the best example of the inefficiency associated with common/public goods and externalities is the environmental harm caused by pollution and overexploitation of natural resources.\nCoase theorem.\nThe Coase theorem, developed by Ronald Coase and labeled as such by George Stigler, states that private transactions are efficient as long as property rights exist, only a small number of parties are involved, and transactions costs are low. Additionally, this efficiency will take place regardless of who owns the property rights. This theory comes from a section of Coase's Nobel prize-winning work \"The Problem of Social Cost\". While the assumptions of low transactions costs and a small number of parties involved may not always be applicable in real-world markets, Coase's work changed the long-held belief that the owner of property rights was a major determining factor in whether or not a market would fail. The Coase theorem points out when one would expect the market to function properly even when there are externalities.\nA market is an institution in which individuals or firms exchange not just commodities, but the \"rights\" to use them in particular ways for particular amounts of time. [...] Markets are institutions which organize the \"exchange of control\" of commodities, where the nature of the control is defined by the property rights attached to the commodities.\nAs a result, agents' control over the uses of their goods and services can be imperfect, because the system of rights which defines that control is incomplete. Typically, this falls into two generalized rights \u2013 \"excludability\" and \"transferability\". Excludability deals with the ability of agents to control who uses their commodity, and for how long \u2013 and the related costs associated with doing so. Transferability reflects the right of agents to transfer the rights of use from one agent to another, for instance by selling or leasing a commodity, and the costs associated with doing so. If a given system of rights does not fully guarantee these at minimal (or no) cost, then the resulting distribution can be inefficient. Considerations such as these form an important part of the work of institutional economics. Nonetheless, views still differ on whether something displaying these attributes is meaningful without the information provided by the market price system.\nInformation failures.\ninformational asymmetry is considered a leading type of market failure. This is where there is an imbalance of information between two or more parties to a transaction. One example is incomplete markets, for example where second hand car buyers know there is a risk a car may break down, and systematically under-pay to discount this risk: this leads to fewer cars being sold overall; or where insurers know that some policyholders will withhold information, and systematically refuse to insure certain groups because of this risk. This may result in economic inefficiency, but also have a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies. From contract theory, decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other is considered \"asymmetry\". This creates an imbalance of power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry. Examples of this problem are adverse selection and moral hazard. Most commonly, information asymmetries are studied in the context of principal\u2013agent problems. George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz developed the idea and shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics.\nUnequal bargaining power.\nIn \"The Wealth of Nations\" Adam Smith explored how an employer had the ability to \"hold out\" longer in a dispute over pay with workers because workers were more likely to go hungry more quickly, given that the employer has more property, and have fewer obstacles in organising. Unequal bargaining power has been used as a concept justifying economic regulation, particularly for employment, consumer, and tenancy rights since the early 20th century. Thomas Piketty in \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century\" explains how unequal bargaining power undermines \"conditions of \"pure and perfect\" competition\" and leads to a persistently lower share of income for labor, and leads to growing inequality. While it was argued by Ronald Coase that bargaining power merely affects distribution of income, but not productive efficiency, the modern behavioural evidence establishes that distribution or fairness of exchange does affect motivation to work, and therefore unequal bargaining power is a market failure. Notably, the price of labour was excluded from the scope of the original charts on supply and demand by their inventor, Fleeming Jenkin, who considered that the wages of labour could not be equated with ordinary markets for commodities such as corn, because of labour's unequal bargaining power.\nBounded rationality.\nIn \"Models of Man\", Herbert A. Simon points out that most people are only partly rational, and are emotional/irrational in the remaining part of their actions. In another work, he states \"boundedly rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving complex problems and in processing (receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) information\" (Williamson, p.\u00a0553, citing Simon). Simon describes a number of dimensions along which \"classical\" models of rationality can be made somewhat more realistic, while sticking within the vein of fairly rigorous formalization. These include:\nSimon suggests that economic agents employ the use of heuristics to make decisions rather than a strict rigid rule of optimization. They do this because of the complexity of the situation, and their inability to process and compute the expected utility of every alternative action. Deliberation costs might be high and there are often other, concurrent economic activities also requiring decisions.\nThe concept of bounded rationality was significantly expanded through behavioral economics research, suggesting that people are systematically irrational in day to day decisions. Daniel Kahneman in \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" explored how human beings operate as if they have two systems of thinking: a fast \"system 1\" mode of thought for snap, everyday decisions which applies rules of thumb but is frequently mistaken; and a slow \"system 2\" mode of thought that is careful and deliberative, but not as often used in making ordinary decisions to buy and sell or do business.\nMacro-economic failures.\n\"Unemployment, inflation and \"disequilibrium\" are considered a category of market failure at a \"macro economic\" or \"whole economy\" level. These symptoms (of high job loss, or fast rising prices or both) can result from a financial crash, a recession or depression, and the market failure is evident in the sustained underproduction of an economy, or a tendency not to recover immediately. Macroeconomic business cycles are a part of the market. They are characterized by constant downswings and upswings which influence economic activity. Therefore, this situation requires some kind of government intervention.\nPersistent labor shortages.\nWidespread and persistent domestic labour shortages in various countries are examples of market failure, whereby excessively low salaries (relative to the domestic cost of living) and adverse working conditions (excessive workload and working hours) in low-wage industries (hospitality and leisure, education, health care, rail transportation, warehousing, aviation, retail, manufacturing, food, construction, elderly care), collectively lead to occupational burnout and attrition of existing workers, insufficient incentives to attract the inflow supply of domestic workers, short-staffing and regular shift work at workplaces and further exacerbation (positive feedback) of staff shortages. Poor job quality and artificial shortages perpetuated by salary-paying employers, deter workers from entering or remaining in these roles.\nLabour shortages occur broadly across multiple industries within a rapidly expanding economy, whilst labour shortages often occur within specific industries (which generally offer low salaries) even during economic periods of high unemployment. In response to domestic labour shortages, business associations such as chambers of commerce, trade associations or employers' organizations would generally lobby to governments for an increase of the inward immigration of foreign workers from countries which are less developed and have lower salaries. In addition, business associations have campaigned for greater state provision of child care, which would enable more women to re-enter the labour workforce at a lower wage rate to achieve economic equilibrium. However, as labour shortages in the relevant low-wage industries are often widespread globally throughout many countries in the world, immigration would only partially address the chronic labour shortages in the relevant low-wage industries in developed countries (whilst simultaneously discouraging local labour from entering the relevant industries) and in turn cause greater labour shortages in developing countries.\nInterpretations and policy examples.\nThe above causes represent the mainstream view of what market failures mean and of their importance in the economy. This analysis follows the lead of the neoclassical school, and relies on the notion of Pareto efficiency, which can be in the \"public interest\", as well as in interests of stakeholders with equity. This form of analysis has also been adopted by the Keynesian or new Keynesian schools in modern macroeconomics, applying it to Walrasian models of general equilibrium in order to deal with failures to attain full employment, or the non-adjustment of prices and wages.\nPolicies to prevent market failure are already commonly implemented in the economy. For example, to prevent information asymmetry, members of the New York Stock Exchange agree to abide by its rules in order to promote a fair and orderly market in the trading of listed securities. The members of the NYSE presumably believe that each member is individually better off if every member adheres to its rules \u2013 even if they have to forego money-making opportunities that would violate those rules.\nA simple example of policies to address market power is government antitrust policies. As an additional example of externalities, municipal governments enforce building codes and license tradesmen to mitigate the incentive to use cheaper (but more dangerous) construction practices, ensuring that the total cost of new construction includes the (otherwise external) cost of preventing future tragedies. The voters who elect municipal officials presumably feel that they are individually better off if everyone complies with the local codes, even if those codes may increase the cost of construction in their communities.\nCITES is an international treaty to protect the world's common interest in preserving endangered species \u2013 a classic \"public good\" \u2013 against the private interests of poachers, developers and other market participants who might otherwise reap monetary benefits without bearing the known and unknown costs that extinction could create. Even without knowing the true cost of extinction, the signatory countries believe that the societal costs far outweigh the possible private gains that they have agreed to forego.\nSome remedies for market failure can resemble other market failures. For example, the issue of systematic underinvestment in research is addressed by the patent system that creates artificial monopolies for successful inventions.\nObjections.\nPublic choice.\nEconomists such as Milton Friedman from the Chicago school and others from the Public Choice school, argue that market failure does not necessarily imply that the government should attempt to solve market failures, because the costs of government failure might be worse than those of the market failure it attempts to fix. This failure of government is seen as the result of the inherent problems of democracy and other forms of government perceived by this school and also of the power of special-interest groups (rent seekers) both in the private sector and in the government bureaucracy. Conditions that many would regard as negative are often seen as an effect of subversion of the free market by coercive government intervention. Beyond philosophical objections, a further issue is the practical difficulty that any single decision maker may face in trying to understand (and perhaps predict) the numerous interactions that occur between producers and consumers in any market.\nAustrian.\nSome advocates of \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, including many economists of the Austrian School, argue that there is no such phenomenon as \"market failure\". Israel Kirzner states that, \"Efficiency for a social system means the efficiency with which it permits its individual members to achieve their individual goals.\" Inefficiency only arises when means are chosen by individuals that are inconsistent with their desired goals. This definition of efficiency differs from that of Pareto efficiency, and forms the basis of the theoretical argument against the existence of market failures. However, providing that the conditions of the first welfare theorem are met, these two definitions agree, and give identical results. Austrians argue that the market tends to eliminate its inefficiencies through the process of entrepreneurship driven by the profit motive; something the government has great difficulty detecting, or correcting.\nMarxian.\nObjections also exist on more fundamental bases, such as Marxian analysis. Colloquial uses of the term \"market failure\" reflect the notion of a market \"failing\" to provide some desired attribute different from efficiency \u2013 for instance, high levels of inequality can be considered a \"market failure\", yet are not Pareto inefficient, and so would not be considered a market failure by mainstream\neconomics. In addition, many Marxian economists would argue that the system of private property rights is a fundamental problem in itself, and that resources should be allocated in another way entirely. This is different from concepts of \"market failure\" which focuses on specific situations \u2013 typically seen as \"abnormal\" \u2013 where markets have inefficient outcomes. Marxists, in contrast, would say that markets have inefficient and democratically unwanted outcomes \u2013 viewing market failure as an inherent feature of any capitalist economy \u2013 and typically omit it from discussion, preferring to ration finite goods not exclusively through a price mechanism, but based upon need as determined by society expressed through the community.\nEcological.\nIn ecological economics, the concept of externalities is considered a misnomer, since market agents are viewed as making their incomes and profits by systematically 'shifting' the social and ecological costs of their activities onto other agents, including future generations. Hence, externalities is a \"modus operandi\" of the market, not a failure: The market cannot exist without constantly 'failing'.\nThe fair and even allocation of non-renewable resources over time is a market failure issue of concern to ecological economics. This issue is also known as 'intergenerational fairness'. It is argued that the market mechanism fails when it comes to allocating the Earth's finite mineral stock fairly and evenly among present and future generations, as future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market. In effect, today's market prices do not, and cannot, reflect the preferences of the yet unborn. This is an instance of a market failure passed unrecognized by most mainstream economists, as the concept of Pareto efficiency is entirely static (timeless). Imposing government restrictions on the general level of activity in the economy may be the only way of bringing about a more fair and even intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock. Hence, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly, the two leading theorists in the field, have both called for the imposition of such restrictions: Georgescu-Roegen has proposed a minimal bioeconomic program, and Daly has proposed a comprehensive steady-state economy. However, Georgescu-Roegen, Daly, and other economists in the field agree that on a finite Earth, geologic limits will inevitably strain most fairness in the longer run, regardless of any present government restrictions: \"Any\" rate of extraction and use of the finite stock of non-renewable mineral resources will diminish the remaining stock left over for future generations to use. \nAnother ecological market failure is presented by the overutilisation of an otherwise renewable resource at a point in time, or within a short period of time. Such overutilisation usually occurs when the resource in question has poorly defined (or non-existing) property rights attached to it while too many market agents engage in activity simultaneously for the resource to be able to sustain it all. Examples range from over-fishing of fisheries and over-grazing of pastures to over-crowding of recreational areas in congested cities. This type of ecological market failure is generally known as the 'tragedy of the commons'. In this type of market failure, the principle of Pareto efficiency is violated the utmost, as \"all\" agents in the market are left worse off, while nobody are benefitting. It has been argued that the best way to remedy a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure is to establish enforceable property rights politically \u2013 only, this may be easier said than done.\nThe issue of climate change presents an overwhelming example of a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure: The Earth's atmosphere may be regarded as a 'global common' exhibiting poorly defined (non-existing) property rights, and the waste absorption capacity of the atmosphere with regard to carbon dioxide is presently being heavily overloaded by a large volume of emissions from the world economy. Historically, the fossil fuel dependence of the Industrial Revolution has unintentionally thrown mankind out of ecological equilibrium with the rest of the Earth's biosphere (including the atmosphere), and the market has failed to correct the situation ever since. Quite the opposite: The unrestricted market has been exacerbating this global state of ecological \"dis\"-equilibrium, and is expected to continue doing so well into the foreseeable future. This particular market failure may be remedied to some extent at the political level by the establishment of an international (or regional) cap and trade property rights system, where carbon dioxide emission permits are bought and sold among market agents.\nThe term 'uneconomic growth' describes a pervasive ecological market failure: The ecological costs of further economic growth in a so-called 'full-world economy' like the present world economy may exceed the immediate social benefits derived from this growth.\nZerbe and McCurdy.\nZerbe and McCurdy connected criticism of market failure paradigm to transaction costs. Market failure paradigm is defined as follows:\n\"A fundamental problem with the concept of market failure, as economists occasionally recognize, is that it describes a situation that exists everywhere.\"\nTransaction costs are part of each market exchange, although the price of transaction costs is not usually determined. They occur everywhere and are unpriced. Consequently, market failures and externalities can arise in the economy every time transaction costs arise. There is no place for government intervention. Instead, government should focus on the elimination of both transaction costs and costs of provision.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As such, they are considered part of the human digestive system. Humans have four types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, which each have a specific function. The incisors cut the food, the canines tear the food and the molars and premolars crush the food. The roots of teeth are embedded in the maxilla (upper jaw) or the mandible (lower jaw) and are covered by gums. Teeth are made of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness.\nHumans, like most other mammals, are diphyodont, meaning that they develop two sets of teeth. The first set, deciduous teeth, also called \"primary teeth\", \"baby teeth\", or \"milk teeth\", normally eventually contains 20 teeth. Primary teeth typically start to appear (\"erupt\") around six months of age and this may be distracting and/or painful for the infant. However, some babies are born with one or more visible teeth, known as neonatal teeth or \"natal teeth\".\nStructure.\nDental anatomy is dedicated to the study of tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify and describe teeth and structures during treatment.\nThe anatomic crown of a tooth is the area covered in enamel above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) or \"neck\" of the tooth. Most of the crown is composed of dentin (\"dentine\" in British English) with the pulp chamber inside. The crown is within bone before eruption. After eruption, it is almost always visible. The anatomic root is found below the CEJ and is covered with cementum. As with the crown, dentin composes most of the root, which normally has pulp canals. Canines and most premolars, except for maxillary first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and mandibular molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Additional roots are referred to as supernumerary roots.\nHumans usually have 20 primary (deciduous, \"baby\" or \"milk\") teeth and 32 permanent (adult) teeth. Teeth are classified as incisors, canines, premolars (also called \"bicuspids\"), and molars. Incisors are primarily used for cutting, canines are for tearing, and molars serve for grinding.\nMost teeth have identifiable features that distinguish them from others. There are several different notation systems to refer to a specific tooth. The three most common systems are the FDI World Dental Federation notation (ISO 3950), the Universal Numbering System, and the Palmer notation. The FDI system is used worldwide, the Universal only in the United States, while the older Palmer notation still has some adherents only in the United Kingdom.\nPrimary teeth.\nAmong deciduous (primary) teeth, ten are found in the maxilla (upper jaw) and ten in the mandible (lower jaw), for a total of 20. The dental formula for primary teeth in humans is 2.1.0.22.1.0.2.\nIn the primary set of teeth, in addition to the canines there are two types of incisors\u2014centrals and laterals\u2014and two types of molars\u2014first and second. All primary teeth are normally later replaced with their permanent counterparts.\nPermanent teeth.\nAmong permanent teeth, 16 are found in the maxilla and 16 in the mandible, for a total of 32. The dental formula is 2.1.2.32.1.2.3. Permanent human teeth are numbered in a boustrophedonic sequence.\nThe maxillary teeth are the maxillary central incisors (teeth 8 and 9 in the diagram), maxillary lateral incisors (7 and 10), maxillary canines (6 and 11), maxillary first premolars (5 and 12), maxillary second premolars (4 and 13), maxillary first molars (3 and 14), maxillary second molars (2 and 15), and maxillary third molars (1 and 16). The mandibular teeth are the mandibular central incisors (24 and 25), mandibular lateral incisors (23 and 26), mandibular canines (22 and 27), mandibular first premolars (21 and 28), mandibular second premolars (20 and 29), mandibular first molars (19 and 30), mandibular second molars (18 and 31), and mandibular third molars (17 and 32). Third molars are commonly called \"wisdom teeth\" and usually emerge at ages 17 to 25. These molars may never erupt into the mouth or form at all. When they do form, they often must be removed. If any additional teeth form\u2014for example, fourth and fifth molars, which are rare\u2014they are referred to as supernumerary teeth (hyperdontia). Development of fewer than the usual number of teeth is called hypodontia.\nThere are small differences between the teeth of males and females, with male teeth along with the male jaw tending to be larger on average than female teeth and jaw. There are also differences in the internal dental tissue proportions, with male teeth consisting of proportionately more dentin while female teeth have proportionately more enamel.\nParts.\nEnamel.\nEnamel is the hardest and most highly mineralized substance of the body. It has its origin from oral ectoderm. It is one of the four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.\nEnamel's primary mineral is hydroxyapatite, which is a crystalline calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts not only for its strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions. In rare circumstances enamel can fail to form, leaving the underlying dentin exposed on the surface.\nDentin.\nDentin is the substance between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin is known as dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.\nDentin is a mineralized connective tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 \u03bcm near the pulp, to 1.2 \u03bcm in the midportion, and 900\u00a0nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although they may have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.\nThere are three types of dentin, primary, secondary and tertiary. Secondary dentin is a layer of dentin produced after root formation and continues to form with age. Tertiary dentin is created in response to stimulus, such as cavities and tooth wear.\nCementum.\nCementum is a specialized bone-like substance covering the root of a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cement to enamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 of the root apex.\nDental pulp.\nThe dental pulp is the central part of the tooth filled with soft connective tissue. This tissue contains blood vessels and nerves that enter the tooth from a hole at the apex of the root. Along the border between the dentin and the pulp are odontoblasts, which initiate the formation of dentin. Other cells in the pulp include fibroblasts, preodontoblasts, macrophages and T lymphocytes. The pulp is commonly called \"the nerve\" of the tooth.\nDevelopment.\nTooth development is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their development is largely the same as in humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form in the development of the embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.\nA significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first pharyngeal arch that is necessary for the development of teeth.\nTooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.\nThe tooth bud (sometimes called the tooth germ) is an aggregation of cells that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental follicle. The \"enamel organ\" is composed of the outer enamel epithelium, inner enamel epithelium, stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium. These cells give rise to ameloblasts, which produce enamel and the reduced enamel epithelium. The growth of cervical loop cells into the deeper tissues forms Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath, which determines a tooth's root shape. The \"dental papilla\" contains cells that develop into odontoblasts, which are dentin-forming cells. Additionally, the junction between the dental papilla and inner enamel epithelium determines the crown shape of a tooth. The \"dental follicle\" gives rise to three important cells: cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the alveolar bone around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the periodontal ligaments which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum.\nEruption.\nTooth eruption in humans is a process in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments play an important role in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.\nThere have been many theories about the cause of tooth eruption. One theory proposes that the developing root of a tooth pushes it into the mouth. Another, known as the cushioned hammock theory, resulted from microscopic study of teeth, which was thought to show a ligament around the root. It was later discovered that the \"ligament\" was merely an artifact created in the process of preparing the slide. Currently, the most widely held belief is that the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process.\nThe onset of primary tooth loss has been found to correlate strongly with somatic and psychological criteria of school readiness.\nSupporting structures.\nThe periodontium is the supporting structure of a tooth, helping to attach the tooth to surrounding tissues and to allow sensations of touch and pressure. It consists of the cementum, periodontal ligaments, alveolar bone, and gingiva. Of these, cementum is the only one that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an alveolus, or \"socket\". Lying over the bone is the gingiva or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.\nPeriodontal ligaments.\nThe periodontal ligament is a specialized connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers the root of the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15\u20130.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.\nAlveolar bone.\nThe alveolar bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone in the human body, alveolar bone is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.\nGingiva.\nThe gingiva (\"gums\") is the mucosal tissue that overlays the jaws. There are three different types of epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.\nTooth decay.\nPlaque.\nPlaque is a biofilm consisting of large quantities of various bacteria that form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming \"tartar\". The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. \"Streptococcus mutans\" is the most important bacterium associated with dental caries.\nCertain bacteria in the mouth live off the remains of foods, especially sugars and starches. In the absence of oxygen they produce lactic acid, which dissolves the calcium and phosphorus in the enamel. This process, known as \"demineralisation\", leads to tooth destruction. Saliva gradually neutralises the acids, which causes the pH of the tooth surface to rise above the critical pH, typically considered to be 5.5. This causes remineralisation, the return of the dissolved minerals to the enamel. If there is sufficient time between the intake of foods then the impact is limited and the teeth can repair themselves. Saliva is unable to penetrate through plaque, however, to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria.\nCaries (cavities).\nDental caries (cavities), described as \"tooth decay\", is an infectious disease which damages the structures of teeth. The disease can lead to pain, tooth loss, and infection. Dental caries has a long history, with evidence showing the disease was present in the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Middle Ages but also prior to the Neolithic period. The largest increases in the prevalence of caries have been associated with diet changes. Today, caries remains one of the most common diseases throughout the world. In the United States, dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, being at least five times more common than asthma. Countries that have experienced an overall decrease in cases of tooth decay continue to have a disparity in the distribution of the disease. Among children in the United States and Europe, 60\u201380% of cases of dental caries occur in 20% of the population.\nTooth decay is caused by certain types of acid-producing bacteria which cause the most damage in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventive and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.\nTooth care.\nOral hygiene.\nOral hygiene is the practice of keeping the mouth clean and is a means of preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.\nThe purpose of cleaning teeth is to remove plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) in order to prevent formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.\nElectric toothbrushes are a popular aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, and with good motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: \"Electric toothbrushes tend to help people who are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems.\" The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\nProtective treatments.\nFluoride therapy is often recommended to protect against dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.\nDental sealants are another preventive therapy often used to provide a barrier to bacteria and decay on the surface of teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in a procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.\nRestorations.\nAfter a tooth has been damaged or destroyed, restoration of the missing structure can be achieved with a variety of treatments. Restorations may be created from a variety of materials, including glass ionomer, amalgam, gold, porcelain, and composite. Small restorations placed inside a tooth are referred to as \"intracoronal restorations\". These restorations may be formed directly in the mouth or may be cast using the lost-wax technique, such as for some inlays and onlays. When larger portions of a tooth are lost, an \"extracoronal restoration\" may be fabricated, such as an artificial crown or a veneer, to restore the involved tooth.\nWhen a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or implants may be used as replacements. Dentures are usually the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants may be used as support.\nAbnormalities.\nTooth abnormalities may be categorized according to whether they have environmental or developmental causes. While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may not appear to be any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.\nEnvironmental.\nAlteration during tooth development.\nTooth abnormalities caused by environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia is a condition in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate. This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency than the rest of the tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, congenital syphilis), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad. Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.\nDestruction after development.\nTooth destruction from processes other than dental caries is considered a normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension on one side of the tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.\nDiscoloration.\nDiscoloration of teeth may result from bacteria stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods with an abundance of chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.\nAlteration of eruption.\nTooth eruption may be altered by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth is said to be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.\nA technique for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists who wish to delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots of the permanent tooth are more than &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.\nDevelopmental.\nAbnormality in number.\nSome systemic disorders which may result in hyperdontia include Apert syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis, Crouzon syndrome, Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, Gardner's syndrome, and Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome. Some systemic disorders which may result in hypodontia include Crouzon syndrome, Ectodermal dysplasia, Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome.\nAbnormality in size.\nMicrodontia of a single tooth is more likely to occur in a maxillary lateral incisor. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in pituitary gigantism and pineal hyperplasia. It may also occur on one side of the face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.\nCleft lip and palate and their association with dental anomalies.\nThere are many types of dental anomalies seen in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients. Both sets of dentition may be affected; however, they are commonly seen in the affected side. Most frequently, missing teeth, supernumerary or discoloured teeth can be seen; however, enamel dysplasia, discolouration and delayed root development are also common. In children with cleft lip and palate, the lateral incisor in the alveolar cleft region has the highest prevalence of dental developmental disorders; this condition may be a cause of tooth crowding. This is important to consider in order to correctly plan treatment keeping in mind considerations for function and aesthetics. By correctly coordinating management invasive treatment procedures can be prevented resulting in successful and conservative treatment.\nThere have been a plethora of research studies to calculate prevalence of certain dental anomalies in CLP populations however a variety of results have been obtained.\nIn a study evaluating dental anomalies in Brazilian cleft patients, male patients had a higher incidence of CLP, agenesis, and supernumerary teeth than did female patients. In cases of complete CLP, the left maxillary lateral incisor was the most commonly absent tooth. Supernumerary teeth were typically located distal to the cleft. In a study of Jordanian subjects, the prevalence of dental anomaly was higher in CLP patients than in normal subjects. Missing teeth were observed in 66.7% of patients, with maxillary lateral incisor as the most frequently affected tooth. Supernumerary teeth were observed in 16.7% of patients; other findings included microdontia (37%), taurodontism (70.5%), transposition or ectopic teeth (30.8%), dilacerations (19.2%), and hypoplasia (30.8%). The incidence of microdontia, dilaceration, and hypoplasia was significantly higher in bilateral CLP patients than in unilateral CLP patients, and none of the anomalies showed any significant sexual dimorphism.\nIt is therefore evident that patients with cleft lip and palate may present with a variety of dental anomalies. It is essential to assess the patient both clinically and radiographically in order to correctly treat and prevent progression of any dental problems. It is also useful to note that patients with a cleft lip and palate automatically score a 5 on the IOTN ( index for orthodontic need) and therefore are eligible for orthodontic treatment, liaising with an orthodontist is vital in order coordinate and plan treatment successfully.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (TVE), who staged the event after winning the 1968 contest for Spain with the song \"La La La\" by Massiel. Broadcasters from a total of sixteen countries took part in the contest, with Austria being the only absence from the seventeen that participated the previous year.\nAt the close of voting, four countries were declared joint-winners: the United Kingdom with \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" by Lulu, Spain with \"\" by Salom\u00e9, the Netherlands with \"De troubadour\" by Lenny Kuhr, and France with \"Un jour, un enfant\" by Frida Boccara. It was the first time in the history of the contest that a tie for first place had occurred, and since the rules in place at the time allowed more than one winner, all four countries were declared joint winners. France's win was its fourth, thus making it the first country to win the contest four times. The Netherlands' win was its third. Spain and the United Kingdom each won for the second time, with Spain becoming the first country to win the contest twice in a row.\nLocation.\n (TVE) staged the 1969 contest in Madrid, after winning the 1968 contest for Spain with the song \"La La La\" by Massiel. This is the only time that the contest has been held in Spain. The venue selected was the , an opera house opened in 1850. After having to close in 1924 due to damage to the building, the venue reopened in 1966 as a concert hall and the main concert venue of the Spanish National Orchestra and the RTVE Symphony Orchestra. At that time, it also housed the Madrid Royal Conservatory and the Royal Higher College of Performing Arts.\nThe press room set up for the event, equipped with a giant colour screen, twelve television monitors, telex, teletype, and telefax machines, telephones, one hundred typewriters with different keyboards, and translation services, was located within the building and had capacity for six hundred journalists.\nOn 27 March 1969, the hosted a cocktail reception at its Madrid facilities, presided over by Manuel Fraga, the Minister of Information and Tourism on whom TVE depended at the time, and attended by all the participating artists, executives from the participating broadcasters, numerous accredited journalists, and local authorities.\nParticipants.\nBroadcasters from sixteen countries participated in the 1969 contest. Of the seventeen countries that participated in 1968 only Austria was absent, officially because (ORF) could not find a suitable representative, but it was rumoured that the broadcaster refused to participate in a contest staged in Franco-ruled Spain.\nSeveral of the performing artists had previously represented the same country in past editions: Simone de Oliveira had represented Portugal in 1965; Kirsti Sparboe had represented Norway in 1965 and in 1967; and Louis Neefs had represented Belgium in 1967. In addition, Siw Malmkvist representing Germany had represented Sweden in 1960; and Romuald representing Luxembourg had represented Monaco in 1964.\nFormat.\nThe event was presented by Laurita Valenzuela, who was dressed for the occasion by Carmen Mir. The surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed designed the publicity material for the contest. The musical director was Augusto Alguer\u00f3, who made the arrangements and conducted the 52-piece orchestra during the opening and ending acts. The show opened with a rendition of the Eurovision tune by the organ, followed by the orchestra performing the previous year's winning song, \"La, la, la\". The interval act consisted of a surrealist documentary titled , directed by Javier Aguirre, with music by Luis de Pablo. The show ended with the orchestra performing a medley of previous Eurovision winning songs during the credits.\nThe event had a budget of around 5 million pesetas (\u20ac30,050). For the set built on the stage, the TVE scenography divisions in Madrid and Barcelona, headed by Bernardo Ballester, designed ten different proposals and built a scale model for each of them. These were shortlisted into three designs for further consideration, from which one was selected. The final design included the 5,000-pipe fixed organ already present at the back of the stage, a scoreboard on the side, a central steel sculpture created by surrealist artist Amadeo Gabino, and fifteen thousand red and pink carnations. Since they were not allowed to make any modifications to the stage, not even hammering a nail into it, the set was prefabricated in more than three hundred modules that, brought from Prado del Rey, were assembled on-site. For better visibility, the floor of the set was raised above the stage. TVE had full access to the concert hall starting from the evening of 16 March, immediately after the audience and staff of that day's regular season concert had left the venue, which allowed its stage crew to begin assembling the set right away, its technical crew to begin setting up the equipment afterwards, and the orchestra to start rehearsals on 22 March.\nThis was the second contest to be filmed and transmitted in colour, even though TVE did not have the required colour equipment for such a big event at the time. It had to rent such equipment from the German ARD, which was provided by Fernseh and brought to Madrid from Cologne. Five colour television cameras inside the concert hall, three of them mounted on cranes, were used to broadcast the event. To avoid interruptions in the broadcast, the television signal was transmitted to the other broadcasters feeding the Eurovision network by two simultaneous ways: via the terrestrial microwave relay link network through France, and via the Intelsat III F-2 satellite through Italy. In addition, 137 dedicated telephone lines were used for transmission, internal communication, and communication with the participating broadcasters. In Spain itself the broadcast was seen in black and white because the local transmitters did not support colour transmissions. The colour recording equipment did not arrive in Madrid on time, so TVE only had a black and white copy of the contest, until a colour copy was discovered in the archives of NRK.\nIt was the first time that the contest resulted in a tie for first place, with four entries each gaining 18 votes. Since the rules in place at the time allowed more than one winner, all four countries were declared joint winners \"ex aequo\". This caused a problem concerning the medals that were to be distributed to the winners, as there were not enough to go round, so only the singers received their medals on stage; the songwriters were not awarded theirs until later. The medals were presented by previous year's winner Massiel, after which all four winning songs were reprised.\nContest overview.\nSpokespersons.\nEach participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for their respective jury via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1969 contest are listed below.\nDetailed voting results.\nEvery participating broadcaster assembled a jury panel of ten people. Every jury member could give one vote to his or her favourite song, except that representing their own country.\nAlthough neither spokesperson made any errors in their announcements, EBU scrutineer Clifford Brown asked both the Spanish and the Monegasque spokespersons to repeat their votes. No adjustments were made to the scoring as a result of the repetition.\nBroadcasts.\nEach participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest live via its networks after receiving it through the Eurovision network. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as \"passive participants\". Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. In addition to the participating countries, the contest was also reportedly broadcast in 26 countries including Tunisia; in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union received via Intervision; and in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Panama, and Puerto Rico. 30 radio and television commentators are reported to be present at the contest, with an estimated global audience of 250 to 400 million viewers.\nKnown details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A re-allocation is a Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement if those that are made better off could hypothetically compensate those that are made worse off and lead to a Pareto-improving outcome. The compensation does not actually have to occur (there is no presumption in favor of status-quo) and thus, a Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement can in fact leave some people worse off.\nTerminology.\nA situation is said to be Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficient, or equivalently is said to satisfy the Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion, if no potential Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement from that situation exists. If an outcome is the highest it could possibly be, it is called a Hicks-optimal outcome. A Hicks optimal outcome is always Pareto efficient.\nThe phenomenon is named for twentieth-century economists Nicholas Kaldor and John Hicks.\nExplanation.\nPareto.\nA reallocation is said to be a Pareto improvement if at least one person is made better off and nobody is made worse off. However, in practice, it is almost impossible to take any social action, such as a change in economic policy, without making at least one person worse off. Even voluntary exchanges may not be Pareto improving if they make third parties worse off.\nUsing the criterion for Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement, an outcome is an improvement if those that are made better off could in principle compensate those that are made worse off, so that a Pareto improving outcome could (but does not have to) be achieved. For example, a voluntary exchange that creates pollution would be a Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement if the buyers and sellers are still willing to carry out the transaction even if they have to fully compensate the victims of the pollution. Kaldor\u2013Hicks does not require compensation actually be paid, merely that the possibility for compensation exists, and thus need not leave each at least as well off. Under Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficiency, an improvement can in fact leave some people worse off. Pareto-improvements require making every party involved better off (or at least none worse off).\nWhile every Pareto improvement is a Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvement, most Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvements are not Pareto improvements. In other words, the set of Pareto improvements is a proper subset of Kaldor\u2013Hicks improvements.\nKaldor and Hicks.\nThe Kaldor criterion holds that an activity moves the economy closer to Pareto optimality if the maximum amount the gainers are prepared to pay to the losers to agree to the change is greater than the minimum amount losers are prepared to accept.\nJohn Hicks claims that adherence to the criterion moves the economy toward Pareto optimality if the maximum amount the losers would pay the gainers to forgo the change is less than the minimum amount the gainers would accept to so agree.\nThus, the Kaldor test supposes that losers could prevent the arrangement and asks whether gainers value their gain so much they would and could pay losers to accept the arrangement, whereas the Hicks test supposes that gainers are able to proceed with the change and asks whether losers consider their loss to be worth less than what it would cost them to pay gainers to agree not to proceed with the change. After several technical problems with each separate criterion were discovered, they were combined into the Scitovsky criterion, more commonly known as the Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion, which does not share those flaws.\nUse in policy-making.\nKaldor\u2013Hicks methods are typically used as tests of proposed changes rather than as intrinsic efficiency goals. They are used to determine whether an activity moves the economy toward Pareto efficiency. Any change usually makes some people better off and others worse off, so these tests consider what would happen if gainers were to compensate losers.\nThe Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion is widely applied in game theory's non-zero sum games, such as DOTMLPF, welfare economics, and managerial economics. For example, it forms an underlying rationale for cost\u2013benefit analysis. In cost\u2013benefit analysis, a project (for example, a new airport) is evaluated by comparing the total costs, such as building costs and environmental costs, with the total benefits, such as airline profits and convenience for travelers. (However, as cost\u2013benefit analysis may also assign different social welfare weights to different individuals, e.g. more to the poor, the compensation criterion is not always invoked by cost\u2013benefit analysis.)\nThe project would typically be given the go-ahead if the benefits exceed the costs. This is effectively an application of the Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion because it is equivalent to requiring that the benefits be enough that those that benefit could in theory compensate those that have lost out. The criterion is used because it is argued that it is justifiable for society as a whole to make some worse off if this means a greater gain for others.\nCriticisms.\nPerhaps the most common criticism of the Kaldor-Hicks criteria is that it is unclear why the ability of the winners to compensate the losers should matter, or have moral or political significance as a decision criterion, if the compensation is not actually paid.\nAt a more technical level, various versions of the Kaldor\u2013Hicks criteria lack desirable formal properties. For instance, Tibor Scitovsky demonstrated that the Kaldor criterion alone is not antisymmetric: it's possible to have a situation where an outcome A is an improvement (according to the Kaldor criterion) over outcome B, but B is also an improvement over A. The combined Kaldor\u2013Hicks criterion does not have this problem, but it may not be transitive (given A as an improvement over B, and B over C, A is not thereby an improvement over C).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Quotations related to at Wikiquote"}

The idea for the Connection Machine grew out of doctoral research on alternatives to the traditional von Neumann architecture of computers by Danny Hillis at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early 1980s. Starting with CM-1, the machines were intended originally for applications in artificial intelligence (AI) and symbolic processing, but later versions found greater success in the field of computational science.\nOrigin of idea.\nDanny Hillis and Sheryl Handler founded Thinking Machines Corporation (TMC) in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1983, moving in 1984 to Cambridge, MA. At TMC, Hillis assembled a team to develop what would become the CM-1 Connection Machine, a design for a massively parallel hypercube-based arrangement of thousands of microprocessors, springing from his PhD thesis work at MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (1985). The dissertation won the ACM Distinguished Dissertation prize in 1985, and was presented as a monograph that overviewed the philosophy, architecture, and software for the first Connection Machine, including information on its data routing between central processing unit (CPU) nodes, its memory handling, and the programming language Lisp applied in the parallel machine. Very early concepts contemplated just over a million processors, each connected in a 20-dimensional hypercube, which was later scaled down.\nDesigns.\nEach CM-1 microprocessor has its own 4\u00a0kilobits of random-access memory (RAM), and the hypercube-based array of them was designed to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously, i.e., to execute tasks in single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) fashion. The CM-1, depending on the configuration, has as many as 65,536 individual processors, each extremely simple, processing one bit at a time. CM-1 and its successor \"CM-2\" take the form of a cube 1.5\u00a0meters on a side, divided equally into eight smaller cubes. Each subcube contains 16 printed circuit boards and a main processor called a sequencer. Each circuit board contains 32 chips. Each chip contains a router, 16 processors, and 16 RAMs. The CM-1 as a whole has a 12-dimensional hypercube-based routing network (connecting the 212 chips), a main RAM, and an input-output processor (a channel controller). Each router contains five buffers to store the data being transmitted when a clear channel is not available. The engineers had originally calculated that seven buffers per chip would be needed, but this made the chip slightly too large to build. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman had previously calculated that five buffers would be enough, using a differential equation involving the average number of 1 bits in an address. They resubmitted the design of the chip with only five buffers, and when they put the machine together, it worked fine. Each chip is connected to a switching device called a nexus. The CM-1 uses Feynman's algorithm for computing logarithms that he had developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for the Manhattan Project. It is well suited to the CM-1, using as it did, only shifting and adding, with a small table shared by all the processors. Feynman also discovered that the CM-1 would compute the Feynman diagrams for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations faster than an expensive special-purpose machine developed at Caltech.\nTo improve its commercial viability, TMC launched the CM-2 in 1987, adding Weitek 3132 floating-point numeric coprocessors and more RAM to the system. Thirty-two of the original one-bit processors shared each numeric processor. The CM-2 can be configured with up to 512\u00a0MB of RAM, and a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) hard disk system, called a DataVault, of up to 25\u00a0GB. Two later variants of the CM-2 were also produced, the smaller \"CM-2a\" with either 4096 or 8192 single-bit processors, and the faster \"CM-200\".\nDue to its origins in AI research, the software for the CM-1/2/200 single-bit processor was influenced by the Lisp programming language and a version of Common Lisp, *Lisp (spoken: \"Star-Lisp\"), was implemented on the CM-1. Other early languages included Karl Sims' IK and Cliff Lasser's URDU. Much system utility software for the CM-1/2 was written in *Lisp. Many applications for the CM-2, however, were written in C*, a data-parallel superset of ANSI C.\nWith the \"CM-5\", announced in 1991, TMC switched from the CM-2's hypercubic architecture of simple processors to a new and different multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) architecture based on a fat tree network of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) SPARC processors. To make programming easier, it was made to simulate a SIMD design. The later \"CM-5E\" replaces the SPARC processors with faster SuperSPARCs. A CM-5 was the fastest computer in the world in 1993 according to the TOP500 list, running 1024 cores with Rpeak of 131.0\u00a0GFLOPS, and for several years many of the top 10 fastest computers were CM-5s.\nVisual design.\nConnection Machines were noted for their striking visual design. The CM-1 and CM-2 design teams were led by Tamiko Thiel. The physical form of the CM-1, CM-2, and CM-200 chassis was a cube-of-cubes, referencing the machine's internal 12-dimensional hypercube network, with the red light-emitting diodes (LEDs), by default indicating the processor status, visible through the doors of each cube.\nBy default, when a processor is executing an instruction, its LED is on. In a SIMD program, the goal is to have as many processors as possible working the program at the same time \u2013 indicated by having all LEDs being steady on. Those unfamiliar with the use of the LEDs wanted to see the LEDs blink \u2013 or even spell out messages to visitors. The result is that finished programs often have superfluous operations to blink the LEDs.\nThe CM-5, in plan view, had a staircase-like shape, and also had large panels of red blinking LEDs. Prominent sculptor-architect Maya Lin contributed to the CM-5 design.\nReferences in popular culture.\nA CM-5 was featured in the film \"Jurassic Park\" in the control room for the island (instead of a Cray X-MP supercomputer as in the novel). Two banks, one bank of 4 Units and a single off to the right of the set could be seen in the control room.\nThe computer mainframes in \"Fallout 3\" were inspired heavily by the CM-5. \n\"Cyberpunk 2077\" features numerous CM-1/CM-2 style units in various portions of the game.\nThe b-side to Clock DVA's 1989 single \"The Hacker\" is titled \"The Connection Machine\" in reference to the CM-1.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68761", "revid": "51065209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68761", "title": "Publishing", "text": "Production and distribution of media\nPublishing is the process of making information, literature, music, software, and other content, physical or digital, available to the public for sale or free of charge. Traditionally, the term publishing refers to the creation and distribution of printed works, such as books, comic books, newspapers, and magazines to the public. With the advent of digital information systems, the scope has expanded to include digital publishing such as e-books, digital magazines, websites, social media, music, and video game publishing.\nThe commercial publishing industry ranges from large multinational conglomerates such as News Corp, Pearson, Penguin Random House, and Thomson Reuters to major retail brands and thousands of small independent publishers. It has various divisions such as trade/retail publishing of fiction and non-fiction, educational publishing, and academic and scientific publishing. Publishing is also undertaken by governments, civil society, and private companies for administrative or compliance requirements, business, research, advocacy, or public interest objectives. This can include annual reports, research reports, market research, policy briefings, and technical reports. Self-publishing has become very common.\nPublishing has evolved from a small, ancient form limited by law or religion to a modern, large-scale industry disseminating all types of information.\n\"Publisher\" can refer to a publishing company, organization, or an individual who leads a publishing company, imprint, periodical, or newspaper.\nStages of publishing.\nThe publishing process covering most magazine, journal, and book publishers includes: \"(Different stages are applicable to different types of publishers)\"\nTypes of publishers.\nNewspaper publishing.\nNewspapers or news websites are publications of current reports, articles, and features written by journalists. They are free, sometimes with a premium edition, or paid for, either individually or through a subscription. They are filled with photographs or other media and usually are subsidized with advertising. Typically, they cover local, national, and international news or feature a particular industry. Some organizations charge premium fees if they have the expertise and exclusive knowledge. The news industry is meant to serve the public interest, hold people and businesses to account, and promote freedom of information and expression. Editors manage the tone of voice of their publication; for example, negative versus positive articles can affect the reader's perspective.\nJournal publishing.\nA journal is an academic or technical publication that is available in digital and(or) print format, containing articles written by researchers, professors, and individuals with professional expertise. These publications are specific to a particular field and often push the boundaries established in these fields. They usually have peer review processes before publishing to test the validity and quality of the content.\nMagazine publishing.\nA magazine is a periodical published at regular intervals. It features creative layouts, photography, and illustrations that cover a particular subject or interest. Magazines are available in print or digital formats and can be purchased on apps or websites like Readly or accessed free of charge on apps or websites like Issuu.\nBook publishing.\nThe global book publishing industry consists of books categorized as fiction or non-fiction and print, e-book, or audiobook. The book market is huge, with around 1.5 billion people speaking English. Translation services are also available to make these texts accessible in other languages. Self-publishing makes publishing widely accessible through small print-run digital printing or online self-publishing platforms. E-reader screen technology continues to improve with increased contrast and resolution making them more comfortable to read. Each book has a registered ISBN to identify it.\nDirectory publishing.\nDirectories contain searchable indexed data about businesses, products, and services. They were printed in the past but are now mostly online. Directories are available as searchable lists, on a map, as a sector-specific portal, as a review site (expert or consumer), or as a comparison site. Although some businesses may not consider themselves publishers, the way the data is displayed is published.\nTextbook publishing.\nA textbook is an educational book, or e-book, that contains information on a particular subject and is used by people studying that subject. The need for textbook publishing continues due to the global need for education. Textbooks from major publishers are being integrated with online learning platforms for expert knowledge and access to a library of books with digital content. A university press is an academic publisher run by a university. Oxford University Press is the largest in the world and specializes in research, education, and English language teaching internationally.\nCatalog publishing.\nA catalog is a visual directory or list of a large range of products that allow you to browse and buy from a particular company. In print, this is usually in the format of a softback book or directory. Smaller visual catalogs can be known as brochures. With the Internet, they have evolved into searchable databases of products known under the term e-commerce. Interactive catalogs and brochures like IKEA and Avon allow customers to browse a full range if they have not decided on their purchase. Responsive web and app design will allow further integration between interactive catalog visuals and searchable product databases.\nWeb publishing.\nUntil recently, physical books were the primary source of recording knowledge. For accessibility and global reach, this content can be repurposed for the web. The British Library, for example, holds more than 170 million items with 3 million new additions each year. With consent, content can be published online through e-books, audio books, CMS-based websites, online learning platforms, videos, or mobile apps. On the Internet, writers and copy editors are known as content writers and content editors, although their roles vary from their print-based counterparts.\nAdvertising.\nAdvertising can provide income or a subsidized income for publishers. If the advertising has a return on investment (ROI), the publisher can boost income exponentially by increasing the spending. An ROI of up to \u00a310 per \u00a31 invested is possible, as seen in the John Lewis &amp; Partners Christmas campaigns. Likewise, any cost savings that harm the customer/consumer experience can impact a brand in the long term. Multichannel marketing can be more cost-effective in creating an immersive experience that cannot be replicated with one channel. For example, when considering marketing spend, a shop with a small margin (or none at all) compared to a website is very cost-effective because it acts as a huge billboard that offers a browsing experience that enables consumers to make purchasing decisions. It gives them a feel for the brand, has a presence in the community, and creates jobs. Also, using social media publishing to advertise has a good ROI if trending, high-quality content is created that reflects positively on the brand.\nTie-in publishing.\nFilm, television, radio, and advertisements publish information to their audiences. Computer games, streaming apps, and social media publish content in various ways that can keep audiences more engaged. Marketing additional products closely related to a major film, such as \"Star Wars\", is an example of tie-in publishing. These products include but are not limited to spin-off books, graphic novels, soundtrack albums, computer games, models and toys, social media posts, and promotional publications. Examples of tie-in publishing based on books are the \"Harry Potter\" and \"James Bond\" franchises.\nBook publishing sub-divisions.\nThe publishing landscape is continually evolving. Currently there are four major types of publishers in book publishing:\nMainstream publishers.\nThese companies traditionally produce hardcopy books in large print runs. They have established networks which distribute those books to bricks-and-mortar stores and libraries. \nWhen a mainstream publisher accepts a book for publication, they require the author to sign a contract surrendering some rights to the publisher. In exchange, the publisher will take care of all aspects of publishing the book at the publisher's cost. They rely entirely on sales of the book to recoup those costs and make a profit. The author receives a royalty on each sale (and sometimes an advance on royalties when the book is accepted). Because of the financial risk, mainstream publishers are extremely selective in what they will publish, and reject most manuscripts submitted to them. \nIn 2013, Penguin (owned by Pearson) and Random House (owned by Bertelsmann) merged, narrowing the mainstream publishing industry to a handful of big publishers as it adapted to digital media. The merger created the largest consumer book publisher globally, with a global market share of more than 25 percent. As of 2022[ [update]], approximately 80% percent of the United States trade market for books was controlled by the \"Big Five\" publishing houses: Penguin Random House, Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Macmillan.\nIn November 2020, ViacomCBS agreed to sell Simon &amp; Schuster, the third largest book publisher in the United States, to Penguin Random House in a deal that, if it had gone through, would have formed the largest publishing company in the world. On November 2, 2021, the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit (U.S. v. Bertelsmann SE &amp; CO. KGaA, et al.) to block the merger on antitrust grounds, and on October 31, 2022, the D.C. District Court ruled in favor of the Department of Justice, filing a permanent injunction on the merger.\nAlthough newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a distributor who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.\nSome major publishers have entire divisions devoted to a single franchise, e.g., Ballantine Del Rey LucasBooks has the exclusive rights to \"Star Wars\" in the United States; Random House UK (Bertelsmann)/Century LucasBooks holds the same rights in the United Kingdom. The video game industry self-publishes through BL Publishing/Black Library (\"Warhammer\") and Wizards of the Coast (\"Dragonlance\", \"Forgotten Realms\", etc.). The BBC has its own publishing division that does very well with long-running series such as \"Doctor Who\". These multimedia works are cross-marketed aggressively, and sales frequently outperform the average stand-alone published work, making them a focus of corporate interest.\nThe advent of the Internet has provided an alternative mode of book distribution and most mainstream publishers also offer their books in ebook format. Preparing a book for e-book publication is the same as print publication, with only minor variations in the process to account for the different publishing mediums; E-book publication also eliminates some costs like the discount given to retailers (usually around 45 percent).\nSmall presses.\nSmall publishers, also called independent or indie publishers, operate on a traditional model (i.e. the author surrenders some rights in exchange for the publisher bearing all costs of publishing), but their precise terms can vary greatly. Often, they do not pay an advance on royalties.\nHybrid publishing.\nA hybrid publisher shares the costs of publication (and therefore the risks) with the author. Because of this financial risk, they are selective in what they publish. The contract varies according to what is negotiated between author and company, but will always include the surrender of some rights to the publisher. Hybrid publishing is the source of debate in the publishing industry, due to the tendency of vanity presses to masquerade as hybrids.\nVanity presses.\nA vanity press will publish any book. In return, the author must cover all the costs of publication, surrender some rights to the publisher, and pay royalties on sales. Vanity presses often engage in deceptive practices or offer costly, poor-quality services with limited recourse available to the writer. In the US, these practices have been cited by the Better Business Bureau as unfavorable reports by consumers. Given the bad reputation of vanity publishing, many vanity presses brand themselves as hybrid publishers. The Society of Authors (SoA) and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain (WGGB) have called for reform of the paid-for publishing sector. These unions, representing 14,800 authors, jointly published a report to expose widespread bad practices among companies that charge writers to publish their work while taking away their rights.\nSelf-publishing.\nWhen an author self-publishes a book, they retain all rights and assume responsibility for all stages of preparing, publishing and distributing the book. The author may hire professionals on a fee-for-service basis as needed, (e.g. an editor, cover designer, proofreader) or engage a company to provide an integrated package. \nRecent developments.\nAccessible publishing uses the digitization of books to mark them up into XML and produce multiple formats to sell to customers, often targeting those who experience difficulty reading. Formats include a variety of larger print sizes, specialized print formats for dyslexia, eye tracking problems, and macular degeneration, as well as Braille, DAISY, audiobooks, and e-books.\nGreen publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimize environmental impact. One example is the concept of on-demand printing, using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a just-in-time basis.\nA further development is the growth of online publishing, where no physical books are produced. The author creates an e-book and uploads it to a website, from which anyone can download and read it.\nAn increasing number of authors are using niche marketing online to sell more books by engaging with their readers online.\nStandardization.\nRefer to the ISO divisions of ICS 01.140.40 and 35.240.30 for further information.\nLegal issues.\nPublication is the distribution of copies or content to the public. The Berne Convention requires that this can only be done with the consent of the copyright holder, which initially is always the author. In the Universal Copyright Convention, \"publication\" is defined in Article VI as \"the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived.\"\nPrivishing.\nPrivishing (\"priv\"ate publ\"ishing\", but not to be confused with self-publishing) is a modern term for publishing a book but printing so few copies or with such lack of marketing, advertising, or sales support that it effectively does not reach the public. The book, while nominally published, is almost impossible to obtain through normal channels such as bookshops, often cannot be ordered specially, and has a notable lack of support from its publisher, including refusal to reprint the title. A book that is privished may be referred to as \"killed.\" Depending on the motivation, privishing may constitute a breach of contract, censorship, or good business practice (e.g., not printing more books than the publisher believes will sell in a reasonable length of time).\nHistory.\nPublishing became possible with the invention of writing and became more practical upon the introduction of printing. Before printing, distributed works were copied manually by scribes. Due to printing, publishing progressed hand-in-hand with the development of books.\nThe Chinese inventor Bi Sheng made a movable type of earthenware c.\u20091045, but there are no known surviving examples of his work. The Korean civil servant Ch'oe Yun-\u016di, who lived during the Goryeo Dynasty, invented the first metal moveable type in 1234\u20131250 AD. \nEurope.\nJohannes Gutenberg developed movable type in Europe around 1450, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. The invention of the printing press gradually made books less expensive to produce and more widely available.\nEarly printed books, single sheets, and images created before 1501 in Europe are known as incunables or \"incunabula\". \"A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330.\"\nThe history of modern newspaper publishing started in Germany in 1609, with the publication of magazines following in 1663.\nHistorians describe the last third of the eighteenth century of the German book trade as the \"Sturm und Drang\" period, German for \"storm and stress.\" \nMissionaries brought printing presses to sub-Saharan Africa in the mid-18th century.\nHistorically, publishing has been handled by publishers, although some authors self-published. \nUnited States.\nThe US publishing industry began with a printing press in Massachusetts in 1638, establishing New England as an early hub. Philadelphia also became significant, with William Bradford setting up the first paper mill and Benjamin Franklin opening his own press. By the mid-19th century, New York City became the industry's center, marked by the rise of large publishing houses like Harper, Wiley, Putnam, and Scribner, who benefited from copyright laws and new distribution methods. Initially, they heavily relied on pirated British works until international copyright laws were established in 1891. The mid-19th century also saw innovations like paperback \"dime novels\" making literature more accessible. The post-World War I era was a boom for American publishing with new writers and publishers like Simon &amp; Schuster and Random House emerging. The Great Depression caused a setback, but the industry recovered post-war. Since the 1960s, there's been a trend of mergers and consolidation, accelerating with the rise of online retailers and ebooks, though New York City remains a major global publishing center, home to the \"Big Five\" publishers (including HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, and Simon &amp; Schuster) and major educational publishers like Macmillan Learning, McGraw-Hill, Scholastic, and Wiley, alongside numerous independent publishers. Starting with Cornell University Press in 1869 and Johns Hopkins University Press in 1878, many universities set up publishing houses to publish scholarly books and journals of this sort produced by their faculty and graduate students. In the 21st century, however, financial pressures. have been reducing their output.\nA U.S.-based study in 2016 that surveyed 34 publishers found that straight, able-bodied, white females overwhelmingly represent the publishing industry in the US. \"Salon\" described the situation as a \"lack of diversity behind the scenes in book world.\" A survey in 2020 by the same group found there has been no significant statistical change in the lack of diversity since the 2016 survey. Lack of diversity in the American publishing industry has been an issue for years. Within the industry, the least amount of diversity was in higher-level editorial positions.\nInternet Age.\nThe establishment of the World Wide Web in 1989 soon propelled the website into a dominant publishing medium. Wikis and blogs soon developed, followed by online books, online newspapers, and online magazines. This also facilitated the technological convergence of commercial and self-published content and the convergence of publishing and production into online production through the development of multimedia content.\nStatistics.\nAccording to the report \"The Global Publishing Industry in 2022\", published by the World Intellectual Property Organization, there is data available for 24 countries about the number of publications published in the educational and trade sector:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "68762", "revid": "50908619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68762", "title": "Rome Statute", "text": "1998 international treaty establishing the International Criminal Court\nThe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is the treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). It was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome, Italy on 17 July 1998 and it entered into force on 1 July 2002. As of January 2025, 125 states are party to the statute. Among other things, it establishes court function, jurisdiction and structure.\nThe Rome Statute established four core international crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Those crimes \"shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.\" Under the Rome Statute, the ICC can only investigate and prosecute the four core international crimes in situations where states are \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to do so themselves. The provisions on the crime of aggression did not take effect until after it was defined at the 2010 Kampala Conference.\nThe jurisdiction of the ICC is complementary to jurisdictions of domestic courts. The Court has jurisdiction over crimes only if they are committed in the territory of, by a national of, or on a vessel registered under a state party or a non-party that has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court; or if the United Nations Security Council makes a referral.\nPurpose.\nThe Rome Statute established four core international crimes: (I) Genocide, (II) Crimes against humanity, (III) War crimes, and the (IV) Crime of aggression. Following years of negotiation, aimed at establishing a permanent international tribunal to prosecute individuals accused of genocide and other serious international crimes, such as crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression, the United Nations General Assembly convened a five-week diplomatic conference in Rome in June 1998 \"to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of an international criminal court\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Rome Statute is the result of multiple attempts for the creation of a supranational and international tribunal. At the end of the 19th century, the international community took the first steps toward the institution of permanent courts with supranational jurisdiction. With the Hague International Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907, representatives of the most powerful nations made an attempt to harmonize laws of war and to limit the use of technologically advanced weapons. \nAfter the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders, international institutions began prosecuting individuals responsible for crimes against humanity which are inhumane actions that may be legal in a given nation, but represent gross human rights violations. In order to re-affirm basic principles of democratic civilisation, the accused received a regular trial, the right to defense and the presumption of innocence. The Nuremberg trials marked a crucial moment in legal history, and after that, some treaties that led to the drafting of the Rome Statute were signed. \nUN General Assembly Resolution n. 260 9 December 1948, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, was the first step toward the establishment of an international permanent criminal tribunal with jurisdiction on crimes yet to be defined in international treaties. In the resolution there was a hope for an effort from the Legal UN commission in that direction. \nThe UN General Assembly, after the considerations expressed from the commission, established a committee to draft a statute and study the related legal issues. In 1951 a first draft was presented; a second draft followed in 1955 but there were a number of delays, officially due to the difficulties in the definition of the crime of aggression, that were only solved with diplomatic assemblies in the years following the statute's coming into force. The geopolitical tensions of the Cold War also contributed to the delays.\nIn December 1989, Trinidad and Tobago asked the UN General Assembly to re-open the talks for the establishment of an international criminal court and in 1994 presented a draft statute. The General Assembly created an \"ad hoc\" committee for the International Criminal Court and, after hearing the conclusions, a Preparatory Committee that worked on the draft for two years from 1996 to 1998. \nMeanwhile, the United Nations created the \"ad hoc\" tribunals for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and for Rwanda (ICTR) using statutes\u2014and amendments due to issues raised during pre-trial or trial stages of the proceedings\u2014that are quite similar to the Rome Statute.\nThe UN\u2019s International Law Commission considered the inclusion of the crime of ecocide to be included within the Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind, the document which later became the Rome Statute. Article 26 (crime against the environment) was publicly supported by 19 countries in the Legal Committee but was removed due to opposition from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\nEstablishment.\nDuring its 52nd session, the UN General Assembly decided to convene a diplomatic conference \"to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of an international criminal court.\" The conference was convened in Rome from 15 June 1998 to 17 July 1998. It was attended by representatives from 161 member states, along with observers from various other organizations, intergovernmental organizations and agencies, and non-governmental organizations (including many human rights groups) and was held at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, located about 4\u00a0km away from the Vatican (one of the states represented). On 17 July 1998, the Rome Statute was adopted by a vote of 120 to 7, with 21 countries abstaining.\nBy agreement, there was no official record of each delegation's vote regarding the adoption of the Rome Statute. Therefore, there is some dispute over the identity of the seven countries that voted against the treaty. \nIt is certain that the People's Republic of China, Israel, and the United States were three of the seven because they have publicly confirmed their negative votes. India, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen have been identified by various observers and commentators as possible sources for the other four negative votes, with Iraq, Libya, Qatar, and Yemen being the four most commonly identified. \nExplanations of Vote was publicly declared by India, Uruguay, Mauritius, Philippines, Norway, Belgium, United States, Brazil, Israel, Sri Lanka, China, Turkey, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.\nOn 11 April 2002, 10 countries ratified the Rome Statute at the same time at a special ceremony held at the United Nations headquarters in New York City, bringing the total number of signatories to 60, which was the minimum number required to bring the statute into force, as defined in Article 126. The treaty entered into force on 1 July 2002; the ICC can only prosecute crimes committed on or after that date.\nThe states parties held a Review Conference in Kampala, Uganda from 31 May 2010 to 11 June 2010. The Review Conference adopted a definition of the crime of aggression, thereby allowing the ICC to exercise jurisdiction over the crime for the first time. It also adopted an expansion of the list of war crimes. Amendments to the statute were proposed to implement these changes.\nRatification status.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]], 125 states are parties to the Statute of the Court, including all the countries of South America, nearly all of Europe, most of Oceania and roughly half of Africa. Burundi and the Philippines were member states, but later withdrew effective 27 October 2017 and 17 March 2019, respectively. A further 29 countries have signed but not ratified the Rome Statute. The law of treaties obliges these states to refrain from \"acts which would defeat the object and purpose\" of the treaty until they declare they do not intend to become a party to the treaty. Four signatory states have informed the UN Secretary General that they no longer intend to become states parties and, as such, have no legal obligations arising from their signature of the Statute; they are Israel in 2002, the United States on 6 May 2002, Sudan on 26 August 2008, and Russia on 30 November 2016. Forty-one other states have neither signed nor acceded to the Rome Statute. Some of them, including China and India, are critical of the Court. \nJurisdiction, structure and amendment.\nThe Rome Statute outlines the structure and areas of jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. The Court can prosecute individuals (but not states or organizations) for four kinds of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. These crimes are detailed in Articles 6, 7, 8, and 8 \"bis\" of the Rome Statute, respectively. They must have been committed after 1 July 2002, when the Rome Statute came into effect.\nThe International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over these crimes in three cases: first, if they took place on the territory of a state party; second, if they were committed by a national of a state party; or third, if the crimes were referred to the Prosecutor by the UN Security Council. The Court may begin an investigation before issuing a warrant if the crimes were referred by the UN Security Council or if a state party requests an investigation. Otherwise, the Prosecutor must seek authorization from a Pre-Trial Chamber of three judges to begin an investigation \"proprio motu\" (on its own initiative). The only type of immunity the ICC recognizes is that it cannot prosecute those under 18 when the crime was committed. In particular, no officials (not even a head of state) are immune from prosecution.\nThe issue of immunities from the jurisdiction of the ICC has become recently relevant, when the Court issued arrest warrants for Russian and Israeli Heads of State, since their immunities are granted from states which are not parties to the Rome Statute. States which have ratified the statute have waived the immunities of their officials with respect to the jurisdiction of the court by accepting the provisions of Article 2: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Article 27\nIrrelevance of official capacity \n1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.\n2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.\nHowever, according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, states which have not ratified a treaty cannot be bound by its provisions, meaning that states such as Russia and Israel have not agreed to waive the immunities of their officials for that purpose. On the other hand, states which are bound to cooperate with the Court under part 9 of the Rome Statute, shall comply with any and all cooperation requests of the Court, including arrest warrants for officials of non-state parties. However, Article 98 of the Court, which has been used as an argument by state parties defending their non-compliance with arrest warrants as such reads as follows: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Article 98 \nCooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender \n1.The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that third State for the waiver of the immunity.\nThe Al-Bashir arrest warrant decisions have shed some light into the apparent conflict between these two articles by establishing two strong arguments in favor of the universality of Article 27 and the nonexistence of a conflict with Article 98. The first argument, commonly known as \"The Security Council route,\" claims that when a situation is referred to the Court in accordance with Article 13(b) of the Rome Statute, the Security Council is placing the state in question in the position of a state party to the Rome Statute, including the waiver of Article 27. In the absence of a Security Council referral, the Court has included a plethora of other justifications for its decision. The argument, one of the justifications of the Court which was reaffirmed in the decision against Mongolia in 2024, is highlighting the grammatical interpretation of Article 98(1). The lack of reference on heads of state in the article, and the clear grammatical meaning that the article applies only to the state or diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third state, is a strong indicator that the article is not an exception to Article 27 for heads of state of states not party.\nThe Rome Statute established three bodies: the International Criminal Court itself, the Assembly of States Parties (ASP), and the Trust Fund for Victims. The ASP has two subsidiary bodies. These are the Permanent Secretariat, established in 2003, and an elected Bureau which includes a president and vice-president. The ICC itself has four organs: the Presidency (with mostly administrative responsibilities); the Divisions (the Pre-Trial, Trial, and Appeals judges); the Office of the Prosecutor; and the Registry (whose role is to support the other three organs). The functions of these organs are detailed in Part 4 of the Rome Statute.\nAny amendment to the Rome Statute requires the support of a two-thirds majority of the states parties, and an amendment (except those amending the list of crimes) will not enter into force until it has been ratified by seven-eighths of the states parties. A state party which has not ratified such an amendment may withdraw with immediate effect. Any amendment to the list of crimes within the jurisdiction of the court will only apply to those states parties that have ratified it. It does not need a seven-eighths majority of ratifications.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original home of the Boston Manufacturing Company, the city was a prototype for 19th century industrial city planning, spawning what became known as the Waltham-Lowell system of labor and production. The city is now a center for research and higher education as home to Brandeis University and Bentley University. The population was 65,218 at the 2020 United States census. Waltham is part of the Greater Boston area and lies west of Downtown Boston.\nWaltham has been called \"watch city\" because of its association with the watch industry. Waltham Watch Company opened its factory in Waltham in 1854 and was the first company to make watches on an assembly line. It won the gold medal in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The company produced over 35 million watches, clocks, and instruments before it closed in 1957.\nWaltham borders Watertown and Belmont to the east, Lexington to the north, Lincoln and Weston to the west, and Newton to the south.\nHistory.\nWaltham was first settled by the English in 1634 as part of Watertown, and was officially incorporated as a separate town in 1738, but the area was inhabited for thousands of years prior to English colonization. At the time of European arrival, Waltham was in a border zone between the territories of the Pawtucket confederation and the Massachusett, with nearby native settlements at \"Nonantum\" and \"Pequosset\" (Watertown). Early settlers recorded the presence of an \"Indian Stockade\" near today's Cambridge Reservoir, and an \"Indian Hollow\" in today's Calvary Cemetery. A native trail through Waltham, the \"Old Connecticut Path\" saw continued use after colonization and became the basis for present day Route 20.\nWaltham is most likely named for Waltham Abbey in the County of Essex, England. The first record of the name is from the articles of incorporation, dated January 15, 1738. The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon words, weald or wald \"forest\" and ham \"homestead\" or \"enclosure.\" Waltham had no recognizable town center until the 1830s, when the nearby Boston Manufacturing Company gave the town the land that now serves as its central square.\nIn the early 19th century, Francis Cabot Lowell and his friends and colleagues established in Waltham the Boston Manufacturing Company\u2014the first integrated textile mill in the United States, with the goal of eliminating the problems of co-ordination, quality control, and shipping inherent in the subcontracting based textile industry. The Waltham\u2013Lowell system of production derives its name from the city and the founder of the mill.\nThe city is home to a number of large estates, including Gore Place, a mansion built in 1806 for former Massachusetts governor Christopher Gore, the Robert Treat Paine Estate, a residence designed by architect Henry Hobson Richardson and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted for philanthropist Robert Treat Paine, Jr. (1810\u20131905), and the Lyman Estate, a estate built in 1793 by Boston merchant Theodore Lyman I.\nIn 1857, the Waltham Model 1857 watch was produced by the American Watch Company in the city of Waltham, Massachusetts.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Waltham was home to the brass era automobile manufacturer Metz, where the first production motorcycle in the U.S. was built.\nAnother first in Waltham industrial history involves the method to mass-produce the magnetron tube, invented by Percy Spencer at Raytheon. During World War II, the magnetron tube technology was applied to radar. Later, magnetron tubes were used as components in microwave ovens.\nWaltham was also the home of the Walter E. Fernald State School, the western hemisphere's oldest publicly funded institution serving people with developmental disabilities. The storied and controversial history of the institution has long been covered by local and, at times, national media.\nTimeline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Timeline of Waltham, Massachusetts\nPronunciation.\nThe name of the city is pronounced with the primary stress on the first syllable and a full vowel in the second syllable, , though the name of the Waltham watch was pronounced with a reduced schwa in the second syllable: . At one time, most people would have pronounced it in the British way, \"Walthum\", but when people came to work in the mills from Nova Scotia, the pronunciation evolved. The local version became a phonetic sounding to accommodate French speakers who could not pronounce it in the British way. In some areas, the city is referred to as \"The Waltham\".\nGeography.\nWaltham is located at (42.380596, \u221271.235005), about north-west of downtown Boston, Massachusetts, and approximately northwest of Boston's Brighton neighborhood. The heart of the city is Waltham Common, which is home to Waltham City Hall and various memorial statues. The Common is on Main Street, which is home to several churches, the Waltham Public Library, and Post Office.\nThe city stretches along the Charles River and contains several dams. The dams were used to power textile mills and other endeavors in the early years of the industrial activity.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (6.69%) is water.\nNeighborhoods.\nWaltham has several neighborhoods or villages, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAdjacent towns.\nIt is bordered to the west by Weston and Lincoln, to the south by Newton, to the east by Belmont and Watertown, and to the north by Lexington.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the census in 2020, there were 65,218 people and 23,891 households in the city. The population density was 5,117.9/mile\u00b2. According to 2021 census estimates, the racial makeup of the city was 60.5% White, 7.6% Black or African American, 0.5% Native American or Alaska Native, 11.8% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 5.3% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 22.3% of the population.\nThere were 23,891 households, 19.8% of which included children under the age of 18 and 28.4% with people 65 and older. 39.7% of households were married couples living together, 9.9% cohabitating couples, 21.2% male householders with no partner present, and 29.2% female householders with no partner present. The average household size was 2.29 and the average family size was 3.02.\n32.7% of households spoke a language other than English at home.\nThe age distribution is as follows: 13.7% under 18, 20% from 18 to 24, 30.6% from 25 to 44, 9.9% from 45 to 64, and 14.6% 65 or older. The median age was 34. The population was 48.3% male and 51.7% female.\nThe median income for a household was $95,851, and per capita was $44,977. In 2020, 9.2% of the population and 5% of families lived below the poverty line. 11.7% of those under 18 and 8.45% of those 65 and older lived below the poverty line.\nForeign-born residents.\nAs of 2020, 26.6% of Waltham residents were born outside of the United States. Of foreign-born residents, 41.5% were born in Asia, 32.7% in Latin America, 11.9% in Europe, and 9.7% in Africa.\nArts and culture.\nWaltham's combination of population (especially in central and south Waltham) parks, public transit, stores, and trails gives it 62 (out of 100) walkability ranking on walkscore.com.\nMoody Street in downtown Waltham offers its own brand of entertainment with a colorful assortment of shops, restaurants, and bars. Moody Street's booming nightlife, convenience to the commuter rail and lower rents have attracted younger professionals to Waltham in growing numbers in recent years. Moody Street is also referred to as \"Restaurant Row\" and has become a destination because of the number, variety and quality of its locally owned restaurants. The city of Waltham has a free \"Tick Tock Trolley\" on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings from 6pm\u201311pm for visitors that provides easy access to local municipal parking lots.\nStarting in 2020, the City of Waltham in Massachusetts has shut down a large portion of the main road, Moody St., to vehicular traffic from May 1 until October 31 annually. Moody Street is lined with restaurants and other small businesses but typically has high volumes of automobile passage. In an effort to assist these businesses in a difficult time, the Waltham Traffic Commission closed off a segment of the road to allow businesses to have outdoor dining and storefronts amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Bus stops that would typically be on the blocked off part of Moody St. are temporarily relocated to nearby spots.\nRestaurants are supportive of the closure, as they can offer outdoor seating and increase their capacity for business. However, Moody Street has a variety of other businesses like small grocery stores, clothing stores, and jewelers. Some of these non-restaurant business owners oppose repeating the plan in the future, arguing that closing off the road makes their businesses less accessible due to a lack of automobile access. While Waltham has included a variety of stakeholders in the process of the street closure, it is crucial that they continue to do so in order to continue using a democratic process for city-wide decision-making.\nFor over 25 years, the Waltham Arts Council has sponsored \"Concerts On Waltham Common\", featuring a different musical act each week of the summer, free of charge to attendees. \"Concerts On Waltham Common\" was created and organized by Stephen Kilgore until his death in 2004.\nThe Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University is devoted to modern and contemporary art. The Rose holds a variety of exhibitions and programs, and collections are free and open to the public.\nThe city's history is also celebrated at a number of museums, monuments, and archives. The Charles River Museum of Industry &amp; Innovation, the Waltham Watch Factory historic district, the Gore Estate, the Lyman Estate, and the Robert Treat Payne Estate are among the most well known of the 109 sites in the city on the National Register of Historical Sites. Many festivals are held at these sites each year, such as the annual sheep shearing festival at the Gore Estate. The National Archives and Records Administration Northeast regional branch is located in Waltham. The Waltham Public Library has extensive archives regarding the city's history. The Waltham Museum is devoted solely to the history of the city. Mark Gately is the only stakeholder left of the Waltham Museum.\nWaltham is known for its embracing of literary arts. Local author Jessica Lucci has written a series of books about Waltham which can be found at the Waltham Museum, The Waltham Historical Society, and many other regional establishments devoted to promoting literary arts.\nThe Waltham Mills Artists Association is located in one of the former factories of the Boston Manufacturing Company. The WMAA Open Studios takes place each year on the first weekend of November. The 76 artists of the WMAA open their homes and studios to the public. Works of all media imaginable are demonstrated, displayed and discussed.\nThe Waltham Philharmonic Orchestra, a civic symphony of the MetroWest area, began in 1985 under the direction of local musicians David J. Tierney and Harold W. McSwain, Jr. With almost 60 professional, semi-professional, and amateur musicians, the orchestra's mission is to provide the Waltham community with the opportunity to perform in and attend classical concerts of the highest quality. WPO musicians come from Waltham as well as from Boston and surrounding communities. The ensemble includes players of a wide range of ages and professions.\nThere are five to six concerts throughout the season, including one that features the winner of the annual Youth Concerto Competition, which provides opportunities for young musicians to perform solo works with the WPO. Annual concerts have included summer Concerts on the Common and the December Holiday Pops.\nWaltham is home to the Waltham Symphony Orchestra, a high-level semi-professional civic orchestra. The 55 piece orchestra performs five concerts each season at the Kennedy Middle-school Auditorium. Its music director is French-born American conductor, Patrick Botti.\nOpen space in the city is protected by the Waltham Land Trust.\nWaltham embraces its ethnic diversity in a number of festivals. The annual Latinos en Acci\u00f3n Festival celebrates the many Puerto Rican, Mexican, Peruvian, and Guatemalan residents. It is held by Latinos in Action, a local nonprofit group that helps the Latino population register to vote, understand the laws and find scholarships. The festival includes a parade, music, food, and a beauty pageant.\nWaltham has in recent decades become a center for Ugandan culture, with an estimated 1500 Ugandans living in the city, leading some to call Waltham \"Little Kampala\". The Ugandan North America Association is headquartered in Waltham, along with St. Peters Church of Uganda Boston, as well as Karibu, a well regarded Ugandan eatery. Wilberforce Kateregga, a Ugandan immigrant to Waltham has since established Waltham College Uganda in Seeta Nazigo, Uganda, a boarding school for over 300 orphans and children affected by AIDS. The school was named in honor of Kateregga's new home city.\nEconomy.\nAmong the major companies based in Waltham are the Life Sciences and Diagnostics firm Revvity (formerly the Life Sciences division of PerkinElmer), defense and aerospace corporation RTX Corporation (headquarters of its Raytheon business unit), biopharmaceutical services provider PAREXEL, energy supply company Global Partners, provider of scientific instrumentation Thermo Fisher Scientific, biopharma company Alkermes, and robotics engineering firm Boston Dynamics.

It is a tree with rough, fibrous bark, leaves with a distinct midvein, white flowers and relatively large, more or less spherical fruit. Its hard, dense timber is insect resistant although the tree is susceptible to dieback. The timber has been utilised for cabinet-making, flooring and railway sleepers.\nDescription.\nJarrah is a tree which sometimes grows to a height of up to with a DBH of , but more usually with a DBH of up to . Less commonly it can be a small mallee to high. Older specimens have a lignotuber and roots that extend down as far as . It is a stringybark with rough, greyish-brown, vertically grooved, fibrous bark which sheds in long flat strips. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches, narrow lance-shaped, often curved, long and broad, shiny dark green above and paler below. There is a distinct midvein, spreading lateral veins and a marginal vein separated from the margin. The stalked flower buds are arranged in umbels of between 4 and 8, each bud with a narrow, conical cap long. The flowers in diameter, with many white stamens and bloom in spring and early summer. The fruit are spherical to barrel-shaped, and long and broad.\nTaxonomy and naming.\n\"Eucalyptus marginata\" was first formally described in 1802 by James Edward Smith, whose description was published in \"Transactions of the Linnean Society of London\". Smith noted that his specimens had grown from seeds brought from Port Jackson and noted a resemblance to both \"Eucalyptus robusta\" and \"E. pilularis\". The specific epithet (\"marginata\") is a Latin word meaning \"furnished with a border\". Smith did not provide an etymology for the epithet but did note that, compared to \"E. robusta\" \"the margin [of the leaves] is more thickened\".\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Eucalyptus marginata\" occurs in the south-west corner of Western Australia, generally where the rainfall isohyet exceeds . It is found inland as far as Mooliabeenee, Clackline and Narrogin and in the south as far east as the Stirling Range. Its northern limit is Mount Peron near Jurien Bay but there are also outliers at Kulin and Tutanning in the Pingelly Shire. The plant often takes the form of a mallee in places like Mount Lesueur and in the Stirling Range but it is usually a tree and in southern forests sometimes reaches a height of . It typically grows in soils derived from ironstone and is generally found within its range, wherever ironstone is present.\nThe jarrah forest occurs in either intimate mixtures or as a mosaic of different forest types with marri (Corymbia calophylla), wandoo (E. wandoo), powderbark wandoo (E. accedens), blackbutt (E. patens), karri (E. diversicolor) and yellow tingle (E. guilfoylei).\nThe area of jarrah forest at the time of European settlement is estimated to have been 2.8 million hectares, although the species occurred over an area double that size. Sixty five per cent of the original forest area remains, with approximately 1.6 million hectares on public land. The forests are located within the south-west botanical province of Western Australia which is recognised as one of the world's 25 global biodiversity hotspots, with approximately 7,400 species of vascular plants, half of which are endemic. It is home to 245 vertebrate species, comprising 29 mammal, 150 bird, 44 reptile, 11 amphibian and 11 fish.\nEcology.\nJarrah is regarded as one of the six forest giants found in Western Australia; the other trees include; \"Eucalyptus gomphocephala\" (tuart), \"Eucalyptus diversicolor\" (karri), \"Eucalyptus jacksonii\" (red tingle), \"Corymbia calophylla\" (marri) and \"Eucalyptus patens\" (yarri).\nJarrah is an important element in its ecosystem, providing numerous habitats for animal life \u2013 especially birds and bees \u2013 while it is alive, and in the hollows that form as the heartwood decays. When it falls, it provides shelter to ground-dwellers such as the chuditch (\"Dasyurus geoffroii\"), a carnivorous marsupial.\nJarrah has shown considerable adaptation to different ecologic zones \u2013 as in the Swan Coastal Plain and further north, and also to a different habitat of the lateritic Darling Scarp.\nJarrah is very vulnerable to dieback caused by the oomycete \"Phytophthora cinnamomi\". In large sections of the Darling Scarp there have been various measures to reduce the spread of dieback by washing down vehicles, and restricting access to areas of forest not yet infected.\nThis evergreen hardwood tree lives for 400 or more years and typically reaches maturity at 70 - 120 years. Senescence is believed to occurs beyond 250 years. \nThe jarrah tree produces an abundance of creamy white flowers during its blooming season which typically occurs between September and January. The jarrah is capable of flowering each year, but full the floral cycle takes three years to complete. Significant flowering events occur on a four to six year cycle, with most trees within any region flowering at the same time.\nConservation status.\n\"Eucalyptus marginata\" was added to the IUCN Red List as a \"near threatened\" species in 2019.\nUses.\nJarrah produces a dark, thick, tasty honey, but its wood is its main use. It is a heavy wood, with a specific gravity of 1.1 when green. Its long, straight trunks of richly coloured and beautifully grained termite-resistant timber make it valuable for cabinet making, flooring, panelling and outdoor furniture. The finished lumber has a deep rich reddish-brown colour and an attractive grain. When fresh, jarrah is quite workable but when seasoned it becomes so hard that conventional wood-working tools are near useless on it. It is mainly used for cabinet making and furniture although in the past it was used in general construction, railway sleepers and piles. In the 19th century, famous roads in other countries were paved with jarrah blocks covered with asphalt.\nJarrah wood is very similar to that of karri, \"Eucalyptus diversicolor\". Both trees are found in the southwest of Australia, and the two woods are frequently confused. They can be distinguished by cutting an unweathered splinter and burning it: karri burns completely to a white ash, whereas jarrah forms charcoal. This property of jarrah was critical to charcoal making and charcoal iron smelting operations at Wundowie from 1948 to 1981. Most of the best jarrah has been logged in southwestern Australia.\nA large amount was exported to the United Kingdom, where it was cut into blocks and covered with asphalt for roads. One of the large exporters in the late nineteenth century was M. C. Davies who had mills in the Augusta - Margaret River region of the southwest, and ports at Hamelin Bay and Flinders Bay.\nThe local poet Dryblower Murphy wrote a poem, \"Comeanavajarrah\" that was published in \"The Sunday Times\" of May 1904, about the potential to extract alcohol from jarrah timber.\nAs of the banning of native logging in Western Australia in 2024, jarrah has become more highly prized, and can only be obtained as recycled timber from sources such as demolished houses and railway sleepers.\nJarrah is used in musical instrument making, for percussion instruments and guitar inlays.\nBecause of its remarkable resistance to rot, jarrah is used to make hot tubs.\n\"Eucalyptus marginata\" have been used for traditional purposes as well. Some parts of the jarrah tree were used as a remedy for some illnesses and diseases. Fever, colds, headaches, skin diseases and snakes bites were traditionally cured through the use of jarrah leaves and bark.\nJarrah honey is a premium monofloral honey produced by bees that forage on the nectar of the jarrah tree. The honey has properties such as being anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory low and prebiotic. Average production of jarrah honey is only 100 tonnes per annum but the yield is significantly impacted by the environment (fire, rainfall, soil moisture and temperatures). For example a peak yield of 400 tonnes was recorded in the 2011\u201312 season, while the harvest was only 50 tonnes in the 2023\u201324 season.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the most common functional style of speech, the language normally employed in casual conversation and other informal contexts. Colloquialism is characterized by the frequent use of expressive phrases, idioms, anthropocentrism, and a lack of specialized focus, and has a rapidly changing lexicon. It can also be distinguished by its usage of formulations with incomplete logical and syntactic ordering.\nA specific instance of such language is termed a \"colloquialism\". The most common term used in dictionaries to label such an expression is \"colloquial\".\nDefinition.\nColloquialism is distinct from formal speech or formal writing. It is the form of language that speakers typically use when they are relaxed and inattentive to their own diction (choices of vocabulary and style of expression). An expression is labeled \"colloq.\" for \"colloquial\" in dictionaries when a different expression is preferred in formal usage, but this does not mean that the colloquial expression is necessarily slang or non-standard.\nSome colloquial language contains a great deal of slang, but some contains no slang at all. Slang is often used in colloquial speech, but this particular register is restricted to particular in-groups, and it is not a necessary element of colloquialism. Other examples of colloquial usage in English include contractions or profanity.\n\"Colloquial\" should be distinguished from \"non-standard\". The difference between standard and non-standard is not strictly connected to the difference between formal and colloquial. As shown by Peter Trudgill in his discussion of standard English, formal, colloquial, and vulgar language are more a matter of stylistic variation and diction, rather than of the standard and non-standard dichotomy. However, the term \"colloquial\" may be equated with \"non-standard\" at times, in certain contexts and terminological conventions.\nIn the philosophy of language, \"colloquial language\" is ordinary natural language, as distinct from specialized forms used in logic or other areas of philosophy. In the field of logical atomism, meaning is evaluated in a different way than with more formal propositions.\nColloquial names.\nA colloquial name or familiar name is a name or term commonly used to identify a person or thing in non-specialist language, in place of another usually more formal or technical name. They are not slang nor vulgar, but are informal. This type is speech is used broadly for a variety of topics.\nIn biology, colloquial names are called \"common names\". Common pests often have common names. For example, armadillidiidae are often called \"rollie pollies\", while fly larvae are frequently called \"maggots\".\nIn medicine, types of musculoskeletal injuries and fractures have colloquial names. For example, the lateral epicondylitis injury is colloquially referred to as \"tennis elbow\".\nIn professional environments, colloquialisms often incorporate figures of speech. For example, when counter-arguing why an action ought not be performed, one may colloquially ask \"why in God's name not?\"\nDistinction from other styles.\nColloquialisms are distinct from slang or jargon. Slang refers to words used only by specific social groups, such as demographics based on region, age, or socio-economic identity. In contrast, jargon is most commonly used within specific occupations, industries, activities, or areas of interest. Colloquial language includes slang, along with abbreviations, contractions, idioms, turns-of-phrase, and other informal words and phrases known to most native speakers of a language or dialect.\nJargon is terminology that is explicitly defined in relationship to a specific activity, profession, or group. The term refers to the language used by people who work in a particular area or who have a common interest. Similar to slang, it is shorthand used to express ideas, people, and things that are frequently discussed between members of a group. Unlike slang, it is often developed deliberately. While a standard term may be given a more precise or unique usage amongst practitioners of relevant disciplines, it is often reported that jargon is a barrier to communication for those people unfamiliar with the respective field.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It comprised parts of what is now southern Scotland and North West England, a region the Welsh tribes referred to as \"Yr Hen Ogledd\" (\u201cthe Old North\"). At its greatest extent in the 10th century, it stretched from Loch Lomond to the River Eamont at Penrith. Strathclyde seems to have been annexed by the Goidelic-speaking Kingdom of Alba in the 11th century, becoming part of the emerging Kingdom of Scotland.\nIn its early days it was called the kingdom of Alt Clud, the Brittonic name of its capital, and it controlled the region around Dumbarton Rock. This kingdom emerged during Britain's post-Roman period and may have been founded by the Damnonii people. After the sack of Dumbarton by a Viking army from Dublin in 870, the capital seems to have moved to Govan and the kingdom became known as Strathclyde. It expanded south to the Cumbrian Mountains, into the former lands of Rheged. The neighbouring Anglo-Saxons called this enlarged kingdom \"Cumbraland\". We do not know what the inhabitants called their polity, though it may have been referred to as \u201cCumbria.\u201d\nThe language of Strathclyde is known as Cumbric, which was closely related to Old Welsh. Its inhabitants were referred to as Cumbrians. There was some later settlement by Vikings or Norse\u2013Gaels &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;, although to a lesser degree than in neighbouring Galloway. A small number of Anglian place-names show some settlement by Anglo-Saxons from Northumbria. Owing to the series of language changes in the area, it is unclear whether any Gaelic settlement took place before the 11th century.\nOrigins.\nPtolemy's \"Geographia\"\u00a0\u2013 a sailors' chart, not an ethnographical survey\u00a0\u2013 lists a number of tribes, or groups of tribes, in southern Scotland at around the time of the Roman invasion and the establishment of Roman Britain in the 1st century AD. As well as the Damnonii, Ptolemy lists the Otalini, whose capital appears to have been Traprain Law; to their west, the Selgovae in the Southern Uplands and, further west in Galloway, the Novantae. In addition, a group known as the Maeatae, probably in the area around Stirling, appear in later Roman records. The capital of the Damnonii is believed to have been at Carman, near Dumbarton, but around five miles inland from the River Clyde.\nAlthough the northern frontier of Roman Britain was Hadrian's Wall for most of its history, the extent of Roman influence north of the Wall is obscure. Certainly, Roman forts existed north of the wall, and forts as far north as Cramond may have been in long-term occupation. Moreover, the formal frontier was three times moved further north. Twice it was advanced to the line of the Antonine Wall, at about the time when Hadrian's Wall was built and again under Septimius Severus, and once further north, beyond the river Tay, during Agricola's campaigns, although, each time, it was soon withdrawn. In addition to these contacts, Roman armies undertook punitive expeditions north of the frontiers. Northern natives also travelled south of the wall, to trade, to raid and to serve in the Roman army. Roman traders may have travelled north, and Roman subsidies, or bribes, were sent to useful tribes and leaders. The extent to which Roman Britain was romanised is debated, and if there are doubts about the areas under close Roman control, then there must be even more doubts over the degree to which the Damnonii were romanised.\nThe final period of Roman Britain saw an apparent increase in attacks by land and sea, the raiders including the Picts, Scotti and the mysterious Attacotti whose origins are not certain. These raids will have also targeted the tribes of southern Scotland. The supposed final withdrawal of Roman forces around 410 is unlikely to have been of military impact on the Damnonii, although the withdrawal of pay from the residual Wall garrison will have had a very considerable economic effect.\nNo historical source gives any firm information on the boundaries of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, but suggestions have been offered on the basis of place-names and topography. Near the north end of Loch Lomond, which can be reached by boat from the Clyde, lies Clach nam Breatann, the Rock of the Britains, which is thought to have gained its name as a marker at the northern limit of Alt Clut. The Campsie Fells and the marshes between Loch Lomond and Stirling may have represented another boundary. To the south, the kingdom extended some distance up the strath of the Clyde, and along the coast probably extended south towards Ayr.\nHistory.\nThe Old North.\nThe written sources available for the period are largely Irish and Welsh, and very few indeed are contemporary with the period between 400 and 600. Irish sources report events in the kingdom of Dumbarton only when they have an Irish link. Excepting the 6th-century jeremiad by Gildas and the poetry attributed to Taliesin and Aneirin\u2014in particular \"y Gododdin\", thought to have been composed in Scotland in the 6th century\u2014Welsh sources generally date from a much later period. Some are informed by the political attitudes prevalent in Wales in the 9th century and after. Bede, whose prejudice is apparent, rarely mentions Britons, and then usually in uncomplimentary terms.\nTwo kings are known from near contemporary sources in this early period. The first is Coroticus or Ceretic Guletic (), known as the recipient of a letter from Saint Patrick, and stated by a 7th-century biographer to have been king of the Height of the Clyde, Dumbarton Rock, placing him in the second half of the 5th century. From Patrick's letter it is clear that Ceretic was a Christian, and it is likely that the ruling class of the area were also Christians, at least in name. His descendant Rhydderch Hael is named in Adomn\u00e1n's \"Life of Saint Columba\". Rhydderch was a contemporary of \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in of D\u00e1l Riata and Urien of Rheged, to whom he is linked by various traditions and tales, and also of \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia.\nThe Christianisation of southern Scotland, if Patrick's letter to Coroticus was indeed to a king in Strathclyde, had therefore made considerable progress when the first historical sources appear. Further south, at Whithorn, a Christian inscription is known from the second half of the 5th century, perhaps commemorating a new church. How this came about is unknown. Unlike Columba, Kentigern (), the supposed apostle to the Britons of the Clyde, is a shadowy figure and Jocelyn of Furness's 12th century \"Life\" is late and of doubtful authenticity though Jackson believed that Jocelyn's version might have been based on an earlier Cumbric-language original.\nThe Kingdom of Alt Clut.\nAfter 600, information on the Britons of Alt Clut becomes slightly more common in the sources. However, historians have disagreed as to how these should be interpreted. Broadly speaking, they have tended to produce theories which place their subject at the centre of the history of north Britain in the Early Historic period. The result is a series of narratives which cannot be reconciled. More recent historiography may have gone some way to addressing this problem.\nAt the beginning of the 7th century, \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in may have been the most powerful king in northern Britain, and D\u00e1l Riata was at its height. \u00c1ed\u00e1n's byname in later Welsh poetry, Aeddan Fradawg (\u00c1ed\u00e1n the Treacherous) does not speak to a favourable reputation among the Britons of Alt Clut, and it may be that he seized control of Alt Clut. \u00c1ed\u00e1n's dominance came to an end around 604, when his army, including Irish kings and Bernician exiles, was defeated by \u00c6thelfrith at the Battle of Degsastan.\nIt is supposed, on rather weak evidence, that \u00c6thelfrith, his successor Edwin and Bernician and Northumbrian kings after them expanded into southern Scotland. Such evidence as there is, such as the conquest of Elmet, the wars in north Wales and with Mercia, would argue for a more southerly focus of Northumbrian activity in the first half of the 7th century. The report in the Annals of Ulster for 638, \"the battle of Glenn Muiresan and the besieging of Eten\" (Eidyn, later Edinburgh), has been taken to represent the capture of Eidyn by the Northumbrian king Oswald, son of \u00c6thelfrith, but the Annals mention neither capture, nor Northumbrians, so this is rather a tenuous identification.\nIn 642, the Annals of Ulster report that the Britons of Alt Clut led by Eugein son of Beli defeated the men of D\u00e1l Riata and killed Domnall Brecc, grandson of \u00c1ed\u00e1n, at Strathcarron, and this victory is also recorded in an addition to \"Y Gododdin\". The site of this battle lies in the area known in later Welsh sources as Bannawg\u2014the name Bannockburn is presumed to be related\u2014which is thought to have meant the very extensive marshes and bogs between Loch Lomond and the river Forth, and the hills and lochs to the north, which separated the lands of the Britons from those of D\u00e1l Riata and the Picts, and this land was not worth fighting over. However, the lands to the south and east of this waste were controlled by smaller, nameless British kingdoms. Powerful neighbouring kings, whether in Alt Clut, D\u00e1l Riata, Pictland or Bernicia, would have imposed tribute on these petty kings, and wars for the overlordship of this area seem to have been regular events in the 6th to 8th centuries.\nThere are few definite reports of Alt Clut in the remainder of the 7th century, although it is possible that the Irish annals contain entries which may be related to Alt Clut. In the last quarter of the 7th century, a number of battles in Ireland, largely in areas along the Irish Sea coast, are reported where Britons take part. It is usually assumed that these Britons are mercenaries, or exiles dispossessed by some Anglo-Saxon conquest in northern Britain. However, it may be that these represent campaigns by kings of Alt Clut, whose kingdom was certainly part of the region linked by the Irish Sea. All of Alt Clut's neighbours, Northumbria, Pictland and D\u00e1l Riata, are known to have sent armies to Ireland on occasions.\nThe Annals of Ulster in the early 8th century report two battles between Alt Clut and D\u00e1l Riata, at \"Lorg Ecclet\" (unknown) in 711, and at \"the rock called Minuirc\" in 717. Whether their appearance in the record has any significance or whether it is just happenstance is unclear. Later in the 8th century, it appears that the Pictish king \u00d3engus made at least three campaigns against Alt Clut, none successful. In 744 the Picts acted alone, and in 750 \u00d3engus may have cooperated with Eadberht of Northumbria in a campaign in which Talorgan, brother of \u00d3engus, was killed in a heavy Pictish defeat at the hands of Teudebur of Alt Clut, perhaps at Mugdock, near Milngavie. Eadberht is said to have taken the plain of Kyle in 750, around modern Ayr, presumably from Alt Clut.\nTeudebur died around 752, and it was probably his son Dumnagual who faced a joint effort by \u00d3engus and Eadberht in 756. The Picts and Northumbrians laid siege to Dumbarton Rock, and extracted a submission from Dumnagual. It is doubtful whether the agreement, whatever it may have been, was kept, for Eadberht's army was all but wiped out\u2014whether by their supposed allies or by recent enemies is unclear\u2014on its way back to Northumbria.\nAfter this, little is heard of Alt Clut or its kings until the 9th century. The \"burning\", the usual term for capture, of Alt Clut is reported in 780, although by whom and in what circumstances is not known. Thereafter Dunblane was burned by the men of Alt Clut in 849, perhaps in the reign of Artgal.\nThe Viking Age.\nAn army, led by the Viking chiefs known in Irish as Amla\u00edb Conung and \u00cdmar, laid siege in 870 to Alt Clut, a siege which lasted some four months and led to the destruction of the citadel and the taking of a very large number of captives. The siege and capture are reported by Welsh and Irish sources, and the Annals of Ulster say that in 871, after overwintering on the Clyde:\nKing Arthgal ap Dyfnwal, called \"king of the Britons of Strathclyde\", was killed in Dublin in 872 at the instigation of Causant\u00edn mac Cin\u00e1eda. He was followed by his son Run of Alt Clut, who was married to Causant\u00edn's sister. Eochaid, the result of this marriage, may have been king of Strathclyde, or of the kingdom of Alba.\nFrom this time forward, and perhaps from much earlier, the kingdom of Strathclyde was subject to periodic domination by the kings of Alba. However, the earlier idea, that the heirs to the Scots throne ruled Strathclyde, or Cumbria as an appanage, has relatively little support, and the degree of Scots control should not be overstated. This period probably saw a degree of Norse, or Norse-Gael settlement in Strathclyde. A number of place-names, in particular a cluster on the coast facing the Cumbraes, and monuments such as the hogback graves at Govan, are some of the remains of these newcomers.\nIn the late ninth century the Vikings almost conquered England, apart from the southern kingdom of Wessex, but in the 910s the West Saxon king Edward the Elder and his sister \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, Lady of the Mercians, recovered England south of the Humber. According to the \"Fragmentary Annals of Ireland\", \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d formed an alliance with Strathclyde and Scotland against the Vikings, and in the view of the historian Tim Clarkson Strathclyde seems to have made substantial territorial gains at this time, some at the expense of the Norse Vikings. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" states that in 920 the kings of Britain, including the king of Strathclyde (who is not named), submitted to Edward. However, historians are sceptical of the claim as Edward's power was confined to southern Britain, and they think it was probably a peace settlement which did not involve submission. The names of Strathclyde's rulers in this period are uncertain, but Dyfnwal is thought to have been king in the early tenth century, and he was probably succeeded by his son Owain before 920.\nIn 927 Edward's son \u00c6thelstan conquered Viking-ruled Northumbria, and thus became the first king of England. At Eamont Bridge on 27 July several kings accepted his overlordship, including Constantine of Scotland. Sources differ on whether the meeting was attended by Owain of Strathclyde or Owain ap Hywel of Gwent, but it could have been both. In 934 \u00c6thelstan invaded Scotland and laid waste to the country. Owain was an ally of the Scottish king and it is likely that Strathclyde was also ravaged. Owain attested \u00c6thelstan's charters as sub-king in 931 and 935 (charters S 413, 434 and 1792), but in 937 he joined Constantine and the Vikings in invading England. The result was an overwhelming victory for the English at the Battle of Brunanburh.\nFollowing the battle of Brunanburh, Owain's son Dyfnwal ab Owain became king of Strathclyde. It is likely that whereas Scotland allied with England, Strathclyde held to its alliance with the Vikings. In 945, \u00c6thelstan's half-brother Edmund, who had succeeded to the English throne in 939, ravaged Strathclyde. According to the thirteenth-century chronicler Roger of Wendover, Edmund had two sons of Dyfnwal blinded, perhaps to deprive their father of throneworthy heirs. Edmund then gave the kingdom to King Malcolm I of Scotland in return for a pledge to defend it on land and on sea, but Dyfnwal soon recovered his kingdom. He died on pilgrimage to Rome in 975.\nThe end of Strathclyde.\nIf the kings of Alba imagined, as John of Fordun did, that they were rulers of Strathclyde, the death of Cuil\u00e9n mac Iduilb and his brother Eochaid at the hands of Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal in 971, said to be in revenge for the rape or abduction of his daughter, shows otherwise. A major source for confusion comes from the name of Rhydderch's successor, M\u00e1el Coluim, now thought to be a son of the Dyfnwal ab Owain who died in Rome, but long confused with the later king of Scots M\u00e1el Coluim mac Cin\u00e1eda. M\u00e1el Coluim appears to have been followed by Owen the Bald who is thought to have died at the battle of Carham in 1018. It seems likely that Owen had a successor, although his name is unknown.\nSome time after 1018 and before 1054, the kingdom of Strathclyde appears to have been conquered by the Scots, most probably during the reign of M\u00e1el Coluim mac Cin\u00e1eda who died in 1034. In 1054, the English king Edward the Confessor dispatched Earl Siward of Northumbria against the Scots, ruled by Mac Bethad mac Findl\u00e1ich (Macbeth), along with an otherwise unknown \"Malcolm son of the king of the Cumbrians\", in Strathclyde. The name Malcolm or M\u00e1el Coluim again caused confusion, some historians later supposing that this was the later king of Scots M\u00e1el Coluim mac Donnchada (M\u00e1el Coluim Cenn M\u00f3r). It is not known if Malcolm/M\u00e1el Coluim ever became \"king of the Cumbrians\", or, if so, for how long.\nThe Keswick area was conquered by the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria in the 7th century, but Northumbria was destroyed by the Vikings in the late 9th. In the early 10th century it became part of Strathclyde; it remained part of Strathclyde until about 1050, when Siward, Earl of Northumbria, conquered that part of Cumbria.\nCarlisle was part of Scotland by 1066, and thus was not recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book. This changed in 1092, when William the Conqueror's son William Rufus invaded the region and incorporated Cumberland into England. The construction of Carlisle Castle began in 1093 on the site of the Roman fort, south of the River Eden. The castle was rebuilt in stone in 1112, with a keep and the city walls.\nBy the 1070s, if not earlier in the reign of M\u00e1el Coluim mac Donnchada, it appears that the Scots again controlled Strathclyde. It is certain that Strathclyde did indeed become an appanage, for it was granted by Alexander I to his brother David, Prince of the Cumbrians, later David I, in 1107.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night. Various \"typical\" or \"traditional\" breakfast menus exist, with food choices varying by regions and traditions worldwide.\nHistory.\nIn Old English, a regular morning meal was called , and the word \"dinner\", which originated from Gallo-Romance \"desjunare\" (\"to break one's fast\"), referred to a meal after fasting. Around the mid-13th century, that meaning of \"dinner\" faded away, and around the 15th century \"breakfast\" came into use in written English to describe a morning meal.\nAncient breakfast.\nAncient Egypt.\nIn Ancient Egypt, peasants ate a daily meal, most likely in the morning, consisting of soup, beer, bread, and onions before they left for work in the fields or work commanded by the pharaohs.\nThe traditional breakfast believed to have been cooked in ancient Egypt was f\u016bl (made from fava beans, possibly the ancestor of today's ful medames), baladi bread, made from emmer wheat, and falafel, and a mixture of fava beans with onions, garlic, parsley and coriander.\nAncient Greece.\nIn Greek literature, there are numerous mentions of , a meal taken not long after sunrise. The \"Iliad\" notes this meal with regard to a labor-weary woodsman eager for a light repast to start his day, preparing it even as he is aching with exhaustion. The opening prose of the 16th book of the \"Odyssey\" mentions breakfast as the meal being prepared in the morning before attending to one's chores. Eventually was moved to around noon, and a new morning meal was introduced.\nIn the post-Homeric classical period of Greece, a meal called was typically consumed immediately after rising in the morning. (, ) consisted of barley bread dipped in wine (, ), sometimes complemented by figs or olives. They also made pancakes called (), (), or (), all words deriving from (), meaning \"frying pan\". The earliest attested references on are in the works of the 5th century BC poets Cratinus and Magnes. Another kind of pancake was (), from (), \"of flour or dough of spelt\", derived itself from (), \"flour of spelt\". Athenaeus in his Deipnosophistae mentions topped with honey, sesame and cheese.\nAncient Rome.\nRomans called breakfast . It was usually composed of everyday staples like bread, cheese, olives, salad, nuts, raisins, and cold meat left over from the night before. They also drank wine-based drinks such as , a mixture of wine, honey, and aromatic spices. 1st century Latin poet Martial said that was eaten at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, while 16th century scholar Claudius Saumaise wrote that it was typically eaten at 9:00 or 10:00\u00a0a.m. It seems unlikely that any fixed time was truly assigned for this meal.\nRoman soldiers woke up to a breakfast of , porridge similar to the Italian polenta, made from roasted spelt wheat or barley that was then pounded and cooked in a cauldron of water.\nMiddle Ages (500\u20131500).\nEurope.\nIn the European Middle Ages, breakfast was commonly eaten by working people, as well as children, the elderly, the sick, while the upper classes didn't speak of or partake in eating in the morning. Eating breakfast meant that one was poor, was a low-status farmer or laborer who truly needed the energy to sustain his morning's labor, or was too weak to make it to the large, midday dinner. Monarchs and their entourages would spend a lot of time around a table for meals. Only two formal meals were eaten per day\u2014one at mid-day and one in the evening. The exact times varied by period and region, but this two-meal system remained consistent throughout the Middle Ages.\nIn the 13th century, breakfast when eaten sometimes consisted of a piece of rye bread and a bit of cheese. Morning meals would not include any meat, and would likely include of low alcohol-content beers. Uncertain quantities of bread and ale could have been consumed in between meals.\nBy the 15th century, breakfast in western Europe often included meat. By this time, noble men were seen to indulge in breakfast, making it more of a common practice, and by the early 16th century, recorded expenses for breakfast became customary. Breakfast in eastern Europe remained mostly the same as the modern day: a \"continental breakfast\". The 16th century introduction of caffeinated beverages into the European diet was also an addition to breakfast; it was believed that coffee and tea aid the body in \"evacuation of superfluities\".\nModern breakfast (1500\u2013present).\nAfrica.\nTraditionally, the various cuisines of Africa use a combination of locally available fruits, cereal grains and vegetables, as well as milk and meat products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features milk, curd and whey products. A type of porridge is most commonly eaten. In the book \"The Bible cyclop\u00e6dia (et al.)\" published in 1843, it was documented that during this time in the Arab world, Bedouins often utilized locusts mixed with butter for breakfast, spreading the mixture on unleavened bread.\nEgypt.\nIn the book \"The Bible cyclop\u00e6dia (et al.)\" published in 1843, it was documented that Egyptians were early risers that sometimes had a first meal consisting of coffee along with the smoking of a pipe, and did not eat breakfast until noon. At this time, it was documented that Egyptian breakfast foods included bread, cheese, eggs, butter, curds, clotted cream and stewed beans. In addition, fava beans are an established national breakfast dish.\nAsia.\nMiddle East.\nIn the Middle East region of Asia, refers to the evening meal when Muslims break their (fast) during the Islamic month of Ramadan. is one of the religious observances of Ramadan, and is often done as a community, with people gathering to break their fast together. is done right after (sunset) time. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims replace traditional breakfast with , an Islamic term referring to the meal consumed early in the morning by Muslims before during daylight hours. The meal is eaten before (dawn).\nJapan.\nIn Japan, it is common to eat miso soup and rice porridge for breakfast.\nLebanon.\nIn the book \"The Bible cyclop\u00e6dia (et al.)\" it was documented that c.\u20091843, poor Lebanese people would consume raw leeks with bread for breakfast.\nEurope.\nAustria.\nThe croissant appears to have originated in Vienna, Austria, in 1683.\nFrance.\nFrench breakfasts are often similar to the continental breakfast. French breakfast pastries include apple turnovers, brioche, croissant and pain au chocolat. Croissants have been described as becoming a standard fare in French breakfast cuisine by 1875.\nNetherlands.\nBreakfast usually consists of bread with a wide variety of cold cuts, cheeses and sweet toppings; such as \"hagelslag\", \"vlokken\", \"muisjes\", \"gestampte muisjes\", chocolate spread, treacle (a thick, dark brown sugar syrup called \"stroop\"), apple butter and peanut butter.\nThe word waffle derives from the Dutch word , which itself derives from the Middle Dutch , and is likely the origin of the food as it is known today.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the early 16th century, some physicians warned against eating breakfast, because they said it was not healthy to eat before a prior meal was digested. By the 1550s, however, there were multiple sources that claimed breakfast was an important meal. For example, in 1551, Thomas Wingfield stated that breakfast was essential. In 1589, Thomas Cogan stated that it was unhealthy to miss breakfast in the morning. He was one of the first to claim that it was healthy for those who were not young, ill or elders to eat breakfast.\nThe full breakfast is a staple of British cuisine, and typically consists of bacon, sausages and eggs, often served with a variety of side dishes and a beverage such as coffee or tea. Prior to 1600, breakfast in Great Britain typically included bread, cold meat or fish, and ale. Tea, chocolate and coffee were introduced to Great Britain in the mid-1600s, and in the 1700s coffee and chocolate were adopted as breakfast drinks by the fashionable. Tea eventually became more popular than chocolate as a breakfast drink.\nNorth America.\nThe first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar were indigenous peoples living in the northeastern part of North America. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region.\nCanada.\nWhile it has been a source of controversy where the lumberjack breakfast came from, the most cited source is that the lumberjack breakfast was first served in a Vancouver hotel, in 1870. The breakfast consisted of eggs, assorted fried pork strips, and flapjacks. It is said by Anita Stewart that the tradition of hearty cooking developed because of men needing the energy for manual labor.\nMexico.\nA typical Aztec breakfast often included corn porridge with honey and chillies, or tortillas with beans and salsa.\nChilaquiles are a staple breakfast dish that dates back to the times of the Aztecs; they consist of tortilla chips (locally known as \"totopos\") slathered in salsa and usually come with a side of refried beans. Depending on the region or person, they may be eaten with fried or scrambled eggs, pulled chicken, sprinkled cheese, crema, diced onion, or chopped cilantro (coriander) leaves. Eggs are also a staple in Mexican breakfasts, scrambled and fried eggs are usually eaten with tortillas, salsa, and beans; local varieties include huevos rancheros and \"huevos con tortilla\", which are scrambled eggs fried alongside pieces of corn tortillas.\nBreakfast cereals are also common in Mexico, mainly due to American influence. Health concerns have arisen regarding the nutritional quality of processed breakfast cereal; it is estimated that Mexican preschoolers consume 7% of their total energy intake from processed breakfast cereals and that 6% of Mexican children exclusively have ready-to-eat cereals with milk for breakfast.\nUnited States.\nIn 1620, waffles were first introduced to North America by pilgrims who had lived in the Netherlands. Later pioneers consumed largely cornmeal-based breakfasts, and would also consume meals such as oatmeal for dinner and lunch. Common breakfast products included corn pone, johnnycakes, ashcakes, hoe-cakes, and corn dodgers. Ashcakes consisted of cornmeal wrapped in cabbage leaves cooked in the ashes of a campfire, while corn pone is baked, corn dodgers are pan fried, and hoe-cakes are similar to pancakes. After the American Civil War, it became fairly common in America to eat sandwiches that were made of ham and eggs. These sandwiches were not strictly consumed in the morning. In 1897, the first true breakfast sandwich recipe was published in a cookbook.\nPopcorn cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s, which typically consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener. Cold breakfast cereal has been consumed by Americans since the late 1890s, and during the 1920s a considerable number of new cereals were marketed. The reason for this movement towards cold breakfast cereals was inspired by the Jacksonian-era Clean Living Movement (1830\u20131860). This movement focused on a lot of lifestyle changes, but specific to breakfast it claimed that eating bacon, eggs, pancakes and hot coffee was too indulgent. The first prepared cold breakfast cereal marketed to American consumers was created by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, who introduced it in 1878 and named it granola. The product was prepared with baked wheat, oatmeal and cornmeal, and was the first brand-name breakfast cereal in the United States.\nCanned fruit juice became prominent as a breakfast beverage after the discovery of vitamins. C. 1900, orange juice as a breakfast beverage was a new concept. The development of frozen orange juice concentrate began in 1915, and in the 1930s it was produced by several companies. Additionally, mass-produced tomato juice began to be marketed in the mid-1920s, and became a popular breakfast drink a few years thereafter.\nThe Caribbean.\nHaitian spaghetti is a common breakfast dish in Haitian cuisine.\nEffect on health.\nWhile breakfast is commonly referred to as \"the most important meal of the day\", some contest the positive implications of its \"most important\" status.\nScientific findings.\nSome epidemiological research indicates that having breakfast high in rapidly available carbohydrates increases the risk of metabolic syndrome.\nMemory was found to be adversely affected in subjects of a study who had not eaten their breakfast (q.v. also \"Studies using mice\" under this heading). Intelligence was not affected. Children aged within 8 and 11 years were found to have differing brainwave; EEG activity states, causative to breakfast consumption. Non-breakfasting children were observed to have higher activity of upper and lower theta wave, alpha wave, and delta wave, which indicated a causative relationship of breakfast consumption to memory function in the subjects.\nA review of 47 studies associating breakfast to (i) nutrition, (ii) body weight and (iii) academic performance found amongst those who had eaten breakfast: (i) better nutrition profiles, many studies found less weight (ii) irrespective of greater calorific consumption per day, although a number did not find this correlation, (iii) studies suggested a possible link to better academic performance in the breakfast eating groups (q.v. Benton and Parker 1998, under this heading).\nThe influence of breakfast on managing body weight is unclear.\nHealthy choice.\nPresent professional opinion is largely in favor of eating breakfast, but skipping breakfast might be better than eating unhealthy foods.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The series features an ensemble cast, with Kiefer Sutherland starring as American counter-terrorist federal agent Jack Bauer. Each season covers 24 consecutive hours using the real time method of narration, which is emphasized by the display of split screens and a digital clock. Multiple ongoing plot lines of intersecting relevance are covered, with Bauer's plot line serving as the link throughout. The show premiered on November 6, 2001, and spanned 204 episodes over nine seasons, with the series finale broadcast on July 14, 2014. In addition, the television film \"\" aired between seasons six and seven, on November 23, 2008. \"24\" is a joint production by Imagine Television and 20th Century Fox Television.\nAt the start of the series, Bauer is already a highly proficient agent with an \"ends justify the means\" approach. This means that he will usually threaten, disregard and lie to anyone who refuses to cooperate with him. Throughout the series, the plot elements contain both a political thriller and serial drama, with each episode typically ending on a cliffhanger. Bauer uses people on both sides of the law in his attempts to prevent terrorist attacks and bring down those responsible, sometimes at great personal expense. These attacks include presidential assassination attempts, bomb detonations, bioterrorism, cyberwarfare, as well as conspiracies that involve government and corporate corruption.\n\"24\" received generally positive reviews, with the fifth season being universally praised by critics. However, the series was criticized for perceived Islamophobia and glorification of torture. The show won numerous awards throughout its run, including Best Drama Series at the 2004 Golden Globe Awards and Outstanding Drama Series at the 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards. In May 2013, it was announced that \"24\" would return with a 12-episode limited series titled ', which aired from May 5 to July 14, 2014, bringing the episode count to 204. A spin-off series, ', premiered on February 5, 2017, lasting a single 12-episode season. \"24\" is the longest-running American espionage- or counterterrorism-themed television drama, surpassing both \"\" and Britain's \"The Avengers\".\nSynopsis.\nPremise.\n\"24\" is a serial drama starring Kiefer Sutherland as central character Jack Bauer, an agent initially with the Counter Terrorist Unit Los Angeles Division (CTU), whose mandate is to protect the United States from terrorist plots. The episodes take place over the course of one hour, depicting events as they happen, in real time. However, commercial breaks are normally used to skip several minutes multiple times, which means that about 17 minutes of each hour is not shown. To emphasize the real-world flow of events, a clock is prominently displayed on-screen at certain points during the show, and there is regular use of split screens, a technique used to depict multiple scenes occurring simultaneously.\nIn addition to Bauer, each episode typically follows other American government officials from CTU/FBI/CIA and the White House, as well as the conspirators who set the events in motion. Because many of these conspirators commit murder for political gain, several of Bauer's contacts are killed as a consequence of government intervention. The grief that Bauer experiences from these deaths is often explored throughout the series. While Bauer does have the utmost respect for most of his colleagues, friends and family members, he always believes himself to know how to provide the best way of saving innocent lives and/or achieving his own sense of justice, often being proven right when taking action.\n\"24\" is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal relationships, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Also, season 4 is notable for a scene in which two men\u2014one of whom possesses crucial information\u2014are dying in a room with only one surgeon.\nOverview.\nSeason 1 begins at midnight on the day of the California presidential primary in Los Angeles. Counter Terrorist Unit Agent Jack Bauer's objective is to protect presidential candidate Senator David Palmer from an assassination attempt and rescue his own family from those responsible, the Drazen syndicate, led by Serbian war criminal Victor Drazen, and his sons, Alexis and Andre, who seek retribution for Jack and Palmer's involvement with a covert American mission in the Balkans.\nSeason 2, set 18 months later, begins at 8:00\u00a0a.m. Jack must stop a nuclear bomb from detonating in Los Angeles, then assist the now-President Palmer in proving who is responsible for the threat and avoid war between the U.S. and three Middle Eastern countries.\nSeason 3, set three years later, begins at 1:00\u00a0p.m. Jack must infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel led by Ramon and Hector Salazar, to seize a deadly virus being marketed underground. President Palmer must deal with a potential scandal that could cost him his presidency.\nSeason 4, set 18 months later, begins at 7:00\u00a0a.m. Jack must save the lives of his new boss, United States Secretary of Defense James Heller, who Jack now works for as a special assistant, and Heller's daughter Audrey Raines (with whom Jack is romantically involved) when they are kidnapped by terrorists. However, Turkish terrorist mastermind Habib Marwan uses this as a disguise to launch further attacks against America, and Jack is forced to use unorthodox methods to stop him, which results in long-term consequences for both Jack and the United States.\nSeason 5, set 18 months after, begins at 7:00\u00a0a.m. Jack is believed to be dead by everyone except a few of his closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are assassinated and he is framed by terrorists with connections to the U.S. government. The acquisition of nerve gas by the terrorists poses a new threat, and Jack discovers an insidious conspiracy while trying to stop those responsible.\nSeason 6, set 20 months later, begins at 6:00\u00a0a.m. Jack is released after being captured by Chinese official Cheng Zhi and being detained in a Chinese prison following the events of Season 5. Terrorists led by Abu Fayed who hold a vendetta against Jack plot to set off suitcase nuclear devices in America. Later, Jack is forced to choose between those he loves and national security when the Chinese set their sights on sensitive circuitry that could trigger a war between the U.S. and Russia.\n\"\", set three-and-a-half years later, begins at 3:00\u00a0p.m. Jack finds himself caught up in a military coup d'\u00e9tat in the fictional African nation of Sangala. Militants are being provided assistance from officials within the United States, where Senator Allison Taylor is being sworn into office as president. Due to the 2007\u201308 Writers' Strike, season seven was delayed one year. To bridge the one-and-a-half-year gap between seasons, \"Redemption\" was produced. This television film aired on November 23, 2008.\nSeason 7, set 65 days after the end of \"Redemption\", begins at 8:00\u00a0a.m. CTU is disbanded, and Jack is assisted by the FBI and covert operatives when the firewall for America's federal computer infrastructure is breached by the same people responsible for a conflict in Sangala. Jack must uncover corruption within the now-President Taylor's administration, which has allowed the Sangalans to raid the White House and capture Taylor. She is later blackmailed by Starkwood, a fictional private military company led by its CEO, Jonas Hodges, in an attempt to release biological weapons on U.S. soil.\nSeason 8, set 18 months later, begins at 4:00\u00a0p.m. Jack is brought in by the now-reinstated CTU to uncover a Russian plot to assassinate Middle Eastern leader Omar Hassan, the President of the fictional country of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan, during peace negotiations with President Taylor at the United Nations in New York City. Russia's contingency plan involves engineering a dirty bomb, which Islamic extremists threaten to detonate in Manhattan unless Hassan is handed over. Jack later seeks retribution for personal losses suffered, including the death of ex-FBI Special Agent Renee Walker, after former President Charles Logan convinces Taylor to cover up these crimes to protect the peace agreement. Jack finds himself at odds with both the Russian and U.S. governments.\n\"\", set four years later, begins at 11:00\u00a0a.m. and finds a fugitive Jack in London trying to stop an assassination attempt on the now-President Heller and later a drone terrorist attack on London by terrorist Margot Al-Harazi while being hunted by but later working with the CIA. Later, Jack must prevent an old enemy, Cheng Zhi, and Russian diplomat Anatol Stolnavich, from sparking a war between the U.S. and China.\nCast and characters.\nThe following cast members have been credited as main cast in the opening credits:\n[a] &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Bernard does not appear in regular \"Live Another Day\" episodes, but appears in the story extension mini-episode titled \"Solitary\" that was released on the \"Live Another Day\" Blu-ray and DVD sets. Bernard also appeared in the \"24\" spin-off series '.[b] &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Both Parrilla and Cross initially appear as guest stars for their first several appearances in season 4 before becoming main cast members.\nProduction.\nConception.\nThe idea for the series first came from executive producer Joel Surnow, who initially had the idea of a TV show with 24 episodes in a season. Each episode would be an hour long, taking place over the course of a single day. He discussed the idea over the phone with producer Robert Cochran, whose initial response was \"Forget it, that's the worst idea I've ever heard, it will never work and it's too hard\". They met the next day at the International House of Pancakes in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, to discuss the idea of this action-espionage series that used the format of real time to create dramatic tension with a race against the clock.\nThe pilot for \"24\" was pitched to Fox who immediately bought it, saying they felt that the idea for the series was one that would \"move the form of television forward\". The episode had a $4 million budget with filming in March 2001. The set of CTU was initially done in a Fox Sports office, with the set reproduced once the series was picked up for the season. The series was supposed to be filmed in Toronto, but due to the variability of Canadian weather, Los Angeles was chosen as a filming location.\nThe pilot of the series was well received by critics, and was signed on for an initial thirteen episodes. Production began in July 2001, and the premiere was planned for October 30, but because of the September 11 attacks, delayed until November 6. After the first three episodes, Fox greenlit the remaining filmed 11 episodes and following Kiefer Sutherland's Golden Globe win, Fox ordered the second half of the season.\nDesign.\nAlthough not the first to do so, \"24\" embraced the concept of real time. This idea started when producer Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing \"24 episodes in a season, with each episode lasting an hour\". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a \"race against the clock\". Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact time is denoted by the digital clock display at the beginning and end of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen. The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode. In line with the depiction of events in real time, \"24\" does not use slow motion techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first-season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours. As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.\nAnother idea was the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace parallel adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.\nA major concept used in the series was the idea of a running clock. This initially came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.\nSetting.\nThe first six seasons of the show are mostly based in Los Angeles and nearby California locations\u2014both real and fictional. Other locations, such as Washington, D.C., are featured in parts of the fourth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The eighth season takes place in New York City, the TV film \"Redemption\", filmed in South Africa, is mainly set in the fictional African nation of Sangala, and the ninth season \"Live Another Day\" is set in London.\nThe main setting of the show is the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit. Its office consists of two main departments: Field Operations, which involves confronting and apprehending suspects, and Communications, which gathers intelligence and assists those that work in Field Operations. CTU offices are established in various cities with these units reporting to \"Divisions\", and Divisions reporting to the \"District\". While CTU itself is a fictional agency, several entities with similar names or duties, like the National Counterterrorism Center, have emerged since the show's debut on television.\nThe set of CTU was initially filmed in a Fox Sports office, with the set recreated in a studio in Woodland Hills after the series was picked up. The same set was used for the first three seasons, but production moved to an old pencil factory in Chatsworth before the start of the fourth season and the CTU set was redesigned. It was redesigned again before the start of the eighth season. Other sets were also constructed here, such as Charles Logan's presidential retreat shown in seasons five and six, and the White House bunker shown in seasons four and six.\nThe writers have stated that events in the \"24\" timeline take place in the \"perpetual now,\" where dates are never specified by the show and concepts of the exact date and year are left vague and unconfirmed; however, in January 2008, producer Howard Gordon confirmed that accounting for the passage of various presidential administrations, the seventh season would be set in 2017.\nSeries conclusion.\nOn March 26, 2010, a statement was issued from Fox that explained that season eight would conclude the original series. Kiefer Sutherland gave a statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This has been the role of a lifetime, and I will never be able to fully express my appreciation to everyone who made it possible. While the end of the series is bittersweet, we always wanted \"24\" to finish on a high note, so the decision to make the eighth season our last was one we all agreed upon. This feels like the culmination of all our efforts from the writers to the actors to our fantastic crew and everyone at Fox. Looking ahead to the future, Howard Gordon and I are excited about the opportunity to create the feature film version of \"24\". But when all is said and done, it is the loyal worldwide fan base that made it possible for me to have the experience of playing the role of Jack Bauer, and for that I am eternally grateful.\nExecutive producer and showrunner Howard Gordon was also a part of the decision. He was quoted saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Kiefer and I have loved every minute of making \"24\", but we all believe that now is the right time to call it a day. I echo his sentiments of gratitude toward the show's amazing creative team, as well as the studio and network who have always believed in us and shown us unbelievable support.\nPeter Rice, Chairman of Entertainment at Fox Networks Group said, \"\"24\" is so much more than just a TV show\u00a0\u2013 it has redefined the drama genre and created one of the most admired action icons in television history.\" Kevin Reilly, President of Entertainment at Fox Broadcasting Company added, \"We are extremely proud of this groundbreaking series and will be forever thankful to Kiefer, the producers, the cast and crew for everything they've put into \"24\" over the years. It's truly been an amazing and unforgettable eight days.\nThe final episode of season 8 aired on May 24, 2010.\nRelation to other productions.\nImmediately prior to \"24\", series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran executive-produced \"La Femme Nikita\" for its entire five-year run on USA Network. Both series deal with anti-terrorist operations, and the lead characters of both series are placed in situations in which they must make a tragic choice in order to serve the greater good. There are numerous on- and off-screen creative connections between \"24\" and \"La Femme Nikita\". Several actors from \"La Femme Nikita\" have portrayed similar roles on \"24\", a number of story concepts from \"La Femme Nikita\" have been revisited on \"24\", and many of the creative personnel from \"La Femme Nikita\" worked on \"24\" in their same role.\nSimilar to the 1997 film, \"Air Force One\", \"24\" featured the president's personal jumbo-jet (Air Force One). Air Force One was featured in \"24\" seasons 2 and 4. Air Force Two (carrying the Vice President but not the President) was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in \"24\", such as Xander Berkeley, Glenn Morshower, Wendy Crewson, Timothy Carhart, J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, Tom Everett and Spencer Garrett also appeared in the film \"Air Force One\". The 25th amendment, which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President and responding to presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series. \"24\" used the same Air Force One set from another television series, \"The West Wing\".\nFeature film development.\nA feature film adaptation of \"24\" was originally planned for the hiatus between the sixth and seventh seasons. Series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran were set to write the script with showrunner Howard Gordon working on story. Filming was going to take place in London, Prague, and Morocco. Plans for the film were later put on hold. Kiefer Sutherland explained, \"It's impossible to ask writers to work on the show and then come up with an amazing film we can shoot in the break between seasons.\"\nIt was later decided that the film would begin after the conclusion of the eighth and final season. It was to be set and shot on-location in Europe. Surnow, Cochran, Gordon, and Sutherland were going to be executive producers on the film, and Billy Ray was going to write the screenplay. Shooting was planned to start in late 2010 or early 2011.\nIn April 2010, Sutherland said in an interview at a BAFTA event in London that the script was finished and he would be reading it upon his return to the United States. He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame. Sutherland described the film production as \"exciting\" because, \"It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so we were not going to be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show.\"\nIn June 2010, it was reported that plans were made to create a film titled \"Die Hard 24/7\", which would serve as a crossover between \"24\" and the \"Die Hard\" franchise, with Sutherland to reprise his role as Jack Bauer alongside Bruce Willis' John McClane. However, these plans never came to fruition, with the studio instead opting to create the film \"A Good Day to Die Hard\".\nIn November 2010, executive producer Gordon revealed that a \"work in progress\" screenplay was being read by Fox, but that the film did not yet have a green-light or fixed schedule. In December 2010, Gordon revealed that Fox turned down the script by Ray, stating, \"It wasn't strong enough or compelling enough\". By that time, Gordon was no longer involved with the project, but stated that director Tony Scott would pitch an idea to Sutherland, an involvement ending with Scott's death in August 2012.\nExecutive producer Brian Grazer tweeted in April 2011 that the film was planned for a 2012 release. At the 2011 Television Critics Association press tour, former showrunner Gordon stated that \"conversations are definitely happening\" about the film, and that they are just looking for the right script before moving forward. In September 2011, Sutherland indicated the script was almost complete. After some small script alterations by screenwriter Mark Bomback, filming was announced to begin in spring 2012, after Sutherland became available in April.\nIn March 2012, 20th Century Fox stopped production before filming could begin. Budgetary issues remained unresolved and Sutherland's narrow time frame for filming were cited as reasons for halting production. However, in July 2012, Sutherland assured the film was still in plans and that they would begin filming in summer 2013. The film was eventually suspended in May 2013 after the announcement that the show would return as a limited series.\nSutherland said in January 2014 that \"the film is an ongoing situation.\" After \"Live Another Day\" received highly positive reception, a new idea for the feature film surfaced in September 2014, spearheaded by Grazer. In January 2016, Sutherland stated that he has \"no idea if the \"24\" movie will ever happen, or Jack Bauer might end up finding his way into an episode one day and clarifying all of that, or ending all of that.\" This was in reference to concluding his character's story arc in a future iteration of the franchise.\nIn July 2024, it was reported that a \"24\" feature film was in early development at 20th Century Studios and Imagine Entertainment. In November 2025, Imagine Entertainment president Justin Wilkes said there were plans to continue \"24\" with Jack Bauer by way of a theatrical film or follow-up television series.\n\"Live Another Day\".\nIn May 2013, \"Deadline Hollywood\" first reported that Fox was considering a limited-run \"event series\" for \"24\" based on a concept by Howard Gordon, after failed efforts to produce the \"24\" feature film and the cancellation of Kiefer Sutherland's series \"Touch\". The following week, Fox officially announced \"24: Live Another Day\", a limited-run series of twelve episodes that would feature the return of Jack Bauer. Fox CEO Kevin Reilly said that the series would essentially represent the twelve \"most important\" hours of a typical \"24\" season, with jumps forward between hours as needed. As with the rest of Fox's push into event programming, the production was said to have \"a big scope and top talent and top marketing budgets.\"\nIn June 2013, it was announced that Jon Cassar was signed to executive produce and direct multiple episodes of \"Live Another Day\", including the first two. Executive producers and writers Robert Cochran, Manny Coto and Evan Katz were also announced to return with Sean Callery returning as the music composer for the series.\nMary Lynn Rajskub was announced as the second official cast member in August 2013, reprising her role as Chloe O'Brian. In October 2013, it was confirmed that Kim Raver and William Devane would reprise their roles as Audrey Raines and James Heller, respectively. New actors joining the cast included Michael Wincott as Adrian Cross, an infamous hacker; Gbenga Akinnagbe and Giles Matthey as CIA agents Erik Ritter and Jordan Reed, respectively; Benjamin Bratt as Steve Navarro, the head of CIA operations tracking Jack Bauer in London; Yvonne Strahovski as Kate Morgan, a \"brilliant but impulsive CIA field operative in London\"; and Stephen Fry as Alistair Davies, the British Prime Minister. In October 2013, it was confirmed the series would be set and filmed in London, England.\n\"24: Live Another Day\" premiered on May 5, 2014, on Fox. The series is set four years after the events of season 8, and adheres to the original real time concept: The main plot is set between 11:00\u00a0a.m. and 10:50\u00a0p.m., with each episode corresponding to an hour; however, the concluding episode's final part features a 12-hour time jump enabling the show to join up the full 24 hour period back to 11:00\u00a0a.m.\n\"Legacy\".\nIn January 2015, another installment of the franchise was pitched by executive producers Howard Gordon, Evan Katz, Manny Coto and Brian Grazer, which would revolve around a stable of supporting characters rather than Kiefer Sutherland in the lead role. In January 2016, Fox announced it had ordered a pilot for a spin-off series titled \"24: Legacy\", which would feature a new cast, with no returning characters except Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard). The series retains the real-time format, but consists of 12 episodes, using a time jump to cover a single day. Stephen Hopkins, who directed the original \"24\" pilot and several first-season episodes, directed the \"Legacy\" pilot. Jon Cassar also returned to direct and produce 6 of the 12 episodes. Corey Hawkins and Miranda Otto play the two lead characters \u2013 Hawkins as Eric Carter, a military hero returning home and Otto as Rebecca Ingram, a former head of CTU. The pilot was officially ordered to series in April 2016 and premiered on February 5, 2017, immediately after Super Bowl LI. In June 2017, the series was canceled after one season.\nOther spin-offs.\nIn July 2018, it was announced that Fox was in the early stages of developing a prequel series that would tell the origin story about Jack Bauer in his early days. Original creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran and executive producer Howard Gordon were set to write the script with. In August 2018, it was announced that Fox was also developing another potential spin-off, which would be a legal thriller. In February 2019, Fox passed on the legal thriller, but were continuing to develop the prequel. In January 2020, Fox confirmed that they had scrapped the potential prequel series as well.\nIn September 2021, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that Fox was in \"active creative talks\" to bring the franchise back in a new form. Kiefer Sutherland later denied in January 2022 that such conversations were taking place, although he confirmed that he had been discussing the potential for future seasons of the show with Howard Gordon, the series' showrunner, and that he supports an idea of a series focusing on an entirely new cast tasked with rescuing Jack Bauer from a Russian prison. He later went on to tell \"Variety\" in April 2022 that he is open to new seasons of the show, as he views Jack Bauer's story as \"unresolved\".\nOther media.\nA significant amount of additional media relating to the series has been created, including Internet-distributed spin-off series such as \"The Rookie\" and \"\", as well as a . Other media include action figures of some of the main characters, soundtracks from both the series and the video game, and a number of novels covering different events not covered in the series. Additionally, a number of in-universe books were created, as well as behind the scenes books containing information on how the series was created.\nInfluence and reception.\nReaction.\nThroughout its run \"24\" was frequently cited by critics as one of the best shows on television. Its fifth season was its most critically acclaimed season, scoring universally positive reviews from critics, with the last three seasons each receiving generally favorable reviews. \"24\" has been called groundbreaking and innovative with \"Time\" stating that the show took \"the trend of serial story 'arcs', which began with '80s dramas like \"Hill Street Blues\" and \"Wiseguy\" and which continues on \"The West Wing\" and \"The Sopranos\" to the \"next level\" and another critic saying that it \"feels like no TV show you've ever seen\". The production and quality of the series has been frequently called \"filmlike\" and better than most films. The series has been compared to old-fashioned film serials, like \"The Perils of Pauline\".\nThe quality of the acting was particularly celebrated by critics. Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" described Kiefer Sutherland as indispensable to the series, and that he had a \"great, under-sung performance\". Dennis Haysbert's \"commanding\" performance as David Palmer was hailed by critics, with some believing the character helped the campaign of Barack Obama. David Leonhart of \"The New York Times\" praised Gregory Itzin's portrayal of President Charles Logan, comparing his character to former U.S. President Richard Nixon. \"The New York Times\" characterized Logan's administration as \"a projection of our very worst fears\" of the government. Jean Smart's portrayal of Martha Logan in the fifth season was equally acclaimed. The character's opening scene (in which she, unsatisfied with her hairdo, dunks her head into a sink) was called \"the most memorable character debut in \"24\" history\". The finale of season one is seen by many critics as one of the best episodes of the series and is frequently cited as one of the best television season finales of all time. Teri Bauer's death at the end of the finale was voted by \"TV Guide\" as the second-most shocking death in television history.\nTowards the middle of \"24\"'s run, the series attracted significant criticism for its depictions of torture, as well as its negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly as a result of these discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.\nThe issue of torture on the series was discussed by President Bill Clinton who stated that he does not feel there is a place in U.S. policy for torture, but \"If you're the Jack Bauer person, you'll do whatever you do and you should be prepared to take the consequences.\" Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, \"thankfully\", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.\nThe use of torture and the negative portrayal of Muslims affected the decisions of some actors who intended to join the series. Janeane Garofalo, who portrayed Janis Gold on the series, initially turned down the role because of the way the series depicted torture, but later took up the role, saying that \"being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance.\" Shohreh Aghdashloo, who portrayed Dina Araz, initially had reservations about taking on the role, as she initially felt that taking on the role of a Muslim terrorist would alienate people who support her as an activist, as she had spent many years in Iran advocating for women's rights and fought against the stereotyping of Muslim-Americans. However, she took on the role as she felt that people would understand that the show was fiction.\nDuring an interview for his new television series \"Homeland\", \"24\" executive producer Howard Gordon addressed the impact of the series, describing it as \"stunning \u2013 everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas\u2014you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer\u2014that would make me feel uncomfortable.\" On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, \"I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about\u2014although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate\u2014was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray in order to make it feel thrilling\u2014and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season), saying \"I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother\u2014and the son\u2014were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: 'They could be next door.' The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.\"\nAfter the series finale, the \"Los Angeles Times\" characterized the series as \"an epic poem, with Jack Bauer in the role of Odysseus or Beowulf. Which means he needed to be fighting monsters, not essentially decent people who have made one very bad decision.\" The critic went on to say that villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that \"Jack and \"24\" fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and megalomania, ruthlessness and stupidity.\" One reviewer for BuddyTV said that \"I'll remember the legacy of \"24\" as an action drama that redefined what serialized television can do and provided many shocking twists and turns along the way\u2014the biggest one being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy.\" \"The New York Times\" said \"\"24\" will live on, possibly as a feature film, and surely in classrooms and in textbooks. The series enlivened the country's political discourse in a way few others have, partly because it brought to life the ticking time-bomb threat that haunted the Cheney faction of the American government in the years after 9/11.\" The show was declared the sixth-highest-rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002\u20132012).\nRatings.\nSeasonal rankings were based on average total viewers per episode of \"24\" on Fox. Most American network television seasons start in mid-September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps. \"24\" aired during both February and May sweeps periods in all of its seasons, and during the November sweeps period in its first three seasons. Beginning with its fourth season, \"24\" began its season in January and aired new episodes non-stop until May.\nAwards and nominations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"24\" has changed the face of television\u2013one hour, one minute, one second at a time. This is a masterpiece of episodic storytelling and continues to deal with the bright color issues in America's war on terror with a degree of difficulty that is off today's television charts. Powerful and involving, with characters who are more fully realized with each season, the show still has viewers on the edge of their seats, both riveted to the action and begging, pleading for a modicum of relief.\n\u2014Judges of the American Film Institute on the show's inclusion in the 2005 list.\nThe series was nominated for and won several other television awards including the Emmy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. It is one of only five TV series (along with \"NYPD Blue\", \"The West Wing\", \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Homeland\") ever to have won the Emmy Award, the Golden Globe and the Satellite Award for Best Drama Series.\n\"24\" was nominated in categories for acting, directing, writing, editing, sound, music score, and stunt coordination.

In September 2019, \"The Guardian\" ranked the series 90th on its list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century, calling it \"the most gripping TV drama of the 00s\".\nDistribution.\n\"24\" was distributed across the globe. Kiefer Sutherland attributed the show's strong support from Fox to its early success in the UK. Its viewership in the UK decreased significantly when BBC Two lost the rights to subscription channel Sky One after the second season.\nFox's then-sister cable network FX aired a 24-hour marathon of the first season on September 1, 2002 (Labor Day).\nThe release of \"24\" on DVD had a significant impact on the success of the television series. In an interview with IGN in 2002, Sutherland revealed, \"[\"24\"'s] success in [the UK] was phenomenal. It was the biggest show the BBC has ever had. It was the number one DVD there, knocking off \"The Lord of the Rings\", which is unheard of for a television show DVD to actually knock-out every feature DVD available. And that's because they showed it without commercials.\" The American sales of the season one DVDs increased the audience size of season two by 25%.\nA special edition of the first season was released on May 20, 2008.

{"id": "68771", "revid": "45925219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68771", "title": "Battle of Marston Moor", "text": "1644 battle of the First English Civil War\nThe Battle of Marston Moor was fought on 2 July 1644, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms of 1639\u20131653. The combined forces of the English Parliamentarians under Lord Fairfax and the Earl of Manchester and the Scottish Covenanters under the Earl of Leven defeated the Royalists commanded by Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the Marquess of Newcastle.\nDuring the summer of 1644, the Covenanters and Parliamentarians had been besieging York, which was defended by the Marquess of Newcastle. Rupert had gathered an army which marched through the northwest of England, gathering reinforcements and fresh recruits on the way, and across the Pennines to relieve the city. The convergence of these forces made the ensuing battle the largest of the civil wars.\nOn 1 July, Rupert outmanoeuvred the Covenanters and Parliamentarians to relieve the city. The next day, he sought battle with them even though he was outnumbered. He was dissuaded from attacking immediately and during the day both sides gathered their full strength on Marston Moor, an expanse of wild meadow west of York. Towards evening, the Covenanters and Parliamentarians themselves launched a surprise attack. After a confused fight lasting two hours, Parliamentarian cavalry under Oliver Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry from the field and, with Leven's infantry, annihilated the remaining Royalist infantry.\nAfter their defeat the Royalists effectively abandoned Northern England, losing much of the manpower from the northern counties of England (which were strongly Royalist in sympathy) and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast. Although they partially retrieved their fortunes with victories later in the year in Southern England, the loss of the north was to prove a fatal handicap the next year, when they tried unsuccessfully to link up with the Scottish Royalists under the Marquess of Montrose.\nBackground.\nCivil war in the north.\nIn Northern England the Royalists had the advantage in numbers and local support, except in parts of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire, where the Parliamentarians had support from the clothing-manufacturing towns which \"naturally maligned the gentry\". On 30 June 1643, the Royalists commanded by the Marquess of Newcastle defeated the Parliamentarian army of Lord Fairfax at the Battle of Adwalton Moor near Bradford. Fairfax and his son, Sir Thomas Fairfax, fled with their remaining forces to the port of Hull, which was held for Parliament.\nNewcastle sent some of his army south into Lincolnshire, as part of a planned \"three-pronged\" advance on London, but was forced to besiege Hull with most of his forces. The siege failed, as the Parliamentarian navy could supply and reinforce the port and the garrison flooded wide areas around the city, while the Royalist detachments sent into Lincolnshire were defeated at the battles of Gainsborough and Winceby.\nIn late 1643, the English Civil War widened. King Charles I negotiated a \"cessation\" in Ireland, which allowed him to reinforce his armies with English regiments (one of horse and twelve of foot) which had been sent to Ireland following the Irish Rebellion of 1641, but Parliament took an even greater step by signing the Solemn League and Covenant, sealing an alliance with the Scottish Covenanters.\nEarly in 1644, a Covenanter army under the Earl of Leven entered the north of England on behalf of the English Parliament. The Marquess of Newcastle was forced to divide his army, leaving a detachment under Sir John Belasyse to watch the Parliamentarians under Lord Fairfax in Hull, while he led his main body north to confront Leven.\nSiege of York.\nDuring March and early April, the Marquess of Newcastle fought several delaying actions as he tried to prevent the Scots from crossing the River Tyne and surrounding the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. Meanwhile, a Parliamentarian cavalry force under Sir Thomas Fairfax, who had been campaigning in Cheshire and Lancashire during the winter, crossed the Pennines and entered the West Riding of Yorkshire. To prevent Sir Thomas rejoining Lord Fairfax in Hull, Belasyse occupied the town of Selby which lay between them. On 11 April, Sir Thomas Fairfax's force, reinforced by infantry under Sir John Meldrum, stormed Selby, capturing Belasyse and most of his force.\nHearing the news, Newcastle realised that the city of York was in danger. York was the principal city and bastion of Royalist power in the north of England, and its loss would be a serious blow to the Royalist cause. He hastily retreated there to forestall the Fairfaxes. Leven left a detachment under the Earl of Callendar to mask the Royalist garrison of Newcastle upon Tyne, and followed the Marquess of Newcastle's army with his main body. On 22 April, Leven and the Fairfaxes joined forces at Wetherby, about west of York. Together, they began the Siege of York.\nInitially, the siege was a rather loose blockade as the Covenanters and Parliamentarians concentrated on capturing smaller Royalist garrisons which threatened their communications with Hull. On 3 June, they were reinforced by the Parliamentarian army of the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester. York was now completely encircled and siege operations began in earnest. Leven was accepted as commander in chief of the three combined allied armies before York (referred to by Parliament as the \"Army of Both Kingdoms\"). It was politic to make the Scottish Covenanters pre-eminent in the north as they were the largest single contingent in the army, but Leven was also a respected veteran of the Thirty Years' War.\nRelief moves.\nNews of the siege soon reached Oxford, where the King had his wartime capital. From 24 April to 5 May, he held a council of war attended by his nephew and most renowned field commander, Prince Rupert. It was settled that while the King attempted to play for time in Oxford, Rupert would relieve York.\nRupert set out from Shrewsbury with a small force on 16 May. His first moves were intended to gather reinforcements along the way to bolster his army, and secure Lancashire for the troops heading over from Ireland for the Royalist cause. He assumed the direction of a small Royalist army, based on Chester and commanded by Lord John Byron, raising his force to 2,000 horse and 6,000 foot. Having forced a crossing of the River Mersey at Stockport, he stormed Bolton, allegedly killing 1,600 of the Parliamentarian defenders and citizens. Resting at Bury nearby, Rupert was joined by the Marquess of Newcastle's cavalry under Lord George Goring, which had broken out of York early in the siege, with a small contingent from Derbyshire, and several regiments which were being freshly raised in Lancashire by the Earl of Derby. Bypassing the Parliamentarian stronghold of Manchester, Rupert approached Liverpool on 6 June and wrested control of the city from Parliament after a five-day siege.\nRupert now hesitated, unsure whether to proceed to the relief of York or remain to consolidate the Royalist hold on Lancashire, securing more reinforcements in the process. He also distrusted some of the members of the King's council of war and was wary of being so far from the King's side. On 16 June, he received a dispatch from the King which contained troubling news. The King's advisors on the council of war had overturned Rupert's defensive policies, sending the garrisons of Reading and Abingdon on an offensive in the West Country. This had left Oxford exposed to a sudden threat from the Parliamentarian armies commanded by the Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller and forced the King to leave the city in haste and head to Worcester, where he was still in danger. The letter also contained some ambiguous orders regarding Rupert's northern offensive and future plans:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But now I must give the true state of my affairs, which, if their condition be such as enforces me to give you more peremptory commands than I would willingly do, you must not take it ill. If York be lost I shall esteem my crown little less; unless supported by your sudden march to me; and a miraculous conquest in the South, before the effects of the Northern power can be found here. But if York be relieved, and you beat the rebels' army of both kingdoms, which are before it, then (but otherwise not) I may possibly make a shift upon the defensive to spin out time until you come to assist me. Wherefore I command and conjure you, by the duty and affection that I know you bear me, that all new enterprises laid aside, you immediately march according to your first intention, with all your force to the relief of York. But if that be either lost, or have freed themselves from the besiegers, or that for want of powder, you cannot undertake that work, that you immediately march with your whole strength, directly to Worcester to assist me and my army; without which, or you having relieved York by beating the Scots, all the successes you can afterwards have must infallibly be useless onto me.\nRupert understood the letter to be an order both to relieve York and defeat the allied army before heading south once more to aid the King. By this time Rupert's army numbered nearly 14,000. He set out from Liverpool to Preston, which surrendered without a fight. From there he proceeded via Clitheroe and crossed the Pennines to Skipton, where he paused for three days from 26 to 28 June to \"fix arms\" and await some final reinforcements from Cumberland and Westmoreland. He arrived at the Royalist garrison at Knaresborough Castle north-west of York on 30 June.\nRelief of York.\nThe allies were aware of Rupert's approach and had been hoping that reinforcements from Manchester under Sir John Meldrum and the Midlands under the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat, but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time. The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers, and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he could destroy any one army before the other two could come to its aid. Therefore, they abandoned the siege on the night of 30 June, and concentrated their forces near the village of Hessay before taking position on Marston Moor, where they blocked Rupert's expected direct march to York (along the old Roman road named Ermine Street, the modern A59), and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making any move to the south via Wetherby.\nEarly on 1 July, some Royalist cavalry advanced from Knaresborough and appeared on the Moor, and the allies prepared for battle. However, Rupert had made a flank march to the northeast with his main body, crossing the River Ure at Boroughbridge and the River Swale at Thornton Bridge. These two rivers merge to form the River Ouse, which Rupert had successfully put between himself and the allied armies. Later that day, his forces defeated the Earl of Manchester's dragoons, who had been left to guard a bridge of boats across the Ouse at the village of Poppleton a few miles north of York. This had been the only crossing available to the allies above another bridge of boats at Acaster Malbis south of York, and its capture prevented the allies crossing the Ouse to engage Rupert.\nMore of Rupert's cavalry arrived at York to gain touch with the garrison. With York definitely relieved, Newcastle sent Rupert a fulsome letter of welcome and congratulations. Rupert replied, not in person but through Goring, with a peremptory demand for Newcastle to march his forces to Rupert's assistance on the following morning.\nBattle.\nPrelude.\nOn learning that they had been outmanoeuvred, the allied commanders debated their options. They decided to march south to Tadcaster and Cawood, where they could both protect their own supply lines from Hull, and also block any move south by Rupert on either side of the Ouse. Their foot (infantry), ordnance and baggage set off early on 2 July, leaving the cavalry and dragoons, commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax, as rearguard. At about 9\u00a0am, the allied generals learned that Rupert's army had crossed the Ouse by the captured bridge of boats at Poppleton and a ford nearby, and was advancing onto Marston Moor. The Covenanter and Parliamentarian foot, some of whom had already reached Tadcaster, were hastily recalled.\nHowever, Newcastle and his Lieutenant General, James King, 1st Lord Eythin, were opposed to any pitched battle and possibly offended by Rupert's high-handed attitude. Rather than join Rupert immediately they temporised, claiming that it would take time to clear the earth and rubble which had been used to block the city gates of York during the siege. Newcastle's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their delayed payment, a dispute which Eythin may have fomented. A number were also absent, pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city, and had yet to return.\nAround midday, Rupert was joined on Marston Moor by Newcastle, accompanied by a mounted troop of \"gentleman volunteers\" only. Rupert greeted him by saying, \"My Lord, I wish you had come sooner with your forces, but I hope we shall yet have a glorious day.\" Newcastle counselled that the three allied armies, with separate garrisons, recruiting areas and lines of communication to protect, would eventually separate. He also suggested waiting for a force of 3,000 under Colonel Clavering and collected garrisons amounting to another 2,000 to join the Royalist army. Rupert was adamant that the King's letter (which he never showed to Newcastle) was a command to engage and defeat the enemy immediately. Furthermore, Rupert wished to compensate for the Royalists' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares, and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers.\nHowever, without Newcastle's infantry, and with his own infantry exhausted from their long march on the previous day, Rupert was unable to attack, and the odds against him lengthened as the day wore on, and the Scots and Parliamentarian infantry and artillery returned from their aborted move south and took position.\nAt about 2:00\u00a0pm, the allied artillery, consisting of around thirty pieces of ordnance commanded by General Alexander Hamilton, began a cannonade, although according to a Royalist eyewitness:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... this was only a shewing of their teeth, for after 4 shots made them give over &amp; in Marston corn feilds [\"sic\"] fall to singing psalms...\"\nAt about 5:00\u00a0pm, the firing ceased. Meanwhile, at about 4:00\u00a0pm, the Royalist contingent from York belatedly arrived, led by Eythin. Rupert and Eythin already knew and disliked one another. Both had fought at the Battle of Vlotho in 1638, where Rupert had been captured and held prisoner for several years. Rupert blamed Eythin's caution for the defeat on that occasion, while Eythin blamed Rupert's rashness. On the Moor, Eythin criticised Rupert's dispositions as being drawn up too close to the enemy. His main concern was that a fold in the ground (referred to by some eyewitnesses as a \"glen\") between the ridge on which the allied forces were drawn up and the track between Long Marston and Tockwith concealed the front line of the allied infantry from both view and artillery fire, allowing them to attack suddenly from a comparatively close distance. When Rupert proposed to either attack or move his army back as Eythin suggested, Eythin then pontificated that it was too late in the day for such a move. The Royalist army prepared to settle down for the night, close to the allied armies.\nDeployment.\nCovenanters and Parliamentarians.\nThe Covenanters and Parliamentarians occupied Marston Hill, a low feature (actually part of a terminal moraine) less than above the surrounding countryside but nevertheless prominent in the flat Vale of York, between the villages of Long Marston and Tockwith. They had the advantage of the higher ground, but cornfields stretching between the two villages hampered their deployment.\nAt some point in the day, the Royalists attempted to seize a rabbit warren to the west of the cornfields from where they might enfilade the Parliamentarian position, but they were driven off and the Parliamentarian left wing of horse occupied the ground. The wing was under the command of Manchester's Lieutenant General, Oliver Cromwell. The first two lines consisted of over 3,000 cavalry from the Eastern Association, including Cromwell's own double-strength regiment of ironsides. They were deployed in eleven divisions of three or four troops of cavalry each, with 600 \"commanded\" musketeers deployed as platoons between them. The use of musketeers to disrupt attacking cavalry or dragoons was a common practice in the Swedish Army during the Thirty Years' War, and was adopted by both the Parliamentarians and Royalists at Marston Moor. Three regiments of Covenanter horse, numbering 1,000 and mounted on lighter \"nags\", formed a third line to Cromwell's rear under Sir David Leslie. Five hundred Scottish dragoons under Colonel Hugh Fraser were deployed on the extreme left.\nThe centre, under the direction of the Earl of Leven as nominated commander in chief, consisted of over 14,000 foot, with 30 to 40 pieces of artillery. Thomas Stockdale recorded the disposition of the troops and the role of Leven in drawing up the order of battle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Yorkeshire forces strengthened with a great party of the Scotts army hauing the main battle, the Earl of Manchester\u2019s forces the left wing, and the Scotts the right wing, each battle hauing severall reserues and winged with horse, according to Generall Lesleys direction whose great experience did worthyly challenge the prime power in ordering them\nThe Covenanter Sergeant Major General of Foot, James Lumsden, nevertheless observed (in a note on the map he made of the allied army's dispositions) that \"... the Brigads drawen up heir as we \"[illegible]\" it is not so formal as it ought to be.\"\nMost of Manchester's infantry under Sergeant Major General Lawrence Crawford were on the left of the front line. A brigade of Lord Fairfax's foot was in the centre. Two Covenanter brigades each of two regiments, the \"vanguard\" of the main battalia commanded by Lieutenant General William Baillie, made up the right of the front line. The second line consisted of four Covenanter brigades, their \"main battle\", commanded by Lumsden. There is confusion as to the disposition of the third line and of the infantry deployment on the right wing, as the only map (Lumsden's) is badly damaged. The usual interpretation, based on Peter Young's reconstruction, is that the third line contained two or three Covenanter brigades and the Earl of Manchester's own regiment of foot. Young placed the main body of Fairfax's foot on the left of the third line, although more recent interpretations of accounts put them on the right of the third line or even behind the cavalry of the right wing. An unbrigaded Covenanter regiment may have formed an incomplete fourth line. There were a total of nineteen Covenanter regiments of foot, some of them incomplete, present at the battle.\nThe right wing was commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax, with John Lambert as his second in command. He had at least 2,000 horse from Yorkshire and Lancashire, deployed in nine divisions, with 600 musketeers posted between them in the same manner as on the left wing. There were also perhaps 500 dragoons. One regiment of Covenanter horse commanded by the Earl of Eglinton was deployed with Fairfax's front line, two more (one of them composed of lancers commanded by the Earl of Balgonie, Leven's son) were deployed behind Fairfax's second line. The second and third lines of the right wing may also have included some units of foot, whose identity is uncertain.\nRoyalists.\nThe Royalists occupied the low-lying moor, behind a drainage ditch that Rupert noted as an effective obstacle to a cavalry charge. There is some dispute over the course of the ditch at the time of the battle. Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non-existent on the Royalists' right wing. On the other hand, a near-contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert's chief engineer, Bernard de Gomme, shows the ditch in its present-day alignment. It is generally accepted that the ditch was at least less of an obstacle on the Royalist right.\nThe Royalist left wing was commanded by Lord Goring. It consisted of 1,700 cavalry from the Marquess of Newcastle's cavalry (the \"Northern Horse\"), 400 cavalry from Derbyshire and 500 musketeers. The first line was commanded by Goring and the second by Sir Charles Lucas.\nTheir centre was commanded by Eythin. A brigade numbering 1,500 and consisting of Rupert's and Byron's regiments of foot under Colonel Robert Napier of Byron's regiment was deployed at the ditch, at the junction of the right wing and centre, possibly to protect some artillery which may have occupied a slight hummock near this point or where the ditch was an especially weak obstacle. To their left, a forlorn hope of musketeers lined the ditch. Behind them, the first line and the left wing of the second line were composed of the remaining infantry units of Rupert's army, numbering 5,500, under Rupert's Sergeant Major General, Henry Tillier. The 3,000 infantry from Newcastle's army, organised as seven small \"divisions\" under Sergeant Major General Francis Mackworth, formed the right wing of the second line and an incomplete third line behind the right centre when they arrived. Some at least of them may not have taken up their assigned positions when the battle began, leaving the right of the Royalist centre understrength. A brigade of 600 \"Northern Horse\" under Sir William Blakiston was deployed behind the left centre. A total of 14 field guns were deployed in the centre.\nThe right wing was commanded by Byron, with 2,600 horse (including a regiment, 200 strong, of Northern Horse) and 500 musketeers. The second line, which included Rupert's Regiment of Horse but also some comparatively inexperienced regiments, was commanded by Lord Molyneux, although the experienced but unprincipled Sir John Urry (or \"Hurry\") was Sergeant Major General of Rupert's horse and therefore Byron's second in command.\nUnlike the Covenanters and Parliamentarians, Rupert retained a reserve of 600 cavalry, including his elite Lifeguard of Horse, under his personal command. This reserve was situated behind the centre.\nMain action.\nDelayed by the late arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From the ranks of the allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of preparation among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30\u00a0pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.\nOn the allied left, Crawford's infantry outflanked and drove back Napier's brigade while Cromwell's horse quickly defeated Byron's wing. Though Byron had been ordered to stand his ground and rely on the ditch and musket fire to slow and disorganize an enemy attack, he instead ordered a hasty counter-charge which disordered his own troops and prevented his musketeers and four \"drakes\" (field guns) attached to Napier's brigade from firing for fear of hitting their own cavalry. In the clashes which followed, Byron's front line regiments were put to flight. Cromwell was slightly wounded in the neck, by a pistol ball in most accounts, and briefly left the field to have the wound dressed.\nNoting the setback on this flank, Rupert led his reserve towards the right, rallying his own fleeing regiment of horse and leading them in a counter-attack. A Parliamentarian officer wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cromwell's own division had a hard pull of it; for they were charged by Rupert's bravest men both in front and flank; they stood at the sword's point a pretty while, hacking one another; but at last (it so pleased God) he [Cromwell] brake through them, scattering them before him like a little dust.\u2014\u200a\nLeslie's Covenanter regiments eventually swung the balance for Cromwell, outflanking and defeating the Royalist cavalry. Rupert's right wing and reserve were routed and he himself narrowly avoided capture by hiding in a nearby bean field.\nOn the allied right centre, the brigade of Fairfax's infantry and Baillie's \"vanguard\" initially succeeded in crossing the ditch, capturing at least three pieces of artillery. On the allied right, Sir Thomas Fairfax's wing fared worse. He later wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Our Right Wing had not, all, so good success, by reason of the whins and ditches which we were to pass over before we could get to the Enemy, which put us into great disorder: notwithstanding, I drew up a body of 400 Horse. But because the intervals of Horse, in this Wing only, were lined with Musketeers; which did us much hurt with their shot; I was necessitated to charge them. We were a long time engaged with one another, but at last we routed that part of their Wing ... [I] myself only returned presently, to get to the men I left behind me. But that part of the Enemy which stood, perceiving the disorder they were in, had charged and routed them, before I could get to them.\u2014\u200a\nFairfax wrote that his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, could not get up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed the ditch on this flank, and some accounts suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four abreast. When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls were recovered.\nWhen Goring launched a counter-charge, the disorganised Parliamentarians were routed, although some of the Covenanter cavalry regiments with Sir Thomas Fairfax's wing, especially the Earl of Eglinton's regiment, resisted stoutly for some time. As an eyewitness observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;sir Tho. Fairfax his new levied Regiments being in the Van [of the right wing], they wheeled about, &amp; being hotly pursued by the enemy, came back upon the L. Fairfax foot, and the reserve of the Scottish foot, broke them wholly, &amp; trod the most part of them under foot.\u2014\u200a\nMost of Goring's victorious wing then either scattered in pursuit, or fell out to loot the allied baggage train, but some of them under Lucas wheeled to attack the right flank of the allied infantry. Meanwhile, some of Newcastle's foot counter-attacked the brigade of Fairfax's foot in the centre of the allied front line and threw them into confusion. Following up this advantage, Blakiston's brigade of horse, probably reinforced by the troop of \"gentleman volunteers\" under Newcastle himself, charged the allied centre. Under Lucas's and Blakiston's assaults in the confusion and the gathering darkness, six of the Covenanter infantry regiments and all of Fairfax's infantry fled the field. The Scottish sergeant major general, Lumsden, on the right of the allied second line, stated that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These that ran away shew themselves most baselie. I commanding the battel was on the head of your Lordships [Loudoun's] Regiment, and Buccleuch's; but they carried themselves not so I could have wished, neither could I prevaile with them: For these that fled, never came to charge with the enemie, but were so possest with ane pannick fear, that they ran for an example to others, and no enemie following them, which gave the enemie [an opportunity] to charge them, they intended not, &amp;they had only the losse.\u2014\u200a\nOne isolated Covenanter brigade of foot that stood its ground was at the right of their front line and consisted of the regiments of the Earl of Crawford-Lindsay and Viscount Maitland. Lucas launched three cavalry charges against them. In the third charge, Lucas's horse was killed, and he was taken prisoner. Behind them, Lumsden reformed the reserve of the allied centre, pushing four regiments (those of the Earl of Cassilis, William Douglas of Kilhead, Lord Coupar and the Earl of Dunfermline) and part of the Clydesdale Regiment forward into the breach in the allied front line. Behind them in turn, the Earl of Manchester's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston's brigade.\nBy now it was nearly fully dark, although the full moon was rising. The countryside for miles around was covered with fugitives from both sides. A messenger from Ireland riding in search of Prince Rupert wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In this horrible distraction did I coast the country; here meeting with a shoal of Scots crying out, 'Weys us, we are all undone'; and so full of lamentation and mourning, as if their day of doom had overtaken them, and from which they knew not whither to fly; and anon I met with a ragged troop reduced to four and a Cornet; by and by with a little foot officer without hat, band, sword, or indeed anything but feet and so much tongue as would serve to enquire the way to the next garrisons, which (to say the truth) were well filled with the stragglers on both sides within a few hours, though they lay distant from the place of the fight 20 or 30 miles.\u2014\u200a\nCromwell's disciplined horsemen had rallied behind the right of the original Royalist position. Sir Thomas Fairfax, finding himself alone in the midst of Goring's men, removed the \"field sign\" (a handkerchief or slip of white paper which identified him as a Parliamentarian) from his hat, and made his way to Cromwell's wing to relate the state of affairs on the allied right flank. Some five or six troops of Fairfax's cavalry and Balgonie's Covenanter regiment of horse (split into two bodies) also made their way through the Royalists to join Cromwell. Cromwell now led his cavalry, with Sir David Leslie still in support and Sergeant Major General Crawford's foot on his right flank, across the battlefield to attack Goring's cavalry.\nBy this time, Goring's troops were tired and disorganised, and several of his senior officers were prisoners. They nevertheless marched down the hill from the Parliamentarian baggage to occupy roughly the same position which Fairfax's cavalry had held at the start of the battle, which most contemporary accounts stated to be a disadvantageous position. When Cromwell attacked, Goring's outnumbered troops were driven back. Many of them retired to the \"glen\", the fold of ground beneath Marston Hill, but refused to take any further part in the battle despite the efforts of officers such as Sir Marmaduke Langdale and Sir Philip Monckton to rally them. Eventually, they obeyed orders to retreat to York late at night.\nThe triumphant allies meanwhile turned against the remains of the Royalist centre, overrunning successive units and cutting down many fugitives. Finally some of Newcastle's foot, the \"whitecoats\", gathered for a last stand in a ditched enclosure. This has usually been stated to be White Sike Close, in the rear of the Royalists' original position, where some of Newcastle's infantry would have retreated when they found their right flank \"in the air\" following the defeat of Byron's and Rupert's cavalry, and certainly where some mass burials later took place, although the enclosure may instead have been Fox Covert, a mile north of Long Marston on the natural line of retreat towards York. The whitecoats refused quarter and repulsed constant cavalry charges until infantry and Colonel Hugh Fraser's dragoons were brought up to break their formation with musket fire. The last 30 survivors finally surrendered.\nCasualties.\nApproximately 4,000 Royalist soldiers had been killed, many in the last stand of the whitecoats, and 1,500 captured, including Lucas and Tillier. The Royalists lost all their guns, with many hundreds of weapons and several standards also falling into the hands of the allied forces.\nThe allied generals' dispatch, and other Parliamentarian accounts, stated that 300 of their soldiers were killed. One of those mortally wounded among the Parliamentarians was Sir Thomas Fairfax's brother, Charles. Another was Cromwell's nephew, Valentine Walton, who was struck by a cannonball early in the day. Cromwell was present when he died afterwards, and wrote a famous letter to the soldier's father, Cromwell's brother-in-law, also named Valentine Walton, which briefly described the battle and then informed the father of the son's last words and death.\nOutcome.\nRoyalists.\nLate at night, the Royalist generals reached York, with many routed troops and stragglers. The Governor of York, Sir Thomas Glemham, allowed only those who were part of the garrison (in effect, only a few officers who had participated in the battle as volunteers) into the city, in case Parliamentarian cavalry entered the city on the heels of the fleeing Royalists. Many fugitives, including wounded, crowded the streets before Micklegate Bar, the western gate into the city.\nNewcastle, having seen his forces broken and having spent his entire fortune in the Royalist cause, resolved that he would not endure the \"laughter of the court\". He departed for Scarborough on the day after the battle (3 July) and went into exile in Hamburg, with Eythin and many of his senior officers. Two days after the battle, Rupert rallied 5,000 cavalry and a few hundred infantry whom he mounted on spare horses. He considered that rather than attempt to restore Royalist fortunes in the north, he was required to return south to rejoin the King. Leaving York by way of Monk Bar on the north east side, he marched back over the Pennines, making a detour to Richmond to escape interception.\nAt Marston Moor, Rupert had been decisively beaten for the first time in the war. He was deeply affected by the defeat, and kept the King's ambiguous dispatch close to him for the remainder of his life. He had suffered an additional blow through the death during the battle of his dog \"Boye\", who had been a constant companion by his side throughout his campaigns. Parliamentarian propaganda made much of this, treating Boye almost as a Devil's familiar.\nWith the departure of Newcastle and Rupert, the Royalists effectively abandoned the north, except for isolated garrisons, which were reduced one by one over the next few months. The remnants of Byron's troops were driven from Lancashire in August, and were involved in another Royalist disaster at the Relief of Montgomery Castle in Wales in September. The Royalist cavalry from the northern counties, the \"Northern Horse\", continued to fight for the King under Sir Marmaduke Langdale. They relieved a Royalist garrison at Pontefract Castle in West Yorkshire in February 1645, but their undisciplined and licentious conduct turned many former sympathisers away from the Royalist cause. After being involved in the defeats of the King at the battles of Naseby and Rowton Heath, they made a final attempt to reach Scotland and were routed at the Battle of Sherburn in Elmet in October 1645.\nAllies.\nThe victorious allies regrouped, although too slowly to intercept Rupert as he left York. Once the allied army had reformed (and had been joined by Meldrum's and Denbigh's forces) they resumed the siege of York. Without hope of relief, and under the agreement that no Scottish soldiers were to be quartered in the city, the garrison surrendered on honourable terms on 16 July.\nOnce York surrendered, the allied army soon dispersed. Leven took his troops north to besiege Newcastle upon Tyne and Carlisle. He sent dispatches to Scotland ordering that all runaways from the Covenanter regiments which broke at Marston Moor be returned, but not before every tenth deserter was hanged according to article 14 of Leven's \"Articles of War\". Once reunited with the Army of both Kingdoms, the remnants of the six broken regiments were put to base service such as latrine duties and the disposing of corpses until they got the chance to redeem themselves during the storm of Newcastle. Manchester's army returned to Lincolnshire and eventually moved into the south of England to take part in the Second Battle of Newbury.\nThe Earl of Leven had again demonstrated the importance of disciplined infantry. Even as some of the newly levied allied regiments were routed by the Royalists, he had ensured he had enough veterans in reserve to replace them and overturn the early gains made by his opponents. Cromwell's reputation as a cavalry commander was also firmly established at this battle. Despite attempts by his political rivals such as Denzil Holles and military critics such as Major General Lawrence Crawford to belittle the part he played, it was acknowledged that the discipline he had instilled into his troops and his own leadership on the battlefield had been crucial to the victory. Cromwell would later declare that Marston Moor was \"an absolute victory obtained by God's blessing\". From this moment, he was to exert increasing influence both in the House of Commons and in the Parliamentarian armies in the field.\nHowever, the accounts published after the battle showed the rifts which were already growing between the moderates and Presbyterians on the one hand and the Independents on the other. The noted Scottish theologian Robert Baillie wrote from Edinburgh only a few days later to one of his Independent brethren:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We were both grieved and angry, that your Independents there should have sent up Major Harrison to trumpet over all the city their own praises, to our prejudice, making all believe, that Cromwell alone, with his unspeakable valorous regiments, had done all that service: that most of us fled: and who stayed they fought so and so, as it might be. We were much vexed with these reports, against which yow were not pleased, any of yow to instruct us with any ansuer, till Lindesay's letters came at last, and captain Stewart with his collors. Then we sent abroad our printed relations, and could lift up our face. But within three days Mr Ashe's relation was also printed, who gives us many good words, but gives much more to Cromwell than we are informed is his due \u2026 See by this inclosed, if the whole victorie both in the right and left wing, be not ascribed to Cromwell, and not a word of David Lesley, who in all places that day was his leader.\nConduct of the allied generals.\nMuch of the resulting many-sided dispute among the Parliamentarians and Covenanters was prompted by accounts very soon after the battle that all three allied generals-in-chief had fled the field. The Earl of Manchester left the field but he subsequently rallied some infantry and returned, although he was able to exercise little control over events.\nBy some accounts, Lord Fairfax and Leven also fled the battlefield with their routed troops, but this has recently been challenged, certainly in Leven's case. The most detailed account of Leven's flight was written by the biographer of Lieutenant Colonel James Somerville, who was present at the battle as a volunteer. However, this second-hand account was published only in 1679, and has been challenged by previously unused eyewitness accounts. These show most of the Covenanter infantry and cavalry units remained fighting until the end of the battle. As seven different eyewitnesses attested, they did so under the direction of Leven. For example, Simeon Ashe (the Earl of Manchester's chaplain) noted that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Earl of Manchester's new levied Forces began to give backe, the Enemey pursued our men, fell on again and gained two peeces of ordnance there; Rupert fell upon Sir Thomas Fairfaxes horse, and there was a very hot fight, many slayne on both sides: our forces retreated, but ralleing our men again and General Lessly coming on with his foot, they fell on furiously, many were killed on both sides, and then the enemy beginning to retreat, our men followed pursuing and totally Routed Rupert.\nThe enigmatic English reporter, \"T. M.\", agreed that Leven still commanded the centre battalia after the initial rout:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Lord of Hosts did so strike up the hearts of the three Noble Generals [that God] took boldness and courage unto them, gathering up those Horse Forces that were left into a body to assist those English and Scotts that stood to it, and set upon them, as David with his small Army upon the numerous company of the Amalekites, while they were rejoicing over their spoils, and smote them until the evening.\nFiction and media.\nIn 1971 the British rock band Electric Light Orchestra released an album track titled \"The Battle of Marston Moor (July 2nd 1644)\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was published by University of Texas Press in 1998.\nThe anthology is a chronological presentation of surrealist writing by women, including poetry, tales, theory, responses to inquiries, critiques, declarations, etc. 97 women are represented, from 30 countries in Western and Eastern Europe, including Sweden, Moravia, and Corsica; North and South America, including Argentina; the Caribbean; the Middle East (e.g. Iraq); and Australia. The editor provides an introductory essay to each of the six chronological periods into which the anthology is organised (1924-1929; 1930-1939; 1940-1945; 1946-1959; the years surrounding May '1968'; and the present), and short biographies/bibliographies about each woman. Two thirds of the works had not previously been included in an anthology, and many had not been republished since their first appearance.\nReviewers considered that the anthology \"has the characteristics of a classic. .. it is a book that will be definitive and delightful for many years to come\"; it \"not only adds to our knowledge of specific writers, but changes our understanding of surrealist art.\" In her introduction, Rosemont disputes some commonly held misconceptions about surrealism, including that it was sexist and did not encourage women's participation. Instead, she presents a case that \"surrealism was both accepting of and tremendously influenced by women members\", and their obscurity was due to critics, not male members of the surrealist movement.\nOne reviewer observed that \"By the penultimate chapter a lot of the names of the women are familiar; we have read their work and delighted in their growth since their first appearance in this anthology. ... As each section examines a period separately .. the same names re-occur in different groupings, different guises. ... as the names shuffle about, the events, countries, times and mediums alter; then there is achieved this dream-like quality within the infrastructure of the book.

It borders on (clockwise from the North) the Belgian provinces of Antwerp, Limburg, Li\u00e8ge, Walloon Brabant, Hainaut and East Flanders. Flemish Brabant also surrounds the Brussels-Capital Region. Its capital is Leuven. It has an area of which is divided into two administrative districts (\"arrondissementen\" in Dutch) containing 65 municipalities. As of January 2024, Flemish Brabant had a population of over 1.19 million.\nFlemish Brabant was created in 1995 by the splitting of the former province of Brabant into three parts: two new provinces, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant; and the Brussels-Capital Region, which no longer belongs to any province. The split was made to accommodate the eventual division of Belgium in three regions (Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region).\nThe province is made up of two arrondissements. The Halle-Vilvoorde Arrondissement surrounds Brussels and is mainly a residential area, though it also contains large industrial zones and has Belgium's main airport. It is joined by the Leuven Arrondissement, centered on Leuven, the province's capital and largest city. Products of Flemish Brabant include Belgian beers.\nThe official language of Flemish Brabant is Dutch, as in the rest of Flanders. A few municipalities are to a certain extent allowed to use French to communicate with their citizens; these are called the municipalities with language facilities. Other such special municipalities can be found along the border between Flanders and Wallonia, and between Wallonia and the German-speaking area of Belgium. Halle-Vilvoorde mostly surrounds Brussels, which is officially bilingual but whose inhabitants mostly speak French.\nPolitics.\nThe Governor is the representative or \"commissioner\" of the federal and Flemish governments in Flemish Brabant. He is appointed by the Flemish government, on the unanimous advice of the Federal Council of Ministers. From the creation of Flemish Brabant in 1995, as a result of the division of the Province of Brabant into Flemish- and French-speaking provinces, until his retirement in 2020, the governor was Lodewijk De Witte. He was succeeded by Jan Spooren. \nThe governor is responsible for supervising the local authorities, ensuring that laws and decrees are observed, maintaining public order and security, and coordinating the response to a disaster which has occurred in his province. He also presides over the Deputation, however, he does not have the right to vote in the Deputation except in those cases where the Deputation exercises a judicial function.\nFlemish Brabant is the only province that has a deputy governor as well. The deputy governor is appointed by the Flemish Government on the unanimous advice of the Federal Council of Ministers and must have a considerable knowledge of both the Dutch and the French language. He is responsible for ensuring that the language legislation is observed in the peripheral municipalities of Flemish Brabant.\nThe Provincial Council of Flemish Brabant consists of 72 members (84 members until 2012) elected for a term of office of 6 years. The last election was held on Sunday 14 October 2012. Seven political parties have seats in the provincial council:\nThe current president of the provincial council is An Hermans (CD&amp;V). She is assisted by a bureau which consists of two vice-presidents, four secretaries, three quaestors and the floor leaders of the fractions in the provincial council.\nThe governing majority in the provincial council for 2013\u20132018 is formed by CD&amp;V, Open VLD, sp.a and Groen. These parties together have a majority of 43 out of 72 seats.\nThe Deputation is the executive organ responsible for the daily administration of the province. It consists of the governor and six deputies elected by the provincial council from among its midst. For the 2013\u20132018 legislative term, the deputies are divided among the majority parties as follows: two for CD&amp;V, two for Open Vld, one for sp.a and one for Groen.\nEconomy.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 49.8 billion \u20ac in 2018. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 38,600 \u20ac or 128% of the EU27 average in the same year.\nReligion.\nAccording to the \"International Social Survey Programme 2008: Religion III\" by the Association of Religion Data Archives, 73.9% of Flemish Brabant's population identified themselves as Catholics, 23.1% as non-religious, and 3% adhered to other religions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMunicipalities.\nFlemish Brabant has 63 municipalities: 33 in the Arrondissement of Halle-Vilvoorde and 30 in Leuven.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68804", "revid": "6200168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68804", "title": "Equity (finance)", "text": "Ownership of property reduced by its liabilities\nIn finance, equity is an ownership interest in property that may be subject to debts or other liabilities. Equity is measured for accounting purposes by subtracting liabilities from the value of the assets owned. For example, if someone owns a car worth $24,000 and owes $10,000 on the loan used to buy the car, the difference of $14,000 is equity. Equity can apply to a single asset, such as a car or house, or to an entire business. A business that needs to start up or expand its operations can sell its equity in order to raise cash that does not have to be repaid on a set schedule.\nWhen liabilities attached to an asset exceed its value, the difference is called a deficit and the asset is informally said to be \"underwater\" or \"upside-down\". In government finance or other non-profit settings, equity is known as \"net position\" or \"net assets\".\nOrigins.\nThe term \"equity\" describes this type of ownership in English because it was regulated through the system of equity law that developed in England during the Late Middle Ages to meet the growing demands of commercial activity. While the older common law courts dealt with questions of property title, equity courts dealt with contractual interests in property. The same asset could have an owner in equity, who held the contractual interest, and a separate owner at law, who held the title indefinitely or until the contract was fulfilled. Contract disputes were examined with consideration of whether the terms and administration of the contract were fair\u2014that is, equitable.\nSingle assets.\nAny asset that is purchased through a secured loan is said to have equity. While the loan remains unpaid, the buyer does not fully own the asset. The lender has the right to repossess it if the buyer defaults, but only to recover the unpaid loan balance. The equity balance\u2014the asset's market value reduced by the loan balance\u2014measures the buyer's partial ownership. This may be different from the total amount that the buyer has paid on the loan, which includes interest expense and does not consider any change in the asset's value. When an asset has a deficit instead of equity, the terms of the loan determine whether the lender can recover it from the borrower. Houses are normally financed with non-recourse loans, in which the lender assumes a risk that the owner will default with a deficit, while other assets are financed with full-recourse loans that make the borrower responsible for any deficit.\nThe equity of an asset can be used to secure additional liabilities. Common examples include home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. These increase the total liabilities attached to the asset and decrease the owner's equity.\nBusiness entities.\nA business entity has a more complicated debt structure than a single asset. While some liabilities may be secured by specific assets of the business, others may be guaranteed by the assets of the entire business. If the business becomes bankrupt, it can be required to raise money by selling assets. Yet the equity of the business, like the equity of an asset, approximately measures the amount of the assets that belongs to the owners of the business.\nAccounting.\nIn financial accounting, the equity is derived by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. For a business as a whole, this value is sometimes referred to as total equity, to distinguish it from the equity of a single asset. The fundamental accounting equation requires that the total of liabilities and equity is equal to the total of all assets at the close of each accounting period. To satisfy this requirement, all events that affect total assets and total liabilities unequally must eventually be reported as changes in equity. Businesses summarize their equity in a financial statement known as the balance sheet (or statement of net position) which shows the total assets, the specific equity balances, and the total liabilities and equity (or deficit).\nVarious types of equity can appear on a balance sheet, depending on the form and purpose of the business entity. Preferred stock, share capital (or capital stock) and capital surplus (or additional paid-in capital) reflect original contributions to the business from its investors or organizers. Treasury stock appears as a contra-equity balance (an offset to equity) that reflects the amount that the business has paid to repurchase stock from shareholders. Retained earnings (or accumulated deficit) is the running total of the business's net income and losses, excluding any dividends. In the United Kingdom and other countries that use its accounting methods, equity includes various reserve accounts that are used for particular reconciliations of the balance sheet.\nAnother financial statement, the statement of changes in equity, details the changes in these equity accounts from one accounting period to the next. Several events can produce changes in a firm's equity.\nInvesting.\nEquity investing is the business of purchasing stock in companies, either directly or from another investor, on the expectation that the stock will earn dividends or can be resold with a capital gain. Equity holders typically receive voting rights, meaning that they can vote on candidates for the board of directors and, if their holding is large enough, influence management decisions.\nLegal foundations.\nInvestors in a newly established firm must contribute an initial amount of capital to it so that it can begin to transact business. This contributed amount represents the investors' equity interest in the firm. In return, they receive shares of the company's stock. Under the model of a joint-stock company, the firm may keep contributed capital as long as it remains in business. If it liquidates, whether through a decision of the owners or through a bankruptcy process, the owners have a residual claim on the firm's eventual equity. If the equity is negative (a deficit) then the unpaid creditors bear loss and the owners' claim is void. Under limited liability, where the financial liability is limited to a fixed sum, owners are not required to pay the firm's debts themselves so long as the firm's books are in order and it has not involved the owners in fraud.\nWhen the owners of a firm are shareholders, their interest is called shareholders' equity. It is the difference between a company's assets and liabilities, and can be negative. If all shareholders are in one class, they share equally in ownership equity from all perspectives. It is not uncommon for companies to issue more than one class of stock, with each class having its own liquidation priority or voting rights. This complicates analysis for both stock valuation and accounting.\nValuation.\nA company's shareholder equity balance does not determine the price at which investors can sell its stock. Other relevant factors include the prospects and risks of its business, its access to necessary credit, and the difficulty of locating a buyer. According to the theory of intrinsic value, it is profitable to buy stock in a company when it is priced below the present value of the portion of its equity and future earnings that are payable to stockholders. Advocates of this method have included Benjamin Graham, Philip Fisher and Warren Buffett. An equity investment will never have a negative market value (i.e. become a liability) even if the firm has a shareholder deficit, because the deficit is not the owners' responsibility.\nAn alternate approach, exemplified by the \"Merton model\",\nvalues stock-equity as a call option on the value of the whole company (including the liabilities), struck at the nominal value of the liabilities.\nThe analogy with options arises in that limited liability protects equity investors:\n(i) where the value of the firm is less than the value of the outstanding debt, shareholders may, and therefore would, choose not to repay the firm's debt;\n(ii) where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay\u2014i.e. exercise their option\u2014and not to liquidate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68808", "revid": "31192532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68808", "title": "Ziklag", "text": "Historic town in the Kingdom of Judah\nZiklag () is the biblical name of a town in the Negev region in the southwest of what was the Kingdom of Judah. It was a provincial town in the Philistine kingdom of Gath when Achish was king. Its exact location has not been identified with any certainty.\nIdentification.\nAt least 14 sites have been proposed as the location of Ziklag. At the end of the 19th century, both Haluza (by Wadi Asluj, south of Beersheba) and Khirbet Zuheiliqah (northwest of Beersheba and south-southeast of Gaza City) had been suggested as possible locations. Conder and Kitchener identified Khirbet Zuheiliqah as the location on the basis of \"Ziklag\" being a corruption of \"Zahaliku\", whence also \"Zuheiliqah\".\nThe more recently proposed identifications for Ziklag are:\nIn the Bible.\nPhilistines' original base.\nThe Book of Genesis (in ) refers to \"Casluhim\" as the origin of the Philistines. Biblical scholars regard this as an eponym rather than a person, and it is thought possible that the name is a corruption of \"Halusah\"; with the identification of Ziklag as Haluza, this suggests that Ziklag was the original base from which the Philistines captured the remainder of their territory. It has also been proposed that Ziklag subsequently became the capital of the Cherethites.\nTribal allotment.\nIn the Book of Joshua's lists of cities of the Israelites by tribe, Ziklag appears both as a town belonging to the Tribe of Judah () and as a town belonging to the Tribe of Simeon (). Textual scholars believe these lists were originally independent administrative documents, not necessarily dating from the same time, and hence reflecting changing tribal boundaries.\nDavid receives Philistine Ziklag.\n1 Samuel 30 claims that by the time of David, the town was under the control of Philistines, but subsequently was given by their king \u2013 Achish \u2013 to David, who at that time was seemingly acting as a vassal of the Philistines. David requested \"a place in one of the country towns\" and was awarded Ziklag, which he used as a base for raids against the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, which he conducted away from Achish's oversight. David's reports to Achish say that he had been conducting raids on Saul's lands in southern Judah and on the Jerahmeelites.\nBiblical scholars argue that the town was probably on the eastern fringe of the Philistines' territory, and that it was natural for it to be annexed to Judah when David became king. Since textual scholars regard the compilation of the Book of Joshua as late, probably due to the deuteronomist, it is possible that the tribal allocations in it date from after this annexation, rather than before.\nDavid and the Amalekites.\nAccording to 1 Samuel 30, while David was encamped with the Philistine army for an attack on the Kingdom of Israel, Amalekites raided Ziklag, burning the town and capturing its population without killing them (scholars think this capture refers to enslavement). But none of the archaeological sites that have been proposed to be Ziklag show any evidence of destruction during the era of David.\nIn the narrative, when David's men discover that their families have been captured, they become angry with David. David seeks the face of his God to determine whether to pursue the Amalekites. The Lord answers and says to pursue them for he would recover all. Initially, 600 men go in pursuit, but a third of them are too exhausted to go further than the HaBesor Stream. They find an abandoned and starving slave, formerly belonging to one of the Amalekites who had raided Ziklag, and after giving him fig cake, raisin cake, and water, persuade him to lead them to the Amalekite raiders. The slave leads them to the captors' camp and finds them feasting and celebrating, due to the size of their spoil; David's forces engage in battle with them for a night and a day, and are victorious.\nTextual scholars ascribe this narrative to the \"monarchial source\" of the Books of Samuel; the \"rival\" source, known as the \"republican source\" (named this due to its negative presentation of David, Saul, and other kings), does not at first glance appear to contain a similar narrative. The same narrative position is occupied in the \"republican source\" by the story of Nabal, who lived in the region south of Hebron (which includes the Negev). There are some similarities between the narratives, including David leading an army in revenge (for Nabal's unwillingness to give provisions to David), with 400 of the army going ahead and 200 staying behind, as well as David gaining Abigail as a wife (though in the Ziklag narrative he \"regains\" her), as well as several provisions, and a jovial feast in the enemy camp (i.e., Nabal's property). There are also several differences, such as the victory and provisions being obtained by Abigail's peaceful actions rather than a heroic victory by David, the 200 that stayed behind doing so to protect the \"baggage\" rather than due to exhaustion, the main secondary character being the wife of the enemy (Nabal) rather than their former slave, David's forces being joined by damsels rather than rejoining their wives, and Nabal rather than the Amalekites being the enemy.\nThe Books of Samuel go on to mention that as a result, the people the Amalekites took were released, and the spoil that the Amalekites had taken, including livestock, and spoil from attacks elsewhere, were divided among David's men, including the third that had remained at the Besor. This ruling, that even those left behind would get a share, is a response by David to those who believed only the two-thirds of David's men who had battled with the Amalekites should get a reward. A similar ruling is given in the Priestly Code () and in . Scholars believe that these rulings derive from the decision in regard to the Amalekite spoil, rather than vice versa.\nAccording to the text, once back at Ziklag, David sends portions of the spoil to the various community leaders \"within Judah\"; the text gives a list of the locations of the recipients, but they are all just within the Negev.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is not documented in extra-biblical documents, and is considered by Sarah Schulz of the University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg as historically plausible, but probably not an actual governor of the province, much like Nehemiah.\nIn the biblical narrative, Zerubbabel led the first group of Jews, numbering 42,360, who returned from the Babylonian captivity in the first year of Cyrus the Great, the king of the Achaemenid Empire. The date is generally thought to have been between 538 and 520 BC. Zerubbabel also laid the foundation of the Second Temple in Jerusalem soon after. In the New Testament he is included in the genealogy of Jesus.\nEtymology.\nZerubbabel means \"seed of Babylon\", showing how quickly the elites integrated into the Babylonian social structure.\nStory.\nIn all of the accounts in the Hebrew Bible that mention Zerubbabel, he is always associated with the high priest who returned with him, Joshua, son of Jozadak (Jehozadak). Together, these two men led the first wave of Jewish returnees from exile and began to rebuild the Temple. Old Testament theologian John Kessler describes the region of Judah as a small province that contained land extending 25\u00a0km from Jerusalem and was independently ruled prior to the Persian rule.\nAppointed by Darius the Great, Zerubbabel was governor of Yehud province. It was after this appointment that Zerubbabel began to rebuild the Temple. Elias Bickerman speculates that one of the reasons that Zerubbabel was able to rebuild the Temple was because of \"the widespread revolts at the beginning of the reign of Darius I in 522 BC, which preoccupied him to such a degree that Zerubbabel felt he could initiate the rebuilding of the temple without repercussions\".\nZerubbabel and the Davidic line.\nThe Davidic line from Jeconiah had been cursed by Jeremiah, saying that no offspring of \"Coniah\" would sit on the throne (Jeremiah 22:30). However, Zerubbabel was of the main Davidic line through Solomon and Jeconiah.\nThe prophets Zechariah and Haggai both give unclear statements regarding Zerubbabel's authority in their oracles, in which Zerubbabel was either the subject of a false prophecy or the receiver of a divine promotion to kingship. He could also be viewed as a governor of a state within another nation and thus technically \"not on the throne\" of a nation. Either way, he was given the task of rebuilding the Temple in the second year of the reign of Darius I (520 BC), along with the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak.\nMuslim historian Ya'qubi (died 897/8) attributed the recovery of the Torah and the Books of the Prophets to him instead of Ezra. The Seder Olam Zutta chronicle from 803 AD lists him as the Exilarch in Babylon to succeed Shealtiel. Several Old Testament texts (see subsection) are conflicting as to whether Zerubbabel was the son or nephew of Shealtiel. His son Meshullam succeeded him as Exilarch, and was followed by another son Hananiah. His other sons were Hashubah, Ohel, Berechiah, Hasadiah and Jushab-hesed (). He also had a daughter called Shelomith ().\nZerubbabel may have had a Babylonian style name because of his interaction with the Babylonian court.\nSheshbazzar.\nThe Book of Ezra begins with Cyrus the Great entrusting the Temple vessels to Sheshbazzar (Hebrew: , \u00a0, \u00a0, \"prince of Judah\", probably from ); this apparently important figure disappears from the story entirely after being named in and , and Zerubbabel is abruptly introduced as the main figure. Both are called governors of Judah and are both credited with laying the foundation of the Temple. A number of explanations have been proposed, including: (1) the two are the same person; (2) Sheshbazzar was in fact Shenazzar (probably from ), Zerubabbel's uncle (mentioned in the Books of Chronicles); (3) Sheshbazzar began the work and Zerubbabel finished it.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nIn the Prophets (\"Nevi'im\").\nZerubbabel appears in the prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah.\nThe Prophecy of Haggai.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"'On that day, says the Lord of Hosts, I will take you Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, my servant, and wear you like a signet ring; for it is you whom I have chosen. This is the word of the Lord of Hosts'\" ().\nThis quotation from the Book of Haggai illustrates the messianic expectations that are often associated with Zerubbabel. The term, \"my servant,\" describes Zerubbabel as God's servant. This term is often associated with King David. Walter Rose concludes that the fact that \"the epithet 'servant' is hardly ever used for kings after David may be related to the fact that most of them were disappointing in their performance as kings appointed by YHVH\". Rose emphasizes that the author of the Book of Haggai is associating Zerubbabel with King David.\nScholars have also analyzed the phrase \"I will take you.\" Rose associates this term with a mission, change, or protection. For Zerubbabel, this mission was likely the rebuilding of the second Temple.\nThe most widely debated part of this prophecy is the phrase, \"wear you like a signet ring.\" A signet ring is an authoritative symbol that is associated with power. Rose interprets this passage by comparing it to the passage in , in through which he concludes that the King is a signet ring on God's hand. John Kessler interprets the idea of the nature of the Signet ring as such that \"the real true figure of speech at issue is a personification of which the simile or metaphor is only a part. The real trope consists of the personification of Yahweh, who is likened to the owner of a signet\". However, this word when in Hebrew has been translated as meaning both seal and signet ring.\nIt is unclear whether Haggai's prophecy claims that Zerubbabel is going to be the King of the Land of Judah or if he is just to build the second Temple. Many scholars have interpreted the following passage from Haggai as identifying Zerubbabel as a king of the land of Judah, a continuation of the Davidic line:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Zerubbabel is to be made either the representative of YHVH, or the new king who will restore the monarchy, or the new world leader. One sometimes finds words like messianic or Messiah used to describe Zerubbabel's role\".\nAccording to Peter Ackroyd, Zerubbabel was \"'a royal representative of God'\". Both historians' interpretations of the prophecy of Haggai appear to understand the term of the \"signet ring\" as being a metaphor for Zerubbabel attaining God's authority on earth.\nNot all biblical scholars interpret Zerubbabel's authority in the same manner. Other scholars see it as a prophecy proclaiming that Zerubbabel will become king. According to Sara Japhet:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Haggai does not explain, however, for what Zerubbabel was chosen. From what is described in the prophecy\u2014the overthrow of the kingdoms of the nations as the first stage in the choosing of Zerubbabel\u2014we may conclude that Haggai sees Zerubbabel as a king, whose kingdom is made possible by a change in the political structure. ... [F]rom now on, since Zerubbabel has been chosen as a 'signet,' he will be 'sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah'. All this, however, is only hinted at in the prophecy of Haggai and not stated explicitly\".\nA. Lemaire interprets the author of Haggai as wanting Zerubbabel to be appointed to a lesser role:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Haggai is expressing the hope of a change in status of the province of Yehud, and of Zerubbabel's emergence as a king of a vassal state within the Persian empire\".\nJohn Kessler's interpretation agrees with Lemaire's:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome historians claim that Haggai's prophecy does not claim that Zerubbabel will become the King of Judah. Rose's concludes that the imagery itself does not claim that Zerubbabel will be King of Judea. Rose also claims that \"in Haggai's passage, one does not find a statement about Zerubbabel being YHVH's anointed, or about his autonomous rule (given by God), present or future, and there is no explicit promise that God will make the nations submit to his chosen one. One reads only about a mutual destruction of political and military forces masterminded by God. On the basis of these observations, I think it is safe to conclude that there is no reason to assume that divine intervention which does not mention autonomous rule or submission of the nations to Zerubbabel () would necessarily imply a change of his position\".\nFurthermore, Rose makes this claim because the prophecy does not claim that Zerubbabel will become king:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The absence of any reference to the Davidic line from which Zerubbabel came, and the failure to use words like \"melech\" ... (related to the title of King)...point in a different direction\".\nZechariah.\nFalling in line with the rest of the twelve prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible (the Nevi'im), the book of Zechariah describes a hope for a future king, beyond the current leader Zerubbabel, and further establishes a portrayal of this future king. Anthony Petterson argues that the standard explanation of Haggai and Zechariah's prophecies, in which Zerubbabel was supposed to be the restorer of the Davidic dynasty but never fulfilled these expectations, does not actually stand as an explanation of the final form of these texts.\nZerubbabel's name is mentioned four times throughout Zechariah 1\u20138, and all of these instances occur in one short oracle written in chapter 4. Any other references to Zerubbabel throughout this book are guesses or theories as to his significance. Zechariah 4:1\u20133 gives a vision that was had by Zechariah of a lampstand with a bowl on it. Upon that are seven lamps, each with seven lips. There are two olive trees, one to the right of the bowl and one to the left. The explanation, told by the angel that Zechariah is conversing with, is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the Lord of hosts. 'Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain! And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts of \"Grace, grace to it!\"' (Zech 4:6\u20137)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. \u2026 The seven are the eyes of the Lord, which range through the whole earth \u2026 the two olive trees \u2026 are the two sons of oil (anointed ones) who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.\" (Zech 4:9\u201314)\nThere is a debate in the biblical scholarly community as to who the \"sons of oil\" is referencing. Though conventional wisdom often understood it to be Zerubbabel and Joshua, Boda argues that, because of the important role that prophets were said to play in the reconstruction of the Temple in Zech 8:9, Haggai and Zechariah are the sons of oil.\nThe controversy regarding the prophesies about Zerubbabel relate back to this quote about Zerubbabel laying the foundation of the temple and eventually completing it. Zech 3:8 and 6:12 refer to a man called \"The Branch.\" In Zechariah 6, the Lord tells Zechariah to gather silver and gold from the returned exiles (who had come back to Judah from Babylonia), and to go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah (members of the Davidic lineage). Then Zechariah is told to fashion a crown out of the silver and gold, set it on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, and tell him the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Thus says the Lord of hosts: Here is a man whose name is Branch (Hebrew: \"Zemah\"): for he shall branch out in his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord \u2026 he shall bear royal honor, and shall sit upon his throne and rule. There shall be a priest by his throne, with peaceful understanding between the two of them.\" (Zech 6:12\u201313)\nIt is unclear whether or not \"the Branch\" refers to Zerubbabel. Should this have been the intention of the author, then the restoration of the Davidic line of kings would be imminent, as Zerubbabel is a member of the line of David (1 Chron 3:19\u201320). There is some evidence for this link, namely that Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah at the time of Zechariah, he was frequently associated with Joshua (Ezra 3:2, 3:8), and he is also described as the Temple builder (Zech 4:9). However, there are several reasons that complicate this association. The first is that Joshua is the one crowned, not the Branch. The next is that Zerubbabel is not mentioned. The third is that the references to Zemah appear to anticipate a future event, while Zerubbabel existed in the present. Zechariah neither proclaims that Zerubbabel will restore the monarchy, nor does he contradict the previous hopes for a Davidic king (Hag 2:23). Rather, Zechariah maintains hope for a Davidic king in the future, without tying down the prophecy directly to Zerubbabel.\nIn the Writings (Kethuvim).\nEzra.\nAccording to the Book of Ezra chapter 2, Zerubbabel returned to Jerusalem in the first wave of liberated exiles under the decree of King Cyrus of Persia in 538 BC. The mention of Zerubbabel in the book of Ezra primarily serves the purpose of describing the return to Judah following the exile from Babylon and the construction of the Second Temple. According to the authors of the Book of Ezra, \"when the seventh month came\u2026 Jeshua son of Jozadak along with his fellow-priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, with his colleagues, set to work to build the altar of the God of Israel\". ()\nThe Book of Ezra also gives a date for the beginning of the construction of the Temple:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"In the second month of the second year, after they came to the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak began the work\".()\nThis passage describes how Zerubbabel was part of the group who began to build the second Temple of Jerusalem. According to the Book of Ezra, Zerubbabel is also under the authority of King Cyrus of Persia to build the Temple (Ezr. 4:3). The passages describing Zerubbabel do mention the prophecies of Haggai and of Zechariah concerning Zerubbabel's actions in the land of Judah.\nRegarding Sheshbazzar, he is frequently considered to have been appointed governor of Judah by the Persian King Cyrus in the year 538 BC, although an argument has been made that he was the last Neo-Babylonian governor of Yehud at the time of the Persian invasion. He was given gold and told to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple. According to a letter from Tattenai (the governor of the province Beyond the River) to King Darius I, Sheshbazzar started the Temple, but it lay under construction for a long time (). It seems as though Zerubbabel picked up construction shortly afterwards, in the 2nd year of Darius' rule (August 29, 520 BC) (see Zerubbabel in Haggai).\nAccording to the Letter written by King Darius I recorded in the Book of Ezra:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar carried away from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned; they are all to be taken back to the temple in Jerusalem, and restored each to its place in the house of God\". ()\nThe final detail in the book of Ezra regarding Zerubbabel is a date for the completion of the second Temple. According to the Book of Ezra, \"the house was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.\" In this passage, the word \"house\" refers to the second Temple.\nNehemiah.\nThe reference to Zerubbabel in the Book of Nehemiah is rather brief. The author of the Book of Nehemiah only refers to Zerubbabel in passing when the author states that: \"These are the priests and the Levites which came back with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua\" (Neh. 12:1). The Book of Nehemiah provides no new information regarding Zerubbabel; however, Nehemiah came to Jeruzalem around 444 BC, almost a century later than Zerubbabel, so that is not so surprising.\n1st Chronicles.\nThe mention of Zerubbabel in 1 Chronicles only states Zerubbabel and his lineage and descendants. The Masoretic Text of the passage states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The sons of Pedaiah: Zerubbabel and Shimei. The sons of Zerubbabel: Meshullam and Hannaniah; they had a sister Shelomith. There were five others: Hashubah, Ohel, Berechiah, Hasadiah, and Jushab-hesed\" (1 Chronicles 3:19).\nUnlike the passages in Nehemiah, Haggai, and Ezra, the Masoretic text of 1 Chronicles appears to state that Zerubbabel is not the son of Shealtiel, but rather the son of Pedaiah. However, in the Septuagint text of 1 Chronicles, Zerubbabel is said to be the son of Shealtiel, in agreement with all other accounts.\nSon of Shealtiel or Pedaiah.\nThe Hebrew Bible has conflicting texts regarding whether Zerubbabel is the son of Shealtiel or of Pedaiah. Several texts (that are thought to be more or less contemporaneous) explicitly call \"Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel\" (, , ). In addition, the genealogy given in the Septuagint text of 1 Chronicles supports that position, as does the Seder Olam Zutta. In contrast, the Masoretic Text of makes Zerubbabel a nephew of Shealtiel: King Jeconiah is the father of Shealtiel and Pedaiah, then Pedaiah is the father of Zerubbabel.\nThe text which identifies Zerubbabel as a son of Pedaiah could be a scribal error. It occurs in a part of the text where the Hebrew seems incongruent and possibly garbled (). The expected mention of Shealtiel being a father seems accidentally omitted, and thus his children became confused with Pedaiah's. There may be other problems with these verses as well.\nIn any case, those texts that call Zerubbabel \"son of Shealtiel\" have a context that is overtly political and seems to emphasize Zerubbabel's potential royal claim to the throne of the Davidic Dynasty by being Shealtiel's successor. Zerubbabel is understood as the legal successor of Shealtiel, with Zerubbabel's title paralleling the High Priest Jeshua's title, \"son of Jozadak\", that emphasizes Joshua's rightful claim to the dynasty of high priests, descending from Aaron. Therefore, with one descending from David and the other from Aaron, these two officials have the divine authority to rebuild the Temple.\nIn the New Testament.\nIn the New Testament, the name Zerubbabel appears in both versions of the genealogy of Jesus.\nMatthew's genealogy matches the genealogy presented in the Septuagint text of 1 Chronicles, although the Masoretic Text of 1 Chronicles replaces Shealtiel with his brother Pedaiah (another son of Jechoniah). Luke's genealogy differs from these completely after David, except for the mention of a Shealtiel and his son, Zerubbabel. Various explanations have been suggested for this divergence, with one common explanation being that Luke traces the genealogy of Jesus through Mary, in recognition of the virgin birth.\nIn Apocrypha.\nSirach.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"How shall we magnify Zerubbabel? He was like a signet ring on the right hand\" (Sirach 49:13)\nZerubbabel is listed alongside Jeshua (Joshua) son of Jozadak and Nehemiah as a leader of the restoration of the Temple. Notably, Ezra is missing from this honor. This portion of the text of Sirach is a list and brief description of the famous rulers, prophets, and ancestors of the kingdom of Judah (beginning in chapter 44).\n1st Esdras.\n1 Esdras 3\u20134 tells the story of a speech-writing competition between three bodyguards of Darius I known as the Tale of the Three Guardsmen or the Darius contest, in which the winner would receive honor and riches from the King. In turn, the three guardsmen nominate wine, the king, and women and truth, as \"the strongest\". Zerubbabel's statement, that women and truth are the strongest, proves to be the one which Darius prefers. Scholars have long debated the source of the competition and the Praise of Truth. Cook says that the competition story could be either \"a secondary insertion or part of the original compilation\". The argument for wine conflicts with Proverbs 23:29\u201335 and Sirach 31:.25\u201330. Cook mentions other views of the Praise of Truth: \"may be a specimen of Palestinian wisdom (Zunz), and although Volz (1493) thinks it shows contact with Alexandrian religious philosophy, Torrey (46 seq.) fails to find anything 'hellenistic' or suggestive of the influence of Greek literature or philosophy\".\nTorrey (1910) disagrees with German critics: \"But if any student of the Greek Bible will look closely at the idiom of these two chapters, he will find it precisely the same which elsewhere results from a close rendering of a Hebrew or Aramaic original. \u2026 All those who are familiar with Semitic modes of thought and literary forms will recognize here a characteristic Semitic product\". Dancy (2001) supports Torrey: \"And the praise of truth is clearly an insertion (4.34\u201341). It differs totally from the other three in being not a courtly speech but a lofty hymn. In particular, Egyption Ma'at and Persian Arsha were deities of order, representing both truth and (as here) justice. The hymn is unlikely to be Jewish in origin, otherwise the praise would have been of Wisdom, but its elevated tone clearly appealed to the Jewish editor.\"\nThe first two spoke about the strength of wine and the strength of kings, respectively, but the winner was the third bodyguard, who spoke about the strength of women and truth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"If she smiles at him, he laughs; if she loses her temper with him, he flatters her so that she may be reconciled with him. Gentlemen, why are not women strong, since they do such things?\" (1 Esdras 4:31\u201332).\nThis speaker is told (in parentheses) to be Zerubbabel, but this detail was likely tacked onto a secular, Hellenized tale about the power of wine, kings, truth, and women. The author of 1 Esdras might have done so to glorify the power of Zerubbabel, the description of which is unparalleled in Ezra, Nehemiah, and Haggai, as the aforementioned books all discuss the power of Zerubbabel in accordance to the power of the high priest Joshua. After Zerubbabel wins the competition, he is given sanction to rebuild the Temple and return the sacred Temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar II had preserved after the conquest of Babylon.\nIt is also probable that the author of 1 Esdras included this reference to Zerubbabel to alleviate any confusion about the difference between Zerubbabel and Sheshbazzar that was apparent in the original book of Ezra.\nThe account of Zerubbabel in 1 Esdras is almost identical to the account of Zerubbabel in the Book of Ezra, included in the Kethuvim. This is because many scholars believe that 1 Esdras is a Greek version of the Book of Ezra. However, there are a few details that appear in 1 Esdras and not in the Book of Ezra. The first discrepancy is that 1 Esdras refers to Zerubbabel's son as Joakim (1 Esdras 5:5). However, this is not one of the sons included in the genealogy included in 1 Chronicles and the Book of Ezra makes no mention of Zerubbabel's son.\nThe second discrepancy is that the author of 1 Esdras claims that it was \"Zerubbabel who spoke wise words before King Darius of Persia\" (1 Esdras 5:6). However, there is no passage similar to this in the Book of Ezra. Finally 1 Esdras mentions a person called Sanabassar as the Governor of Judah and that it was he who laid the foundation for the first temple (1 Esdras 6:18\u201320). Sanabassar may refer to Shashbazar. According to the Book of Ezra, Shashbazar was a governor of Judah (Ezra 5:14) who receives credit for laying the temple's foundation (Ezra 5:15). The difference in the names is likely due to the rendering of the Hebrew name in Greek.\nZorobabel and the Darius contest in other texts.\nAlcuin Blamires has found five authors who tell the tale of a contest to identify what is the strongest thing. According to Blamires these tales represent \"the nearest discoverable counterpart to Theophrastus/Jerome's influence on medieval misogyny.\" In chronological order they are:\nFive versions pick truth as strongest after discussing the merits of women. Bozon's omission of the \"Esdras sequel on truth\" was either deliberate or \"not available in the account he is following. Le F\u00e8vre \"makes Zorobabel a fourth speaker, championing truth after the other three nominations have been aired by three preceding speakers\". Lope De Vega also ignores truth. Walker observes that De Vega used several historical sources in addition to 1 Esdras. Four versions (Esdras, Josephus, Gower and Collier) mention the courtesan Apame who took the crown of Darius in Esdras and Josephus (in Gower Apemen is courtesan of Cyrus). Collier follows Esdras fairly closely and \"ends with a pious expression of the poet's submission to divine will:\".\nThe contest inspired six sixteenth century artists to create prints illustrating the four powers. Veldman has located works by Philips Galle, Johannes Wierix, Pieter Perret, Zacharias Dolendo, Nicolaus Kn\u00fcpfer and Christoffel van Sichem. The last work dates from 1657. The disappearance of 1 Esdras from the Dutch bible \"would certainly have contributed to the sudden decline in the riddle's popularity\".\nMany authors consider \"truth\" to be the core of this story. Some modern critics view \"women\" as the focus as they were often belittled in biblical and medieval texts. Milton disagrees with Zorobabel and asserts that \"truth and justice are all one\".\nIn Freemasonry.\nAlthough he is not mentioned in Craft Freemasonry, Zerubbabel is considered to be of great importance to a number of Masonic bodies. Within Holy Royal Arch freemasonry and Scottish Rite Freemasonry he is considered to be a ruling principal.\nIn other texts.\nHe is the receiver of an apocalypse in the seventh-century \"Apocalypse of Zerubbabel,\" also known as \"Sefer Zerubbabel.\" This text contains a prophecy given to Zerubbabel from God. It is very similar to the style of the prophecy given in 1 Enoch. The prophecy contains messianic imagery and Zerubbabel is told the future of the city of Jerusalem.\nHe plays a large role in Sholem Asch's final work \"The Prophet\". He is announced as the Prince of Judah upon his return to the Holy Land. One of the firm and long-standing followers and friends of the Prophet Isaiah, and descendant of the Davidic Dynasty.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was listed as the second son of Reuel, son of Basemath, who was Ishmael's daughter and one of the wives of Esau the brother of Jacob (Israel) ().\nSon of Tamar and Judah.\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, Zerah was the son of Tamar and her father-in-law Judah, and was the twin of Perez (). This same Zerah is mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in .\nZerah is also listed as the ancestor of Achan, who was stoned to death as recounted in the Book of Joshua (). Achan is the son of Carmi, a descendant of Zimri, the son of Zerah.\nSimeonite clan.\nThe Bible also identifies Zerah as the name of the founder of one of the Simeonite clans.\nThe Cushite.\n\"Zerah the Cushite\" is mentioned by the Book of Chronicles (). There he is said to have invaded the Kingdom of Judah with an enormous army in the days of Asa. According to the text, when Zerah's army reached that of Asa at the valley of Zephathah near Mareshah, Zerah's army was utterly defeated, by divine intervention, and Asa's forces collected a large volume of spoils of war.\nThe invasion, and its implied time-frame, means that the traditional view was to consider this Zerah to have actually been Usarkon II or Usarkon I, both being rulers of Egypt. Usarkon II is known to have entered the Kingdom of Judah with a huge army in 853 BCE; however, rather than attacking Judah, the army was just passing through on its way to attack the Assyrian forces. In addition, Asa's reign is traditionally dated to have ended in 873 BCE. In the Book of Kings, which doesn't mention Asa's defeat of Zerah, Asa is described as being extremely weak from a defensive point of view (), and Biblical scholars regard the idea that Asa could defeat an enormous Egyptian army to be untenable. More recent scholars consider that Zerah the Cushite may have been a military commander under Osorkon I rather than a Pharaoh.\nFurthermore, \"Cushite\" refers to Kush. It is unclear why either Usarkon should be described as a \"Cushite.\" The name \u201cZerah\u201d may have been a corruption of \u201cUsarkon\u201d (U-Serak-on), to which it closely resembles (see Petrie, Egypt and Israel, 74), but most scholars do not identify Zerah with Usarkon II. The publication by Naville (1891) of an inscription in which Usarkon II would claim to have invaded Lower and Upper Palestine suggests this Pharaoh as the victor over Asa. However, the Bible contends that Asa won the battle.\nIt is a possibility that \"Cushites \" gained dominance in Upper and Lower Egypt during the 9th and 8th century. Zerah was most likely a Cushite of Nubia located in Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan who came to power as ruler of Egypt or at the very least a Nubian commander of The Egyptian/Nubian armies. William F. Albright suggested that Zerah was the governor of a Cushite colony which had been established by Shishak after his campaign in Israel. tells us that the Cushites (Ethiopians) were feared far and wide for conquests and destruction (being a powerful nation who dominated ancient kingdoms). Cushites were a very formidable people who were expert archers famous in the ancient world for surprise attacks with the bow and arrow.\nIn the genealogies of the Book of Chronicles.\nThe Book of Chronicles mentions a Zerah who was a Gershonite Levite ().\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68818", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68818", "title": "Moral Politics", "text": "1996 book by George Lakoff\nMoral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think is a 1996 book by cognitive linguist George Lakoff. It argues that conservatives and liberals hold two different conceptual models of morality. Conservatives have a strict father model in which people are made good through self-discipline and hard work, everyone is taken care of by taking care of themselves. Liberals have a nurturant parent model in which everyone is taken care of by helping each other.\nThe first edition of the book was published with the subtitle What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don't.\nThe book.\n\"Moral Politics\" has two different purposes. Lakoff uses the techniques of cognitive linguistics to attempt to better understand the mental frameworks that lie behind contemporary American politics, describing which mental concepts make up a \"liberal\", and which a \"conservative\". (What Lakoff means by these two terms is considered below.) And, in the last few chapters, he argues that \"liberal\" morals and politics are superior to \"conservative\" morals and politics.\nThe book is intended as an objective study of the conceptual metaphors underlying conservative and liberal politics although the closing section is devoted to the author's personal views. Lakoff makes it clear however, that there is no such thing as an \"Objective\" study of politics, as politics is based in subjective morality.\nLakoff wrote \"Moral Politics\" soon after the Republican Party's \"Contract With America\" takeover of Congress under the Clinton presidency, and his usage of the terms \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" is strongly influenced by how those labels were used in the 1994 elections, the former having much to do with the Democratic party and the latter with the Republican party; indeed, chapter 9, \"Moral Categories in Politics\", presents Hillary Clinton as a prototypical \"liberal\" and Newt Gingrich as a prototypical \"conservative\". (Lakoff actually puts this somewhat differently, suggesting that Clinton is the prototypical nemesis of conservatives, while Gingrich is the prototypical nemesis of liberals.)\nThe central problems.\nThe major observations/assumptions and questions on which the book is founded include these:\nThe proposed solution: a metaphorical model.\nLakoff tries to resolve these difficulties through a model in which liberals and conservatives are shown to have different and contradictory worldviews. These worldviews are thought to conflict in a number of ways relevant to the understanding of politics. Nonetheless, Lakoff claims that all of these differences center around the two sides' respective understandings of a single concept - the ideal nuclear family.\nThe family is central to Lakoff because he views the family as the most familiar model for Americans to understand the country; that is, Americans often metaphorically understand their country as a family, with the government corresponding to the parent(s) of the family and the individual citizens corresponding to the children. Thus, one's understanding of how a family is best organized will have direct implications for how the country should be governed.\nThe progressive ideal conceptualization follows the model of the \"nurturant parent\" family, while the conservative's follows the model of the \"strict father\" family. Given the importance of these concepts in \"Moral Politics\", it is important to consider their meaning, along with how each view suggests and is justified by a corresponding view of the nature of child rearing, morality, and justice.\nA \"nurturant parent\" family is one that revolves around every family member caring for and being cared for by every other family member, with open communication between all parties, and with each family member pursuing their own vision of happiness. The nurturant parent model is also correlated with the following views:\nIn contrast, the \"strict father\" family revolves around the idea that parents teach their children how to be self-reliant and self-disciplined through \"tough love\". This is correlated with the following views:\nLakoff uses this model to answer the central questions framed above - why is there such clear grouping on issues that separate liberals and conservatives, and, conversely, why don't we find more issue-by-issue voters? Lakoff claims that one's take on any given political issue is largely determined by which model one adopts. Thus, in Part IV, \"The Hard Issues\", he tries to demonstrate how the liberal and conservative worldviews outlined above lead to typical liberal and conservative positions on a wide range of issues, including taxes, the death penalty, environmental regulations, affirmative action, education, and abortion.\nAs to why liberals and conservatives view each other as incomprehensible on an issue-by-issue basis, Lakoff claims that this is due to each side failing to grasp the other side's worldview as well as not appreciating how different the other worldview is from its own. Failure to see or appreciate this gap results in both sides thinking the other is hopelessly irrational and immoral.\nLakoff also uses this model to show how and why liberals and conservatives use different semantics, often even using the same words in very different ways. Liberals and conservatives have different worldviews and semantics are very much influenced by the worldview of the speaker. As Lakoff puts it,\nWords don't have meanings in isolation. Words are defined relative to a conceptual system. If liberals are to understand how conservatives use their words, they will have to understand the conservative conceptual system. (From chapter 2, \"The Worldview Problem\")\nHere, Lakoff is specifically referring to liberals' challenges in understanding conservatives. However, he obviously views the reverse situation as equally problematic.\nIn addressing why conservatives and liberals choose different issues as the focus of their campaigns, Lakoff claims that this too finds explanation in the context of his model. In the 1994 elections, the Republican focus on \"family values\", while the Democrats largely ignored this framing, is key to Lakoff. He views this discrepancy as a sign that conservatives understand the \"Country is a Family\" metaphor that lies behind people's views of politics much better than liberals do. And, by extension, this has been key to the success of the Republican Party.\nClarifications of the model.\nThere are several things Lakoff does not intend to mean with his model. Perhaps most importantly, he does not believe that all conservatives are the same, nor all liberals. Chapter 17, \"Varieties of Liberals and Conservatives\", is devoted to showing scales along which one can slide and still be a member of either camp. Among other things, he says that one might have one way to conceptualize an actual nuclear family, and a separate, even opposite, way of conceptualizing a metaphorical country-family. Lakoff is not trying to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for being liberal or conservative. In the terminology of cognitive linguistics, Lakoff views both liberal and conservative as \"radial category\" labels.\nLakoff does not feel people consciously believe in the family concepts he describes. As a cognitive scientist, he believes he is describing mental structures that are mostly below the level of consciousness. A tenet of cognitive psychology is that such mental structures affect one's opinions and consequent actions.\nArguments against shallow stereotypes.\nLakoff is opposed to superficial, stereotypical and false characterizing of both liberals and conservatives. The book addresses common oversimplifications about both worldviews.\nIn chapter 7, \"Why We Need a New Understanding of American Politics\", Lakoff refutes several conceptions of \"Conservatism\" that he views as too simplistic. He says that any liberal or conservative saying that \"Conservatives just believe in less government\" is incorrect. Common misconceptions that liberals hold include that Conservatism is \"the ethos of selfishness\" and \"is no more than a conspiracy of the ultrarich to protect their money and power and to make themselves even richer and more powerful.\" Common misunderstandings of conservatives by conservatives are that \"Conservatism (and nothing else) is for traditional values\", and that \"Conservatism is just what the Bible tells us.\"\nIn chapter 18, \"Pathologies, Stereotypes, and Distortions\", he refutes certain stereotyped views of liberals, including viewing them as \"lovers of bureaucracy\", \"defenders of special interests\" and \"advocating only rights and no responsibilities\" (p.\u00a0317, 1996 edition).\nThe importance of metaphors.\nLakoff argues that people tend to think metaphorically, reasoning through analogy rather than logic. Metaphors are prevalent in communication and we do not just use them in language; we actually perceive and act in accordance with metaphors. Conceptual metaphors shape not just our communication, but also the way we think and act.\nAs a cognitive scientist Lakoff emphasizes that what conservatives know that liberals don't is how to use metaphors to motivate people. Liberals try to persuade through reason and facts while conservatives used metaphorical stories and that is why, Lakoff argues, conservative politicians are more successful at motivating voters than liberals are.\nSecond edition.\nThe book's subtitle changed between the first and the current edition. Previously titled \"Moral Politics: What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don't\", it has been rechristened \"Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think\".\nThe original subtitle reflected Lakoff's idea that conservatives, at least 1994 conservatives, understood the nature of American politics better than liberals. In particular, he felt conservatives better understood the metaphorical connection between the family, morality and politics; and, especially around 1994, were able to gain votes by using persuasive metaphors, whilst liberals employed logic and reason. Within this framework, the original subtitle can be seen as a call-to-arms to liberals to gain understanding of how people actually think about politics, or face growing electoral irrelevance.\nThe bulk of the second edition text is identical to that of the first. All that is added is a second edition preface, and a 37-page afterword relating the book's content to the 2000 US presidential election.\nApplication.\nHoward Dean.\nPresidential candidate Howard Dean is a fan of the book, citing it as support for his activist strategy. \"What you do is crank the heck out of your base, get them really excited and crank up the base turnout and you'll win the middle-of-the-roaders,\" Dean told \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\". Dean reasoned that since swing voters share the mental model of both parties they will eventually go with whatever party excites them the most. \"Democrats appeal to them on their softer side--the safety net--but the Republicans appeal to them on the harder side--the discipline, the responsibility, and so forth. So the question is which side appears to be energetic, deeply believing in its message, deeply committed to bringing a vision of hope to America. That side is the side that gets the swing voters and wins.\"\nWhile Dean lost the 2004 Presidential Democratic primary, he has been successful in other political and activist arenas. First, he was the governor of Vermont, and later the front-runner in a crowded primary race although his campaign was staffed mostly by students and non-professional political staff. Dean later formed the activist organization Democracy for America and later was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee (leader of the Democratic party) in February 2005. Dean's activism is widely credited with reviving the activist base of the Democratic Party.\nDean later wrote the introduction to a related but shorter book by Lakoff, \"Don't Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate\"."}
{"id": "68819", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68819", "title": "Naturopathy", "text": "Form of alternative medicine\nNaturopathy, or naturopathic medicine, is a form of alternative medicine. A wide array of practices branded as \"natural\", \"non-invasive\", or promoting \"self-healing\" are employed by its practitioners, who are known as naturopaths. These treatments range from the pseudoscientific and thoroughly discredited, such as homeopathy, to the widely accepted, such as certain forms of psychotherapy. The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine rather than evidence-based medicine, although practitioners may use techniques supported by evidence. The ethics of naturopathy have been called into question by medical professionals and its practice has been characterized as quackery.\nNaturopathic practitioners commonly encourage alternative treatments that are rejected by conventional medicine, including resistance to surgery or vaccines for some patients. The diagnoses made by naturopaths often have no basis in science and are often not accepted by mainstream medicine.\nNaturopaths frequently campaign for legal recognition in the United States. Naturopathy is prohibited in three U.S. states (Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee) and tightly regulated in many others. Some states, however, allow naturopaths to perform minor surgery or even prescribe drugs. While some schools exist for naturopaths, and some jurisdictions allow such practitioners to call themselves doctors, the lack of accreditation, scientific medical training, and quantifiable positive results means they lack the competency of true medical doctors.\nHistory.\nThe term \"naturopathy\" originates from \"natura\" (Latin root for birth) and \"pathos\" (the Greek root for suffering) to suggest \"natural healing\". Naturopaths claim the ancient Greek \"Father of Medicine\", Hippocrates, as the first advocate of naturopathic medicine, before the term existed. Naturopathy has its roots in the 19th-century Natural Cure movement of Europe. After graduating as a licenciate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1879, Thomas Allinson began promoting his \"hygienic medicine\" in London, advocating a natural diet, exercise, and avoidance of tobacco and overwork.\nThe term \"naturopathy\" was coined in 1895 by John Scheel, and bought by Benedict Lust, whom naturopaths consider to be the \"Father of U.S. Naturopathy\". Lust had been schooled in hydrotherapy and other natural health practices in Germany by Father Sebastian Kneipp; Kneipp sent Lust to the United States to spread his drugless methods. Lust defined naturopathy as a broad discipline rather than a particular method, and included such techniques as hydrotherapy, herbal medicine, and homeopathy, as well as eliminating overeating, tea, coffee, and alcohol. He described the body in spiritual and vitalistic terms with \"absolute reliance upon the cosmic forces of man's nature\". According to the \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\", the first known use of \"naturopathy\" in print is from 1901.\nFrom 1901, Lust founded the American School of Naturopathy in New York. In 1902, the original North American Kneipp Societies were discontinued and renamed \"Naturopathic Societies\". In September 1919, the Naturopathic Society of America was dissolved and Benedict Lust founded the American Naturopathic Association to supplant it. Naturopaths became licensed under naturopathic or drugless practitioner laws in 25 states in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Naturopathy was adopted by many chiropractors, and several schools offered both Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) and Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degrees. Estimates of the number of naturopathic schools active in the United States during this period vary from about one to two dozen.\nAfter a period of rapid growth, naturopathy went into decline for several decades after the 1930s. In 1910, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching published the Flexner Report, which criticized many aspects of medical education, especially quality and lack of scientific rigour. The advent of penicillin and other \"miracle drugs\" and the consequent popularity of modern medicine also contributed to naturopathy's decline. In the 1940s and 1950s, a broadening in scope of practice laws led many chiropractic schools to drop their ND degrees, though many chiropractors continued to practice naturopathy. From 1940 to 1963, the American Medical Association campaigned against heterodox medical systems. By 1958, practice of naturopathy was licensed in only five states. In 1968, the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare issued a report on naturopathy concluding that naturopathy was not grounded in medical science and that naturopathic education was inadequate to prepare graduates to make appropriate diagnosis and provide treatment; the report recommends against expanding Medicare coverage to include naturopathic treatments. In 1977 an Australian committee of inquiry reached similar conclusions; it did not recommend licensure for naturopaths.\nBeginning in the 1970s, there was a revival of interest in the United States and Canada, in conjunction with the \"holistic health\" movement. As of 2009[ [update]], fifteen U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia licensed naturopathic doctors, and the State of Washington requires insurance companies to offer reimbursement for services provided by naturopathic physicians. On the other hand, some states such as South Carolina and Tennessee prohibit the practice of naturopathy.\nIn the United States, the Indian Health Service began accepting naturopathic doctors in their clinics and practice in 2013, also making loan repayment available to ND's.\nIn 2015, a former naturopathic doctor, Britt Marie Hermes, began writing critically about her experience being trained in and practicing naturopathic medicine. Her blog garnered a large following among skeptics while enraging some proponents of alternative medicine.\nPractice.\nIn 2003, a report was presented by Kimball C. Atwood, an American medical doctor and researcher from Newton, Massachusetts, best known as a critic of naturopathic medicine, stating among other criticisms that \"The practice of naturopathy is based on a belief in the body's ability to heal itself through a special vital energy or force guiding bodily processes internally\".\nDiagnosis and treatment concern primarily alternative therapies and \"natural\" methods that naturopaths claim promote the body's natural ability to heal. Many naturopaths in India now use modern diagnostic techniques in their practice. Naturopaths focus on a holistic approach, avoiding the use of surgery and conventional medicines. Naturopaths aim to prevent illness through stress reduction and changes to diet and lifestyle, often rejecting the methods of evidence-based medicine.\nA consultation typically begins with a comprehensive patient interview assessing lifestyle, medical history, emotional tone, and physical features, as well as physical examination. Many naturopaths present themselves as primary care providers, and some naturopathic physicians may prescribe drugs, perform minor surgery, and integrate other conventional medical approaches such as diet and lifestyle counselling with their naturopathic practice. Traditional naturopaths deal exclusively with lifestyle changes, not diagnosing or treating disease. Naturopaths do not generally recommend vaccines and antibiotics, based in part on the early views that shaped the profession, and they may provide alternative remedies even in cases where evidence-based medicine has been shown effective.\nMethods.\nNaturopaths are often opposed to mainstream medicine and take an antivaccinationist stance.\nThe particular modalities used by a naturopath vary with training and scope of practice. These may include herbalism, homeopathy, acupuncture, nature cures, physical medicine, applied kinesiology, colonic enemas, chelation therapy, color therapy, cranial osteopathy, hair analysis, iridology, live blood analysis, ozone therapy, psychotherapy, public health measures and hygiene, reflexology, rolfing, massage therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. \"Nature cures\" include a range of therapies based on exposure to natural elements such as sunshine, fresh air, or heat or cold, as well as nutrition advice such as following a vegetarian and whole food diet, fasting, or abstention from alcohol and sugar. Physical medicine includes naturopathic, osseous, or soft tissue manipulative therapy, sports medicine, exercise, and hydrotherapy. Psychological counseling includes meditation, relaxation, and other methods of stress management.\nA 2004 survey determined the most commonly prescribed naturopathic therapeutics in Washington state and Connecticut were botanical medicines, vitamins, minerals, homeopathy, and allergy treatments. An examination published in 2011 of naturopathic clinic websites in Alberta and British Columbia found that the most commonly advertised therapies were homeopathy, botanical medicine, nutrition, acupuncture, lifestyle counseling, and detoxification.\nIn 2020, a survey of methods used by naturopaths in fourteen countries reported that 27% of clients received acupuncture, 22% homeopathy, 16% \"other energetic medicines\", and 13.5% were given hydrotherapy. A mean of 4.0 \"treatments\" were provided to each customer. One-third (33%) of patients consulted with only the naturopath to manage their primary health concern.\nEvidence basis.\nNaturopathy as a whole lacks an adequate scientific basis, and it is rejected by the medical community. Although it includes valid lifestyle advice from mainstream medicine (healthy sleep, balanced diet, regular exercise), it typically adds a range of pseudoscientific beliefs. Some methods rely on immaterial \"vital energy fields\", the existence of which has not been proven, and there is concern that naturopathy as a field tends towards isolation from general scientific discourse. Naturopathy is criticized for its reliance on and its association with unproven, disproven, and other controversial alternative medical treatments, and for its vitalistic underpinnings. Natural substances known as nutraceuticals show little promise in treating diseases, especially cancer, as laboratory experiments have shown limited therapeutic effect on biochemical pathways, while clinical trials demonstrate poor bioavailability. According to the American Cancer Society, \"scientific evidence does not support claims that naturopathic medicine can cure cancer or any other disease\". According to Britt Hermes, naturopath student programs are problematic because \"As a naturopath [student], you are making justifications to make the rules and to fudge the standards of how to interpret research all along the way. Because if you don't, you're not left with anything, basically\".\nIn 2015, the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; Naturopathy was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.\nKimball C. Atwood IV writes, in the journal \"Medscape General Medicine\",&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Naturopathic physicians now claim to be primary care physicians proficient in the practice of both \"conventional\" and \"natural\" medicine. Their training, however, amounts to a small fraction of that of medical doctors who practice primary care. An examination of their literature, moreover, reveals that it is replete with pseudoscientific, ineffective, unethical, and potentially dangerous practices. In another article, Atwood writes that \"Physicians who consider naturopaths to be their colleagues thus find themselves in opposition to one of the fundamental ethical precepts of modern medicine. If naturopaths are not to be judged \"nonscientific practitioners\", the term has no useful meaning\".\nA former licensed naturopathic doctor, Britt Marie Hermes, states that \"any product that is sold by a naturopath almost guarantees that there is no reliable scientific data to support whatever health claims are made, and that while some naturopaths claim to only practice evidence based medicine, \"the problem is, all naturopaths in an accredited naturopathic program are required to extensively study homeopathy, herbal medicine, energy healing, chiropractic techniques, water therapy\" and other pseudoscientific practices. Hermes further notes that, while some naturopaths claim that their method can be effective treatments for psychological disorders, \"no naturopathic treatment has been clinically proven to be safe and effective for bipolar disorder or any other condition.\"\nAccording to Arnold S. Relman, the \"Textbook of Natural Medicine\" is inadequate as a teaching tool, as it omits to mention or treat in detail many common ailments, improperly emphasizes treatments \"not likely to be effective\" over those that are, and promotes unproven herbal remedies at the expense of pharmaceuticals. He concludes that \"the risks to many sick patients seeking care from the average naturopathic practitioner would far outweigh any possible benefits\".\nThe Massachusetts Medical Society states, \"Naturopathic practices are unchanged by research and remain a large assortment of erroneous and potentially dangerous claims mixed with a sprinkling of non-controversial dietary and lifestyle advice.\"\nSafety of natural treatments.\nNaturopaths often recommend exposure to naturally occurring substances, such as sunshine, herbs and certain foods, as well as activities they describe as natural, such as exercise, meditation and relaxation. Naturopaths claim that these natural treatments help restore the body's innate ability to heal itself without the adverse effects of conventional medicine. However, \"natural\" methods and chemicals are not necessarily safer or more effective than \"artificial\" or \"synthetic\" ones, and any treatment capable of eliciting an effect may also have deleterious side effects.\nCertain naturopathic treatments offered by naturopaths, such as homeopathy, rolfing, and iridology, are widely considered pseudoscience or quackery. Stephen Barrett of QuackWatch and the National Council Against Health Fraud has stated that naturopathy is \"simplistic and that its practices are riddled with quackery\". \"Non-scientific health care practitioners, including naturopaths, use unscientific methods and deception on a public who, lacking in-depth health care knowledge, must rely upon the assurance of providers. Quackery not only harms people, it undermines the ability to conduct scientific research and should be opposed by scientists\", says William T. Jarvis. In the 2018 Australian case against Marlyin Bodnar, who advised a mother to treat her infant son's eczema with a raw food diet which nearly led to the child's starvation death, Judge Peter Berman said, \"Well intentioned but seriously misguided advice is, as the facts of this case demonstrate, capable of causing great harm and even death to vulnerable children.\" Furthermore, Britt Hermes criticizes the \"pervasive culture of patient blaming\" among naturopathic practitioners, where \"when something doesn't work for the patient and the patient is not experiencing all of the positive effects and zero side-effects that are promised with the therapy, it's never because the therapy doesn't work, it's because the patient didn't do something right.\"\nVaccination.\nMany naturopathy practitioners voice their opposition to vaccination. The reasons for this opposition are based, in part, on the early views which shaped the foundation of this occupation. A naturopathy textbook, co-authored by Joseph Pizzorno, recalls anti-vaccine beliefs associated with the founding of naturopathy in the United States: \"a return to nature in regulating the diet, breathing, exercising, bathing and the employment of various forces\" \"in lieu\" of the smallpox vaccine.\nIn general, evidence about associations between naturopathy and pediatric vaccination is sparse, but \"published reports suggest that only a minority of naturopathic physicians actively support full vaccination\". In Washington state from 2000 to 2003, children were significantly less likely to receive immunizations if they had seen a naturopath. A survey of naturopathic students published in 2004 found that students at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine became less likely to recommend vaccinations to their patients and became more distrustful of public health and conventional medicine as they advanced in the program.\nThe British Columbia Naturopathic Association lists several major concerns regarding the pediatric vaccine schedule and vaccines in general, and the group's policy is to not advocate for or against vaccines. The Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians reports that many naturopaths \"customize\" the pediatric vaccine schedule.\nAs of April 25, 2022, a British Columbia government report found that 69.2% of naturopaths reported having received at least two COVID vaccines or receiving a medical exemption. This was much lower than all the other regulated medical professions in the report. The number for two professions\u00a0\u2013 dieticians and physicians/surgeons\u00a0\u2013 was 98%.\nAs of 2016[ [update]], the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, which is the largest professional organization for licensed naturopaths in the U.S., is \"still discussing its stance on vaccinations\".\nPractitioners.\nNaturopath practitioners can generally be categorized into three groups: 1) those with a government issued license; 2) those who practice outside of an official status (\"traditional naturopaths\"); 3) those who are primarily another kind of health professional who also practices naturopathy.\nIn Switzerland, these divisions fall between those with a federal diploma, those recognized by health insurances, and those with neither federal diploma nor recognition by health insurances. Naturopaths with federal diploma can be divided into four categories: European traditional medicine, Chinese traditional medicine, ayurvedic medicine and homeopathy. The number of listed naturopaths (including traditional healers) in Switzerland rose from 223 in 1970 to 1835 in 2000.&lt;ref name=\"bfs.admin.ch/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nLicensed naturopaths.\nLicensed naturopaths may be referred to as \"naturopathic doctors\" or \"naturopathic physicians\" in 26 US states or territories and 5 Canadian provinces. Licensed naturopaths present themselves as primary care providers. Licensed naturopaths do not receive comparable training to medical doctors in terms of the quality of education or quantity of hours.\nIn British Columbia, legislation permits licensed naturopaths to use the title \"doctor\" or \"physician\". However, section 102 of the bylaw of the College of Naturopathic Physicians of British Columbia (CNPBC), the terms \"naturopathic\" or \"naturopathic medicine\" must be included anytime the term doctor or physician is used by a member of the CNPBC.\nEducation.\nLicensed naturopaths must pass the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX) administered by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) after graduating from a program accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Training in CNME-accredited programs includes basic medical diagnostics and procedures such as rudimentary physical exams and common blood tests, in addition to pseudoscientific modalities, such as homeopathy, acupuncture, and energy modalities.\nThese accredited programs have been criticized for misrepresenting their medical rigor and teaching subjects that are antithetical to the best understandings of science and medicine. The CNME as an accrediting authority has been characterized as unreliable and suffering from conflicts of interest. The naturopathic licensing exam has been called a mystery by those outside the naturopathic profession and criticized for testing on homeopathic remedies, including for the use to treat pediatric emergencies.\nSeveral schools in North America exist for the study of naturopathic medicine, some accredited by the CNME. The CNME and the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC) claim entrance requirements and curricula at accredited colleges are often similar or comparable to those required and offered at conventional medical schools. However, the lack of accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education may indicate insufficiency of scientific medical training and/or quantifiable positive results, and accordingly it remains disputed whether graduates of medical colleges accredited by the CNME have the competency of Medical Doctors and Doctors of Osteopathy.\nNaturopathic doctors are not eligible for medical residencies, which are available exclusively for medical doctors and doctors of osteopathic medicine. There are limited post-graduate \"residency\" positions available to naturopathic doctors offered through naturopathic schools and naturopathic clinics approved by the CNME. Most naturopathic doctors do not complete such a residency, and naturopathic doctors are not mandated to complete one for licensure, except in the states of Utah and Connecticut. Continuing education in naturopathic modalities for health care professionals varies greatly.\nPolitical activity in the United States.\nNaturopathic practitioners affiliated with the CNME-accredited schools lobby state, provincial, and federal governments for medical licensure and participation in social health programs. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians represents licensed naturopaths in the United States; the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors represents licensed naturopaths in Canada. Naturopathic lobbying efforts are funded by vitamin and supplement makers and focus on portraying naturopathic education as comparable to medical education received by physicians and on having high professional standards. Medical societies and advocacy groups dispute these claims by citing evidence of licensed naturopathic practitioners using pseudoscientific methods without a sound evidence basis and lacking adequate clinical training to diagnose and treat disease competently according to the standard of care. Jann Bellamy has characterized the process by which naturopathic practitioners and other practitioners of pseudoscience convince lawmakers to provide them with medical licenses as \"legislative alchemy\".\nSince 2005, the Massachusetts Medical Society has opposed licensure based on concerns that NDs are not required to participate in residency and concerns that the practices of naturopaths included many \"erroneous and potentially dangerous claims\". The Massachusetts Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners rejected their concerns and recommended licensure. The Massachusetts Medical Society states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Naturopathic medical school is not a medical school in anything but the appropriation of the word medical. Naturopathy is not a branch of medicine. It is a hodge podge of nutritional advice, home remedies and discredited treatments ... Naturopathic colleges claim accreditation but follow a true \"alternative\" accreditation method that is virtually meaningless. They are not accredited by the same bodies that accredit real medical schools and while some courses have similar titles to the curricula of legitimate medical schools the content is completely different.\nIn 2015, a former naturopathic doctor, Britt Marie Hermes, who graduated from Bastyr University and practiced as a licensed ND in Washington and Arizona, began advocating against naturopathic medicine. In addition to opposing further licensure, she believes that NDs should not be allowed to use the titles \"doctor\" or \"physician\", and be barred from treating children. She states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Naturopaths aggressively lobby for laws to issue them medical licenses. I would characterize this political effort as a perverted redefinition of the words \"physician\", \"doctor\", \"medical school\", and \"residency\" in order to mask the inadequacy of the training provided in naturopathic programs. ND students do not realize that they are taking educational shortcuts and therefore do not possess any demonstrable competencies found in modern medicine.\nTraditional naturopaths.\nTraditional naturopaths are represented in the United States by the American Naturopathic Association (ANA), representing about 1,800 practitioners and the American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA).\nThe level of naturopathic training varies among traditional naturopaths in the United States. Traditional naturopaths may complete non-degree certificate programs or undergraduate degree programs and generally refer to themselves as naturopathic consultants. These programs often offer online unaccredited degrees, but do not offer comprehensive biomedical education or clinical training.\nTraditional naturopathic practitioners surveyed in Australia perceive evidence-based medicine to be an ideological assault on their beliefs in vitalistic and holistic principles. They advocate for the integrity of natural medicine practice.\nNaturopaths graduating from accredited programs argued in 2002 that their training used evidence-based scientific principles unlike traditional naturopathic programs, but this claim remains inaccurate.\nRegulation.\nNaturopathy is practiced in many countries and is subject to different standards of regulation and levels of acceptance. The scope of practice varies widely between jurisdictions, with some covering naturopathy under medical regulation and allowing practitioners to prescribe drugs and perform minor surgery, while other jurisdictions outlaw naturopathy entirely.\nAustralia.\nIn 1977, a Commonwealth Government inquiry reviewed all colleges of naturopathy in Australia and found that despite having syllabuses appearing to cover the basic biomedical sciences, actual lectures had little connection to those syllabuses and no significant practical work was available. In addition, there did not appear to be significant or systematic coverage of techniques favoured by naturopaths, such as homeopathy, Bach's floral remedies, or mineral salts.\nThe position of the Australian Medical Association is that \"evidence-based aspects of complementary medicine can be part of patient care by a medical practitioner\", but it has concerns that there is \"limited efficacy evidence regarding most complementary medicine. Unproven complementary medicines and therapies can pose a risk to patient health either directly through misuse or indirectly if a patient defers seeking medical advice.\" The AMA's position on regulation is that \"there should be appropriate regulation of complementary medicine practitioners and their activities\".\nIn 2015, the Australian government found no clear evidence of effectiveness for naturopathy. Accordingly, In 2017 the Australian government named naturopathy as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidies, saying this step would \"ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence\".\nIndia.\nIn India, naturopathy is overseen by the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH); there is a 5\u00bd-year degree in \"Bachelor of Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences\" (BNYS) degree that was offered by twelve colleges in India as of August\u00a02010[ [update]]. The National Institute of Naturopathy in Pune that operates under AYUSH, which was established on December 22, 1986, and encourages facilities for standardization and propagation of the existing knowledge and its application through research in naturopathy throughout India.\nNorth America.\nIn five Canadian provinces, seventeen U.S. states, and the District of Columbia, naturopathic doctors who are trained at an accredited school of naturopathic medicine in North America are entitled to use the designation ND or NMD. Elsewhere, the designations \"naturopath\", \"naturopathic doctor\", and \"doctor of natural medicine\" are generally unprotected or prohibited.\nIn North America, each jurisdiction that regulates naturopathy defines a local scope of practice for naturopathic doctors that can vary considerably. Some regions permit minor surgery, access to prescription drugs, spinal manipulations, midwifery (natural childbirth), and gynecology; other regions exclude these from the naturopathic scope of practice or prohibit the practice of naturopathy entirely.\nCanada.\nFive Canadian provinces license naturopathic doctors: Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. British Columbia has the largest scope of practice in Canada, allowing certified NDs to prescribe pharmaceuticals and perform minor surgeries. Ontario also permits prescription from a modified formulary list, following separate examination.\nSwitzerland.\nThe Swiss Federal Constitution defines the Swiss Confederation and the Cantons of Switzerland within the scope of their powers to oversee complementary medicine. In particular, the Federal authorities must set up diplomas for the practice of non-scientific medicine. The first of such diplomas has been validated in April 2015 for the practice of naturopathy. There is a long tradition of naturopathy and traditional medicine in Switzerland. The Cantons of Switzerland make their own public health regulations. Although the law in certain cantons is typically monopolistic, the authorities are relatively tolerant with regard to alternative practitioners.\nUnited Kingdom.\nNaturopathy is not regulated in the United Kingdom. In 2012, publicly funded universities in the United Kingdom dropped their alternative medicine programs, including naturopathy.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They lived during the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt as they prepared to enter the Promised Land and who raised before the Israelite community the legal case of a woman's right and obligation to inherit property in the absence of a male heir in the family. Zelophehad, a man of the Tribe of Manasseh, had five daughters but no sons, and therefore no male heirs.\nBiblical account.\nThe biblical text tells little of Zelophehad himself, save that he died during the 40 years when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, and explicitly that he played no part in Korah's rebellion. does not in any case cite the tribe of Manasseh as being involved in the rebellion against Moses.\nZelophehad's daughters petitioned Moses, Eleazar the priest, the tribal chiefs, and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for their rights to inherit his property rights in the Land of Israel. Zelophehad's daughters noted that their father Zelophehad had not taken part in Korah's rebellion, but only died \"in his own sin\". Zelophehad's daughters argued that were they not to inherit, then Zelophehad's name would be lost to his clan. Moses took their case to God. God told Moses that the plea of Zelophehad's daughters was just, and that they should be granted their father's hereditary holding.\nLater, the family heads of the clan of Manasseh's grandson Gilead appealed to Moses and the chieftains, arguing that if Zelophehad's daughters married men from another Israelite tribe, then their share would be lost to the tribe of Manasseh and be added to the portion of the tribe into which they married. So Moses, at God's bidding, instructed the Israelites that the plea of the tribal leaders was just and that Zelophehad's daughters could marry anyone they wished, but only among the men of the tribe of Manasseh.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;5 So Moses, at \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u2019s bidding, instructed the Israelites, saying: \u201cThe plea of the Josephite tribe is just. 6 This is what \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: They may become the wives of anyone they wish, provided they become wives within a clan of their father\u2019s tribe. 7 No inheritance of the Israelites may pass over from one tribe to another, but the Israelite [heirs]\u2014each of them\u2014must remain bound to the ancestral portion of their tribe. 8 Every daughter among the Israelite tribes who inherits a share must become the wife of someone from a clan of her father\u2019s tribe, in order that every Israelite [heir] may keep an ancestral share. 9 Thus no inheritance shall pass over from one tribe to another, but the Israelite tribes shall remain bound each to its portion.\u201d 10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 had commanded Moses: 11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, Zelophehad\u2019s daughters, became the wives of their uncles\u2019 sons, 12 becoming wives within clans of descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph; and so their share remained in the tribe of their father\u2019s clan.\nZelophehad's daughters did as God had commanded in the instructions conveyed to Moses, and each married a son of an uncle, first cousin marriages. When the Israelites entered the land, Zelophehad's daughters appeared before Eleazer the priest, Joshua (who by then had assumed leadership from Moses), and the chieftains, reminding them that God had commanded Moses to grant them a portion among their kinsmen, and Zelophehad's daughters received a portion in the holdings of Manasseh, probably on the east side of the Jordan River.\nRabbinical commentary.\nIn the Talmud and the \"Zohar\" the reference to Zelophehad having \"died in his own sin\" is used to equate him with the man executed for gathering sticks on Shabbat, but \"Sifri Zutta\" says that it cannot be known if he was.\nIn the Talmud, Rabbi Josiah interpreted that they petitioned first the assembly, then the chieftains, then Eleazar, and finally Moses, but Abba Hanan said in the name of Eliezer ben Hurcanus of Judaea that Zelophehad's daughters stood before all of them as they were sitting together.\nThe \"Zohar\" said that Zelophehad's daughters drew near to Moses in the presence of Eleazar and all the chieftains because they were afraid of Moses' anger at Zelophehad and thought that it might be contained in a public forum. According to the \"Zohar\", Moses presented the case to God instead of deciding it himself out of modesty.\nA baraita taught that Zelophehad's daughters were wise, Torah students, and righteous. Another baraita taught that Zelophehad's daughters were equal in merit, and that is why the order of their names varies in the text. According to the Gemara, they demonstrated their wisdom by raising their case in a timely fashion, just as Moses was expounding the law of levirate marriage, or \"yibbum\", and they argued for their inheritance by analogy to that law. The daughters also demonstrated their righteousness by marrying men who were fitting for them.\nScholarly views.\nTwo genealogies are given for Zelophehad by the Bible; in the Book of Chronicles, he is listed as a son of Manasseh. in other places where his genealogy is mentioned, he is listed as a son of Hepher, who was the son of Gilead, and therefore merely a descendant of Manasseh. Both of these genealogies record Zelophehad as being a member of the tribe of Manasseh. The apparent contradictions have been addressed by naming Zelophehad as a \"descendant\" rather than as \"the second [son]\".\nAccording to Shammai Feldman, Zelophehad and his daughters are a fiction created simply to illustrate some of the legal rules of inheritance; Jewish textual scholars regard the accounts concerning Zelophehad's daughters as accretions added to the earlier priestly source narrative by writers from the same pro-Aaronid religio-political group. The presence of Zelophehad and his daughters in the earlier census is marked by the King James Version as having dubious authenticity.\nAccording to \"Tevye's Daughters: No Laughing Matter\", author Jan Lisa Huttner makes a connection from the five daughters of Zelophehad to Tevye's five daughters in \"Fiddler on the Roof\". Sholem Aleichem presumably read the story of Zelophehad's five daughters and it is highly likely that Joseph Stein read it at one time too. The number five, five daughters\u2014or to be exact, five dowries\u2014is the same number God also bestowed on Sholem Aleichem.\nNames.\nLinguistic scholars are divided in regard to the etymology of the name \"Zelophehad\". Following the reading of the Masoretic Text, some scholars suspect that the name is derived from a Syriac term meaning \"first rupture\", in the sense of being a first-born son. Most scholars, following the Septuagint's rendering of the name as \"salpaad\", believe that the name was derived from the Hebrew term \"salpahad\", literally meaning \"shadow from terror\"; many of these scholars interpret this as referring to the shadow created by a shelter, and so interpret the name as \"protection from terror\", but others interpret it as meaning \"the bringer of terror is shadowed\".\nIn regard to the names of the daughters, scholars largely are in agreement; \"Mahlah\" means \"forgiven\", \"Noah\" means \"movement\", \"Milcah\" means \"queen\", \"Tirzah\" means \"pleasing\", \"Hoglah\" means \"circling/dancing\" (though for this reason it is also the word for \"partridge\").\nLegal issues.\nLegal advice, concerning the inheritance rights and obligations of the daughters of Zelophehad, is given twice in the Biblical account. On the first occasion, the topic is about inheritance when there are no male children, while the topic of the second occasion is levirate marriage, and property inheritance remaining within a clan (not the tribe). The daughters are mentioned a third time, in the Book of Joshua, where they are simply portrayed as being given land in the territory of Manasseh, to which their inheritance entitled them; the text is unclear in regards to which part of Manasseh's territory they were granted land, except that it was not in Gilead.\nInheritance when there are no male children.\nIn the Biblical account, earlier regulations had specified that property was to be inherited by heirs who were male, but the daughters were the only children of their now deceased father, and so they came to the door of the \"Tent of Meeting\" and asked Moses, Eleazer, the tribal chieftains, and the rest of the \"congregation\", for advice on what was to be done, as there were no obvious male heirs; in the Talmud, opinions vary as to whether this means that the daughters petitioned all of these groups at the same time, with them gathered together, or if it means that the daughters first petitioned the \"congregation\", then the chieftains, then Eleazar, and finally petitioned Moses.\nThe biblical text states that Moses asked Hashem to rule on the issue; the Zohar argues that Moses had presented the case to Hashem, rather than deciding it himself, because Moses was modest. The biblical account continues by stating that Moses was told by Hashem that the daughters should be considered their father's heirs, and that the general case holds - if there are no sons, the daughter (or daughters) should inherit - and if there are no children at all, the inheritance should pass to the man's brothers, and if there are no brothers it should pass to the \"nearest relative in his clan\".\nMaimonides, and other rabbinical commentators, extrapolated this into the conclusion that, if they exist, then sons and their descendants are the heirs of an individual, but if they do not it would be any daughters or their descendants, and if these do not exist then it would be the individual's father, and if he is no longer alive then the rule concerning heirs applies to him - the father's sons (the individual's brothers) and their descendants have priority, followed by the father's daughters (the individual's sisters), followed by the father's father (the individual's grandfather), and so on. However, although this was how the Pharisees saw the biblical implication, the Sadducees argued that if there were only female descendants of an individual's sons, and the sons themselves were dead, then the individual's daughters had the right to inherit.\nEvidently the regulations preferring male descendants may have come to be disregarded in some respects, as the Book of Job, which textual scholars date to the fourth century BCE, states in its epilogue that Job's daughters were given equal inheritance rights to his sons, and the Karaites always gave daughters the same rights as sons. By the Middle Ages it came to be a tradition to evade the inequality between daughters and sons via a legal fiction, in which the father claims that he is indebted to his daughter for a certain sum of money, and that this debt is due by him and his heirs, and then makes a formal agreement that this debt is to be paid upon his death, either in cash or as a proportion of his estate equal to half the share of one of the sons; by this legal mechanism, the daughter would either gain a share in her father's estate, or a sum of money equal to its value.\nEndogamous and exogamous inheritance.\nLater in the narrative of the Book of Numbers, the elders of the clan of Gilead petitioned Moses and the tribal chieftains for advice, because they were concerned that if Zelophehad's daughters married men from another Israelite tribe, the property that the daughters had inherited the right to would become the property of the other tribe, and would be lost from the tribe of Manasseh, to which Zelophehad had belonged. The narrative continues by stating that Hashem gave Moses a response to give to the elders, namely that the daughters must each marry someone from the Gilead clan, but they are otherwise unrestricted in their choice; the narrative also states that the general case was to be applied - that inheritances cannot pass between tribes, but instead any female that inherits land is compelled to marry someone from the same clan as her father. The narrative's coda mentions that the daughters each marry one of the sons of their uncles; the gemara states that the daughters had demonstrated their righteousness in doing so, as these men were fitting for them, and had not married earlier as they were waiting for suitable husbands.\nThe biblical prohibition of heiresses to commit exogamy was repealed by the classical rabbis; Rabbah argued that the rule only applied to the period that Canaan had been divided between the tribes, and had therefore become redundant, especially as the laws concerning the territory were in abeyance anyway, owing to the destruction of the Temple. Thus in all forms of Judaism following the Oral Law, women are allowed to marry whom they wish, including exogamously, whether they have gained an inheritance or not.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
