He was the preeminent Wagnerian heldentenor of the 1920s through the 1940s and has come to be considered the quintessence of his voice type. Late in his career, Melchior appeared in movie musicals and on radio and television. He also made numerous recordings.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nBorn Lauritz Lebrecht Hommel Melchior in Copenhagen, Denmark, the young Melchior was a treble and amateur singer before starting his first operatic vocal studies under Paul Bang at the Royal Opera School in Copenhagen at the age of 18 in 1908.\nHis sister, Agnes Melchior (1883\u20131945), was a blind Danish Esperantist.\nIn 1913, Melchior made his debut as a baritone in the secondary role of Silvio in Ruggero Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" at the Royal Theatre (Det Kongelige Teater) in Copenhagen. He sang mostly secondary baritone and bass roles for the Royal Danish Opera and provincial Scandinavian opera companies for the next few years.\nOne night, while on tour, Melchior helped an ailing soprano performing in \"Il trovatore\" by singing a high C in the Act IV Leonara and De Luna duet. The American contralto Mme Charles Cahier, who was singing the role of Azucena, was impressed by the tone she had heard and gave her young colleague sound advice: he was no baritone, but a tenor \"with the lid on.\" She even contacted the Royal Opera pleading that Melchior be given a sabbatical and a stipend to restudy his voice. This he did during 1917 and 1918, studying with the noted Danish tenor Vilhelm Herold (1865\u20131937) who had sung Wagnerian roles at Covent Garden, the Chicago Opera and elsewhere from 1900 to 1915. This proved to be a turning point in Melchior's career. His high baritone voice was recast into that of a low tenor, but with a strong high extension. His second debut was on 8 October 1918 in the title role of \"Tannh\u00e4user\", also at the Royal Opera in Copenhagen.\nIn 1920, Melchior visited England to sing in an experimental radio broadcast to the Scandinavian capital cities from the Marconi station in Chelmsford. From 1920, Melchior was a frequent performer in London, appearing at Sir Henry J. Wood's Prom Concerts in Queen's Hall.\nIn September 1920, when he was singing the Steersman's Song, from Wagner's \"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\" at a Prom Concert, he met the popular novelist and passionate Wagnerite Hugh Walpole and the two quickly became firm friends, travelling together and staying in each other's houses. On a visit to Walpole's cottage in Polperro Melchior \"caused a sensation by singing at a concert in the village\", and later on a visit to Helston he and Walpole both took part in the Floral Dance. In December 1921 on a visit with Walpole to his (Walpole's) parents in Edinburgh, Melchior gave a concert in the Usher Hall. Walpole provided the fledgling Heldentenor with financial aid in February 1922, paying in advance two-thirds of the fees for his studies under Victor Beigel. In 1923, Walpole gave Melchior a further \u00a3800, enabling him to continue his studies with Ernst Grenzebach and the legendary dramatic soprano of the Vienna Court Opera, Anna Bahr von Mildenburg.\nAs a leading \"Heldentenor\".\nWord of his talent spread and was heard of by Cosima and Siegfried Wagner at Bayreuth. There the re-opening of the Festival for 1924 was under preparation. Melchior was engaged to sing Siegmund and Parsifal. This prestigious contract opened the way to several other appearances such as a Wagner concert with Frida Leider in Berlin in 1923. Around this time several acoustic records were cut for Polydor.\nOn May 14, 1924, Lauritz Melchior made his debut, as Siegmund, at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London. The result was a smashing success. Some weeks later Melchior made his debut on the stage of the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth in the roles of Siegmund and Parsifal. In July 1925 Adolf Hitler attended a performance of \"Parsifal\" in Bayreuth as a guest of Winifred Wagner. According to Walpole, who was sitting in Wagner's box next to Hitler, as Melchior sang, \"the tears poured down Hitler's cheeks\". On February 17, 1926, his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City took place. He sang Tannh\u00e4user opposite Maria Jeritza, Friedrich Schorr, Karin Branzell, and Michael Bohnen with Artur Bodanzky conducting. Although he was not adversely criticized, there was not much enthusiasm elicited by this debut. In his first season at the Metropolitan opera, Melchior sang only eight times. His second season brought only one appearance. To build up his repertory and gain more stage experience, he accepted an engagement at the Hamburg State Opera, where he appeared as Lohengrin, Otello, Radames in \"Aida\" and Jean van Leyden in \"Le proph\u00e8te\". He also sang regularly at other major German music theaters, like the State Operas of Berlin and Munich.\nAlthough Melchior sang at most of the theatres and concert halls of the Western world during his long career, he is perhaps best remembered as a member of the Metropolitan Opera company, where he sang 519 performances of Wagnerian roles between 1926 and 1950. Melchior's breakthrough at the Metropolitan Opera finally came when he performed in \"Tristan und Isolde\" on March 20, 1929. From this point on, his career flourished.\nMelchior appeared at Covent Garden from 1924 to 1939, also as Otello (opposite Viorica Ursuleac as Desdemona) and Florestan, besides the Wagnerian repertory. Also at Covent Garden in 1932, he sang opposite popular soprano Florence Easton in \"Siegfried\", the only time they appeared together. Other important stations of his career were in the Buenos Aires (Teatro Col\u00f3n) (1931\u20131943), San Francisco Opera (1934\u20131945) and Chicago Opera (1934\u20131945). It was Lohengrin's Farewell that served as Melchior's \"swan song\" in his last stage performance, on February 2, 1950.\nSome of Melchior's most notable colleagues in the opera houses of the world included the sopranos Frida Leider, Kirsten Flagstad, Lotte Lehmann, Helen Traubel, Marjorie Lawrence, and Elisabeth Rethberg, and conductors Felix Weingartner, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Fritz Reiner, Sir Thomas Beecham, Arturo Toscanini, Erich Leinsdorf, George Szell, and Otto Klemperer.\nHe played contract bridge, and holds the world record for the lowest score (13%) secured in a duplicate bridge tournament.\nMoving in new directions.\nBetween 1944 and 1952, Melchior performed in five Hollywood musical films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures and made numerous US radio and television appearances. In 1947, he put his hand and footprints in cement in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.\nFrom 1946 to 1949, Melchior went on a world tour with his personal conductor Ezra Rachlin. Their visit to Denmark was particularly meaningful as they were the guests of King Frederik IX, who was an amateur conductor with his own personal concert hall in his palace.\nIn 1952, Melchior performed at New York's Palace Theatre, following the popular singer-actress Judy Garland, after she set a record-breaking vaudeville engagement there which lasted nineteen weeks.\nFollowing unofficial retirement circa 1955, Melchior made sporadic singing appearances. On occasion, he sang the national anthem at Dodgers baseball games in Los Angeles, such as Game 3 of the 1963 World Series. In the late 1960s, he established a fund through the Juilliard School for the training of potential heldentenors called \"The Lauritz Melchior Heldentenor Foundation.\"\nIn the 1960s, he made at least one television appearance on \"The Danny Thomas Show\", where he sang with Shirley Jones in the role of her father, to assist her entry into show business.\nIn the summer of 1972, Melchior conducted the San Francisco Opera Orchestra at Sigmund Stern Grove in the \"Radetzky March\" by Johann Strauss I as part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the company. This was one of his last public appearances.\nVictim of robbery.\nOn June 18, 1957, three men (Richard McFall, Wayne Burke and Alfred J. Pope) forcibly entered Melchior's Los Angeles home and tied/bound four victims (Melchior, his wife and two servants) before fleeing with an estimated value of $100,000 in cash, jewels, furs and other personal property. The three robbers were told of the valuables by a former Melchior chauffeur, Louis J. Spivak, who was to receive a 1/3 share of the booty.\nDeath.\nAn American citizen since 1947, Melchior died in Santa Monica, California, in 1973, two days before his 83rd birthday. He was put to rest in the Assistens Kirkegaard cemetery in Copenhagen. He was survived by his son, Danish-American novelist and filmmaker Ib Melchior, who wrote a biography of his father and for years fought a legal battle to reclaim the Melchior family estate Chossewitz in Germany, which was confiscated by East Germany.\nRecordings.\nMelchior made many recordings, first as a baritone on His Master's Voice, then as a tenor for Deutsche Grammophon (Polydor) (1923\u20131930), His Master's Voice (1927\u20131935), RCA Victor (1938\u20131941), American Columbia (1942\u20131950) and lastly Warner Bros. His final appearance with Danish radio was in 1960 with a performance of the first act of \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" to celebrate his 70th birthday, which was released as a recording.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The rite of coronation was executed by the former Archbishop of Mexico, Pr\u00f3spero Alarc\u00f3n y S\u00e1nchez de la Barquera on 12 October 1895. Pope Paul VI raised the shrine to the status of Minor Basilica via his Pontifical decree titled \"Sacra illa \u00c6des\" on 6 October 1976. It is the most-visited Catholic shrine in the world, and the world's third most-visited sacred site.\nDescription of Marian apparitions.\nAccording to the \"Nican Mopohua\", included in the 17th-century \"Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica\", written in Nahuatl, the Virgin Mary appeared four times to Juan Diego, a Chichimec peasant, and once to his uncle, Juan Bernardino. The first apparition occurred on the morning of Saturday, December 9, 1531 (Julian calendar, which is December 19 on the (proleptic) Gregorian calendar in present use). Juan Diego experienced a vision of a young woman at a place called the Hill of Tepeyac, which later became part of Villa de Guadalupe, in a suburb of Mexico City.\nAccording to the accounts, the woman, speaking to Juan Diego in Nahuatl, his first language and the language of the former Aztec Empire, identified herself as the Mary, \"mother of the very true deity\". She was said to have asked for a church to be erected at that site in her honor.\nBased on her words, Juan Diego then sought the Archbishop of Mexico City, Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga, to tell him what had happened. Not unexpectedly, the Archbishop did not believe Diego. Later the same day, Juan Diego saw the young woman again (the second apparition), and she asked him to continue insisting.\nThe next day, Sunday, December 10, 1531, in the Julian calendar, Juan Diego spoke to the Archbishop a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac and to ask the woman for a truly acceptable, miraculous sign to prove her identity. Later that day, the third apparition appeared when Juan Diego returned to Tepeyac; encountering the same woman, he reported to her the Archbishop's request for a sign, which she consented to provide on the next day (December 11).\nOn Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego's uncle fell ill and he was obliged to attend to him. In the early hours of Tuesday, December 12, as Juan Bernardino's condition deteriorated, Juan Diego journeyed to Tlatelolco in search of a Catholic priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and help minister to him on his deathbed.\nTo avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around Tepeyac Hill, yet the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having made recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe apparitions and are inscribed above the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked \"\u00bfNo estoy yo aqu\u00ed que soy tu madre?\" (\"Am I not here, I who am your mother?\"). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and told him to gather flowers from the summit of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan Diego obeyed her instruction and he found Castile roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.\nAccording to the story, the Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan Diego's \"tilm\u00e0tli\" or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak later that day before Archbishop Zum\u00e1rraga, the flowers fell to the floor, revealing on the fabric the image of the Virgin.\nThe next day, December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he also had seen her after praying at his bedside (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the Archbishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of \"Guadalupe\".\nThe Archbishop kept Juan Diego's mantle, first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display, where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531, a procession formed to transfer the miraculous image back to Tepeyac Hill where it was installed in a small, hastily erected chapel. During this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when a native was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays performed in honor of the Virgin. In great distress, the natives carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim fully and immediately recovered.\nHistory.\nOrigin in Guadalupe, Spain.\nThe shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe in Guadalupe, C\u00e1ceres, in Extremadura, Spain, was the most important of the shrines to the Virgin Mary in the medieval Kingdom of Castile. It is one of the many Black Madonnas in Spain and is revered in the Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, in the town of Guadalupe, from which numerous Spanish conquistadors stem.\nThe most popular etymology of the name \"Guadalupe\" is from the Arabic \"Wadi\" (river) and the Latin word \"lupus\" (wolf). Some find it unlikely that Arabic and Latin would be combined in this way, and suggest as an alternative the Arabic \"Wadi-al-lub\", signifying a river with black stones in its bed.\nThe shrine houses a statue reputed to have been carved by Luke the Evangelist and given to Archbishop Leander of Seville by Pope Gregory I. According to local legend, when Seville was taken by the Moors in 712, a group of priests fled northward and buried the statue in the hills near the Guadalupe River.\nAt the beginning of the 14th century, the Virgin appeared one day to a humble cowboy named Gil Cordero who was searching for a missing animal in the mountains. Cordero claimed that Mary had appeared to him and ordered him to ask priests to dig at the site of the apparition. Excavating priests rediscovered the hidden statue and built a small shrine around it which became the great Guadalupe monastery.\nOrigin in Mexico.\nFollowing the Conquest in 1519\u20131521, the Marian cult was brought to the Americas and Franciscan friars often leveraged syncretism with existing religious beliefs as an instrument for evangelization. What is purported by some to be the earliest mention of the miraculous apparition of the Virgin is a page of parchment, the \"Codex Escalada\" from 1548, which was discovered in 1995 and, according to investigative analysis, dates from the sixteenth century. This document bears two pictorial representations of Juan Diego and the apparition, several inscriptions in Nahuatl referring to Juan Diego by his Aztec name, and the date of his death: 1548, as well as the year that the then named Virgin Mary appeared: 1531. It also contains the glyph of Antonio Valeriano; and finally, the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun which was authenticated by experts from the Banco de Mexico and Charles E. Dibble. Historians Alberto Peralta and Stafford Poole questioned the authenticity of the document.\nA more complete early description of the apparition occurs in a 16-page manuscript called the \"Nican mopohua\", which has been reliably dated in 1556 and was acquired by the New York Public Library in 1883. This document, written in Nahuatl, tells the story of the apparitions and the supernatural origin of the image. It was probably composed by a native Aztec man, Antonio Valeriano, who had been educated by Franciscans. The text of this document was later incorporated into a printed pamphlet which was widely circulated in 1649.\nIn spite of these documents, there are no known 16th century written accounts of the Guadalupe vision by the archbishop Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga. In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga as a major player in the story, but, although Zum\u00e1rraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the indigenous story.\nThe written record suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the native beliefs springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the Franciscan order (who then had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the outside groups, while the Dominicans supported it.\nThe main promoter of the story was the Dominican Alonso de Mont\u00fafar, who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Mont\u00fafar commended popular devotion to \"Our Lady of Guadalupe\", referring to a painting on cloth (the tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had also occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the native belief and believers. He expressed concern that the Catholic Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an indigenous image:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The devotion at the chapel\u00a0... to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not.\nArchbishop Mont\u00fafar opened an inquiry into the matter at which the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's statement that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him \"the Indian painter Marcos\". This could refer to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active at that time. A document called and published in 1888 states that on September 8, 1556, the feast of the Nativity of Mary, at the end of the sermon that Bustamante gave in the chapel of San Jos\u00e9 in the convent of San Francisco in Mexico, Bustamante attacked Archbishop Mont\u00fafar for having, according to the former, encouraged a devotion that had arisen around an image \"painted yesterday by the Indian Marcos\".\nProf. Jody Brant Smith, referring to Philip Serna Callahan's examination of the tilma using infrared photography in 1979, wrote: \"if Marcos did, he apparently did so without making a preliminary sketches \u2013 in itself then seen as a near-miraculous procedure\u00a0... Cipac may well have had a hand in painting the Image, but only in painting the additions, such as the angel and moon at the Virgin's feet.\"\nUltimately Archbishop Mont\u00fafar, himself a Dominican, decided to end Franciscan custody of the shrine. From then on the shrine was kept and served by diocesan priests under the authority of the archbishop. Moreover, Archbishop Mont\u00fafar authorized the construction of a much larger church at Tepeyac, in which the tilma was later mounted and displayed.\nIn the late 1570s, the Franciscan historian Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan denounced the cult at Tepeyac and the use of the name \"Tonantzin\" or to call her Our Lady in a personal digression in his \"General History of the Things of New Spain\", also known as the \"Florentine Codex\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess ... And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also called her Tonantzin, being motivated by those preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin. While it is not known for certain where the beginning of Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word refers to the ancient Tonantzin. And it was viewed as something that should be remedied, for their having [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, instead of Tonantzin, but . It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin. And they now come to visit from very far away, as far away as before, which is also suspicious, because everywhere there are many churches of Our Lady and they do not go to them. They come from distant lands to this Tonantzin as in olden times.\nSahag\u00fan's criticism of the indigenous group seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a syncretistic application of the native name \"Tonantzin\" to the Catholic Virgin Mary. However, Sahag\u00fan often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.\nFirst printed accounts in Mexico.\nOne of the first printed accounts of the history of the apparitions and image occurs in \"Imagen de la Virgen Maria, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe\", published in 1648 by Miguel S\u00e1nchez, a diocesan priest of Mexico City.\nAnother account is the Codex Escalada, dating from the sixteenth century, a sheet of parchment recording apparitions of the Virgin Mary and the figure of Juan Diego, which reproduces the glyph of Antonio Valeriano alongside the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan. It contains the following glosses: \"1548 Also in that year of 1531 appeared to Cuahtlatoatzin our beloved mother the Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico. Cuahtlatoatzin died worthily\"\nThe next printed account was a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, \"Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica\" (\"The Great Event\"), which was published in 1649. This tract contains a section called the \"Nican mopohua\" (\"Here it is recounted\"), which has been already touched on above. The composition and authorship of the \"Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica\" is assigned by a majority of those scholars to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647 to 1657.\nNevertheless, the most important section of the tract, the \"Nican Mopohua\", appears to be much older. It has been attributed since the late 1600s to Antonio Valeriano (c. 1531\u20131605), a native Aztec man who had been educated by the Franciscans and who collaborated extensively with Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan.\nA manuscript version of the \"Nican Mopohua\", which is now held by the New York Public Library,\nappears to be dated to c. 1556, and may have been the original work by Valeriano, as that was used by Laso in composing the \"Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica\". Most authorities agree on the dating and on Valeriano's authorship. According to the skeptic and investigator of the paranormal, Joe Nickell, if the main source, the \"Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica\", was published in 1649, the legend it narrates date to after that time.\nOn the other hand, in 1666, the scholar Luis Becerra Tanco published in Mexico a book about the history of the apparitions under the name , which was republished in Spain in 1675 as . In the same way, in 1688, Jesuit Father Francisco de Florencia published \"La Estrella del Norte de M\u00e9xico\", giving the history of the same apparitions.\nTwo separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century, and the other in Spanish by Servando Teresa de Mier date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the Julian calendar, but the latter also says that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.\nAccording to the document \"Informaciones Jur\u00eddicas de 1666\", a Catholic feast day in name of Our Lady of Guadalupe was requested and approved, as well as the transfer of the date of the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from September 8 to December 12, the latest date on which the Virgin supposedly appeared to Juan Diego. The initiative to perform them was made by Francisco de Siles who proposed to ask the Church of Rome, a Mass itself with allusive text to the apparitions and stamping of the image, along with the divine office itself, and the precept of hearing a Catholic Mass on December 12, the last date of the apparitions of the Virgin to Juan Diego as the new date to commemorate the apparitions (which until then was on September 8, the birth of the Virgin).\nIn 1666, the Church in M\u00e9xico began gathering information from people who reported having known Juan Diego, and in 1723 a formal investigation into his life was ordered, where more data was gathered to support his veneration. Because of the \"Informaciones Jur\u00eddicas de 1666\" in the year 1754, the Sacred Congregation of Rites confirmed the true and valid value of the apparitions, and granted celebrating Mass and Office for the then Catholic version of the feast of Guadalupe on December 12.\nThese published accounts of the origin of the image already venerated in Tepeyac, then increased interest in the identity of Juan Diego, who was the original recipient of the prime vision. A new Catholic Basilica church was built to house the image. Completed in 1709, it is now known as the Old Basilica.\nThe crown ornament.\nThe image had originally featured a 12-point crown on the Virgin's head, but this disappeared in 1887\u201388. The change was first noticed on February 23, 1888, when the image was removed to a nearby church. Eventually a painter confessed on his deathbed that he had been instructed by a clergyman to remove the crown. This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated. But according to the historian David Brading, \"the decision to remove rather than replace the crown was no doubt inspired by a desire to 'modernize' the image and reinforce its similarity to the nineteenth-century images of the Immaculate Conception which were exhibited at Lourdes and elsewhere... What is rarely mentioned is that the frame which surrounded the canvas was adjusted to leave almost no space above the Virgin's head, thereby obscuring the effects of the erasure.\"\nA different crown was installed to the image. On February 8, 1887, a Papal bull from Pope Leo XIII granted permission a Canonical Coronation of the image, which occurred on October 12, 1895.\n20th century.\nSince then the Virgin of Guadalupe has been proclaimed \"Queen of Mexico\", \"Patroness of the Americas\", \"Empress of Latin America\", and \"Protectress of Unborn Children\" (the latter two titles given by Pope John Paul II in 1999).\nOn November 14, 1921, a bomb hidden within a basket of flowers and left under the tilma by an anti-Catholic secularist exploded and damaged the altar of the Basilica that houses the original image, but the tilma was unharmed. A brass standing crucifix, bent by the explosion, is now preserved at the shrine's museum and is believed to be miraculous by devotees.\nThe beatification of Juan Diego.\nUnder Pope John Paul II the move to beatify Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Juan Diego \"venerable\" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on May 6, 1990, during a Mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, declaring him \"protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples\", with December 9 established as his feast day.\nAt that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop Zum\u00e1rraga, into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe, Guillermo Schulenburg, was forced to resign following an interview published in the Catholic magazine \"Ixthus,\" in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was \"a symbol, not a reality\", and that his canonization would be the \"recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.\" In 1883 Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta, historian and biographer of Zum\u00e1rraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for Bishop Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision. He concluded that Juan Diego had not existed.\nIn 1995, Father Xavier Escalada, a Jesuit whose four volume Guadalupe encyclopedia had just been published, announced the existence of a sheet of parchment (known as \"Codex Escalada\"), which bore an illustrated account of the vision and some notations in Nahuatl concerning the life and death of Juan Diego. Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe encyclopedia, published in 1997. Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as \"rather like finding a picture of St. Paul's vision of Christ on the road to Damascus, drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter.\"\nMarian title.\nIn the earliest account of the apparition, the \"Nican Mopohua\", the Virgin of Guadalupe tells Juan Bernardino, the uncle of Juan Diego, that the image on the tilma is to be known as \u2018the Perfect Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe.\u2019\nThere have been various efforts to find a pre-Hispanic origin in the cult, including attempts to find a Nahuatl etymology to the name. The first theory to promote this Nahuatl origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco. In his 1675 work \"Felicidad de Mexico\", Becerra Tanco said that Juan Bernardino and Juan Diego would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the \"d\" and \"g\" sounds do not exist in Nahuatl.\nHe proposed two Nahuatl alternative names that sound similar to \"Guadalupe\", \"Tecuatlanopeuh\" , which he translates as \"she whose origins were in the rocky summit\", and \"Tecuantlaxopeuh\" , \"she who banishes those who devoured us.\"\nOndina and Justo Gonz\u00e1lez suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the Nahuatl term, \"Co\u0101tlaxopeuh\" , which they interpret as meaning \"the one who crushes the serpent\", and that it may seem to be referring to the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl. In addition, the Virgin Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the serpent of the Garden of Eden.\nSahag\u00fan claimed that the Aztecs had previously worshiped the goddess Tonantzin (sometimes identified with Coatl\u00edcue or Cihuacoatl) at Tepeyac. He believed that the shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe allowed them to continue their worship of Tonantzin, since they neglected other Marian shrines to come to Tepeyac.\nThe theory promoting the Spanish origin of the name says that:\nVenerated image and Diego's \"tilma\".\nDescription.\nThe image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is of a life-sized, dark-haired, olive-skinned young woman, standing with her head slightly inclined to her right, eyes downcast, and her hands held before her in prayer. She wears a pink dress ornamented with a floral design, a dark ribbon tied above her waist, and a blue-green mantle over all. The mantle is edged with gold and has golden stars throughout. She stands on a crescent moon, which is supported by an angel with eagle wings. She is surrounded by a golden sunburst.\nThe tilma now measures approximately , though sources vary by a few centimeters, and it shows signs of having been trimmed from the original size. It is made of two pieces of fabric sewn together with cotton thread. There is a large crack running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as smaller horizontal cracks, caused by the image being folded at some point.\nThe image is currently housed in a golden frame above the main altar of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, where it has been since the new basilica was completed in 1976.\nSymbolism.\nThe iconography of the Virgin is fully Catholic: Miguel S\u00e1nchez, the author of the 1648 tract \"Imagen de la Virgen Mar\u00eda\", described her as the Woman of the Apocalypse from the New Testament's Revelation 12:1, \"clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" She is described as a representation of the Immaculate Conception.\n&lt;section begin=Alleged corruption in the Catholic Church transclusion/&gt;Virgil Elizondo says the image also had layers of meaning for the indigenous people of Mexico who associated her image with their polytheistic deities, which further contributed to her popularity. Her blue-green mantle was the color reserved for the divine couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl; her belt is interpreted as a sign of pregnancy; and a cross-shaped image, symbolizing the cosmos and called \"nahui-ollin,\" is inscribed beneath the image's sash. She was called \"mother of maguey\", the source of the sacred beverage pulque. Pulque was also known as \"the milk of the Virgin\". The rays of light surrounding her are seen to also represent maguey spines.\nTechnical analyses.\nThe image and \"tilma\" have been examined numerous times over the years.\nCapitular inquiry.\nIn 1662, canons of the cathedral in Mexico City began the process of asking for a proper liturgy for Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12. As part of this request, Rome asked for a canonical investigation into the apparitions. The canons carried out this investigation from 1665 to 1666, including an examination of the image in March 1666.\nOn March 13, 1666, seven painters examined the image, accompanied by the viceroy and several clerics. The painters unanimously agreed that it was \"impossible that any artist could paint and work something so beautiful, clean, and well-formed on a fabric which is as rough as is the \"tilma\"\", and that the image must therefore be miraculous. They also noted the degree of preservation of the image and \"tilma\", and that the \"tilma\" had not been prepared for painting.\nOn March 28, three members of the \"protom\u00e9dico\" of New Spain also examined the image. They also noted how well-preserved the image was given the local climate, and saw this as evidence of the image's supernatural origin. In contrast, the silver of the moon and the gold on the sunburst, which had both been added to the original, were faded.\nCabrera.\nOn April 30, 1751, a group of eight painters headed by Jos\u00e9 de Ibarra were allowed to examine the image. On April 15, 1752, one of the painters, Miguel Cabrera, was again allowed access to the image in order to create three copies. In 1756, Cabrera published his account of the image, approved by the other painters, entitled \"Maravilla Americana\".\nLike the previous report, Cabrera noted the preservation of the image despite the climate. He said that the \"tilma\" was two pieces of cloth sewn together, and that it felt soft, probably made of \"ayate\" fibers rather than the coarser \"maguey\", as others had claimed. He discovered signs of four different painting techniques which he claimed had never been used in combination before. He said that the image had not been sized, and thus the image could be seen through the back of the cloth, though all but a small portion of the back was covered with silver at the time.\nBartolache.\nIn 1787, another group of painters examined the image at the request of Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Bartolache, a doctor and mathematician. They confirmed Cabrera's opinion that the fabric of the \"tilma\" was not coarse, but determined that it was of palm fibers. Contrary to Cabrera, however, they claimed that the image had been sized beforehand, and was not visible from behind; however, four years later, two of the painters claimed that they had never seen the back of the image and did not know if it had been sized. The artists came to the conclusion that the parts of the image that were original were of divine origin, though they noted that there were some touch-ups that were clearly the work of human hands, the first study to so note.\nFlores G\u00f3mez.\nArt restorer Jos\u00e9 Antonio Flores G\u00f3mez was hired by the abbot of the basilica to work on the image in 1947 and 1973. In a 2002 interview with the magazine \"Proceso\", he spoke about his experience. He noted that he had not been required to keep silent about his work, but had done so of his own accord.\nWhen he examined the image in 1947, he saw a large crack in the paint running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as some smaller horizontal cracks, which he thought were caused by the image having been folded. He also saw signs that others had touched up the image at various points. The necessity of touching up the image convinced him that it was of human origin.\nLike others, Flores G\u00f3mez noted the softness of the \"tilma\", which seemed to him more like cotton than the rougher agave traditionally claimed. He also said that the paints used in the image came from natural pigments, such as from the cochineal.\nCallahan and Smith.\nIn 1981, Philip Serna Callahan and Jody Brant Smith examined the image under infrared light, a common technique in art analysis. They were unable to find any trace of sizing or sketching underneath the paint. They concluded that, while there had been additions to and touch-ups of the image, which were in a poor state, there was no explanation for the original parts of the image or their preservation.\nSol Rosales.\nIn 1982, Guillermo Schulenburg, abbot of the basilica, hired Jos\u00e9 Sol Rosales of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura to study the image. Sol Rosales thought that the \"tilma\" was made of linen and hemp, and not either agave or cotton. Contrary to previous claims, he said that the fabric had been prepared with white paint before the image had been painted. He saw several different styles of tempera throughout the image. He held that the paints were made from various natural pigments, and further noted that all of these pigments were commonly available in 16th-century Mexico. Like Flores G\u00f3mez, Sol Rosales saw various touch-ups and repainting throughout the image.\nSol Rosales concluded that the image was of human origin. He claimed that others, like Cabrera, had had similar findings, but concluded that the image was divine due to social pressures. Sol Rosales and his team were supervised during the investigation by Schulenburg and others. Schulenburg sent the results of this study to the Vatican, cautioning against the canonization of Juan Diego.\nStudies on the eyes.\nSeveral studies have examined the eyes of the image. The authors of these studies claim that they have found images in the eyes corresponding to the people believed to have been present when Juan Diego opened his \"tilma\" before the bishop. The eyes are also claimed to contain Purkinje images exactly where they would be expected to be found in living eyes.\nCritics of these studies liken the figures to inkblots and pareidolia.\nCultural significance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nJuan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular veneration. In the 19th century it became the rallying cry of the Spaniards born in America, in what they denominated 'New Spain'. They said they considered the apparitions as legitimizing their own indigenous Mexican origin. They infused it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity, thereby also justifying their armed rebellion against Spain.\nSymbol of Mexico.\n\"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe\" became a recognized symbol of Catholic Mexicans. Miguel S\u00e1nchez, the author in 1648 of the first published account of the vision, identified Guadalupe as \"Revelation's\" Woman of the Apocalypse, and said:\n... this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary\u00a0... who had prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this, her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image.\nThroughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first President of Mexico (1824\u20131829) changed his name from Jos\u00e9 Miguel Ram\u00f3n Adaucto Fern\u00e1ndez y F\u00e9lix to Guadalupe Victoria in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Father Miguel Hidalgo, in the Mexican War of Independence (1810), and Emiliano Zapata, in the Mexican Revolution (1910), led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan flags emblazoned with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the \"Patroness of the Americas\", the \"Empress of Latin America\", and the \"Protectress of Unborn Children\".\nIn 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his \"Grito de Dolores\", with the cry \"Death to the Spaniards and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!\" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked Guanajuato and Valladolid, they placed \"the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors\" and \"they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats.\" After Hidalgo's death, leadership of the revolution fell to a mestizo priest named Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos, who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos adopted the Virgin as the seal of his Congress of Chilpancingo, inscribing her feast day into the Chilpancingo constitution and declaring that Guadalupe was the power behind his victories:\nNew Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos's execution in 1815 wrote: \"the leaders of the independence struggle have put fanaticism to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their flags... the veneration for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest prophet might inspire.\"\nIn 1912, Emiliano Zapata's peasant army rose out of the south against the government of Francisco Madero. Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in land reform\u2014\"tierra y libertad\" ('land and liberty') was the slogan of the uprising\u2014when his peasant troops penetrated Mexico City, they carried Guadalupan banners. More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) named their \"mobile city\" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson Subcomandante Marcos wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.\nMexican culture.\nHarringon argues that: The Aztecs... had an elaborate, coherent symbolic system for making sense of their lives. When this was destroyed by the Spaniards, something new was needed to fill the void and make sense of New Spain\u00a0... the image of Guadalupe served that purpose.\nAccording to the traditional account, the name of Guadalupe, as the name was heard or understood by Spaniards, was chosen by the Virgin herself when she appeared on the hill outside Mexico City in 1531, ten years after the Conquest.\nGuadalupe continues to be a mixture of the cultures which blended to form Mexico, both racially and religiously, \"the first mestiza\", or \"the first Mexican\", \"bringing together people of distinct cultural heritages, while at the same time affirming their distinctness.\" As Jacques Lafaye wrote in \"Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe\", \"as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.\" The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a \"common denominator\" uniting Mexicans. Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of differences\u2014linguistic, ethnic, and class-based\u2014King says \"The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole.\"\nThe Mexican novelist, Carlos Fuentes, once said that \"you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe.\" Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in 1974 that \"The Mexican people, after more than two centuries of experiments and defeats, have faith only in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery.\"\nVeneration.\nThe shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Over the Friday and Saturday of December 11 to 12, 2009, a record number of 6.1\u00a0million pilgrims visited the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the apparition.\nReligious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe appears in Roman Catholic parishes, especially those with Latin American heritage. &lt;section end=Alleged corruption in the Catholic Church transclusion/&gt;In addition, due to the growth of Hispanic communities in the United States, religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe has started appearing in some Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.\nThe Virgin of Guadalupe is considered the Patroness of Mexico and the Continental Americas; she is also venerated by Native Americans, on the account of the devotion calling for the conversion of the Americas.\nDue to Mary's appearance as a pregnant mother and her claims as mother of all in the apparition, the Blessed Virgin Mary, under this title is popularly invoked as \"Patroness of the Unborn\" and a common image for the Pro-Life movement.\nIn political movements.\nDue to her association as a crusader of social justice, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe has been utilized as a symbol across regions\u00a0to advance political movements and mobilize the masses. For instance, the image has most notably been utilized in Mexico's Independence movement in the early 19th century, the United Farm Worker Movement in the U.S. in the 20th century and in contemporary political causes like immigration.\nIn Mexico's Independence, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe became associated with the movement after Father Miguel Hidalgo rallied and united insurgents under her banner. In fact, the first president of the Mexican republic, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Ram\u00f3n Adaucto Fern\u00e1ndez y F\u00e9lix, who was heavily involved in Mexico's Independence war, changed his name as to Guadalupe Victoria as a sign of devotion.\nIn the United Farm Workers Union (UFW), its leader, Cesar Chavez, was a devout Catholic who drew on his religious beliefs to demand for better wages and labor practices for farm workers in the U.S. He incorporated his religious beliefs in the movement by holding masses in the picket lines and prayers before meetings, and leading a pilgrimage from Delano to Sacramento in 1966 during Lent. Similarly to Mexico's Independence movement, the famous pilgrimage in 1966 that drew national attention to the cause was lead\u00a0under a banner with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\nThe image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is also present in the contemporary political discussion on immigration. Artists like Ester Hernandez and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood embed or reimagine her image on artworks that comment on immigration politics. For instance, Ester Hernandez's screen print titled \"Wanted\" (2010) and\u00a0Consuelo Jimenez Underwood's\u00a0\"Sacred Jump\" (1994) and \"Virgen de los Caminos\" (1994).\nIn popular culture.\nLiterature and film.\nOne notable reference in literature to the image and its alleged predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess Tonantzin, is in Sandra Cisneros' short story \"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\", from her collection \"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories\" (1991). Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas. \"Little Miracles\" ends with an extended narrative (pp.\u00a0124\u2013129) of a feminist artist, Rosario \"Chayo\" de Le\u00f3n, who at first did not allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women. But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzin, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence. In Chayo's words, \"I finally understood who you are. No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzin. Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple\" (128).\nThe image and its alleged apparition was investigated several times, including in the 2013 documentary \"The Blood &amp; The Rose\", directed by Tim Watkins.\nVisual arts.\nDrawing on the significance of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Chicano culture, many Chicano artists revere her image and visually reimagine the religious figure within a feminist and contemporary context. In addition to being a religious symbol, some Chicano artists view Our Lady of Guadalupe as an empowering feminist icon and a proclamation of Indigenous pride. However, these re-envisioned artworks have encountered controversy, as many artists have faced intense backlash from Catholic groups who view these artworks as \"disrespectful and irreverent\". One of the most famous controversies was sparked by Alma L\u00f3pez's \"Our Lady\" digital collage, which later led to a book titled \"Our Lady of Controversy: Alma L\u00f3pez's Irreverent Apparition\". Chicano artists such as Yolanda L\u00f3pez, Alma L\u00f3pez, Margarita 'Mita' Cuaron, Ester Hern\u00e1ndez, and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood, among others, have used Our Lady of Guadalupe's portrait to explore themes of repression, feminine strength, and to uplift women.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}
{"id": "66443", "revid": "51062074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66443", "title": "Kleptocracy", "text": "Form of government\n[[File:Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-\nKleptocracy (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] , \"thief\", or , \"I steal\", and from , \"power, rule\"), also referred to as thievocracy, is a [[government]] whose [[Corruption|corrupt]] leaders (kleptocrats) use [[Power (social and political)|political power]] to expropriate the wealth of the people and land they govern, typically by [[embezzlement|embezzling]] or [[Misappropriation|misappropriating]] government funds at the expense of the wider population. One feature of political-based socioeconomic thievery is that there is often no public announcement explaining or apologizing for misappropriations, nor any legal charges or punishment levied against the offenders.\nKleptocracy is different from [[plutocracy]] (rule by the richest) and [[oligarchy]] (rule by a small elite). In a kleptocracy, corrupt politicians enrich themselves secretly outside the [[rule of law]], through [[kickbacks]], [[bribes]], and special favors from lobbyists and corporations, or they simply direct state funds to themselves [[Cronyism|and their associates]]. According to the \"[[Oxford English Dictionary]]\", the first use in English occurs in the publication \"Indicator\" of 1819: \"Titular ornaments, common to Spanish kleptocracy.\"\nCharacteristics.\nKleptocratic rulers often treat their country's [[treasury]] as a source of personal wealth, spending funds on [[luxury good]]s and extravagances as they see fit. Many kleptocratic rulers secretly transfer public funds into [[numbered bank account|hidden personal accounts]] in foreign countries to provide for themselves if removed from power.\nAccording to L.K. Samuels, one reason governmental bodies subscribe to theft-prone policies is to lay the groundwork for the socialization of labor and property, thus permitting kleptocrats to make a populace \"subservient to an institutionalized authority.\" Journalist [[Paul Greenberg (journalist)|Paul Greenberg]], in writing in 1989 against the idea of the United States sending substantial foreign aid to [[Poland]], argued that the country was emerging from \"40 years of a Communist thievocracy that has obliterated not only economic progress but also the idea of a modern economy.\"\nFinancial system.\nContemporary studies have identified 21st-century kleptocracy as a global [[financial system]] based on [[money laundering]], which \"depends on the services of the world's largest banks and expert financial professionals\". The [[International Monetary Fund]] has suggested it could be a consensus of estimates, that money laundering made up 2\u20135 percent of the global economy in 1998. Kleptocrats engage in [[money laundering]] to obscure the corrupt origins of their wealth and safeguard it from domestic threats such as economic instability and predatory kleptocratic rivals. They are then able to secure this wealth in assets and investments within more stable [[jurisdiction]]s, where it can then be stored for personal use, returned to the country of origin to support the kleptocrat's domestic activities, or deployed elsewhere to protect and project the regime's interests overseas.\nKleptocrats abuse the freedoms found in Western countries by transferring funds out of a kleptocracy and into [[Western world|Western]] jurisdictions for money laundering and asset security. Since 2011, more than $1 trillion has left [[Developing country|developing countries]] annually in illicit financial outflows. A 2016 study found that $12 trillion had been siphoned out of the kleptocracies of [[Russia]], [[China]], and developing economies. Western [[Professional services|professional services providers]] are taken advantage of by kleptocratic Russians and Chinese, exploiting legal and financial loopholes in the West to facilitate transnational money laundering. The kleptocratic financial system typically comprises four steps according to one opinion.\nIn a 2011 forensic study of grand corruption cases, the [[World Bank]] found the United States was the leading victim of illegal incorporation of entities involved in money laundering schemes. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]] estimates that $300 billion is laundered annually in the United States in violation of US law.\nThis kleptocratic financial system flourishes in the [[United States]] by illegally abusing the United States' liberal economic structure for two reasons.\n[[File:Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 at the Enthronement of Naruhito (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Montenegro's president [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] was listed among the twenty richest [[World leaders|world leader]]s according to \"[[The Independent]]\" in May 2010, which described the source of his wealth as \"mysterious\".]]\nAs of 2016, there are only around 1,200 money laundering convictions per year in the United States and money launderers face a less than five percent chance of conviction. [[Raymond W. Baker]] estimates that law enforcement fails in 99.9% of cases to detect money laundering by kleptocrats and other financial criminals.\nOther Western jurisdictions favoured by kleptocrats include [[South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]], and British dependencies, especially the [[British Virgin Islands]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Guernsey]], and [[Jersey]]. Jurisdictions connected to the [[European Union]] that are particularly favoured by kleptocrats include [[Cyprus]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[Netherlands Antilles]].\n[[File:Pacifick\u00e9 shrom\u00e1\u017ed\u011bn\u00ed v Brn\u011b za Skute\u010dnou Demokracii TE\u010e (03).jpg|thumb|Demonstration banner with text in (\"[[Democracy]] instead of kleptocracy\"); peace rally in [[Brno]] for Real Democracy NOW, [[Moravian Square]], [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]]]\nPolitical and corporate kleptomania.\nOther forms of a thievery society that can induce a \"culture of systematic fraud\" have been described as \"political and corporate kleptomania\". In this case, the plunder and looting enriches not only high government officials, but a narrow class of [[Plutocracy|plutocrats]], who usually represent wealthy individuals and families who have amassed great assets through the usage of political favoritism, special interest legislation, monopolies, special tax breaks, state intervention, subsidies or outright [[Graft (politics)|graft]]. This type of economic system of political spoils is sometimes referred to as [[crony capitalism]].\nEffects.\nThe effects of a kleptocratic regime or government on a nation are typically adverse in regards to the welfare of the state's [[economy]], political affairs, and [[civil right]]s. Kleptocratic governance typically ruins prospects of foreign investment and drastically weakens the domestic market and cross-border trade. As kleptocracies often embezzle money from their citizens by misusing funds derived from [[tax payment]]s, or engage heavily in money laundering schemes, they tend to heavily degrade the quality of life for citizens.\nIn addition, the money that kleptocrats steal is diverted from funds earmarked for public amenities such as the building of hospitals, schools, roads, parks \u2013 having further adverse effects on the quality of life of citizens. The informal oligarchy that results from a kleptocratic elite subverts democracy (or any other political format).\nExamples.\n[[File:President_Suharto,_1993.jpg|thumb|[[Suharto]], the former [[President of Indonesia]], was reported to have stolen over $15 billion during his presidency.]]\nIn early 2004, the German anti-corruption [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Transparency International]] released a list of ten self-enriching leaders in the two decades previous to the report. Transparency International acknowledged that they were \"not necessarily the 10 most corrupt leaders\" and noted that \"very little is known about the amounts actually embezzled\".\nIn descending order of amount allegedly stolen (converted to [[United States dollar]]s), they were:\nThe [[Politics of Russia|political system in Russia]] has been described as a [[Mafia state]] where president [[Vladimir Putin]] serves as the \"head of the clan\".\nFormer [[Malaysian Prime Minister]] [[Najib Razak]] had $731\u00a0million in his personal bank accounts when his ruling party alliance [[Barisan Nasional]] lost the 14th election to opposition party [[Pakatan Harapan]] led by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], in part because of allegations of participating in the [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|1MDB scandal]].\n[[Azerbaijan]] has been described as a kleptocracy for its use of oil revenue to enrich an oligarch class, including that of the ruling Aliyev dynasty. Azerbaijan's leader [[Ilham Aliyev]] and his wife [[Mehriban Aliyeva]] were described as the \"embodiment of nepotism and kleptocracy\" in Azerbaijan.\nIn 2010, \"[[The Washington Times]]\" estimated that [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] elites in [[Croatia]] led by former prime minister [[Ivo Sanader]] had \"stolen or siphoned off\" about 1 billion USD.\nThe [[2015\u20132016 protests in Moldova]] had been organised by a grass-roots citizens' movement, \"[[Dignity and Truth Platform Party|Dignity and Truth]]\", as a response to the disappearance of [[2014 Moldovan bank fraud scandal|$1 billion from the Moldovan banks in 2014]]. Former Prime Minister [[Vlad Filat]] was arrested on October 15, 2015, for involvement in the bank fraud scandal.\nIn 2016 the [[Enough Project]] issued a report claiming that the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is run as a violent kleptocracy.\nNarcokleptocracy.\nA narcokleptocracy is a society in which criminals involved in the trade of [[narcotics]] have undue influence on the governance of a state. For instance, the term was used to describe the regime of [[Manuel Noriega]] in [[Panama]] in a report prepared by a subcommittee of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] chaired by [[Massachusetts]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]].\nIn 2020, the [[United States]] charged the president of [[Venezuela]], [[Nicolas Maduro]] with drug trafficking, as well as many officials and head figures of his administration.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading\n[[Category:Political corruption]]\n[[Category:Pejorative terms for forms of government]]\n[[Category:Wealth concentration]]\n[[Category:Oligarchy]]"}

Longitudinally it extends from the border with France and the French Riviera (or ) near Ventimiglia (a former customs post) eastwards to Capo Corvo (also known as Punta Bianca) which marks the eastern end of the Gulf of La Spezia and is close to the regional border between Liguria and Tuscany. The Italian Riviera thus includes nearly all of the coastline of Liguria. Historically the \"Riviera\" extended further to the west, through what is now French territory as far as Marseille.\nThe Italian Riviera crosses all four Ligurian provinces and their capitals Genoa, Savona, Imperia and La Spezia, with a total length of about 350\u00a0km (218 miles). It is customarily divided into a western section, the Ponente Riviera, and an eastern section, the Levante Riviera, the point of division being the apex of the Ligurian arc at Voltri. It has about 1.6 million inhabitants, and most of the population is concentrated within the coastal area. Its mild climate draws an active tourist trade in the numerous coastal resorts, which include Alassio, Bonassola, Bordighera, Camogli, Cinque Terre, Lerici, Levanto, Noli, Portofino, Porto Venere, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sanremo, San Fruttuoso, and Sestri Levante. It is also known for its historical association with international celebrity and artistic visitors; writers and poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway were inspired by the beauty and spirit of Liguria.\nAs a tourist centre, the Italian Riviera benefits from over 300 days of sunshine per year, and is known for its beaches, colourfully painted towns, natural environment, food, and luxury villas and hotels, as well as for its popular resort facilities, major yachting and cruising areas with several marinas, festivals, golf courses, sailing, rock climbing and scenic views of centuries old farmhouses and cottages.\nIndustries are concentrated in and around Genoa, Savona, and along the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Genoa and La Spezia are Italy's leading shipyards; La Spezia is Italy's major naval base, and Savona is a major centre of the Italian iron industry. Chemical, textile, and food industries are also important.\n in the center of Genoa and the Cinque Terre National Park (which includes \"Cinque Terre\", Portovenere, and the islands Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto) are two of Italy's 58 World Heritage Sites.\nOverview.\nThe Riviera's centre is Genoa, which divides it into two main sections: the Riviera di Ponente (\"the coast of the setting sun\"), extending westwards from Genoa to the French border; and the Riviera di Levante (\"the coast of the rising sun\") between Genoa and Capo Corvo.\nIt is known for its mild climate and its reputation for a relaxed way of life, old fishing ports, and landscapes. It has been a popular destination for travellers and tourists since the time of Byron and Percy Shelley.\nMany villages and towns in the area are internationally known, such as Portofino, Bordighera, Lerici and the Cinque Terre. Many villages of the Italian Riviera are counted among I Borghi pi\u00f9 belli d'Italia (\"The most beautiful villages of Italy\").\nThe part of the Riviera di Ponente centred on Savona, is called the Riviera delle Palme (the Riviera of palms); the part centred on Sanremo, is the Riviera dei Fiori, after the long-established flower growing industry.\nPlaces on or near the Italian Riviera include:\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nThe Italian Riviera contains the following UNESCO World Heritage Sites:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On 7 September 2021 the Taliban officials in de facto control of most of Afghanistan announced a new interim government headed by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund as Prime Minister. The government is subject to the oversight of the Taliban's Supreme Leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada. As of 8 September 2021, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has not yet been formally recognized as the de jure government of Afghanistan by any other country. The representatives appointed by the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan continue to represent the country at the United Nations. These representatives have refused to recognize the Taliban appointed government and have urged other countries to not recognize this government either.\nBetween 2002 and 2021, the government of Afghanistan consisted of the cabinet of ministers, provincial governors and the national assembly, with a president serving as the head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the Afghan Armed Forces. The nation was formerly led by President Ashraf Ghani who was backed by two vice presidents, Amrullah Saleh and Sarwar Danish until Ghani fled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in August 2021 due to Taliban fighters reaching the capital Kabul, which established a \"de facto\" government. In the last decade the politics of Afghanistan have been influenced by NATO countries, particularly the United States, in an effort to stabilise and democratise the country. In 2004, the nation's new constitution was adopted and an executive president was elected. The following year a general election to choose parliamentarians took place.\nHamid Karzai was declared the first-ever democratically elected head of state in Afghanistan in 2004, winning a second five-year term in 2009. The National Assembly was Afghanistan's national legislature. It was a bicameral body, composed of the House of the People and the House of Elders. The first legislature was elected in 2005 and the most recent one in 2018. Members of the Supreme Court were appointed by the president to form the judiciary. Together, this system served to provide a set of checks and balances.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAfghanistan was an Islamic republic consisting of three branches of power (executive, legislative, and judiciary) overseen by checks and balances. The country was led by President Ashraf Ghani, who replaced Hamid Karzai in 2014. Before the election of 2004, Karzai led the country after being appointed as President of the Afghan Transitional Administration. While supporters have praised Karzai's efforts to promote national reconciliation and a growing economy, critics charge him with failing to stem corruption and the illegal drug production. \nThe National Assembly was elected in 2005 and then in 2010. Among the elected officials were former mujahideen, Islamic fundamentalists, reformists, communists, and several Taliban associates. About 28% of the delegates elected were women, 3% more than the 25% minimum guaranteed under the constitution. This made Afghanistan one of the leading countries in terms of female representation in the legislature. \nThe Supreme Court of Afghanistan was led by Chief Justice Sayed Yusuf Halem, replacing Abdul Salam Azimi in 2014. The Deputy Chief Justice was Bahauddin Baha.\nNorthern Alliance and Taliban government.\nIn September 1996, officials of the Islamic State of Afghanistan under Burhanuddin Rabbani were displaced by forces of the Taliban. The United Nations refused to recognize the Taliban government, instead it recognized the Islamic State as the official government in exile. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference left the Afghan seat vacant until the question of legitimacy could be resolved through negotiations among the warring factions. The Taliban controlled 95% of the territory by 2001 and only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized them as the government of Afghanistan. The remaining 5% belonged to rebel forces that became known as the Northern Alliance.\nMilitary action by the United States and allies.\nAfter the Taliban's refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden to U.S. authorities for his involvement in the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., a US-led international coalition was formed; after several weeks of aerial bombardment by coalition forces and military action on the ground, including operations with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban was officially ousted from power on November 17, 2001.\nBonn Agreement.\nIn December 2001, a number of prominent Afghans met under the United Nations auspices in Germany to decide on a plan for governing the country. As a result, the Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) \u2013 made up of 30 members, headed by a chairman \u2013 was inaugurated on December 22, 2001, with a six-month mandate to be followed by a two-year Afghan Transitional Administration (ATA), after which elections are to be held. Some provisions in the agreement have expired, due to the creation of the constitution. Still, the agreement paved the way for the creation of a democratic Afghanistan.\nISAF and Afghan security forces.\nThe United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to help provide basic security for the population of Afghanistan. Members of the United States Armed Forces and other NATO countries began sending large number of troops to Afghanistan. They began to train the Afghan Armed Forces and Afghan National Police as well as fight insurgents and take part in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\nNew constitution and national elections.\nThe structure of the Transitional Authority was announced on June 10, 2002, when an emergency loya jirga (grand assembly) convened establishing the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan (TISA), which had 18 months to hold a constitutional loya jirga to adopt a constitution and 24 months to hold nationwide elections. The loya jirga was replaced by the National Assembly.\nUnder the Bonn Agreement the Afghan Constitution Commission was established to consult with the public and formulate a draft constitution. The meeting of a constitutional \"loya jirga\" was held in December 2003, when a new constitution was adopted creating a presidential form of government with a bicameral legislature: the House of Elders (Meshrano Jirga) and the House of the People (Wolesi Jirga).\nThe 2004 presidential election was held on October 9, with over 10 million Afghans being registered to vote. Many of the candidates running against Hamid Karzai tried to boycott the election because they feared irregularities. However, Karzai made this statement to the media:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"It is too late to call for a boycott now that millions of Afghans have come from their homes despite rain and snow and they have voted... We should respect the people's will. I'm very delighted that all over Afghanistan, with the help of God, people with a lot of happiness and enthusiasm went to ballot boxes and voted. This shows the political understanding of Afghans and their will for a peaceful future.\"\u2014\u200a An independent commission found evidence of fraud, but ruled that it did not affect the outcome of the poll and Karzai won with 55.4% of the vote. He was inaugurated as President on December 7 of that year. It was the country's first national election since 1969, when parliamentary elections were last held.\nIn September 2005, the parliamentary election was held; the National Assembly opened after the results were announced. In December 2005, Sibghatullah Mojadeddi was picked to head the 102-seat upper house and Yunus Qanuni was chosen to lead the 249-seat lower house of parliament.\nExecutive branch.\nThe Constitution of Afghanistan creates a strong presidency, serving as the head of state and Commander-in-Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces. A president is elected with two vice-presidents. The president appoints cabinet ministers and provincial governors, which are to be approved by the National Assembly.\nPresidency of Hamid Karzai.\nHamid Karzai served as the Chairman of the Interim Administration from December 2001 to June 2002. He then served as the Interim President between June 2002 to October 2004. He officially became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan after winning the 2004 presidential election.\nFirst term.\nThe United States is the leading nation in the rebuilding and democratization of Afghanistan. United States-Afghanistan relations have improved since late 2001, especially after the Karzai administration was formed. Foreign relations of Afghanistan with other NATO members and regional countries have also improved under the Karzai administration.\nAfter winning the 2004 election and removing many of the former Northern Alliance warlords from his cabinet, it was thought that Karzai would pursue a more aggressively reformist path in 2005 but he proved to be more cautious. Ever since Karzai's new administration took over in 2004, the economy of Afghanistan has been growing rapidly for the first time in many years. Government revenue is increasing every year, although it is still heavily dependent on foreign aid. During the Karzai administration, public discontent grew about corruption and the civilian casualties in the fight against the Taliban insurgency.\nSecond term.\nThree months after the 2009 election, President Karzai was officially declared the winner. The Obama administration urged Karzai to exclude ineffective or corrupt officials from the new government, while powerful Afghans who helped deliver his re-election were demanding positions. According to political analysts, the list of ministers Karzai presented to the Parliament was \"not encouraging\", but it reflected realpolitik. Slightly more than half were ministers who would stay in their current positions or who had served previously in Karzai's government. In January 2009, the Afghan Parliament rejected 17 of Karzai's 24 cabinet nominees, approving only seven. Relations between US President Barack Obama and Karzai were not so great in the beginning but by 2012 they slightly improved, especially after the death of Osama bin Laden and the assassination of Karzai's brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai. President Obama made two official visits to Afghanistan between 2010 and 2012. The relations again began to decline in late 2013 after Karzai decided not to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) with the United States.\nPresidency of Ashraf Ghani.\nAfter a disputed election, Ashraf Ghani became President of Afghanistan and Abdullah Abdullah became Chief Executive Officer of Afghanistan in September 2014. One day later, the new Afghan government signed the Bilateral Security Agreement.\nOn August 15, 2021, during the 2021 Taliban offensive, as the Fall of Kabul was occurring, Ashraf Ghani left Afghanistan with his wife to Abu Dhabi in the UAE. Some unconfirmed reports suggest that Ghani may return to Kabul in the future.\nLegislative branch.\nThe 2005 parliamentary election for the Wolesi Jirga (House of the People) were conducted on September 18, 2005. This was the first parliamentary election in Afghanistan since 1969. Approximately 2,707 candidates, including 328 women, competed for 249 seats. The election was conducted with multiple seat electoral constituencies. Each province is a constituency and has a varying number of seats, depending on population. Voters have a single non-transferable vote.\nThe Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders) consists of 102 members. One-third of the members were appointed by the president, while another third was elected by the provincial councils. Elections for the provincial councils were held simultaneously with those for the Wolesi Jirga. The remaining third are to be elected by district councils.\nElections.\n2004 presidential.\nThe first presidential election under the new constitution was held on October 9, 2004. Interim-president Karzai had enough votes to avoid a run-off.\n2005 parliamentary.\nAfghanistan held parliamentary elections on 18 September 2005. First results were announced on 9 October and final results on 12 November 2005. Since all candidates were not listed by party and elected as non-partisans, a breakdown by party was not possible. Turnout was estimated at 50 percent.\n2009 presidential.\nThe 2009 presidential election was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud.\nThe vote, along with elections for 420 provincial council seats, took place on August 20, 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.\nTwo months later, under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, a second round run-off vote between incumbent President Hamid Karzai and his main rival Abdullah Abdullah was announced for November 7, 2009. On November 1, however, Abdullah announced that he would no longer be participating in the run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met, and a \"transparent election is not possible.\" A day later, on November 2, 2009, officials of the election commission canceled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President of Afghanistan for another 5-year term.\n2014 presidential.\nThe 2014 presidential election was held in April 2014, followed by a run-off in June 2014. The results of both ballots were challenged by the losing candidate Abdullah Abdullah, who claimed the results were manipulated to ensure his opponent Ashraf Ghani was declared the winner. The results of the election remained in dispute until September 2014, despite a proposal by the United States that the candidates agree to a power-sharing deal, which was initially agreed to. A UN-led audit failed to sway Abdullah as he insisted the audit team could not explain a million extra votes counted in the run-off. Ghani supporters insisted they wanted to do a deal and were leaving the door open to negotiations.\n2019 presidential.\nThe 2019 presidential election was held on September 2, 2019, with Ashraf Ghani narrowly reelected over Abdullah Abdullah who contested the preliminary results. When the final results were released in February 2020, Abdullah rejected them, forming a parallel government and organising a separate inauguration. Nonetheless, Ghani was officially sworn in on March 9, 2020. The dispute was resolved on May 16, 2020, when the two signed a power-sharing deal whereby Ghani remained president, however both would choose an equal number of ministers and Abdullah would lead peace talks with the Taliban.\nJudicial branch.\nThe constitution of Afghanistan mandates a Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority in Afghanistan and is the court of last resort. Judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the National Assembly. Lower courts included magistrate courts, Courts of First Instance, and the Intermediate Court of Appeals. Intermediate Court of Appeals review decisions of lower courts, before appeals are sent to the Supreme Court. If an appeal loses, they can be sent to the Supreme Court. Courts of First Instance exist in every city. They have several branches that try all major cases. The branches include Criminal, Civil, Religious, Administrative, Labor, and Family divisions. Also in the first instance include military courts, which try military personnel. Magistrate Courts are at the lowest level, which tries minor civil and criminal cases.\nPolitical parties.\nPolitical parties in Afghanistan are in flux and many prominent players have plans to create new ones. Some of the political parties in Afghanistan are as follow:\nInternational organization participation.\nAfghanistan is a member of the following organizations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (observer)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The breed dates back to the 16th century and makes frequent appearances in paintings from the Dutch Golden Age.\nDescription.\nAppearance.\nThe Kooikerhondje is a small, spaniel-like sporting dog. Originally bred in the Netherlands as a duck hunting dog, it has a white plumed tail for the purpose of attracting ducks.\nThe preferred height at the withers is for males and for females. The FCI standard allows a range of for males, and for females. The breed has a wavy, medium-length double coat, and its coloration is white and orange-red. Some Kooikerhondjes have black ear tips, which are referred to as \"earrings\".\nHealth.\nA number of heritable diseases have been identified in the Kooikerhondje, including inflammatory myopathy, Type III von Willebrand's disease, necrotising myelopathy, renal dysplasia, patellar luxation, and ataxia. A Dutch study of 842 Kooikerhondjes found that patellar luxation was prevalent in 24% of dogs scanned. During the time period of the study \u2014 which started in 1994 and ended in 2011 \u2014 the prevalence of the condition fell from 28% to 19%, although the prevalence is still higher than for other spaniel dogs.\nHistory.\nThe Kooikerhondje was developed in the Netherlands sometime around the 16th century in order to lure ducks into duck decoys where hunters could easily catch the fowl. The hunting style of the Kooikerhondje was inspired by foxes, as Dutch hunters realized ducks were enticed by foxes playing near water, as long as they did not make eye contact.\nThe Kooikerhondje frequently appears in paintings by Dutch masters such as Jan Steen, Rembrandt, and Johannes Vermeer. The breed is believed to be an ancestor of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever.\nThe breed almost became extinct during World War II until Baroness van Hardenbroek van Ammerstol rescued it. The breed was not officially recognized by the Dutch Kennel Club until 1971 and has since been imported into other countries and recognized officially. In January 2013, the Kennel Club announced it was reclassifying the Kooikerhondje from the gun dog group to the utility group effective from January 2014. The decision was reached after discussions with the British breed clubs and unanimous agreement was achieved.\nThe Kooikerhondje was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2018. The breed gained fame in the United States in the 2020s, in part due to Decoy Ohtani, a Kooikerhondje owned by baseball player Shohei Ohtani.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is based on the memoirs of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order who was canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church. The film stars Andreas Mu\u00f1oz, a Spanish actor who portrays the titular character in the film.\nProduction.\nThe English-language film was helmed by Filipino director Paolo Dy and was produced by the media arm of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines, Jesuit Communications. The musical score was written by Filipino composer Ryan Cayabyab.\nThe film was shot primarily in Spain, particularly in Navarra and the Basque Country, over twenty days, with a ten-hour cap per day. The film budget was pegged at \u20b1, with The One Meralco Foundation being among the sponsors of the film. Post-production, including the film's special effects, was done in the Philippines. Dy said that the most challenging part in shooting the film was the battle scene, for which the production team had to bring in stuntmen from the Canary Islands.\nIt was around 2012 that the Jesuit Communications Foundation contacted director Paolo Dy about making the film. Before shooting, the director's wife Cathy Azanza-Dy sought the aid of her friends from the Philippine theater industry in developing the script. Luna Inocian read the script and provided comments, while others including Jenny Jamora, Topper Fabregas, and Steve Cadd did a table reading in Manila. They reviewed each scene's good points and identified those elements that could be scrapped. They also improved each character's arc. Dy and his wife honed each character's motivation and relationships, and brought the film's focus upon the humanity of Ignatius of Loyola, creating a protagonist with whom the audience could identify. The film adopts elements from traditional theater. The film's costumes were conceived to materially represent each of the character's personalities and are not necessarily historically accurate. Costume designer Juvan Bermil designed the approximately four hundred period costumes. The Spanish cast comprises actors and actresses also with a background in theater.\nRelease.\nThe film was screened at the Vatican Film Library in the Vatican City on June 14, 2016, becoming the first Philippine film to be screened in the city-state. The Philippine premiere was held at The Theater at Solaire Resort and Casino, Paranaque City on July 23, 2016. The premiere was accompanied by a live orchestra conducted by Gerard Salonga. The film then began its commercial run in Philippine cinemas on July 27, 2016.\n\"Ignacio de Loyola\" is also planned to be screened in Jesuit communities and universities across the world.\nThe film was screened in the United States in select cinemas on August 26, 2016.\nPossible sequel.\nIf reception to the film is satisfactory, a sequel to the film will be produced, this time on Francis Xavier, a friend of Ignatius of Loyola and co-founder of the Society of Jesus.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists of legislative, executive, and judicial subdivisions, as well as of a head of state, known as the president.\nThe Constitution of the Italian Republic is the result of the work of the Constituent Assembly, which was formed by the representatives of all the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of nazis and the fascist forces during the Italian Civil War. Article 1 of the Italian constitution states: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Italy is a democratic Republic founded on labour. Sovereignty belongs to the people and is exercised by the people in the forms and within the limits of the constitution.\"\nBy stating that Italy is a democratic republic, the article solemnly declares the results of the institutional referendum that took place on 2 June 1946 valid. The state is not the hereditary property of the ruling monarch, but instead a \"res publica\", belonging to everyone.\nThe people who are called to temporarily administer the republic are not owners, but servants; and the governed are not subjects, but citizens. And the sovereignty, that is the power to make choices that involve the entire community, belongs to the people, in accordance with the concept of a democracy, from the Greek \"demos\" (people) and \"krat\u00eca\" (power). However, this power is not to be exercised arbitrarily by mob rule, but in the forms and within the limits established by the rule of law.\nHead of state.\nThe president of the Republic of Italy is the head of state and represents the unity of the nation (art. 87 of the Constitution). The president serves as a point of connection between the three branches as he is elected by the lawmakers, appoints the executive and is the president of the judiciary. The president is also commander-in-chief in time of war.\nThe president of the Republic of Italy is elected for seven years by Parliament in joint session, together with three representatives of each region, except for the Aosta Valley, which gets only one representative. These delegates are elected by their respective regional councils so as to guarantee representation to minorities. The election needs a wide majority that is progressively reduced from two-thirds to one-half plus one of the votes after the third ballot. The only presidents ever to be elected on the first ballot are Francesco Cossiga and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Ciampi was replaced by Giorgio Napolitano, who was elected on 10 May 2006. While not forbidden by the law, no president had ever served two terms until 20 April 2013, when President Giorgio Napolitano was re-elected.\nAccording to the constitution, any citizen who is 50 years old on the day of the election, and enjoys civil and political rights, can be elected president. The president cannot hold office in any other branch of power and the office's salary and privileges are established by law.\nAmong the powers of the president, they have the capacity to:\nThe president also presides over the High Council of the Judiciary and the Supreme Council of Defence. Usually, the president tries to stay out of the day-to-day politics, and tries to be an institutional guarantee for all those involved in the political process. The president is not responsible for the actions performed in the exercise of his duties, except for high treason and violation of the Italian constitution, for which the president can be impeached by the parliament in joint session, with an absolute majority of its members.\nLegislative branch.\nWith article 48 of the constitution, which guarantees the right to vote, the people exercise their power through their elected representatives in the parliament. The Italian Parliament has a bicameral system, and consists of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic, elected every five years.\nThe Chamber of Deputies is elected by direct and universal suffrage by voters who are eighteen or older. There are 400 deputies, eight of which are elected in the overseas constituencies. All voters who are twenty-five or older on election day are eligible to be deputies.\nThe senate is elected by direct and universal suffrage by voters who are eighteen or older. There are 200 senators, four of whom are elected in the overseas constituencies. There are also a small number of senators for life, such as former presidents and up to five citizens appointed by the president for having brought honor to the nation with their achievements. All voters who are forty or older on election day are eligible to be senators. Elections of senators for each region being based on a modified proportional representation system.\nExecutive branch.\nThe constitution establishes the Government of Italy as composed of the president of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) and the cabinet's ministers. The President of Italy appoints the prime minister and, on the prime minister's proposal, the subsequent ministers that form their cabinet. The appointee is usually the leader of the majority coalition that won the election (e.g. Berlusconi IV Cabinet), but they can also be a new leader emerging from a post-election leadership challenge within the majority coalition (e.g. Renzi Cabinet), or a person instructed by the president to form a national unity government in times of political crisis, such as in a coalition shift (e.g. Conte II Cabinet), or if enough politicians from the majority coalition switch parties (e.g. Monti Cabinet). In any scenario, the government must receive the confidence of both houses, so the executive branch derives its legitimacy from the Italian Parliament and the great number of political parties forces the prime minister to bend to their will.\nIf the majority coalition no longer supports the government, the prime minister can be ousted with a vote of no confidence, at which point the president can either appoint a new Prime Minister capable of forming a government with the support of Parliament, or dissolve parliament and call for new elections. Cabinet reshuffles are also possible in case specific ministers lack the support of the parliament, while the prime minister remains in charge. In the history of the Italian Republic, there have been twenty legislatures (including the Constituent Assembly), forty-five consecutive premierships, and sixty-eight different cabinets.\nJudicial branch.\nThe law of Italy has a plurality of sources of production. These are arranged in a hierarchical scale, under which the rule of a lower source cannot conflict with the rule of an upper source (hierarchy of sources). The constitution of 1948 is the main source.\nThe constitution states that justice is administered in the name of the people and that judges are subject only to the law. So the judiciary is a branch that is completely autonomous and independent of all other branches of power, even though the minister of justice is responsible for the organization and functioning of those services involved with justice and has the power to originate disciplinary actions against judges, which are then administered by the High Council of the Judiciary, presided over by the president.\nThe judiciary of Italy is based on Roman law, the Napoleonic Code and later statutes. It is based on a mix of the adversarial and inquisitorial civil law systems, although the adversarial system was adopted in the appeal courts in 1988. Appeals are treated almost as new trials, and three degrees of trial are present. The third is a legitimating trial.\nThere is only partial judicial review of legislation in the North-American sense. Judicial review can be enacted only under certain conditions, either it already being established by constitutional law, or in the Constitutional Court, which can reject violating laws after judicial scrutiny. According to Article 134 of the constitution, the Constitutional Court shall pass judgement on:\nThe Constitutional Court is composed of 15 judges, one of which is the president of the Italian Constitutional Court elected from the court itself. One third of the judges are appointed by the president of the Italian Republic, one-third are elected by Parliament and one-third are elected by the ordinary and administrative supreme courts. The Constitutional Court passes on the constitutionality of laws, and is a post-World War II innovation.\nThe Constitutional Court was primarily established \"for the protection of the legal order and only indirectly as an institution for the vindication of fundamental rights\" of individuals. The court generally only has the power of judicial review over \"laws and enactments having force of law issued by the State and Regions\" (what is called primary legislation in civil-law systems) and does not have the power to review administration acts and regulations, or parliamentary rules.\nIn November 2014, Italy accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n "}

The country is characterized by a highly diverse, multi-ethnic, and multilingual society, reflecting its historical position at the crossroads of Central, South, and Western Asia, along ancient trade and invasion routes. The four major ethnic categories in the country are Pashtun, Tajik/Farsiwan, Hazara, and Uzbek. In addition, Afghanistan has a plethora of minor ethnic categories, including Turkmen, Baloch, Aimaq, Nuristani, Arab and many others. Together they make up the contemporary Afghan people.\nApproximately 43% of the population was under the age of 15, and about 74% of Afghans lived in rural areas as of 2016. The country has one of the highest fertility rates in the world outside of Africa, with the average woman giving birth to five children over her lifetime. Around 6.8% of infants die during childbirth or early infancy. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the nation's average life expectancy was estimated at about 63 years as of 2019. The prevalence of HIV remains very low, affecting only about 0.04% of the population.\nPashto () and Dari () are the official languages of Afghanistan. Dari serves as the inter-ethnic lingua franca across most of the country, particularly in northern and eastern provinces as well as in most major cities. Pashto is predominantly spoken in regions south of the Hindu Kush mountains and extends eastward toward the Indus River in neighbouring Pakistan. Smaller languages such as Uzbek and Turkmen are spoken in parts of northern Afghanistan. Multilingualism is widespread, particularly in the major urban centres.\nUp to 89.7% of the population adheres to Sunni Islam and follows the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, while between 10% and 15% are followers of Shia Islam, with the majority belonging to the Twelver branch, and smaller communities adhering to Ismaili traditions. The remaining 0.3% of the population practices other religions, including Sikhism and Hinduism. Outside the principal urban centres, much of the population is organized into tribal or other kinship-based groups that maintain their own traditional customs.\nPopulation size and distribution.\nAnatol Lieven of Georgetown University in Qatar wrote in 2021 that \"it may be noted that in the whole of modern Afghan history there has never been a census that could be regarded as remotely reliable.\"\nHistorical.\nThe first and only nationwide census of Afghanistan was carried out in 1979. It revealed a population of 13,051,358 (rural 11,037,231, urban 2,014,127). Previously there had been scattered attempts to conduct censuses in individual cities. According to the 1876 census, Kabul had a population of 140,700 people. In Kandahar in 1891 a population census was carried out, according to which 31,514 people lived in the city, of which 16,064 were men and 15,450 were women.\nFrom 1979 until the end of 1983, some 5 million people left the country to take shelter in neighbouring northwestern Pakistan and eastern Iran. This exodus was largely unchecked by any government. The Afghan government in 1983 reported a population of 15.96\u00a0million, which presumably included the exodus.\nIt is assumed that roughly 600,000 to as high as 2 million Afghans may have been killed during the various 1979\u20132001 wars. These figures are questionable and no attempt has ever been made to verify if they were actually killed or had moved to neighbouring countries as refugees.\nAs no census has been performed after 1979 and millions of people may have left the country, the current population of Afghanistan can only be guessed.\nCurrent and latest.\nAs of 2021, the total population of Afghanistan is around 37.5 million, which includes the 3 million Afghan nationals living in both Pakistan and Iran. About 26% of the population is urbanite and the remaining 74% lives in rural areas.\nAfghanistan's Central Statistics Organization (CSO) stated in 2011 that the total number of Afghans living inside Afghanistan was about 26 million and by 2017 it reached 29.2\u00a0million. Of this, 15 million are males and 14.2\u00a0million are females. The country's population is expected to reach 82 million by 2050.\nUrban areas have experienced rapid population growth in the last decade, which is due to the return of over 5 million expats. The only city in Afghanistan with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul.\nStructure of the population.\nStructure of the population (2012.01.07) (Data refer to the settled population based on the 1979 Population Census and the latest household prelisting.

Ten surveys were conducted between 2004 and 2015 by the Asia Foundation (a sample is shown in the table below; the survey in 2015 did not contain information on the ethnicity of the participants) and one between 2004 and 2009 by a combined effort of the broadcasting companies NBC News, BBC, and ARD.\nLanguages.\nDari and Pashto are both official languages of Afghanistan.\nUzbek and Turkmen are spoken as native languages in northern provinces, mainly among the Uzbeks and Turkmens. Smaller number of Afghans are also fluent in English, Urdu, Balochi, Arabic and other languages. An approximate distribution of languages spoken in the country is shown in the chart below:\nBased on information from the latest national opinion polls, up to 51% stated that they can speak or understand Pashto and up to 79% stated that they can speak or understand Dari. Uzbek was spoken or understood by up to 11% and Turkmen by up to 7%. Other languages that can be spoken are Arabic (4%) and Balochi (2%).\nReligion.\nAlmost the entire Afghan population is Muslim, with less than 1% being non-Muslim. Despite attempts to secularise Afghan society, Islamic practices pervade all aspects of life. Likewise, Islamic religious tradition and codes, together with traditional practices, provide the principal means of controlling personal conduct and settling legal disputes. Islam was used as the main basis for expressing opposition to the progressive reforms of Afghanistan by King Amanullah in the 1920s.\nThe members of Sikh and Hindu communities are mostly concentrated in urban areas. They numbered hundreds of thousands in the 1970s but over 90% have since fled due to the Afghan wars and persecution.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original AstroTurf product was a short-pile synthetic turf invented in 1965 by Monsanto. Since the early 2000s, AstroTurf has marketed taller pile systems that use infill materials to better replicate natural turf. In 2016, AstroTurf became a subsidiary of German-based SportGroup, a family of sports surfacing companies, which itself is owned by the investment firm Equistone Partners Europe.\nHistory.\nThe original AstroTurf brand product was invented by James M. Faria and Robert T. Wright at Monsanto. The original, experimental installation was inside the Waughhtel-Howe Field House at the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1964. It was patented in 1965 and originally sold under the name \"ChemGrass.\" It was rebranded as AstroTurf by company employee John A. Wortmann after its first well-publicized use at the Houston Astrodome stadium in\u00a01966. Donald L. Elbert patented two methods to improve the product in 1971.\nEarly iterations of the short-pile turf swept many major stadiums, but the product did need improvement. Concerns over directionality and traction led Monsanto's R&amp;D department to implement a texturized nylon system. By imparting a crimped texture to the nylon after it was extruded, the product became highly uniform.\nIn 1987, Monsanto consolidated its AstroTurf management, marketing, and technical activities in Dalton, Georgia, as AstroTurf Industries, Inc. In 1988, Balsam AG purchased all the capital stock of AstroTurf Industries, Inc. In 1994, Southwest Recreational Industries, Inc. (SRI) acquired the AstroTurf brand. In 1996, SRI was acquired by American Sports Products Group Inc.\nWhile AstroTurf was the industry leader throughout the late 20th century, other companies emerged in the early 2000s. FieldTurf, AstroTurf's chief competitor since the early 2000s, marketed a product of tall-pile polyethylene turf with infill, meant to mimic natural grass more than the older products. This third-generation turf, as it became known, changed the landscape of the marketplace. Although SRI successfully marketed AstroPlay, a third-generation turf product, increased competition gave way to lawsuits. In 2000, SRI was awarded $1.5 million in a lawsuit after FieldTurf was deemed to have lied to the public by making false statements regarding its own product and making false claims about AstroTurf and AstroPlay products.\nDespite their legal victory, increased competition took its toll. In 2004, SRI declared bankruptcy. Out of the bankruptcy proceedings, Textile Management Associates, Inc. (TMA) of Dalton, Georgia, acquired the AstroTurf brand and other assets. TMA began marketing the AstroTurf brand under the company AstroTurf, LLC. In 2006, General Sports Venue (GSV) became TMA's marketing partner for the AstroTurf brand for the American market. AstroTurf, LLC handled the marketing of AstroTurf in the rest of the world.\nIn 2009, TMA acquired GSV to enter the marketplace as a direct seller. AstroTurf, LLC focused its efforts on research and development, which has promoted rapid growth. AstroTurf introduced new product features and installation methods, including AstroFlect (a heat-reduction technology) and field prefabrication (indoor, climate-controlled inlaying). AstroTurf also introduced a product called \"RootZone\" consisting of crimped fibers designed to encapsulate infill.\nIn 2016, SportGroup Holding announced that it would purchase AstroTurf, along with its associated manufacturing facilities. The AstroTurf brand has operated since then in North America as AstroTurf Corporation.\nIn August 2021, AstroTurf became the official supplier of artificial turf to the United Soccer League, who run soccer leagues at the second, third, and fourth tiers of the U.S. men's soccer pyramid and the second tier of the U.S. women's soccer pyramid.\n1960s.\n1964\n1966\n1967\n1968\n1969\n1970s.\n1970\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1974\n1975\n1980s.\n1980\n1984\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1990s.\n1993\n1999\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories, many of them winners of literary awards. Three of his novels have been adapted into films.\nSince he first came to prominence in the mid-1960s, critics have cited Campbell as one of the leading writers in his field: T.E.D. Klein has written that \"Campbell reigns supreme in the field today\", and Robert Hadji has described him as \"perhaps the finest living exponent of the British weird fiction tradition\", while S. T. Joshi stated, \"future generations will regard him as the leading horror writer of our generation, every bit the equal of Lovecraft or Blackwood.\" In a 2021 appreciation of his collected works, \"The Washington Post\" said: \"Taken together, they constitute one of the monumental accomplishments of modern popular fiction.\"\nOverview.\nEarly life and work.\nCampbell was born in Liverpool, England, to Alexander Ramsey and Nora (Walker) Campbell. He was educated by Christian Brothers at St Edward's College, Liverpool. Campbell's childhood and adolescence were marked by the rift between his parents, who became estranged shortly after his birth. Campbell's father became a shadowy presence more often heard than seen. Campbell states, \"I didn't see my father face to face for nearly twenty years, and that was when he was dying.\" Years later, Campbell's mother degenerated into paranoia and schizophrenia, rendering his life a living hell\u2014an experience he has discussed in detail in the introduction and afterword to the restored text of \"The Face That Must Die\". Other autobiographical pieces regarding Campbell's life are available in Section V, \"On Ramsey Campbell\" in his essay collection \"Ramsey Campbell, Probably: 30 Years of Essays and Articles\" (ed. S. T. Joshi), as well as in the novella \"The Enigma of the Flat Policeman\" (2020).\nCampbell's mother \"wrote a great deal, novel after novel, but was largely unpublished aside from a handful of short stories in writer's magazines.\" She encouraged her young son to send his writing off from an early age. Growing up in the blitzed landscape of post-war Liverpool, Campbell avidly consumed the work of Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, Franz Kafka, Fritz Leiber, Graham Greene, and the cinema of film noir.\n\"Ghostly Tales\".\nCampbell's earliest tales were written when he was 11 years old (1957\u201358) and were influenced by a magazine from Bolton, Lancashire, called \"Phantom\". These early tales formed a self-illustrated collection of sixteen stories and a poem entitled \"Ghostly Tales\". Campbell intended to submit these to \"Phantom\", but his mother, who regarded literary success as a possible way of financing her escape from her disastrous marriage, persuaded him to wait until he had a whole book to show to publishers. His English teacher, Brother Kelly, used to have him read his stories to the class. Campbell (as John R. Campbell) submitted \"Ghostly Tales\" to \"numerous publishers\" including Tom Boardman publisher; Boardman rejected it as they did not publish ghost stories, but his rejection letter included encouragement to Campbell to keep writing. This collection of juvenilia was published thirty years later, as a special issue of \"Crypt of Cthulhu\" magazine titled \"Ghostly Tales: Crypt of Cthulhu\" 6, No 8, whole number 50, Michaelmas 1987, edited by Robert M. Price. It is of interest that, though the stories are mostly mainstream spectral lore, one story (\"The Hollow in the Woods\") can be considered a very early mythos yarn.\nAnother issue of this magazine \"Crypt of Cthulhu\" No 43 (Hallowmas 1983), titled \"The Tomb-Herd and Others\" collects various early stories, including some early drafts of tales later published revised in Campbell's first book, \"The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants\" (Arkham House, 1964). The manuscripts of Campbell's early tales are housed at the Local History Library of the Liverpool Public Libraries.\nThe influence of H. P. Lovecraft and \"The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants\".\nCampbell first encountered the works of H. P. Lovecraft at age eight (1954), via the story \"The Colour Out of Space\", which he found in the Groff Conklin anthology \"Strange Travels in Science Fiction\", and within the next few years read \"The Rats in the Walls\" and \"The Dunwich Horror\", encountered in the Wise and Fraser anthology \"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural\". At the age of twelve, Campbell attempted to write a novel titled \"Broken Moon\", influenced by Arthur Machen, but it petered out after fifty pages. By the age of 14, he discovered Lovecraft's \"Cry Horror!\", a British edition of the collection entitled \"The Lurking Fear\", and read it in one day, finding the fiction's sense of awesomeness as well as horror extraordinarily appealing. He had also read Arthur Machen's major horror stories by this age, and some works by John Dickson Carr, which led him to write, at 14 years old, a 100-page Carr pastiche (unfinished) titled \"Murder By Moonlight\". This piece was published in 2020 as \"The Enigma of the Flat Policeman\", including annotations from the adult author reflecting on his psychological state at the time of composition. \nOn leaving school at age sixteen, Campbell went to work in the Inland Revenue as a tax officer (1962\u201366). Campbell sold various early stories to editors including August Derleth and Robert A.W. Lowndes. His concept of what was possible in the Weird genre was highly influenced by Lovecraft for the next few years. In December 1961, Campbell completed the story \"The Church in High Street\" (previously titled \"The Tomb-Herd\") which he sent to August Derleth at Arkham House, an imprint singlehandedly responsible for preserving the legacy of H P Lovecraft. Derleth accepted the story in February 1962 and it became Campbell's first professionally published tale, appearing in the Derleth-edited anthology \"Dark Mind, Dark Heart\". Campbell wrote various other tales of the Cthulhu Mythos between 1961 and 1963. Derleth gave the young writer invaluable advice on improving his writing style (their correspondence has been published in a single volume from PS Publishing).\nForming his literary apprenticeship with stories modelled after Lovecraft's themes, Campbell's first collection, \"The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants\" (Arkham House, 1964), published when he was eighteen years old, collects his Lovecraftian pastiches to that date. Campbell has written, \"In 1964 I was several kinds of lucky to find a publisher, and one kind depended on my having written a Lovecraftian book for Arkham House, the only publisher likely even to have considered it and one of the very few then to be publishing horror.\" The title story of the collection introduces Campbell's invention of a tome of occult lore similar to Lovecraft's forbidden Necronomicon, \"The Revelations of Gla'aki\" (see Books of the Cthulhu Mythos).\nSevern Valley.\nThe Severn Valley is the setting of several fictional towns and other locations created by Campbell. Part of the Cthulhu Mythos started by Lovecraft, the fictional milieu is arguably the most detailed mythos setting outside of Lovecraft Country itself.\nIn his early writings, Campbell used the setting of Lovecraft's stories, in the fictional New England area of the Miskatonic River valley. At the suggestion of fellow Lovecraftian writer, August Derleth, he rewrote many of his earliest stories, which he had originally set in the Massachusetts locales of Arkham, Dunwich and Innsmouth, and moved them to English settings in and around the fictional Gloucestershire city of Brichester, near the River Severn, creating his own Severn Valley milieu for Lovecraftian horrors. The invented locale of Brichester is the main town of Campbell's Severn Valley, and was deeply influenced by Campbell's native Liverpool, and much of his later work is set in the real locales of Liverpool and the Merseyside area. The River Severn is an actual river in Wales and western England. Campbell's stories mention various real-world locales, including the Cotswold Hills, Berkeley, and the A38 road. These references place \"Campbell Country\" in the southern part of Gloucestershire, roughly between the cities of Gloucester and Bristol. This area is more correctly referred to as the Vale of Berkeley or the Severn Estuary; the real-world Severn Valley refers to an area around fifty miles (80\u00a0km) further north. His later work continued the focus on Liverpool; in particular, his 2005 novel \"Secret Stories\" (published in the U.S. in an abridged edition as \"Secret Story\" (2006) both exemplifies and satirizes Liverpudlian speech, characters, humour and culture, while \"Creatures of the Pool\" draws on the city's geography and history.\nInclusions.\nSome of his stories about the fictional Severn Valley can be found in the following anthologies and collections:\nInfluence.\nThe story \"Cold Print\" (1969) marked an end to Campbell's literary apprenticeship, taking the essence of Lovecraft out of the New England backwoods into a modern urban setting. Subsequently Campbell briefly disavowed Lovecraft, whilst working on the radically experimental tales which would be published as the collection \"Demons by Daylight.\" He later acknowledged Lovecraft's lasting influence, and his subsequent Cthulhu Mythos tales, collected in \"Cold Print\" (1985; expanded in 1993), confirm the transition from pastiche to homage, most notably in such tales as \"The Faces at Pine Dunes\" and the eerily surreal \"The Voice of the Beach\" (1982). Later work still seeks to \"ascend the cosmic peaks achieved by Lovecraft\", particularly the novel \"The Darkest Part of the Woods\" (2003), the novella \"The Last Revelation of Gla'aki\" (2013), and three novels that form his Brichester Mythos trilogy (2016\u201318).\nThe 1970s: \"Determined to be myself\": \"Demons by Daylight\" and early novels.\nWith his stories written between 1964 and 1968, beginning with \"The Reshaping of Rossiter\" (first draft of \"The Scar\"), \"A Garden at Night\" (first draft of \"Made in Goatswood\") and \"The Successor\" (first draft of \"Cold Print\"), Campbell set out to be as unlike Lovecraft as possible. Having discovered writers such as Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Aickman, Graham Greene, Iris Murdoch, William Burroughs and Henry Miller, and such influences as the French 'new novel', he became interested in expanding the stylistic possibilities of his work. He finished the collection that would become \"Demons by Daylight\" in 1968, but it would not see print until 1973. Meanwhile, from 1969 to 1973, he continued to write short stories in which he gradually developed his own voice and themes and left the influence of Lovecraft far behind. Campbell worked in the Liverpool Public Libraries as a library assistant (1966\u201373) and was acting librarian in charge (1971\u201373).\nIn 1969, he had written \"Lovecraft in Retrospect\", a violent diatribe against Lovecraft, for the fanzine \"Shadow\", \"condemning [Lovecraft's] work outright.\" However, in his 1985 book \"Cold Print\", which collects his Lovecraftian stories, Campbell disavowed the opinions expressed in the article, stating: \"I believe Lovecraft is one of the most important writers in the field\" and \"the first book of Lovecraft's I read made me into a writer.\" Around 1970, Campbell stopped using his first initial \"J.\" on his work, though a few stories earlier than this appeared as by \"Ramsey Campbell\", and a few after still saw print as by \"J. Ramsey Campbell\". Campbell later legally changed his name to remove the \"John\".\nAfter working four years in the tax office and seven years in public libraries, by 1973, Campbell became a fulltime writer, encouraged by the issuance by Arkham House of his second collection, \"Demons by Daylight\" (as by Ramsey Campbell). That collection had been due for publication in 1971, but was held back two years by the death of August Derleth. \"Demons by Daylight\" includes \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\", which uses Lovecraft's documentary narrative technique without slipping into parody of his writing style. Other tales, such as \"The End of a Summer's Day\" and \"Concussion\", show the emergence of Campbell's highly distinctive mature style, of which S. T. Joshi has written:\nCertainly much of the power of his work derives purely from his prose style, one of the most fluid, dense and evocative in all modern literature [...] His eye for the details and resonances of even the most mundane objects, and his ability to express them crisply and almost prose-poetically, give to his work at once a clarity and a dreamlike nebulousness that is difficult to describe but easy to sense.\nThe book's appearance induced T. E. D. Klein to write an extensive and highly positive review, \"Ramsey Campbell: An Appreciation\" in \"Nyctalops\" magazine, and critic S. T. Joshi has stated that:\nits [...] allusiveness of narration; careful, at times even obsessive focusing on the fleeting sensations and psychological processes of characters; an aggressively modern setting that allows commentary on social, cultural and political issues\"\u2014\"all conjoin to make \"Demons by Daylight\" perhaps the most important book of horror fiction since Lovecraft's \"The Outsider and Others\".\nCampbell has written that \"Having completed \"Demons by Daylight\" in 1968, I felt directionless, and it shows in quite a few of the subsequent tales.\" He wrote only four tales in 1970, and five stories in 1971. He has written that \"retrospect demonstrates how untimely my decision [to write fulltime] was. Kirby McCauley, now my agent, had to tell me that the market for short horror stories was very limited ... My solution was to lurch into science fiction as best I could. Little of it sold...\" Many of the science fiction tales are collected in \"Inconsequential Tales\" (2008); he also wrote the novella \"Medusa\" (1973) and the short story \"Slow\" (collected in \"Told by the Dead\"), but has stated that his science fiction \"tried to deal with Themes, too consciously, I feel\".\nOutside the world of horror, he wrote a series of fantasy stories starring Ryre the Swordsman, who battles enemies on an alien world called Tond. Initially published in various anthologies, these stories were finally gathered in the collection \"Far Away &amp; Never\" (Necronomicon Press, July 1996). In 1976 he 'completed' three of Robert E. Howard's unfinished Solomon Kane stories, \"Hawk of Basti\", \"The Castle of the Devil\" and \"The Children of Asshur\" (published in 1978 and 1979). By the time Arkham House published his second hardcover collection of horror stories, \"The Height of the Scream\" (1976), he was beginning to be seen as one of the major modern writers of horror.\n1976 also saw the publication of Campbell's first novel, \"The Doll Who Ate His Mother\", which immediately drew acclaim from figures such as Fritz Leiber and T.E.D. Klein. In this and \"The Face that Must Die\" (1979), Campbell began to fully explore the enigma of evil, touching on the psychological themes of possession, madness and alienation which feature in many of his subsequent novels. He also continued to write short stories, mainly supernatural, receiving the World Fantasy Award for \"The Chimney\" (1977) and \"Mackintosh Willy\" (1980).\nCampbell has been a lifelong enthusiast of film; early stories such as \"The Reshaping of Rossiter\" (1964; an early version of \"The Scar\") show the influence of directors such as Alain Resnais, and as early as 1969 Campbell had become the film reviewer for BBC Radio Merseyside. He worked in Merseyside on the Friday edition of \"Breakfast\" and less frequently on Claire Hamilton's Sunday show. A longer version of his Merseyside reviews appeared on the Radio Merseyside website, where he also reviewed DVDs. His love of old movies features prominently in two of Campbell's later novels, \"Ancient Images\" and \"The Grin of the Dark\".\nCampbell wrote novelisations and introductions for a series of novelisations of Universal horror films. The series has a rather complex publishing history. They were published in paperback in 1977 in the US, with uniform packaging, by Berkley Medallion Books as \"The Universal Horror Library\". All six of the Berkley editions were published under the house name 'Carl Dreadstone'; all six of the US editions featured stills from the relevant films. It is believed this set was made available as boxed set in slipcase, as well as sold individually. Only three of the novels were actually written by Campbell, though he contributed introductions to all six volumes. No US hardcover edition of the series is known. Campbell's contributions to the series were \"Bride of Frankenstein\", \"Dracula's Daughter\" and \"The Wolfman\", published as Carl Dreadstone. Three further novelisations which appeared under this house name were not by Campbell but written by other authors. Walter Harris wrote two of the novels: \"Werewolf of London\" and \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". The author of the sixth Dreadstone (\"The Mummy\") remains unknown. UK editions followed\u2014in 1978, Universal Books (a paperback division of W. H. Allen Ltd) published \"The Bride of Frankenstein\" (by Campbell) together with Harris's \"The Werewolf of London\" and the (unknown author) \"The Mummy\" under the 'Carl Dreadstone' house name, with similar packaging under the title 'The Classic Library of Horror'. A further two years would elapse before the rest of the series was issued in the UK. The last three of the series were issued by Star Books (a W. H. Allen imprint) in 1980 (with different packaging from the 1978 titles) and these three appeared under a different house-name\u2014'E. K. Leyton'. These were Campbell's remaining two novels of the series, \"Dracula's Daughter\" and \"The Wolfman\", together with Harris's \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". At least one hardcover omnibus was published, presumably prior to the UK paperbacks: \"The Classic Library of Horror Omnibus\u2014The Mummy &amp; The Werewolf of London\" (London: Allan Wingate, 1978). Its existence suggests there may have been two companion hardcover omnibuses collecting the balance of the series (if this were the case they would contain the Campbell-authored novels), but their existence/issuance is uncertain. All six of the UK paperbacks and the hardcover omnibus omitted the film stills which appeared in the original US editions.\n1979 saw the publication of the non-supernatural thriller \"The Face That Must Die\", the story of a homophobic serial killer told largely from the killer's point of view. Initially considered by numerous publishers, including Campbell's British publisher Thomas Tessier at Millington Books, as too grim to publish, it is regarded by many critics as one of Campbell's finest works. The novel was cut by Star Books, who first issued it in a paperback edition in 1979; it was not issued complete until the US Scream Press edition of 1983.\nThe 1980s: \"The Parasite\" to \"Ancient Images\".\nCampbell became even more prolific during the 1980s, issuing at least eight novels (of which six won awards) and three short story collections. He has written that after moving away from Lovecraft's influence he was \"determined to sound like myself\" but also that \"The Chicago and San Francisco tales of Fritz Leiber were now my models in various ways. I wanted to achieve that sense of supernatural terror which derives from the everyday urban landscape rather than invading it, and I greatly admired\u2014still do\u2014how Fritz wrote thoroughly contemporary weird tales which were nevertheless rooted in the best traditions of the field, and which drew some of their strength from uniting British and American influences.\"\nIn 1981, Stephen King published a semi-autobiographical overview of the horror field, \"Danse Macabre.\" In a chapter focusing on 20th century practitioners, King devoted a section to Campbell's fiction, alongside that of Ray Bradbury, Shirley Jackson, Peter Straub, Richard Matheson, Jack Finney and others. On the basis of Campbell's earliest work, especially \"The Doll Who Ate His Mother\", King argued that the author's strength lies in his hallucinogenic prose and edgy psychology, the way his characters view the world and how this affects readers:\nIn a Campbell novel or story, one seems to view the world through the thin and shifting perceptual haze of an LSD trip that is just ending ... or just beginning. The polish of his writing and his mannered turns of phrase and image make him seem something like the genre's Joyce Carol Oates [...] as when journeying on LSD, there is something chilly and faintly schizophrenic in the way his characters see things ... and in the things they see [...] Good stuff. But strange; so uniquely Campbell that it might as well be trademarked.\nKing also singled out one of Campbell's early short stories for particular praise: \"'The Companion' may be the best horror tale to be written in the English language in thirty years; it is surely one of the half a dozen or so which will still be in print and commonly read a hundred years from now.\" This story appeared in Campbell's 1982 collection, \"Dark Companions\", alongside other tales from that period commonly cited as early classics: \"The Chimney\", \"Mackintosh Willy\", and \"Call First\".\nStarting with \"The Parasite\" (1980; published in the US with a different ending as \"To Wake the Dead\"), and continuing throughout much of the decade, Campbell's full-length novels were consciously aimed at a more commercial audience. It features a point of view of a female protagonist who becomes embroiled in occult practices (with Lovecraftian undertones). In \"The Nameless\" (1981), also told from the point of view of a woman, a child goes missing and returns only years later, affiliated to a nefarious organisation. \"Obsession\" (1982) involves a group of childhood friends making a wish apiece concerning their futures, the manifestations tormenting them in later life; however, as is common in Campbell's work involving aberrant mental states, it is not entirely apparent that these events have a supernatural origin. In \"Incarnate\" (1983), the boundaries between dream and reality are gradually broken down as a group of characters involved in a psychological experiment begin to experience fragmentation in their everyday lives (the novel was written during the \"terrible nightmare year\" of Campbell's mother's last mental breakdown).\nIn \"The Claw\" (1983; originally published under the pseudonym Jay Ramsey) a family man is tempted by an African talisman to devour his own daughter and in \"The Hungry Moon\" (1986) a primordial moon entity stokes the religious hysteria of a quiet community. The latter book is a favourite among fans and a multi-character 'small town' horror story along the lines of similar work in this period, a subgenre arguably 'pump-primed' by the likes of Stephen King's \"'Salem's Lot\". In characteristically honest and self-critical afterwords, Campbell has claimed that, despite its popularity, \"The Hungry Moon,\" along with the similarly commercial \"The Parasite\" and, to a lesser degree, \"The Claw\", are among the least successful of his works from this period, by turns awkwardly structured, containing too many ideas, and/or tending towards explicit violence. In contrast Campbell has stated his pride that \"The Influence\" (1988) and \"Ancient Images\" (1989) are subtler, tightly plotted novels of supernatural menace, each with (predominantly) female central characters and generating unease through the author's trademark suggestiveness and surreal imagery. In 1987, Campbell published \"Scared Stiff\", a collection of \"sex and horror\" short stories.\nIn the early 1980s Campbell had crossed paths a number of time in Liverpool at cinemas and various parties with a young Liverpool writer named Clive Barker, who had been working around London as a playwright. Barker asked Campbell if he knew any markets for short stories and eventually asked him to look over a soon-to-be-published manuscript and the contract he had been offered for it. Campbell says \"My jaw dropped when I looked at the manuscript\u2014it turned out to be the \"Books of Blood\".\" Campbell wrote the introduction to the first edition.\nCampbell contributed numerous articles on horror cinema to \"The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural\" (1986).\nThe 1990s: \"Midnight Sun\" to \"The Last Voice They Hear\".\nThe 1990s again saw Campbell publish eight novels, though in the second half of this decade he moved away from traditional horror to explore crime and tales of social alienation. Four of this decade's novels won awards.\nIn \"Midnight Sun\" (1990), an alien entity apparently seeks entry to the world through the mind of a children's writer. In its fusion of horror with awe, \"Midnight Sun\" shows the influence of Algernon Blackwood and Arthur Machen as well as Lovecraft. It is one that many enthusiasts single out as a highlight of this stage of his career. \"Needing Ghosts\" (1990), a novella, is a nightmarish work that blends the horrific and the comic; Campbell himself has described the composition of this piece as unique among his work in that it \"felt like dreaming on the page\" and was written relatively quickly without technical or structural challenges.\nA sympathetic serial murderer appears in the black comedy \"The Count of Eleven\" (1991), which displays Campbell's gift for word play, and which the author has said is disturbing \"because it doesn't stop being funny when you think it should\". A review at the time suggested that the central character might be played in a film by Stan Laurel, an observation that delighted Campbell, who is a great admirer of Laurel and Hardy. Other novels of this decade include \"The Long Lost\" (1993), in which a sin-eater is discovered by a couple holidaying in Wales and brought home ostensibly as a relative, with considerable impact on a community. A haunted house novel called \"The House on Nazareth Hill\" (1996), combining the author's M R Jamesian suggestiveness with an increasingly idiosyncratic prose style, is a study of familial psychology and the unchanging nature of social processes, particularly those relating to the young's quest for independence and the threat this presents to others.\nCampbell had earlier published a non-supernatural novel called \"The One Safe Place\" (1995), which uses a highly charged thriller narrative to examine social problems such as the deprivation and abuse of children, and in 1998 he turned away for a more sustained period from the supernatural work with which he was associated. By this time, horror had become commercially less successful and publishers were taking fewer chances on publishing such material, all of which encouraged Campbell to write a number of crimes novels. The first, \"The Last Voice They Hear\" (1998), is a tightly plotted thriller which ranges back and forth in time as two brothers become engaged in a cat-and-mouse game redolent of earlier events in their lives. Although written \"under protest\", Campbell came to think of the book, during composition, as bearing his own stamp, and his next two novels were also non-supernatural.\nIn this decade Campbell issued four short story collections, including, in 1993, the 30-year career retrospective \"\", published by Campbell's original publisher, Arkham House. This volume, illustrated by Jeff K. Potter, is not a comprehensive collection of all the stories Campbell had published in those thirty years, rather 39 tales which Campbell and his editor Jim Turner thought representative. Drawing on material across his career to that date, it is considered a good entry point for readers unfamiliar with his work. \"Waking Nightmares\" (1991), \"Strange Things and Stranger Places\" (1993), and \"Ghosts and Grisly Things\" (1998) collect much of Campbell's short fiction from this period. Two of this decade's short story collections won awards.\nIn 1999, Campbell was awarded both the Grand Master Award from the World Horror Convention and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Horror Writers Association.\nThe 2000s: \"Silent Children\" to \"Creatures of the Pool\".\nIn the \"noughties\", Campbell continued his prolific output, publishing multiple novels, along with three short story collections. He reviewed films and DVDs weekly for BBC Radio Merseyside until 2007, and began to contribute a monthly film column, \"Ramsey's Ramblings\", for \"Video Watchdog\" magazine. In 2002, PS Publishing issued a collection of Campbell's essays on horror and other areas of interest: \"Ramsey Campbell, Probably\" (this volume was expanded to include further material in a 2014 reprint). The collection includes book reviews, film reviews, autobiographical writings and other nonfiction, along with reminiscences and appreciations of authors such as John Brunner, Bob Shaw and K. W. Jeter, and an extensive, negative critique of Shaun Hutson's \"Heathen\", parodying Hutson's style.\nFollowing the publication of two more crime novels\u2014\"Silent Children\" (2000), the story of an eccentric child killer; and \"Pact of the Fathers\" (2001), which draws on arcane religious practices\u2014Campbell returned to the supernatural and otherworldly. \"The Darkest Part of the Woods\" (2003) successfully evokes the cosmic terrors of H P Lovecraft and was the first of Campbell's work published by PS Publishing; the author would go on to enjoy a long-term relationship with the UK imprint, granting first print rights to most new work. Having spent a number of months working full-time in a Borders store, Campbell wrote \"The Overnight\" (2004), about bookshop staff trapped in their hellish workplace during an overnight shift. In \"Secret Stories\" (2005; abridged US edition, \"Secret Story\", 2006) Campbell returned to the crime genre with a blackly comic study of a serial killer whose written accounts of his crimes inadvertently win a fiction competition, resulting in further murders.\n\"The Grin of the Dark\" (2007) draws on Campbell's interest in the history of cinema, as a character seeks material relating to a silent film comedian by the name of Tubby Thackeray. The novel also explores the impact of the internet on human consciousness. The author, often critical of his own output, continues to cite this novel as one with which he remains pleased. \"Thieving Fear\" (2008) and \"The Creatures of the Pool\" (2009) use locations in and around the author's native Liverpool to eerie effect.\n\"Told by the Dead\" (2003) and \"Just Behind You\" (2009) collected Campbell's short fiction, while \"Inconsequential Tales\" (2008), collecting a number of unpublished stories, documents his early evolution as a stylist.\nIn 2007, Campbell was awarded the Living Legend Award from the International Horror Guild.\nThe 2010: \"The Seven Days of Cain\" to the \"Brichester Mythos Trilogy\".\nAfter 2010, Campbell continued to publish at least a book a year, including a collection of letters from his early career between himself and his first mentor August Derleth (\"Letters to Arkham: The Letters of Ramsey Campbell and August Derleth, 1961-1971\", ed. S. T. Joshi, 2014) .\nBoth \"The Seven Days of Cain\" (2010) and \"Think Yourself Lucky\" (2014) explore use of the internet, as characters originally appearing online start to impact upon the real world with disconcerting effects. In 2010, Campbell was commissioned to write the novelisation of the movie \"Solomon Kane,\" which was based on the swords and sorcery stories of Robert E. Howard (some of which Campbell had completed in his early career)\".\" \"Ghosts Know\" (2011), one of the author's few latter-day non-supernatural excursions (on the surface, at least), explores the mendacity of stage mediums/psychics in the context of a missing person story; it also showcases a later development in the Campbell's work, social comedy and confusions inherent in everyday communication. \"The Kind Folk\" (2012) is a delicately written evocation of fairy folk, told in the modern day.\nIn 2013, \"Holes for Faces\", a further collection of short fiction appeared, gathering together his work from the 2000s. During the same period, PS Publishing issued two novellas by Campbell: \"The Last Revelation of Gla'aki\" (2013) and \"The Pretence\" (2013). A third novella appeared in 2016 entitled \"The Booking,\" from Dark Regions Press. These were the first novellas Campbell had written since 1990's \"Needing Ghosts\". 2015 saw the release of \"Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach\", one of Campbell's few novels set outside the UK; a family holiday on a Greek island involves communion with a familiar supernatural character from literature. Campbell's collection of playful limericks based on famous horror works of fiction appeared in 2016: \"Limericks of the Alarming and Phantasmal.\"\n\"The Searching Dead\" (2016) was the first novel in a trilogy of H P Lovecraft-influenced works which, like the novella \"The Last Revelation of Gla'aki,\" revisits themes from Campbell's early work. Described by the author as his \"Brichester Mythos trilogy\", the three-book series, including \"Born to the Dark\" (2017) and \"The Way of the Worm\" (2018), documents a character's engagement with a nefarious organisation over three time periods (1950s, 1980s, 2010s) and evokes a cosmic entity by the name of Daoloth. The trilogy draws together multiple themes that have preoccupied the author during his whole career: the cosmic, family, scapegoating, the vulnerability of children, and the seductiveness of totalising belief systems.\nA new short story collection, \"By the Light of my Skull,\" was also released in 2018, some stories deal with older age. \"Visions from Brichester\" (2017) collected all of the author's Lovecraftian short fiction not originally published in \"The Inhabitant of the Lake\". PS Publishing issued the first of a two-volume retrospective focused on Campbell's most representative short fiction across his entire career: \"The Companion &amp; Other Phantasmagorical Stories\" (2019).\nIn 2015, Campbell received the World Fantasy Award's Life Award, and in 2017, in Spain, he was awarded the Premio Sheridan Le Fanu for his career achievements. In 2015, the author received an Honorary Fellowship from John Moores University, Liverpool, for \"outstanding services to literature\".\nThe 2020s: \"The Wise Friend\" to present.\n\"The Wise Friend\" was published in spring 2020 by new publisher Flame Tree Press (which has also reissued earlier Campbell novels in hardcover, paperback, ebook, and audiobook). Among the quietest of the author's work, this novel draws on folk horror as a father seeks to protect his son who has become involved with a legacy with occult overtones. A new novella, \"The Enigma of the Flat Policeman,\" part of Borderlands Press's Little Book series (in this case, \"A Little Green Book of Grins &amp; Gravity\"), was released in March 2020. It consists of an incomplete short detective novel the author wrote aged 14 in imitation of John Dickson Carr, with annotations exploring the adult author's perceptions of his younger self's psychological state at the time of composition. The second volume of PS Publishing's career retrospective, \"The Retrospective &amp; Other Phantasmagorical Stories,\" was published in late 2020. Another Campbell career retrospective (with a different selection of tales) appeared in 2020 from Centipede Press as part of their \"Masters of the Weird Tale\" series, also issued in two volumes.\nIn July 2021, Flame Tree Press released \"Somebody's Voice\", a non-supernatural thriller novel which focuses on themes of identity, memory, and mental disintegration; after an author ghost-writes a memoir, his grip on reality slides when the truth turns out to be less assured than he was led to believe. A third volume in PS Publishing's career retrospective series, \"Needing Ghosts &amp; Other Novellas\", was published in 2021; the book collects all of the author's novellas to date and includes a new novella, \"The Village Killings\". Also in 2021, a new edition of the author's sword and sorcery collection \"Far Away and Never\" was published (by DMR Books), including an extra story. In the same year, Dark Moon Books published a Campbell edition of their primer series (\"Exploring Dark Fiction\" \"#6: A Primer to Ramsey Campbell,\" which includes a new short story), while PS Publishing also released a new expanded edition of the author's collected essays, \"Ramsey Campbell, Certainly.\" In 2023, PS Publishing published a new short story collection by Campbell called \"Fearful Implications,\" along with his personal tribute to The Third Stooges, \"Six Stooges and Counting\". \nCampbell's 2022 novel \"Fellstones\" is oriented around the author's love of classical music and is squarely in the tradition of British folk horror, as a young man suffers in later life unwanted attention from a family that adopted him in childhood and that still lives in a village occupied by seven standing stones; the novel is a return to themes of cosmicism. \"The Lonely Lands\" (2023) explores themes of the afterlife as a man loses his wife to Covid and experiences communications from her after death. But other less welcome people also return and he must do what he can to protect her from them. \"The Incubations\" (2024) focuses on post-WWII Anglo-German relations as young man who had a childhood penfriend in Germany gets involved in a myth that infects his homecoming after a trip abroad. Campbell has recently completed a new novel entitled \"An Echo of Children\" and is working on another called \"The Ancestral\".\nStyle and themes.\nCampbell's style is characterised by an idiosyncratic use of language. His fictional worlds feel unusual, threatening, and dislocated. Such an approach prompted Peter Straub to write in a blurb for one of Campbell's early novels: \"Horrors in his fiction are never merely invented, they are felt and experienced, and affect the reader for days afterward.\" The horrors Campbell evokes are commonly suggested to the reader by ambiguous allusions to events his characters are not always mindful of. In this regard, his approach is similar to that of M. R. James. Indeed, Campbell celebrates James's concentrated prose, choice of detail, and ability to hint at disquieting material much larger than what is explicitly revealed. Campbell has described much of his own later work as \"comedies of paranoia\", as his characters experience an existential bewilderment that borders on the absurd.\nCampbell himself has cited the following themes as recurrent in his work: \"the vulnerability of children, the willingness of people to espouse a belief system that denies them the right to question, and the growing tendency to create scapegoats for the ills of the world.\" However, his work has addressed a wide range of issues, including censorship (e.g., \"The One Safe Place\", 1995), the impact of the internet on consciousness (e.g., \"The Grin of the Dark\", 2007; \"The Seven Days of Cain\", 2010; \"Think Yourself Lucky\", 2014), corporation-led consumerism (the recurrence of a global organisation called Frugo in his later work, especially \"The Overnight\", 2004, and \"Thieving Fear\", 2008), fatherhood (\"The House on Nazareth Hill\", 1996), and older age (\"Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach\", 2015). Abnormal human psychology is also a major recurring theme in Campbell's work (e.g., \"The Face That Must Die\", 1979; \"The Count of Eleven\", 1991; \"The Last Voice They Hear\", 1998; \"Secret Stories\", 2005; \"Somebody's Voice\", 2021).\nTributes.\nFour tribute anthologies of stories inspired by Campbell's work have been released to date. The first was the 1995 anthology \"Made in Goatswood\" (Chaosium, edited by Scott David Aniolowski), which includes a story by Campbell himself. \"The Children of Gla'aki\" (2016, Dark Regions Press, edited by Brian M. Sammons and Glynn Owen Barrass) consists of stories focused on one of Campbell's Lovecraftian creations, and \"Darker Companions\" (2017, PS Publishing, edited by Joe Pulver and Scott David Aniolowski) contains tales inspired by the author's vision and prose. In Spain, a further tribute anthology appeared entitled \"El Horror Que Vino del Sur: Un Tributo Latino a Ramsey Campbell Y Al Circulo de Lovecraft\" (2018, Bookbaby). All four books demonstrate Campbell's influence in the field on both established and newer writers. In 2021, \"Phantasmagoria\" magazine published a special edition (#4) devoted to Campbell\"s work, boasting many critiques and tributes from his peers.\nIn 2012, Campbell attracted a spoof collection of horror stories edited by fellow writer Rhys Hughes. Hughes contributed a good deal of the fictional content, including the pieces focused on an author called Lamblake Heinz, clearly a parody of Campbell (although Hughes has admitted elsewhere that he has read little if any of Campbell's work).\nFilms.\nThree of Campbell's novels have been adapted into films to date, all in Spain. Jaume Balaguer\u00f3's \"The Nameless\" (in Spanish \"Los Sin Nombre\"; in Catalan \"Els sense nom\"), based on the novel of the same name, takes some liberties with the source material's plot but captures its pungent atmosphere. Paco Plaza's \"Second Name\" (\"El Segundo Nombre\" in Spanish) based on the novel \"The Pact of the Fathers\", similarly evokes Campbell's paranoiac fictional world, its story rooted in the world of arcane religious practices. Denis Rovira van Boekholt's \"The Influence\" (\"La Influencia\" in Spanish), based on the Campbell novel of the same name and quite faithful (except for changes in the final third), was released in 2019 and was later picked up by Netflix to stream. In 2025, a TV series based on \"The Nameless\" was released under the stewardship of Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Pau Freixas.\nBooks edited.\nCampbell has edited a number of anthologies, including \"New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos\" (1980); \"New Terrors\" and \"New Terrors II\", a groundbreaking two-volume anthology series; and (with Stephen Jones) the first five volumes of the annual \"Best New Horror\" series (1990\u20131994). His 1992 anthology \"Uncanny Banquet\" was notable for including the first ever reprint of the obscure 1914 horror novel \"The Hole of the Pit\" by Adrian Ross. \"The Gruesome Book\" was a paperback anthology of horror tales for children. Campbell is extremely well-read in the horror field, and some of his own literary influences are demonstrated by his selections for the 1988 anthology \"Fine Frights: Stories That Scared Me\". In 2002 he edited a collection of fiction in the tradition of M. R. James, entitled \"Meddling with Ghosts\". His 2003 anthology \"Gathering the Bones\" (co-edited with Dennis Etchison and Jack Dann) draws together tales from the UK, US, and Australia. \"The Folio Book of Horror Stories\" (2018), the first collection Campbell had edited in 15 years, draws together classic tales from the last 200 years.\nPersonal life.\nCampbell married Jenny Chandler, daughter of A. Bertram Chandler, on 1 January 1971. He commonly describes his wife as the \"best part\" of himself. At various stages of his career\u2014for instance, when he first decided to write on a full-time basis\u2014he received support from Jenny, who worked as a teacher. They have two children, Tamsin (born 1978) and Matthew (born 1981). Campbell is a life-long resident of Merseyside. He is fond of fine dining, travel, and classical music. He is very active as a public speaker and greatly enjoys giving readings of his fiction at literary events. Campbell is eloquent and jolly (a persona he self-effacingly describes as a \"facade\"), and he has claimed that if he hadn't become a horror writer, he might have been a stand-up comedian.\nIn response to an interview question about religion, Campbell has stated, \"As I got older I'm more Agnostic [...] [a] little religious perspective is no bad thing; I have no set belief.\" He added, \"I don't think there is any supernatural force out there to make you do stuff.\" When asked whether he believes in the supernatural he claims to have experienced episodes that might be described as involving such activity; however, he remains noncommittal on this issue, stating that he writes about such material because he finds it \"imaginatively appealing\" and to \"repay\" the genre for many treasured reading experiences. Campbell is fiercely opposed to censorship, claiming that the suppression of contentious material can result in it returning in an even worse form. He has been very generous in support of newer writers, frequently writing introductions to their work.\nFor many years Campbell was the President of the British Fantasy Society.\nLiterary Awards.\nAmong Ramsay Campbell's trove of awards, he's a multiple winner &amp; nominee of the British Fantasy Award's \"August Derleth Award\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It serves the capital city of Moscow and the neighbouring cities of Krasnogorsk, Reutov, Lyubertsy, and Kotelniki. Opened in 1935 with one line and 13 stations, it was the first underground railway system in the Soviet Union.\nAs of December 2024[ [update]], the Moscow Metro has 300 stations and of routes, making it the 8th-longest in the world, the longest in Europe and the longest outside China. It is also the only system in Russia with two circle lines. The system is mostly underground, with the deepest section underground at the Park Pobedy station, one of the world's deepest underground stations. It is the busiest metro system in Europe, the busiest in the world outside Asia, and is considered a tourist attraction in itself, thanks to its lavish interior decoration. \nThe Moscow Metro is a world leader in the frequency of train traffic, as intervals during peak hours often do not exceed 90 seconds. In February 2023, Moscow was the first in the world to reduce the intervals of metro trains to 80 seconds.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName.\nThe full legal name of the metro has been Moscow Order of Lenin and Order of the Red Banner of Labor V. I. Lenin Metro () since 1955. This is usually shortened to V. I. Lenin Metro (). This shorter official name appears on many stations. Although there were proposals to remove Lenin from the official name, it still stands. During the 1990s and 2000s, Lenin's name was excluded from the signage on newly built and reconstructed stations. In 2016, a Metro representative stated that Lenin's name would remain on station name plates as it aligns with the official name of the company, unchanged since the Soviet era.\nThe first official name of the metro was L. M. Kaganovich Metro () after Lazar Kaganovich (see \"History\" section). However, when the Metro was awarded the Order of Lenin, it was officially renamed Moscow Order of Lenin L. M. Kaganovich Metro () in 1947. When the metro was renamed in 1955, the Okhotny Ryad station was renamed as \"Imeni Kaganovicha\" in honor of Lazar Kaganovich. In 1957, the original \"Okhotny Ryad\" name of the station was reinstated.\nLogo.\nThe first line of the Moscow Metro was launched in 1935, complete with the first logo, the capital M paired with the text \"\u041c\u0415\u0422\u0420\u041e\". There is no accurate information about the author of the logo, so it is often attributed to the architects of the first stations \u2013 Samuil Kravets, Ivan Taranov and Nadezhda Bykova. At the opening in 1935, the M letter on the logo had no definite shape.\nIn 2014, the Moscow Metro adopted a standardized logo of the network as part of a broader rebranding of the Moscow Transport.\nOperations.\nThe Moscow Metro, a state-owned enterprise, is long and consists of 15 lines and 263 stations organized in a spoke-hub distribution paradigm, with the majority of rail lines running radially from the centre of Moscow to the outlying areas. The Koltsevaya Line (line 5) forms a long circle which enables passenger travel between these diameters, and the new Moscow Central Circle (line 14) and even newer Bolshaya Koltsevaya line (line 11) form a and long circles respectively that serve a similar purpose on middle periphery. Most stations and lines are underground, but some lines have at-grade and elevated sections; the Filyovskaya Line, Butovskaya Line and the Central Circle Line are the three lines that are at grade or mostly at grade.\nThe Moscow Metro uses , like other Russian railways, and an underrunning third rail with a supply of 825 Volts DC, except line 14, which being directly connected to the mainlines with 3000V DC overhead lines, as is typical. The average distance between stations is ; the shortest ( long) section is between Delovoy Tsentr and Moskva-City, and the longest ( long) is between Krylatskoye and Strogino. Long distances between stations have the positive effect of a high cruising speed of .\nThe Moscow Metro opens at 05:25 and closes at 01:00. The exact opening time varies at different stations according to the arrival of the first train, but all stations simultaneously close their entrances at 01:00 for maintenance, and so do transfer corridors. The minimum interval between trains is 90 seconds during the morning and evening rush hours.\nAs of 2017, the system had an average daily ridership of 6.99 million passengers. Peak daily ridership of 9.71 million was recorded on 26 December 2014.\nFree Wi-Fi has been available on all lines of the Moscow Metro since 2 December 2014.\nNetwork.\nLines.\nEach line is identified by a name, an alphanumeric index (usually consisting of just a number, and sometimes a letter suffix), and a colour. The colour assigned to each line is its colloquial identifier, except for the nondescript greens and blues assigned to the Bolshaya Koltsevaya, the Butovskaya and Troitskaya lines (lines 11, 12, and 16, respectively). The upcoming station is announced by a male voice on inbound trains to the city center (on the Circle line and the Bolshaya Koltsevaya Line, the clockwise trains), and by a female voice on outbound trains (anti-clockwise trains on the Circle line and the Bolshaya Koltsevaya Line).\nThe metro used to have a connection to the former Moscow Monorail, a , six-station monorail line between Timiryazevskaya and VDNKh which opened in \"excursion mode\" (i. e. as a low-frequency service used primarily by tourists) in November 2004 and started providing regular passenger services in January 2008. Since 2017 the monorail has been switched into \"excursion mode\" with less frequent trains, before being shut down on 27 June 2025.\n\"Note: Line 13 is the former Moscow Monorail that was disestablished in 2025. The lines are still numbered as if the line were there.\"\nAlso, from 11 August 1969 to 26 October 2019, the Moscow Metro included Kakhovskaya line long with 3 stations, which closed for a long reconstruction. On 7 December 2021, Kakhovskaya is reopened after reconstruction as part of the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line. The renewed Varshavskaya and Kashirskaya stations reopened as part of the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line, which became fully functional on 1 March 2023. Its new stations included Pechatniki, Nagatinsky Zaton and Klenovy Bulvar.\nHistory.\nThe first plans for a metro system in Moscow date back to the Russian Empire but were postponed by World War I, the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of .\nThe first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by Lazar Kaganovich, along with his project managers (notably Ivan M. Kuznetsov and, later, Isaac Y. Segal) in the 1930s\u20131950s, and the Metro was named after him until 1955 \"()\". The Moscow Metro construction engineers consulted with their counterparts from the London Underground, the world's oldest metro system, in 1936: British architect Charles Holden and administrator Frank Pick had been working on the station developments of the Piccadilly Line extension, and Soviet delegates to London were impressed by Holden's thoroughly modern redeployment of classical elements and use of high-quality materials for the circular ticket hall of Piccadilly Circus, and so engaged Pick and Holden as advisors to Moscow's metro system. Partly because of this connection, the design of Gants Hill tube station, which was completed in 1947, is reminiscent of a Moscow Metro station. Indeed, Holden's homage to Moscow has been described as a gesture of gratitude for the USSR's helpful role in The Second World War.\nSoviet workers did the labour and the art work, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from London Underground. The British called for tunnelling instead of the \"cut-and-cover\" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, the routes and the design of the rolling stock. The paranoia of the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage because they gained an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company (Metrovick) were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.\nFirst four stages of construction.\nThe first line was opened to the public on 15 May 1935 at 07:00 am. It was long and included 13 stations. The day was celebrated as a technological and ideological victory for socialism (and, by extension, Stalinism). The designers consulted with employees of the London Underground during the initial planning phase, and much of the engineering design work was done by British engineers. \nAn estimated 285,000 people rode the Metro at its debut, and its design was greeted with pride; street celebrations included parades, plays and concerts. The Bolshoi Theatre presented a choral performance by 2,200 Metro workers; 55,000 colored posters (lauding the Metro as the busiest and fastest in the world) and 25,000 copies of \"Songs of the Joyous Metro Conquerors\" were distributed. The Moscow Metro averaged and had a top speed of . In comparison, New York City Subway trains averaged a slower and had a top speed of . While the celebration was an expression of popular joy it was also an effective propaganda display, legitimizing the Metro and declaring it a success.\nThe initial line connected Sokolniki to Okhotny Ryad then branching to Park Kultury and Smolenskaya. The latter branch was extended westwards to a new station (Kiyevskaya) in March 1937, the first Metro line crossing the Moskva River over the Smolensky Metro Bridge.\nThe second stage was completed before the war. In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the Kurskaya station (now the dark-blue Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line). In September 1938, the Gorkovskaya Line opened between Sokol and Teatralnaya. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first deep-level column station Mayakovskaya was built at the same time.\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during World War II, and two Metro sections were put into service; Teatralnaya\u2013Avtozavodskaya (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and Kurskaya\u2013Partizanskaya (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the Siege of Moscow in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the Council of Ministers moved its offices to the Mayakovskaya platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The Chistiye Prudy station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the Koltsevaya Line, a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from Ploshchad Revolyutsii to Kievskaya and a surface extension to Pervomaiskaya during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The Koltsevaya Line was first planned as a line running under the Garden Ring, a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from Park Kultury to Kurskaya (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013Belorusskaya), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\nStalinist ideals in Metro's history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935, it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system (as opposed to horse-carried barrows still widely used in 1930s Moscow). It also became the prototype, the vision for future Soviet large-scale technologies. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus\" (Soviet man). The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u00a0\u2013 a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity. \nThe Metro was also iconic for showcasing Socialist Realism in public art. The method was influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Lenin's favorite 19th-century nihilist, who stated that \"art is no useful unless it serves politics\". This maxim sums up the reasons why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology: any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected.\n\"Bright future\" and literal brightness in the Metro of Moscow.\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied \"svet\" (literally \"light\", figuratively \"radiance\" or \"brilliance\") and \"svetloe budushchee\" (a well-lit/radiant/bright future). With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".\nThis palatial underground environment reminded Metro users their taxes were spent on materializing \"bright future\"; also, the design was useful for demonstrating the extra structural strength of the underground works (as in Metro doubling as bunkers, bomb shelters).\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the \"Metrostroi\" (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop. Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form. His team experimented with different materials (most often cast bronze, aluminum, sheet brass, steel, and milk glass) and methods to optimize the technology. Damsky's discourse on \"Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950\" describes in detail the epic chandeliers installed in the Taganskaya Station and the Kaluzhskaia station (\"Oktyabrskaya\" nowadays, not to be confused with contemporary \"Kaluzhskaya\" station on line 6). The work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with the idea of \"bright\" future.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Oktyabrskaya Station (originally named Kaluzhskaya) was designed by the architect [Leonid] Poliakov. Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Polyakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.\nIndustrialization.\nStalin's first five-year plan (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and resource distribution that kept up the pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough steel to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's second five-year plan. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933. The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.\nMobilization.\nThe Communist Party had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during World War II. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was Lazar Kaganovich. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment. He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the Palace of the Soviets: failure.\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the northern Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East\u2014\u200a\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The \"Metrostroi\" (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of \"Udarnik metrostroia\" (\"Metrostroi Shock Worker\", its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the Komsomol generation because of its strength and youth.\nLater Soviet stations.\n\"Fifth stage\" set of stations.\nThe beginning of the Cold War led to the construction of a deep section of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between Ploshchad Revolyutsii and Kiyevskaya were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the Filyovskaya Line. The stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as proper nuclear shelters.\nIn the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\nNikita Khrushchev's era of cost cutting.\nDuring the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s, the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was decisively rejected on the orders of Nikita Khrushchev. He had a preference for a utilitarian \"minimalism\"-like approach to design, similar to Brutalism style. The idea behind the rejection was similar to one used to create Khrushchyovkas: cheap yet easily mass-produced buildings. Stations of his era, as well as most 1970s stations, were simple in design and style, with walls covered with identical square ceramic tiles. Even decorations at the Metro stations almost finished at the time of the ban (such as VDNKh and Alexeyevskaya) got their final decors simplified: VDNKh's arcs/portals, for example, got plain green paint to contrast with well-detailed decorations and pannos around them.\nA typical layout of the cheap shallow-dug metro station (which quickly became known as \"Sorokonozhka\" \u2013 \"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations, and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, cheap technology; this resulted in utilitarian design being flawed in some ways. Some stations such as adjacent Rechnoi Vokzal and Vodny Stadion or sequiential Leninsky Prospect, Akadmicheskaya, Profsoyuznaya and Novye Cheryomushki would have a similar look due to the extensive use of same-sized white or off-white ceramic tiles with hard-to-feel differences.\nWalls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train-related vibration: some tiles would eventually fall off and break. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the exact color and tone, which eventually led to variegated parts of the walls.\nMetro stations of late USSR.\nThe contrasting style gap between the powerfully decorated stations of Moscow's center and the spartan-looking stations of the 1960s was eventually filled. In the mid-1970s the architectural extravagance was partially restored. However, the newer design of shallow \"centipede\" stations (now with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate. For example, Kaluzhskaya \"centipede\" station from 1974 (adjacent to \"Novye Cheryomushki\" station) features non-flat tiles (with 3D effect utilized), and Medvedkovo from 1978 features complex decorations.\n1971 station Kitay-Gorod (\"Ploshchad Nogina\" at the time) features cross-platform interchange (Line 6 and line 7). Although built without \"centipede\" design or cheap ceramic tiles, the station utilizes near-grayscale selection of colors. It is to note the \"southbound\" and \"northbound\" halls of the station have identical look.\nBabushkinskaya station from 1978 is a no-column station (similar to Biblioteka Imeni Lenina from 1935). 1983 Chertanovskaya station has resemblance to Kropotkinskaya (from 1935). Some stations, such as the deep-dug Shabolovskaya (1980), have the near-tunnel walls decorated with metal sheets, not tiles. Tyoply Stan features a theme related to the name and the location of the station (\"Tyoply Stan\" used to literally mean \"warm area\"): its walls are covered in brick-colored ribbed panes, which look like radiators).\nDowntown area got such stations as Borovitskaya (1986), with uncovered red bricks and gray, concrete-like colors accompanying a single gold-plated decorative pane known as \"Tree of peoples' of USSR\" or additional station hall for Tretyakovskaya to house cross-platform interchange system between line 6 and line 8. To this day, Tretyakovskaya metro station consists of two contrasting halls: brutalistic 1971 hall and custom design hall from 1986 reminiscent of Tretyakovskaya Galereya museum located within walking distance.\nPost-USSR stations of the modern Russian Federation.\nSome bleak, bland-looking \"centipedes\" like Akademicheskaya and Yugo-Zapadnaya have undergone renovations in the 21st century (new blue-striped white walls on Akademicheskaya, aqualine glassy, shiny walls on Yugo-Zapadnaya).\nMoscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14).\nA new circle metro line in Moscow was relatively quickly made in the 2010s. The Moscow Central Circle line (Line 14) was opened for use in September 2016 by re-purposing and upgrading the Maloe ZheleznoDorozhnoe Kol'tso. A proposal to convert that freight line into a metropolitan railway with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012. The original tracks had been built in pre-revolutionary Moscow decades before the creation of Moscow Metro; the tracks remained in place in one piece as a non-electrified line until the 21st century. Yet the circle route was never abandoned or cut. New track (along the existing one) was laid and all-new stations were built between 2014 and 2016. MCC's stations got such amenities as vending machines and free water closets.\nLine 14 is operated by Russian Railways and uses full-sized trains (an idea, somewhat similar to S-Train). The extra resemblance to an S-Train line is, the 1908 line now connects modern northern residential districts to western and southern downtown area, with a station adjacent to Moscow International Business Center.\nThere is a noticeable relief of congestion, decrease in usage of formerly overcrowded Koltsevaya line since the introduction of MCC. To make line 14 attractive to frequent Koltsevaya line interchanges users, upgrades over regular comfort of Moscow Metro were made. Use of small laptops/portable video playing devices and food consumption from tupperwares and tubs was also improved for Line 14: the trains have small folding tables in the back of nearly every seat, while the seats are facing one direction like in planes or intercity buses - unlike side-against-side sofas typical for Metro.\nUnlike MCD lines (D1, D2 etc.) MCC line accepts \"unified\" tickets and \"Troika\" cards just like Moscow Metro and buses of Moscow do. Free transfers are permitted between the MCC and the Moscow Metro if the trip before the transfer is less than 90 minutes. It's made possible by using same \"Ediny\", literally \"unified\" tickets instead of printing \"paper tickets\" used at railroads. \nMCD (D lines).\nIn 2019, new lines of Russian Railways got included in the map of Metro as \"line D1\" and \"line D2\". Unlike Line 14, the MCD lines actually form S-Train lines, bypassing the \"vokzals\", terminus stations of respective intercity railways. Line D3 is planned to be launched in August 2023, while D4 will be launched in September of that year. The schedule for the development of the infrastructure of the Central Transport Hub in 2023 was signed by the Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and the head of Russian Railways Oleg Belozerov in December 2022.\nAs for the fees, MCD accepts Moscow's \"Troika\" cards. Also, every MCD station has printers which print \"station X \u2013 station Y\" tickets on paper. Users of the D lines must keep their tickets until exiting their destination stations: their exit terminals require a valid \"... to station Y\" ticket's barcode.\nBig Circle Line (line 11).\nAfter upgrading the railway from 1908 to a proper Metro line, the development of another circle route was re-launched, now adjusted for the pear-shaped circle route of line #14.\nThroughout the late 2010s, Line 11 was extended from short, tiny Kakhovskaya line to a half-circle (from Kakhovskaya to Savyolovskaya). In early 2023, the circle was finished.\nAs for the spring of 2023, the whole circle route line is up and running, forming a circle stretching to the southern near-MKAD residential parts of the city (Prospekt Vernadskogo, Tekstilshchiki) as opposed to the MCC's stretching towards the northern districts of Moscow. In other words, BCL \"mirrors\" MCC, avoiding forming a perfect circle around the city centre. While being long, the line is now the longest subway line in the world, ahead of the previous record holder - the line 10 of Beijing Subway.\nExpansions.\nSince the turn of the 2nd millennium several projects have been completed, and more are underway. The first was the Annino-Butovo extension, which extended the Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line from Prazhskaya to Ulitsa Akademika Yangelya in 2000, Annino in 2001 and Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo in 2002. Its continuation, an elevated Butovskaya Line, was inaugurated in 2003. Vorobyovy Gory station, which initially opened in 1959 and was forced to close in 1983 after the concrete used to build the bridge was found to be defective, was rebuilt and reopened after many years in 2002. Another recent project included building a branch off the Filyovskaya Line to the Moscow International Business Center. This included Vystavochnaya (opened in 2005) and Mezhdunarodnaya (opened in 2006).\nThe Strogino\u2013Mitino extension began with Park Pobedy in 2003. Its first stations (an expanded Kuntsevskaya and Strogino) opened in January 2008, and Slavyansky Bulvar followed in September. Myakinino, Volokolamskaya and Mitino opened in December 2009. Myakinino station was built by a state-private financial partnership, unique in Moscow Metro history. A new terminus, Pyatnitskoye Shosse, was completed in December 2012.\nAfter many years of construction, the long-awaited Lyublinskaya Line extension was inaugurated with Trubnaya in August 2007 and Sretensky Bulvar in December of that year. In June 2010, it was extended northwards with the Dostoyevskaya and Maryina Roscha stations. In December 2011, the Lyublinskaya Line was expanded southwards by three stations and connected to the Zamoskvoretskaya Line, with the Alma-Atinskaya station opening on the latter in December 2012. The Kalininskaya Line was extended past the Moscow Ring Road in August 2012 with Novokosino station.\nIn 2011, works began on the Third Interchange Contour that is set to take the pressure off the Koltsevaya Line. Eventually the new line will attain a shape of the second ring with connections to all lines (except Koltsevaya and Butovskaya).\nIn 2013, the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line was extended after several delays to the south-eastern districts of Moscow outside the Ring Road with the opening of Zhulebino and Lermontovsky Prospekt stations. Originally scheduled for 2013, a new segment of the Kalininskaya Line between Park Pobedy and Delovoy Tsentr (separate from the main part) was opened in January 2014, while the underground extension of Butovskaya Line northwards to offer a transfer to the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line was completed in February. Spartak, a station on the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line that remained unfinished for forty years, was finally opened in August 2014. The first stage of the southern extension of the Sokolnicheskaya Line, the Troparyovo station, opened in December 2014.\nCurrent plans.\nIn addition to major metro expansion the Moscow Government and Russian Railways plans to upgrade more commuter railways to a metro-style service, similar to the MCC. New tracks and stations are planned to be built in order to achieve this.\nStations.\nOf the metro's 250 stations, 88 are deep underground, 123 are shallow, 12 are surface-level and 5 are elevated.\nThe deep stations comprise 55 triple-vaulted pylon stations, 19 triple-vaulted column stations, and one single-vault station. The shallow stations comprise 79 spanned column stations (a large portion of them following the \"centipede\" design), 33 single-vaulted stations (Kharkov technology), and four single-spanned stations. In addition, there are 12 ground-level stations, four elevated stations, and one station (Vorobyovy Gory) on a bridge. Two stations have three tracks, and one has double halls. Seven of the stations have side platforms (only one of which is subterranean). In addition, there were two temporary stations within rail yards.\nThe stations being constructed under Stalin's regime, in the style of socialist classicism, were meant as underground \"palaces of the people\". Stations such as Komsomolskaya, Kiyevskaya or Mayakovskaya and others built after 1935 in the second phase of the evolution of the network are tourist landmarks: their photogenic architecture, large chandeliers and detailed decoration are unusual for an urban transport system of the twentieth century.\nThe stations opened in the 21st century are influenced by an international and more neutral style with improved technical quality.\nRolling stock.\nSince the beginning, platforms have been at least long to accommodate eight-car trains. The only exceptions are on the Filyovskaya Line: Delovoy Tsentr, Moskva-City, Studencheskaya, Kutuzovskaya, Fili, Bagrationovskaya, Filyovsky Park and Pionerskaya, which only allows six-car trains (note that this list includes all ground-level stations on the line, except Kuntsevskaya, which allows normal length trains).\nTrains on the Zamoskvoretskaya, Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya, Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya, Kalininskaya, Solntsevskaya, Bolshaya Koltsevaya, Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya, Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya and Nekrasovskaya lines have eight cars, on the Sokolnicheskaya line seven or eight cars, on the original Koltsevaya line seven cars, and on the Filyovskaya line six cars. The Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line also once ran seven-car 81-717 size trains, but now use five-car trains of another type. Butovskaya line uses three-car trains of another type.\nDimensions have varied subtly, but for the most cars fit into the ranges of long and wide with 4 doors per side. The 81-740/741 Rusich deviates greatly from this, with a 3-car Rusich being roughly 4 normal cars and a 5-car Rusich being 7 normal cars.\nTrains no longer in operation.\nThe V-type trains were formerly from Berlin U-Bahn C-class trains from 1945 to 1969, until its complete demise in 1970. They were transported from the Berlin U-Bahn during the Soviet occupation. A-type and B-type trains were custom-made since the opening.\nThe Moscow Monorail used Intamin P30 trains, which consisted of six short cars.\nTrains in operation.\nCurrently, the Metro only operates 81-style trains.\nRolling stock on several lines was replaced with articulated 81-740/741 Rusich trains, which were originally designed for light rail subway lines. The Butovskaya Line was designed by different standards, and has shorter ( long) platforms. It employs articulated 81-740/741 trains, which consist of three cars (although the line can also use traditional four-car trains).\nOn the Moscow Central Circle, which is a route on the conventional railway line, ES2G Lastochka trains are used, consisting of five cars.\nTicketing.\nThe Moscow Metro charges a flat fare for a single journey, regardless of distance or time travelled within the network. An exception to this is the Moscow Central Diameters, which operate on a zone-based fare system.\nThe Moscow Metro ticketing system allows free interchanges within a 90-minute window between different transport modes, including the MCC, the MCD, trams and buses.\nModern Metro turnstiles are designed to accept various forms of payment, including plastic cards like the Troika card or Moscow Resident Social Cards, bank cards, bank stickers, souvenir tickets such as Troika rings, bracelets, or keychains, and disposable RFID chip cardboard cards. Additionally, all stations are equipped to accept biometric payments. Some transport cards have usage limitations that impose a waiting period between consecutive uses (e.g., delays of 7 or 20 minutes).\nHistory of the ticketing system.\nSoviet era turnstiles simply accepted N kopeck coins.\nIn the early years of Russian Federation (and with the start of a hyperinflation) plastic tokens were used. Disposable magnetic stripe cards were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of rides.\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement \"contactless\" smart cards, known as Transport Cards. Transport Cards were the card to have unlimited amount of trips for 30, 90 or 365 days, its active lifetime was projected as 3\u00bd years. Defective cards were to be exchanged at no extra cost.\nIn August 2004, the city government launched the Moscow Resident Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the Moscow region; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the Bank of Moscow. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\nSince 2006, several banks have issued credit cards which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles). Partner banks include the Bank of Moscow, CitiBank, Rosbank, Alfa-Bank and Avangard Bank.\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing limited magnetic cards with contactless disposable tickets based on NXP's MIFARE Ultralight technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards ended on 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards ceased to be accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.\nContemporary ticketing system.\nOn 2 April 2013, the Moscow Department of Transport introduced the Troika smartcard, which serves as the foundation of the city's modern ticketing system. Currently, passengers can use a single Troika card to pay for travel on the metro, MCC, MCD, buses, trams, river transport, suburban trains, and Aeroexpress. Approximately 80% of all trips in Moscow are paid for using Troika, with over 50 million cards sold to date.\nIn 2023, Troika production, including its chip, was fully localized in Moscow. In 2024, Moscow plans to launch a virtual analog of the card for smartphones.\nMoreover, the Moscow Metro offers Ediniy (Unified) tickets with varying durations: 1 day, 3 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and 365 days.\nIn 2015, the Moscow Metro started testing bank card payments at ticket windows. At the moment, bank card or bank sticker payments are accepted at all turnstiles in the network. As of April 2024, this payment option is used approximately 900 thousand times daily. \nIn October 2021, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in the world to implement biometric payment on a large scale. To use this system, passengers must link their photo, bank card, and metro card to the service through the Moscow Metro mobile app. This allows passengers to pay for their rides without taking out their phone, metro card, or bank card, thereby increasing passenger flow at station entrances. The technology is available at all metro stations, the MCC, and on river transport. As of April 2024, passengers have completed 100 million trips using biometric technology.\nOther payment methods include:\nThe Moscow Metro ticketing system received two prestigious international Transport Ticketing Awards in 2020 and 2021.\nFares.\nMCD network is divided between the \"Central\" and \"Suburban\" zone. Metro (with the monorail and the MCC) is completely within the Central zone.\nPassenger services.\nPassenger Mobility Center.\nThe Passenger Mobility Center was created within the Moscow Metro in October 2013 to aid passengers with reduced mobility, encompassing individuals with hearing or visual impairments, mobility limitations, senior citizens, large families, and parents with strollers. Today, the PMC staff escorts passengers at the metro, MCC, MCD, buses and trams.\nSince its inception, PMC has assisted over 1.15 million passengers with reduced mobility. In 2023, PMC staff escorted approximately 70,000 passengers, representing a 9% increase compared to 2022.\nWayfinding.\nIn 2013, the Moscow Metro started to develop the new principles of wayfinding, including a redesigned metro map. Today, these principles have been applied to all of Moscow Transport. The new system is characterized by the following features:\nDigital services.\nMobile app.\nLaunched in 2017, the Moscow Metro mobile app offers a range of useful features for passengers:\nAs of March 2024, the app has been downloaded 13 million times and is used by 2 million people monthly.\nChatbot.\nIn 2020, the Moscow Metro introduced Aleksandra, a chatbot that has since become the official chatbot for all types of urban transport in Moscow. As of February 2024, Aleksandra has answered over 6.8 million questions and is equipped to respond to over 58,000 inquiries related to Moscow's urban transport system.\nNotable incidents.\n1977 bombing.\nOn 8 January 1977, a bomb was reported to have killed 7 and seriously injured 33. It went off in a crowded train between Izmaylovskaya and Pervomayskaya stations. Three Armenians were later arrested, charged and executed in connection with the incident.\n1981 station fires.\nIn June 1981, seven bodies were seen being removed from the Oktyabrskaya station during a fire there. A fire was also reported at Prospekt Mira station about that time.\n1982 escalator accident.\nA fatal accident occurred on 17 February 1982 due to an escalator collapse at the Aviamotornaya station on the Kalininskaya Line. Eight people were killed and 30 injured due to a pileup caused by faulty emergency brakes.\n1996 murder.\nIn 1996, an American-Russian businessman Paul Tatum was murdered at the Kiyevskaya Metro station. He was shot dead by a man carrying a concealed Kalashnikov gun.\n2000 bombings.\nOn 8 August 2000, a strong blast in a Metro underpass at Pushkinskaya metro station in the center of Moscow claimed the lives of 12, with 150 injured. A homemade bomb equivalent to 800 grams of TNT had been left in a bag near a kiosk.\n2004 bombings.\nOn 6 February 2004, an explosion wrecked a train between the Avtozavodskaya and Paveletskaya stations on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line, killing 41 and wounding over 100. Chechen terrorists were blamed. A later investigation concluded that a Karachay-Cherkessian resident had carried out a suicide bombing. The same group organized another attack on 31 August 2004, killing 10 and injuring more than 50 others.\n2005 Moscow blackout.\nOn 25 May 2005, a citywide blackout halted operation on some lines. The following lines, however, continued operations: Sokolnicheskaya, Zamoskvoretskaya from Avtozavodskaya to Rechnoy Vokzal, Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya, Filyovskaya, Koltsevaya, Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya from Bitsevskiy Park to Oktyabrskaya-Radialnaya and from Prospekt Mira-Radialnaya to Medvedkovo, Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya, Kalininskaya, Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya from Serpukhovskaya to Altufyevo and Lyublinskaya from Chkalovskaya to Dubrovka. There was no service on the Kakhovskaya and Butovskaya lines. The blackout severely affected the Zamoskvoretskaya and Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya lines, where initially all service was disrupted because of trains halted in tunnels in the southern part of city (most affected by the blackout). Later, limited service resumed and passengers stranded in tunnels were evacuated. Some lines were only slightly impacted by the blackout, which mainly affected southern Moscow; the north, east and western parts of the city experienced little or no disruption.\n2006 billboard incident.\nOn 19 March 2006, a construction pile from an unauthorized billboard installation was driven through a tunnel roof, hitting a train between the Sokol and Voikovskaya stations on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. No injuries were reported.\n2010 bombing.\nOn 29 March 2010, two bombs exploded on the Sokolnicheskaya Line, killing 40 and injuring 102 others. The first bomb went off at the Lubyanka station on the Sokolnicheskaya Line at 7:56, during the morning rush hour. At least 26 were killed in the first explosion, of which 14 were in the rail car where it took place. A second explosion occurred at the Park Kultury station at 8:38, roughly forty minutes after the first one. Fourteen people were killed in that blast. The Caucasus Emirate later claimed responsibility for the bombings.\n2014 pile incident.\nOn 25 January 2014, at 15:37 a construction pile from a Moscow Central Circle construction site was driven through a tunnel roof between Avtozavodskaya and Kolomenskaya stations on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. The train operator applied emergency brakes, and the train did not crash into the pile. Passengers were evacuated from the tunnel, with no injures reported. The normal line operation resumed the same day at 19:50.\n2014 derailment.\nOn 15 July 2014, a train derailed between Park Pobedy and Slavyansky Bulvar on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line, killing 24 people and injuring dozens more.\n2025 restoration of Stalin's relief.\nOn 15 May 2025, a bas-relief wall panel depicting Joseph Stalin was installed in the connecting passage between the two Taganskaya stations. An earlier version of this sculpture at this location was removed in 1966, and Stalin himself was removed from the relief during the de-Stalinization campaign in the 1950s. Russian human rights activist Yan Rachinsky wrote that \"among Stalin\u2019s victims were more than 750 construction workers and employees of the Moscow Metro. More than 140 were executed, including the subway\u2019s first director, Petrikovsky (his name appears in a Stalinist execution list dated August 20, 1938). There\u2019s no mention of these people anywhere in the subway today, but the man responsible for their deaths is honored with a life-sized statue.\"\nMetro-2.\nConspiracy theorists have claimed that a second and deeper metro system code-named \"D-6\", designed for emergency evacuation of key city personnel in case of nuclear attack during the Cold War, exists under military jurisdiction. It is believed that it consists of a single track connecting the Kremlin, chief HQ (General Staff \u2013\"Genshtab\"), Lubyanka (FSB Headquarters), the Ministry of Defense and several other secret installations. There are alleged to be entrances to the system from several civilian buildings, such as the Russian State Library, Moscow State University (MSU) and at least two stations of the regular Metro. It is speculated that these would allow for the evacuation of a small number of randomly chosen civilians, in addition to most of the elite military personnel. A suspected junction between the secret system and the regular Metro is supposedly behind the Sportivnaya station on the Sokolnicheskaya Line. The final section of this system was supposedly completed in 1997.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Moscow Metro is the central location and namesake for the \"Metro\" series, where during a nuclear war, Moscow's inhabitants are driven down into the Moscow Metro, which has been designed as a fallout shelter, with the various stations being turned into makeshift settlements.\nIn 2012, an art film was released about a catastrophe in the Moscow underground.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in Sauk City, Wisconsin, in 1939 by August Derleth and Donald Wandrei to publish hardcover collections of H. P. Lovecraft's best works, which had previously been published only in pulp magazines. The company's name is derived from Lovecraft's fictional New England city, Arkham, Massachusetts. Arkham House editions are noted for the quality of their printing and binding. The printer's mark for Arkham House was designed by Frank Utpatel.\nFounding.\nIn late 1937, after Lovecraft's death, Derleth and Wandrei sought to produce a collection of their friend's best weird fiction from the pulp magazines into a memorial volume. After several failed attempts to interest major publishers in the omnibus volume, the two men realized no publisher would be willing to take a chance with the collection. Derleth and Wandrei then decided to form their own company, Arkham House with the express purpose of publishing all of Lovecraft's writings in hardcover. The omnibus volume was scheduled as the first offering from Arkham House and priced at $5.00, although advance orders were accepted at $3.50. Even at that bargain price, only 150 advance orders were received for \"The Outsider and Others\" before its release in 1939.\n\"The Outsider\" was printed by the George Banta Co. of Wisconsin in an edition of 1,268 copies. The book was over 550 pages long with small print and featured a dustjacket by fantasy artist Virgil Finlay. The omnibus sold slowly but steadily. Derleth was a successful writer and had a good deal of revenue coming in from his writing work, which allowed him to subsidize Arkham House's operations without it needing to realize a quick profit.\nA second Lovecraft omnibus, \"Beyond the Wall of Sleep\", appeared in 1943 as sales on all Arkham House books continued to advance. By 1944, Arkham House was established as a successful small press, with four titles appearing (collections of works by Donald Wandrei, Henry S. Whitehead, Clark Ashton Smith, and a final Lovecraft omnibus). In 1945, Arkham House widened its range by publishing two novels, neither of which had seen print in any form before. These were\" Witch House \"by Evangeline Walton and\" The Lurker at the Threshold \"by August Derleth (based on an outline by H. P. Lovecraft). Derleth also widened Arkham's range by publishing collections of stories by well-known fantasy authors, the first being \"Green Tea and Other Ghost Stories \"by the Irish author J. Sheridan Le Fanu. Collections by Englishmen A.E. Coppard, H. Russell Wakefield, William Hope Hodgson and Algernon Blackwood followed in 1947. Also in 1947 were books by three American writers, including the science fiction novel \"Slan\" by A.E. Van Vogt. Derleth must have felt he was in the wrong field as \"Slan\", with a print run of over 4,000 copies proved to be the fastest and best selling Arkham House of the 1940s.\nArkham House published many books in the fantasy and horror field including a small but steady number throughout the 1950s. Robert Weinberg has written that: \"However, intense competition from the SF (science fiction) small presses as well as slow sales of certain titles put August Derleth in a precarious bind. Only a generous loan from Dr David H. Keller prevented Arkham from going bankrupt during a period of cash flow problems in 1948. Keller visited Derleth's home, \"The Place of Hawks\" in the company of Sam Moskowitz, the object of the visit being Derleth agreeing to publish a Keller book under the Arkham House imprint, Keller to advance Derleth a loan against the cost of the book. Derleth revealed to Keller and Moskowitz that he owed his printer $2500 and had exhausted every possible source of help. Upon Keller's return to his home in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, he wrote a check for the needed sum and sent it to Derleth as a loan at 35% interest on Derleth's personal note. Reporting the transaction in \"Thirty Years of Arkham House\", Derleth adds: \"I had not asked for it; he had offered it with the comment, 'I pride myself on my judgment of character.' No greater compliment could have been paid me or Arkham House.'\"\nIn the late 1960s, Arkham House seemed again on the verge of going bankrupt, but suddenly found a whole new market for its books when the surge in interest in Robert E. Howard (capitalized upon by Donald M. Grant) coincided with a surge in interest in the work of H. P. Lovecraft. All of Lovecraft's works were reprinted in three newly edited omnibus volumes, which were kept continually in print.\nIn addition to volumes of H. P. Lovecraft's fiction, Arkham House began to publish a five volume edition of Lovecraft's \"Selected Letters\" which had been planned from the very start of the company, and which gives an overview of Lovecraft's correspondence to peers, friends and family. Among his correspondents were Arkham House founders, Derleth and Wandrei. (Arkham House's volumes of Lovecraft's letters are highly abridged; unabridged volumes of Lovecraft's letters to individual correspondents have been issued progressively by Hippocampus Press). After a long slow period, Arkham House entered the 1970s with ambitious publishing plans.\nArkham House also published fiction by many of Lovecraft's contemporaries, including Ray Bradbury, Robert E. Howard, Frank Belknap Long, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Bloch, and Derleth himself; classic genre fiction by authors such as William Hope Hodgson (under the prompting of Herman Charles Koenig), Algernon Blackwood, H. Russell Wakefield, Seabury Quinn, and Sheridan Le Fanu; and later writers in the Lovecraft school, such as Ramsey Campbell and Brian Lumley to whom Derleth gave their earliest publication in hardcover.\nDespite the wealth of talented writers who appeared under the Arkham House imprint, it was not a financial success. Derleth wrote in 1970, \"[T]he fact is that in no single year since its founding have the earnings of Arkham House met the expenses, so that it has been necessary for my personal earnings to shore up Arkham House finances.\" Robert Weinberg has stated \"Arkham House's greatest flop was \"Witch House\", an excellent novel that took nearly two decades to go out of print.\"\nAfter Derleth's death in 1971 Donald Wandrei briefly acted as editorial director but declined to resume his interest in the firm permanently.\nPrior to the 1980s Arkham House did not reprint its books (with some exceptions such as \"Someone in the Dark\" and \"\" and four of the core Lovecraft collections issued in the 1960s\u2014\"Dagon and Other Macabre Tales\", \"At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels\", \"The Horror in the Museum\" and \"The Dunwich Horror and Others\"). Rights were occasionally sold during the 1960s and 1970s to other publishers who issued paperback editions of Arkham House titles. However, this changed in the 1980s. There are now multiple printings and/or alternate editions of over 20 individual Arkham House titles.\nOperation.\nAugust Derleth's children April (Rose) and Walden (Wally) Derleth now co-owned the publisher, April running the business while Wally had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. April earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1977. She became majority stockholder, President, and CEO of Arkham House in 1994, in which capacity she remained until her death in March, 2011.\nWandrei was succeeded as editorial director by James Turner. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Turner expanded the company's range of authors to include such prominent science fiction and fantasy writers as Michael Bishop, Lucius Shepard, Bruce Sterling, James Tiptree, Jr., Michael Shea and J. G. Ballard, often publishing hardcover collections of shorter works. Turner's acquisitions took the publisher away from its roots in weird and horror fiction, and he was eventually dismissed by April Derleth in 1997. He went on to found Golden Gryphon Press.\nIn 1997 Peter Ruber was appointed as her consulting editor and successor to James Turner. April became president of Arkham House in 2002. She made the house's mission a return to classic weird fiction, which Ruber sought to do. Ruber drew criticism for the hostile opinions of various authors he expressed in his story introductions within \"Arkham's Masters of Horror\" (2000). Rumors of his ill-health circulated for some time; he eventually suffered a stroke and his editorial duties at Arkham House lapsed due to this.\nThe house's publishing schedule slowed considerably between 2000 and 2006, with only nine books issued\u2014\"In the Stone House\" by Barry N. Malzberg (2000); \"Book of the Dead\" by E. Hoffmann Price (a collection of memoirs of writers known by Price, 2001); \"Arkham House's Masters of Horror\" (ed. Peter Ruber, 2000); \"The Far Side of Nowhere\" by Nelson Bond (2002); \"The Cleansing\" by John D. Harvey (a horror novel, 2002); \"Selected Letters of Clark Ashton Smith\" (ed. Scott Connors, 2003); \"Cave of a Thousand Tales\" by Milt Thomas (a biography of pulp writer Hugh B. Cave, 2004); \"Other Worlds Than Ours\", another collection by Nelson Bond (2005); and \"Evermore\" (a collection of tales in tribute to Edgar Allan Poe, ed. James Robert Smith &amp; Stephen Mark Rainey, 2006).\nIn 2005 Arkham House was awarded the World Fantasy Award for Small Press Achievements\u2014the trophy at that time was a bust of H. P. Lovecraft.\nIn early 2009 it was announced that George Vanderburgh of Battered Silicon Dispatch Box, and Robert Weinberg, would jointly take over the editorial duties at Arkham House. That year Battered Silicon Dispatch Box issued four new volumes of stories by August Derleth under the umbrella title \"The Macabre Quarto\" under a joint imprint with Arkham House, which constituted the latter's only output since 2006.\nIn 2010 \"The Arkham Sampler (1948\u201349)\" was reissued in a limited edition (250 sets) two-volume facsimile reprint of the now-rare magazine issued by Arkham House that ran four issues a year 1948\u20131949. This work was issued by Arkham House co-published with the August Derleth Society. In the same year Jon Lellenberg's novel \"Baker Street Irregular\" was issued under the Mycroft and Moran imprint.\nStatus.\nGeorge Vanderburgh's blog at Battered Silicon Dispatch Box announced a number of Arkham House titles for 2011 and after (the last being \"Evermore\"), none of which had appeared as of January 2017 due to April Derleth's death on March 21, 2011. The publisher's website announced in April 2011 that her children would take over the running of the firm. Danielle Jacobs was named president, and her brother Damon Derleth as vice president; they are also the current owners. George Vanderburgh would continue as house editor, as would Robert Weinberg until his death in September 2016.\nNo books have been issued under the Arkham House imprint in the 2020s; the press has reprinted some backlist titles. Books had previously been published almost every year from 1939 to 2010 (except for 1940, 1955/56, and 2006).\nAs of June 7, 2023, the Arkham House web site, arkhamhouse.com, has been down for several months. Arkham House has not made an announcement about the status of the company. It was stated on the August Derleth/Arkham House Facebook page that Arkham House is no longer in business, and they have not replied to several attempts at contact. As of March 2024, a pending new trademark application has been filed by Arkham House LLC of Minnesota with the USPTO office.\nOther imprints.\nArkham House published under two additional imprints during its history.\nIn 1945 the Mycroft &amp; Moran imprint was launched for the publication of weird detective and mystery stories, including Derleth's Solar Pons series. The title of the imprint was inspired by characters from the Sherlock Holmes stories: Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes, and the villain Colonel Sebastian Moran. Some Mycroft and Moran titles since 1993 have also been issued by Battered Silicon Dispatch Box.\nArkham also introduced Stanton &amp; Lee Publishers in 1945 with the intention of publishing cartoons by Clare Victor Dwiggins. Stanton &amp; Lee Publishers went on to publish poetry and the regional writings of August Derleth.\nAugust Derleth also sub-contracted certain books which were nominally published by Arkham House to other publishers, including Pellegrini &amp; Cudahy of New York, and Villiers Publications of England.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The doctrine was first proclaimed by the First Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934 as approved as the only acceptable method for Soviet cultural production in all media.\nThe primary official objective of socialist realism was \"to depict reality in its revolutionary development\" although no formal guidelines concerning style or subject matter were provided. Works of socialist realism were usually characterized by unambiguous narratives or iconography relating to the Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology, such as the emancipation of the proletariat. In visual arts, socialist realism often relied on the conventions of academic art and classical sculpture. Socialist realism was usually devoid of complex artistic meaning or interpretation yet counter sources may provide different interpretations. \nIn the aftermath of World War II, socialist realism was adopted as official policy by the communist states that were politically aligned with the Soviet Union. Socialist realism was the predominant form of approved art in the Soviet Union from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status beginning in the late 1960s until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe. The doctrine of socialist realism should not be confused with social realism, a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern and was popularized in the United States during the 1930s, or any other forms of artistic \"realism\".\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nSocialist realism was developed by many thousands of artists, across a diverse society, over several decades. Early examples of realism in Russian art include the work of the Peredvizhnikis and Ilya Yefimovich Repin. While these works do not have the same political connotation, they exhibit the techniques exercised by their successors. After the Bolsheviks took control of Russia on October 25, 1917, there was a marked shift in artistic styles. There had been a short period of artistic exploration in the time between the fall of the Tsar and the rise of the Bolsheviks.\nShortly after the Bolsheviks took control, Anatoly Lunacharsky was appointed as head of Narkompros, the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment. This put Lunacharsky in the position of deciding the direction of art in the newly created Soviet state. Although Lunacharsky did not dictate a single aesthetic model for Soviet artists to follow, he developed a system of aesthetics based on the human body that would later help to influence socialist realism. He believed that \"the sight of a healthy body, intelligent face or friendly smile was essentially life-enhancing.\" He concluded that art had a direct effect on the human organism and under the right circumstances that effect could be positive. By depicting \"the perfect person\" (New Soviet man), Lunacharsky believed art could educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.\nDebate within Soviet art.\nThere were two main groups debating the fate of Soviet art: futurists and traditionalists. Russian Futurists, many of whom had been creating abstract or leftist art before the Bolsheviks, believed communism required a complete rupture from the past and, therefore, so did Soviet art. Traditionalists believed in the importance of realistic representations of everyday life. Under Lenin's rule and the New Economic Policy, there was a certain amount of private commercial enterprise, allowing both the futurists and the traditionalists to produce their art for individuals with capital. By 1928, the Soviet government had enough strength and authority to end private enterprises, thus ending support for fringe groups such as the futurists. At this point, although the term \"socialist realism\" was not being used, its defining characteristics became the norm.\nAccording to the \"Great Russian Encyclopedia\", the term was first used in press by chairman of the organizing committee of the Union of Soviet Writers, Ivan Gronsky in \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\" on May 23, 1932. The term was approved in meetings that included politicians of the highest level, including Joseph Stalin. Maxim Gorky, a proponent of literary socialist realism, published a famous article titled \"Socialist Realism\" in 1933. During the Congress of 1934, four guidelines were laid out for socialist realism. The work must be:\nCharacteristics.\nThe purpose of socialist realism was to limit popular culture to a specific, highly regulated faction of emotional expression that promoted Soviet ideals. The party was of the utmost importance and was always to be favorably featured. The key concepts that developed assured loyalty to the party were \"partiinost\"' (party-mindedness), \"ideinost\" (idea and ideological content), \"klassovost\" (class content), \"pravdivost\" (truthfulness). \"Ideinost\" was an important concept: not only was the work to embody an approved idea, but its content was more important than its form. This allowed the identification of formalism, a work in which the formal aspects of a work of art commanded more importance than the subject matter, or content.\nThere was a prevailing sense of optimism, as socialist realism's function was to show the ideal Soviet society. Not only was the present glorified, but the future was also supposed to be depicted in an agreeable fashion. Because the present and the future were constantly idealized, socialist realism had a sense of forced optimism. Tragedy and negativity were not permitted, unless they were shown in a different time or place. This sentiment created what would later be dubbed \"revolutionary romanticism\".\nRevolutionary romanticism elevated the common worker, whether factory or agricultural, by presenting his life, work, and recreation as admirable. Its purpose was to show how much the standard of living had improved thanks to the revolution, as educational information, to teach Soviet citizens how they should be acting and to improve morale. The ultimate aim was to create what Lenin called \"an entirely new type of human being\": The \"New Soviet Man\". Art (especially posters and murals) was a way to instill party values on a massive scale. Stalin described the socialist realist artists as \"engineers of souls\".\nCommon images used in socialist realism were flowers, sunlight, the body, youth, flight, industry, and new technology. These poetic images were used to show the utopianism of communism and the Soviet state. Art became more than an aesthetic pleasure; instead it served a very specific function. Soviet ideals placed functionality and work above all else; therefore, for art to be admired, it must serve a purpose. Georgi Plekhanov, a Marxist theoretician, states that art is useful if it serves society: \"There can be no doubt that art acquired a social significance only in so far as it depicts, evokes, or conveys \"actions, emotions and events that are of significance to society\".\"\nThe themes depicted would feature the beauty of work, the achievements of the collective and the individual for the good of the whole. The artwork would often feature an easily discernible educational message.\nThe artist could not, however, portray life just as they saw it because anything that reflected poorly on Communism had to be omitted as it did not reflect material reality of the work of the artist. People who could not be shown as either wholly good or wholly evil could not be used as characters as the concept of pure good and evil did not exist. Art was filled with health and happiness: paintings showed busy industrial and agricultural scenes; sculptures depicted workers, sentries, and schoolchildren.\nCreativity was an important part of socialist realism. The styles used in creating art during this period were those that would produce the most realistic results based on material realism. Painters would depict happy, muscular peasants and workers in factories and collective farms. During the Stalin period, they produced numerous heroic portraits of Stalin to serve his cult of personality\u00a0\u2013 all in the most realistic fashion possible. The most important thing for a socialist realist artist was not artistic integrity as it was political in nature, thus creating a singular materialistic realism aesthetic.\nImportant groups.\nThe Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines socialist realism as \"a Marxist aesthetic theory calling for the didactic use of literature, art, and music to develop social consciousness in an evolving socialist state\". Socialist realism compelled artists of all forms to create positive or uplifting reflections of socialist utopian life by utilizing any visual media, such as posters, movies, newspapers, theater and radio, beginning during the Communist Revolution of 1917 and escalating during the reign of Stalin until the early 1980s.\nVladimir Lenin, head of the Russian government 1917\u20131924, laid the foundation for this new wave of art, suggesting that art is for the people and the people should love and understand it, while uniting the masses. Artists Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner attempted to define the lines of art under Lenin by writing \"The Realist Manifesto\" in 1920, suggesting that artists should be given free rein to create as their muse desired. Lenin, however, had a different purpose for art: wanting it functional, and Stalin built on that belief that art should be agitation.\nThe term \"Socialist Realism\" was proclaimed in 1934 at the Soviet Writer's congress, although it was left not precisely defined. This turned individual artists and their works into state-controlled propaganda.\nAfter the death of Stalin in 1953, he was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev who allowed for less draconian state controls and openly condemned Stalin's artistic demands in 1956 with his \"Secret Speech\", and thus began a reversal in policy known as \"Khrushchev's Thaw\". In 1964, Khrushchev was removed and replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reintroduced Stalin's ideas and reversed the artistic decisions made by Khrushchev. However, by the early 1980s, the Socialist Realist movement had begun to fade. Artists to date remark that the Russian Social Realist movement as the most oppressive and shunned period of Soviet Art.\nAssociation of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR).\nThe Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR) was established in 1922 and was one of the most influential artist groups in the USSR. The AKhRR worked to truthfully document contemporary life in Russia by utilizing \"heroic realism\". The term \"heroic realism\" was the beginning of the socialist realism archetype. AKhRR was sponsored by influential government officials such as Leon Trotsky and carried favor with the Red Army.\nIn 1928, the AKhRR was renamed to Association of Artists of the Revolution (AKhR) in order to include the rest of the Soviet states. At this point the group had begun participating in state promoted mass forms of art like murals, jointly-made paintings, advertisement production and textile design. The group was disbanded April 23, 1932 by the decree \"On the Reorganization of Literary and Artistic Organizations\" serving as the nucleus for the Stalinist USSR Union of Artists.\nStudio of military artists named after M. B. Grekov.\nStudio of military artists was created in 1934.\nThe Union of Soviet Writers (USW).\nThe creation of Union of Soviet Writers was partially initiated by Maxim Gorky to unite the Soviet writers of different methods, such as the \"proletarian\" writers (such as Fyodor Panfyorov), praised by the Communist Party, and the \"poputchicks\" (such as Boris Pasternak and Andrei Bely). In August 1934, the union held its first congress where Gorky said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Writers' Union is not being created merely for the purpose of bodily uniting all artists of the pen, but so that professional unification may enable them to comprehend their corporate strength, to define with all possible clarity their varied tendencies, creative activity, guiding principles, and harmoniously to merge all aims in that unity which is guiding all the creative working energies of the country.\nOne of the most famous authors during this time was Alexander Fadeyev. Fadeyev was a close personal friend of Stalin and called Stalin \"one of the greatest humanists the world has ever seen.\" His most famous works include \"The Rout\" and \"The Young Guard\".\nReception and impact.\nStalin's adversary, Leon Trotsky, was highly critical of this rigid approach towards the arts. He viewed cultural conformity as an expression of Stalinism in which \"the literary schools were strangled one after the other\" and the method of command extended across various areas from scientific agriculture to music. Overall, he regarded socialist realism to be an arbitrary construct of the Stalinist bureaucracy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"In that victorious revolution, there is not only the revolution, but also a new privileged stratum...[which] has strangled artistic creation with a totalitarian hand...Even under absolute monarchy art was based on idealization, but not on falsification, whereas in the Soviet Union official art\u00a0\u2013 and none other exists there\u00a0\u2013 is sharing in the fate of official justice; its purpose is to glorify the \"Leader\" and to manufacture officially a heroic myth...The style of official Soviet painting is being described as \"socialist realism\"\u00a0\u2013 the label could have been invented only by a bureaucrat at the head of an Arts Department.\"\nThe impact of socialist realist art can still be seen decades after it ceased being the only state-supported style. Even before the end of the USSR in 1991, the government had been reducing its practices of censorship. After Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev began to condemn the previous regime's practice of excessive restrictions. This freedom allowed artists to begin experimenting with new techniques, but the shift was not immediate. It was not until the ultimate fall of Soviet rule that artists were no longer restricted by the deposed Communist Party. Many socialist realist tendencies prevailed until the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s. \nIn the 1990s, many Russian artists used the characteristics of socialist realism in an ironic fashion. This was completely different from what existed only a couple of decades before. Once artists broke from the socialist realist mould, there was a significant power shift. Artists began including subjects that could not exist according to Soviet ideals. Now that the power over appearances was taken away from the government, artists achieved a level of authority that had not existed since the early 20th century. In the decade immediately after the fall of the USSR, artists represented socialist realism and the Soviet legacy as a traumatic event. By the next decade, there was a unique sense of detachment.\nWestern cultures often do not look at socialist realism positively. Democratic countries view the art produced during this period of repression as a lie based on their Capitalist realism. Non-Marxist art historians tend to view communism as a form of totalitarianism that smothers artistic expression and therefore retards the progress of capitalist culture. In recent years there has been a reclamation of the movement in Moscow with the addition of the Institute of Russian Realist Art (IRRA), a three-story museum dedicated to preserving 20th-century Russian realist paintings.\nNotable works and artists.\nMusic.\nHanns Eisler composed many workers' songs, marches, and ballads on current political topics such as \"Song of Solidarity\", \"Song of the United Front\", and \"Song of the Comintern\". He was a founder of a new style of revolutionary song for the masses. He also composed works in larger forms such as \"Requiem for Lenin\". Eisler's most important works include the cantatas \"German Symphony\", \"Serenade of the Age\" and \"Song of Peace\". Eisler combines features of revolutionary songs with varied expression. His symphonic music is known for its complex and subtle orchestration.\nClosely associated with the rise of the labor movement was the development of the revolutionary song, which was performed at demonstrations and meetings. Among the most famous of the revolutionary songs are \"The Internationale\" and \"Whirlwinds of Danger\". Notable songs from Russia include \"Boldly, Comrades, in Step\", \"Workers' Marseillaise\", and \"Rage, Tyrants\". Folk and revolutionary songs influenced the Soviet mass songs. The mass song was a leading genre in Soviet music, especially during the 1930s and the war. The mass song influenced other genres, including the art song, opera, and film music. The most popular mass songs include Dunaevsky's \"Song of the Homeland\", Isaakovsky's \"Katiusha\", Novikov's \"Hymn of Democratic Youth of the World\", and Aleksandrov's \"Sacred War\".\nFilm.\nDiscussions of film as a tool of the Soviet state began in the early twentieth century. Leon Trotsky argued that cinema could be used to supplant the influence of the Orthodox Church in Russia. In the early 1930s, Soviet filmmakers applied socialist realism in their work. Notable films include \"Chapaev\", which shows the role of the people in the history-making process. The theme of revolutionary history was developed in films such as \"The Youth of Maxim\" by Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg, \"Shchors\" by Dovzhenko, and \"We are from Kronstadt\" by E. Dzigan. The shaping of the new man under socialism was a theme of films such as \"A Start Life\" by N. Ekk, \"Ivan\" by Dovzhenko, \"Valerii Chkalov\" by M. Kalatozov and the film version of \"Tanker \"Derbent\"\" (1941). Some films depicted the part of peoples of the Soviet Union against foreign invaders: \"Alexander Nevsky\" by Eisenstein, \"Minin and Pozharsky\" by Pudovkin, and \"Bogdan Khmelnitsky\" by Savchenko. Soviet politicians were the subjects in films such as Yutkevich's trilogy of movies about Lenin. Socialist realism was also applied to Hindi films of the 1940s and 1950s. These include Chetan Anand's \"Neecha Nagar\" (1946), which won the Grand Prize at the 1st Cannes Film Festival, and Bimal Roy's \"Two Acres of Land\" (1953), which won the International Prize at the 7th Cannes Film Festival.\nPaintings.\nThe painter Aleksandr Deineka provides a notable example for his expressionist and patriotic scenes of the Second World War, collective farms, and sports. Yuriy Ivanovich Pimenov, Boris Ioganson, Isaak Brodsky and Geli Korzev have also been described as \"unappreciated masters of twentieth-century realism\". Another well-known practitioner was Fyodor Pavlovich Reshetnikov. Socialist realist art found acceptance in the Baltic nations, inspiring many artists. One such artist was Czeslaw Znamierowski (23 May 1890 \u2013 9 August 1977), a Soviet Lithuanian painter, known for his large panoramic landscapes and love of nature. Znamierowski combined these two passions to create very notable paintings in the Soviet Union, earning the prestigious title of Honorable Artist of LSSR in 1965. Born in Latvia, which formed part of the Russian Empire at the time, Znamierowski was of Polish descent and Lithuanian citizenship, a country where he lived for most of his life and died. He excelled in landscapes and social realism, and held many exhibitions. Znamierowski was also widely published in national newspapers, magazines and books. His more notable paintings include \"Before Rain\" (1930), \"Panorama of Vilnius City\" (1950), \"The Green Lake\" (1955), and \"In Klaipeda Fishing Port\" (1959). A large collection of his art is located in the Lithuanian Art Museum.\nLiterature.\nMartin Andersen Nex\u00f8 developed socialist realism in his own way. His creative method featured a combination of publicistic passion, a critical view of capitalist society, and a steadfast striving to bring reality into accord with socialist ideals. The novel \"Pelle, the Conqueror\" is considered to be a classic of socialist realism.\nBruno Apitz's novel \"Nackt unter W\u00f6lfen\", a story that culminates in the vivid description of the self-liberation of the detainees, was deliberately chosen to take place on the same day as the formal opening of the Buchenwald Monument in September 1958. The novels of Louis Aragon, such as \"The Real World\", depict the working class as a rising force of the nation. He published two books of documentary prose, \"The Communist Man\". In the collection of poems \"A Knife in the Heart Again\", Aragon criticizes the penetration of American imperialism into Europe. The novel \"The Holy Week\" depicts the artist's path toward the people against a broad social and historical background.\nMaxim Gorky's novel \"Mother\" (1906) is usually considered to have been the first socialist-realist novel. Gorky was also a major factor in the school's rapid rise, and his pamphlet, \"On Socialist Realism\", essentially lays out the needs of Soviet art. Other important works of literature include Fyodor Gladkov's \"Cement\" (1925), Nikolai Ostrovsky's \"How the Steel Was Tempered\" (1936) and Aleksey Tolstoy's epic trilogy \"The Road to Calvary\" (1922\u20131941). Yury Krymov's novel \"Tanker \"Derbent\"\" (1938) portrays Soviet merchant seafarers being transformed by the Stakhanovite movement. \"Thol\", a novel by D. Selvaraj in Tamil is a standing example of Marxist Realism in India. It won a literary award (Sahithya Akademi) for the year 2012.\nSculptures.\nSculptor Fritz Cremer created a series of monuments commemorating the victims of the Nazi regime in the former concentration camps Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Mauthausen and Ravensbr\u00fcck. His bronze monument in Buchenwald, depicting the liberation of this concentration camp by detainees in April 1945, is considered one of the most striking examples of socialist realism in GDR sculpture for its representation of communist liberation. Each figure in the monument, erected outside the campsite, has symbolic significance according to the orthodox communist interpretation of the event. Thus communists were portrayed as the driving force behind self-liberation, symbolized by a figure in the foreground sacrificing himself for his sufferers, followed by the central group of determined comrades through whose courage and fearlessness is encouraged. The German Democratic Republic used these sculptures to reaffirm its claim to the historical and political legacy of the anti-fascist struggle for freedom.\nClaudia Cobizev was a Moldovan sculptor, whose work was known for its sensitive portrayals of women and children. Her most notable work is \"Cap de moldoveanc\u0103\" which was exhibited at the Paris International Exhibition to wide acclaim.\nTheater.\nTheater is a realm in which socialist realism as a movement took root as a way to reach out and appeal to the masses. This occurred both within the Soviet bloc as well as outside of it, with China being another hotbed for socialist realism within theater.\nSoviet Union.\nCountries within the Soviet Union were heavily influenced by socialist realism when it came to theater. Early after the 1917 revolution, a movement arose to attempt to redefine what theater was, with theorist Platon Kerzhentsev wanting to break down the barriers between actors and the public, creating unity between the two.\nWith the revolution, there was the ability to change the existing theatrical institutions to fit the new ideas circulating. The early 1920s saw this explosion of creativity, with organizations such as the TEO Narkompros (the Department of Fine Arts) working to incorporate new types of theater. Thus, these movements were later brought under control and solidified by the Soviet government, as individual theatrical troupes were organized and transformed through governmental support.\nA part of these movements involved the reinvention of classic shows, including those in the Western canon. \"Hamlet\" particularly had a draw for Russians, and was seen to provide insight into the workings and complexities of Russian life after the 1917 revolution. Playwrights attempted to express their feelings about life around them while additionally following the guidelines of socialist realism, a way of reinventing old shows. \"Hamlet\" was re-imagined by Nikolay Akimov, for example, as a show that was more materialist in nature, coming at the end of this era of experimentation.\nThese movements were not merely localized to Russia, but spread throughout the USSR, with Poland being a notable location where socialist realism was implemented in theater. In order to make theater more accessible to the average person (for both entertainment and educational purposes), an emphasis was put on creating a network of smaller, independent theaters, including those in rural communities and traveling companies.\nBy making theater available to everyone, not simply those with the time and money to view it, officials hoped to educate the public both on theater itself and the various ideologies they wanted to promote. Beliefs that were more heavily promoted included those seen to be educational (with the idea of \u201cteaching through entertaining\u201d springing up), those upholding the values of nature and the countryside, and those that generally had a positive quality, especially when looking at children\u2019s theater.\nReinvention of old forms took place, along with the creation of new theatrical movements. Opera as a theatrical form was reinterpreted and reinvented throughout the Soviet Union, moving away from its aristocratic roots and towards the support of the new state. By the 1930s, the Bolshoi Theater in particular became a symbol of Bolshevik power, and the question became how to best integrate socialist realism into an opera that could be performed there. The Union of Soviet Composers, established 1932, played a role towards creating these new operas, and spoke about the importance of socialist realism in opposition to modernistic art.\nChina.\nTheater in China fell under the state\u2019s purview after the Chinese Communist Revolution, led partly by poet and playwright Tian Han, President of the China Theater Association (among other honors). He pushed for theatrical reform in a socialist manner, primarily focused on transferring ownership from private troupes to state ones, but additionally on the subject matter of the plays themselves.\nIn the midst of these reforms, ideas around feminism and how it tied into socialism emerged, specifically with regards to theater. Bai Wei, inspired by Tian Han, developed a style of theater in the 1920s that focused specifically on women within a patriarchal society, and the struggle to break free of it. She additionally incorporated ideas of socialist realism within her work, though did break from it in some ways, including the fact that her characters were more individualized and less collective. Strong female characters were, however, idealized and put forward in Chinese socialist realism, with these women often shown making some sort of sacrifice or grand action in service of a greater cause.\nSocialist realism in Chinese theater can be seen to home in on the ideas that it is more valuable to take action as a group, together, than individually. This is evident from plays put on during the Cultural Revolution, where common themes included a large group standing up to imperialist forces (such as a Japanese invasion, for example), with the individual characters within the play being less important than the overarching power struggle occurring.\nSoviet Union.\nIn conjunction with the Socialist Classical style of architecture, socialist realism was the officially approved type of art in the Soviet Union for more than fifty years. In the early years of the Soviet Union, Russian and Soviet artists embraced a wide variety of art forms under the auspices of Proletkult. Revolutionary politics and radical non-traditional art forms were seen as complementary.\nThese styles of art were later rejected by members of the Communist Party who did not appreciate modern styles such as Impressionism and Cubism. Socialist realism was, to some extent, a reaction against the adoption of these \"decadent\" styles. It was thought by Lenin that the non-representative forms of art were not understood by the proletariat and could therefore not be used by the state for propaganda.\nAlexander Bogdanov argued that the radical reformation of society to communist principles meant little if any bourgeois art would prove useful; some of his more radical followers advocated the destruction of libraries and museums. Lenin rejected this philosophy, deplored the rejection of the beautiful because it was old, and explicitly described art as needing to call on its heritage: \"Proletarian culture must be the logical development of the store of knowledge mankind has accumulated under the yoke of capitalist, landowner, and bureaucratic society.\"\nModern art styles appeared to refuse to draw upon this heritage, thus clashing with the long realist tradition in Russia and rendering the art scene complex. Even in Lenin's time, a cultural bureaucracy began to restrain art to fit propaganda purposes. Leon Trotsky's arguments that a \"proletarian literature\" was un-Marxist because the proletariat would lose its class characteristics in the transition to a classless society, however, did not prevail.\nSocialist realism became state policy in 1934 when the First Congress of Soviet Writers met and Stalin's representative Andrei Zhdanov gave a speech strongly endorsing it as \"the official style of Soviet culture\". This was either because they were \"decadent\", unintelligible to the proletariat, or counter-revolutionary. A great number of landscapes, portraits, and genre paintings exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus ostensibly free from any ideology. Genre painting was also approached in a similar way.\nTheir time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas, and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by Vladimir Gorb, Boris Korneev, Engels Kozlov, Felix Lembersky, Oleg Lomakin, Samuil Nevelshtein, Victor Oreshnikov, Semion Rotnitsky, Lev Russov, and Leonid Steele; in landscapes by Nikolai Galakhov, Vasily Golubev, Dmitry Maevsky, Sergei Osipov, Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Alexander Semionov, Arseny Semionov, and Nikolai Timkov; and in genre paintings by Andrey Milnikov, Yevsey Moiseenko, Mikhail Natarevich, Yuri Neprintsev, Nikolai Pozdneev, Mikhail Trufanov, Yuri Tulin, Nina Veselova, and others.\nIn 1974, for instance, a show of unofficial art in a field near Moscow was broken up and the artwork destroyed with a water cannon and bulldozers (see Bulldozer Exhibition). Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika facilitated an explosion of interest in alternative art styles in the late 1980s, but socialist realism remained in limited force as the official state art style until as late as 1991. It was not until after the fall of the Soviet Union that artists were finally freed from state censorship.\nOther countries.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, socialist realism became an international literary movement. Socialist trends in literature were established in the 1920s in Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Writers who helped develop socialist realism in the West included Louis Aragon, Johannes Becher, and Pablo Neruda.\nDuring the 1950s, this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to architects perceived not as merely engineers creating streets and edifices, but rather as \"engineers of the human soul\" who, in addition to extending simple aesthetics into urban design, were to express grandiose ideas and arouse feelings of stability, persistence and political power. In art, from the mid-1960s more relaxed and decorative styles became acceptable even in large public works in the Warsaw Pact bloc, the style mostly deriving from popular posters, illustrations and other works on paper, with discreet influence from their Western equivalents. Today, arguably the only countries still focused on these aesthetic principles are North Korea, Laos, and to some extent Vietnam. Socialist realism had little mainstream impact in the non-Communist world, where it was widely seen as a totalitarian means of imposing state control on artists.\nThe former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was an important exception among the communist countries, because after the Tito\u2013Stalin split in 1948, it abandoned socialist realism along with other elements previously imported from the Soviet system and allowed greater artistic freedom. Socialist realism was the main art current in the People's Socialist Republic of Albania. In 2017, three works by Albanian artists from the socialist era were exhibited at documenta 14.\nIndonesia.\nLembaga Kebudajaan Rakjat, often abbreviated Lekra; meaning Institute for the People's Culture) was a prolific cultural and social movement associated with the Communist Party of Indonesia. Founded in 1950, Lekra pushed for artists, writers and teachers to follow the doctrine of socialist realism. Increasingly vocal against non-Lekra members, the group rallied against the Manifes Kebudayaan (Cultural Manifesto), eventually leading to President Sukarno banning it with some hesitations. After the 30 September Movement, Lekra was banned together with the Communist party.\nChina.\nAcademics typically view China's socialist literature as existing within the trend of Stalinist-influenced socialist realism, particularly major works such as Mikhail Sholokhov's \"Virgin Soil Upturned\" and Galina Nikolaeva's \"Harvest\", which were widely translated and disseminated in China. Other academics, including Cai Xiang, Rebecca E. Karl, and Xueping Zhong, place greater weight on the influence of Mao Zedong's 1942 lectures, Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Art and Literature. During the years 1952 to 1954, the architectural style of socialist realism from the Soviet Union influenced Chinese architecture.75 Socialist realism was introduced into Chinese oil painting through a class held by Konstantin Maksimov in Beijing.165 Feng Fasi's \"The Heroic Death of Liu Hulan\" is regarded as a classic socialist realist painting.166\nEast Germany.\nOverview.\nThe earliest ideas of socialist realism in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) came about directly after the end of World War II, when the state was formed. While planning to establish a national East German culture, cultural leaders wanted to move away from fascist ideas, including those of Nazi and militaristic doctrines. Cultural leaders first started clarifying what \"realism\" entailed. The SED determined that realism was to act as a \"fundamental artistic approach that is attuned to contemporary social reality.\"\nThe characteristics of realism became more specified in East German cultural policy as the GDR defined its identity as a state. As the head of the SMAD's cultural division, Aleksandr Dymshits asserted that the \"negation of reality\" and \"unbridled fantasy\" was a \"bourgeois and decadent attitude of the mind\" that rejects \"the truth of life.\"\nCultural officials looked back at historical events in Germany that could have acted as the origin points of the eventual creation of the GDR. The works and legacy of Albrecht D\u00fcrer became a point of reference for the early development of socialist realism in East Germany. D\u00fcrer created many artworks about the Great Peasants' War. His \"support for the 'revolutionary forces'\" in his illustrations made him an appealing figure to East German officials, while they searched for a starting point of a new German socialist state. In Heinz L\u00fcdecke and Susanne Heiland's anthology \"D\u00fcrer und die Nachwelt,\" they described D\u00fcrer as being \"inseparably associated with the two great currents of bourgeois antifeudal progress, namely humanism and the Reformation...\" The authors also stated that D\u00fcrer came to mind \"both by bourgeois self-awareness and by the then awakening German national sense of identity.\" The legacies of D\u00fcrer and the Great Peasants' War continued as artists produced their works in the GDR. Thomas M\u00fcntzer was another key figure of historical interest and artistic inspiration for socialist realism in East Germany. Friedrich Engels revered M\u00fcntzer for arousing the peasantry to confront the feudal elite.\nVisual art.\nSocialist realist visual art in East Germany was unique in its various historical influences. It also stood out with how the art style transcended the boundaries of the art doctrine at times, yet still maintained the goals the state had of communicating early forms of German revolutionary history. Werner T\u00fcbke was one of East Germany's most prominent painters, who demonstrated this expansive nature of socialist realist art in his country. Though his paintings did not always conform to the socialist realism doctrine, he was still \"able to portray the Socialist utopia, and in particular the understanding of history as held by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany...\nT\u00fcbke's style drew from the Renaissance art movement, as the GDR also emphasized this style in the creation of artwork, which they referred to as \"Erbe,\" or \"heritage\" art. He cited various Renaissance-era German painters whom he referenced in developing his art style in his \"Methodisches Handbuch,\" D\u00fcrer being one of them. He made several paintings depicting the lives of the working class and revolutionary struggle, in styles and compositions that resemble the historical German Renaissance paintings. His series of four triptychs called \"History of the German Working Class Movement\" was an example of this. Each painting was filled with action taking place on every part of the panel, along with several people in one scene, two common characteristics of German renaissance artwork.\nThe GDR aimed to use socialist realism to educate the German people about their history, through the lens of working-class struggle, and to evoke a sense of pride for their socialist state. The SED commissioned East German artists \"to produce paintings affirming the 'victors of history.'\" Werner T\u00fcbke was tasked to create his Early Bourgeois Revolution in Germany. The state wanted to have a visual reminder of the German Peasants' War and the leadership of M\u00fcntzer in the revolt. The highly detailed mural includes many different scenes and key figures of the revolution. D\u00fcrer is included at the bottom of the painting at the fountain. Edith Brandt, the Secretary for Science, Education, and Culture, believed that the mural \"would enhance the historical awareness of the population, especially the young, and serve the cause of patriotic education.\"\nEast German socialist realism started to shift in later decades, especially after the Basic Treaty, 1972 was signed by both East and West Germany. The treaty allowed East German artists to travel to West Germany and beyond to other European countries. Artistic exchanges between artists in both states introduced these new practices to the GDR, while socialist realism gained more attention by those outside of East Germany. Two exhibitions featuring artwork from both East and West Germany were curated at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1981. The exhibition for East German art presented itself as \"the good founded by socialist realism to better embody a possible alternative to the crisis of values experienced by the West.\"\nFilm.\nFilm was used as a teaching tool for East German cultural values. DEFA was the GDR's official film studio, which created such films. DEFA's socialist realist films were especially geared towards East German youth, as the next generation of the GDR. Leader of the SMAD's propaganda wing, Sergei Tiulpanov, asserted that the primary goal of DEFA was \"the struggle to re-educate the German people\u2013especially the young\u2013to a true understanding of genuine democracy and humanism.\" The studio produced children's films to influence them, as they believed these types of films to be effective in emphasizing good citizenship and how to show children how to emulate this.\nGerhard Lamprecht's Somewhere in Berlin (German: \"Irgendwo in Berlin\") was one of DEFA's most notable films. Though the film was produced in 1946, three years before the GDR was established, it was a foundation point for a broader development of East German socialist realist film. An antifascist film, Lamprecht emphasizes the necessity of \"reconstructing the nation\" after World War II. Preliminary East German films like \"Somewhere in Berlin\" \"laid the groundwork for a national film culture based in pedagogical intent.\"\nSome DEFA films were also derived from earlier German fairytales that predated the GDR. Paul Verhoeven's \"The Cold Heart\" (German: \"Das kalte Herz)\" was one of such films, which was based on the story written by Wilhelm Hauff of the same title. The film was produced to serve as a good example of how a person should treat others. The film's main messages centered on the pitfalls of greed and the value of loving personal relationships.\nDEFA also employed films to be used as history lessons for the people of East Germany, namely those about the German Peasants' War. Martin Hellberg's Thomas Muentzer (film) told the stories of his leadership and the revolution in a heroic and idealistic portrayal. DEFA saw Hellberg's film proposal as an opportunity to teach about German revolutionary history, as a means of preventing a descent into fascism again. The producers gave the actor portraying M\u00fcntzer lines that embrace Marxist thought, to clearly communicate ideals of socialism and the roles of the working class to viewers. Ideas about property re-distribution and a proletariat victory over the ruling classes are conveyed in the film's depiction of the revolutionary leader.\nLiterature.\nMany of East Germany's renowned writers lived through the Nazi regime, which influenced their craft and works with socialist realism. Anna Seghers' 1949 novel The Dead Stay Young (German: \"Die Toten Bleiben Jung\") was considered \"a foundational literary work for the young GDR.\" Critics commented on the pessimistic plot and message of the novel, as it was centered on the unsuccessful Spartacist uprising. Though the novel did not depict an ideal or optimistic view on socialism, critic G\u00fcnther Cwojdrak stated that Seghers still communicated reality by fulfilling \"the task of transforming the working people and educating them in the spirit of socialism...\"\nEast German literature that followed Seghers' novel focused on including heroes as protagonists to communicate optimistic messages of the prospects of socialism. Journalist Heinrich Goeres suggested that writers should use Soviet literature as an example to write more positive stories. Early works of socialist literature in the GDR were produced in 1949 \"to promote the new socialist man.\" In later years, stories about women's lives under socialism were written, and Christa Wolf and Brigitte Reimann were some of the authors who were involved in these widening developments. In the 1960s, the SED introduced the \"Bitterfelder Weg,\" a part of Aufbauliteratur, which was a plan to send writers to industrial centers to generate \"cultural production\" between the writers and workers.\nGender in socialist realism.\nUSSR.\nEarly Soviet period.\nIn the poster propaganda produced during the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922) men were overrepresented as workers, peasants, and combat heroes, and when women were shown, it was often either to symbolize an abstract concept (e.g., Mother Russia, \"freedom\") or as nurses and victims. The symbolic women would be depicted as feminine\u00a0\u2013 wearing long dresses, long hair, and bare breasts. The image of the urban proletariat, the group which brought the Bolsheviks to power was characterized by masculinity, physical strength, and dignity and were usually shown as blacksmiths.\nIn 1920, Soviet artists began to produce the first images of women proletarians. These women differed from the symbolic women from the 1910s in that they most closely resembled the aspects of the male workers\u00a0\u2013 dignity, masculinity, and even supernatural power in the case of blacksmiths. In many paintings in the 1920s, the men and women were almost indistinguishable in stature and clothing, but the women would often be depicted taking subservient roles to the men, such as being his assistant (\"rabotnitsa\"). These women blacksmith figures were less common, but significant, since it was the first time women were represented as proletarians. The introduction of women workers in propaganda coincided with a series of government policies which allowed for divorce, abortion, and more sexual freedom.\nPeasant women were also rarely depicted in socialist propaganda art in the period before 1920 as socialist realism was still at its inception. The typical image of a peasant was a bearded, sandal-shoed man in shoddy clothes and with a scythe, until 1920, when artists began to create peasant women, who were usually buxom, full-bodied, with a scarf tied around their head. The image of peasant women was not always positive; they often would evoke the derogatory caricature \"baba\", which was used against peasant women and women in general as some older stereotypes were still present from the Tsarist aristocracy.\nAs is discussed above, the art style during the early period of the Soviet Union (1917\u20131930) differed from the socialist realist art created during the Stalinist period. Artists were able to experiment more freely with the message of the revolution. Many Soviet artists during this period were part of the constructivist movement and used abstract forms for propaganda posters, while some chose to use a realist style. Women artists were significantly represented in the revolutionary avant garde movement, which began before 1917 and some of the most famous were Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Varvara Stepanova, Olga Rozanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova. These women challenged some of the historical precedents of male dominance in art. Art historian Christina Kiaer has argued that the post-revolutionary shift away from market-based art production was beneficial to female artists' careers, especially before 1930, when the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia (AKhRR) was still relatively egalitarian. Instead of an elite, individualistic group of disproportionately male \"geniuses\" produced by the market, artists shared creation of a common vision.\nStalin era.\nThe style of socialist realism began to dominate the Soviet artistic community starting when Stalin rose to power in 1930, and the government took a more active role in regulating art creation. The AKhRR became more hierarchical and the association privileged realist style oil paintings, a field dominated by men, over posters and other mediums in which women had primarily worked. The task of Soviet artists was to create visualisations of the \"New Soviet Man\"\u00a0\u2013 the idealized icon of humanity living under socialism. This heroic figure encapsulated both men and women, per the Russian word \"chelovek\", a masculine term meaning \"person\". While the new Soviet person could be male or female, the figure of man was often used to represent gender neutrality.\nBecause the government had declared the \"woman question\" resolved in 1930, there was little explicit discourse about how women should be uniquely created in art. Discussions of gender difference and sexuality were generally taboo and viewed as a distraction from the duties people had to the creation of socialism as the objectifying nature of western culture was not tolerated. Accordingly, nudes of both men and women were rare, and some art critics have pointed out that Socialist Realist paintings escaped the problem of women's sexual objectification commonly seen in capitalist forms of art production which had been considered progressive for its time unlike western institutions which carried old patriarchal cultural norms. But the declaration of women's equality also made it difficult to talk about the gender inequality that did exist; Stalin's government had simultaneously banned abortion and homosexuality as homosexuality was also banned in western capitalist countries as there were still remnants of feudalistic culture remaining in the USSR, made divorce more difficult as pre and post war conditions required more numbers of Soviet citizens to build up future workforces to oversee development, and dismantled the women's associations in government (Zhenotdels). The \"New Soviet Woman\" was often shown working in traditionally male jobs, such as aviation, engineering, tractor-driving, and politics as unlike western institutions which still prohibited women from participation until early to late war period. The point of this was to encourage women to join the workforce and show off the strides the USSR had made for women, especially in comparison with the United States. Indeed, women had expanded opportunities to take up traditionally male jobs in comparison to the US. In 1950, women made up 51.8% of the Soviet labor force, compared to just 28.3% in North America as most labor force in the US was reserved to women from the upper middle class and in elite positions.\nHowever, there were also many patriarchal depictions of women in pre and post WW2 period. Historian Susan Reid has argued that the cult of personality around male Soviet leaders created an entire atmosphere of patriarchy in Socialist Realist art, where both male and female workers often looked up to the \"father\" icon of Lenin and Stalin as they were seen as historical inspirations to look up to. Furthermore, the policies of the 1930s ended up forcing many women to be solely responsible for childcare, leaving them with the famous \"double burden\" of childcare and work duties. The government encouraged women to have children by creating portraits of the \"housewife-activist\"\u00a0\u2013 wives and mothers who supported their husbands and the socialist state by taking on unpaid housework and childcare.\nWomen were also more often shown as peasants than workers as in wartime men were required for active duty as previous feudalistic stereotypes were largely present, which some scholars see as evidence of their perceived inferiority stated by capitalist institutions. Art depicting peasant women in the Stalin era was far more positive than in the 1920s, and often explicitly pushed back against the \"baba\" stereotype. However, the peasantry, still living in feudal society, was generally seen as backwards, and did not hold the same status as the heroic status as the revolutionary urban proletariat. An example of the gender distinction of male proletariat and female peasantry is Vera Muhkina's statue \"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\" (1937), where the worker is shown as male, while the collective farm worker is female which signifies the wartime roles which people had to fulfill.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos\nMi-Go are a fictional race of extraterrestrials created by H. P. Lovecraft and used by others in the Cthulhu Mythos setting. The aliens are fungus-based lifeforms which are extremely varied due to their prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill. The variants witnessed by the protagonist of \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" resemble winged human-sized crabs.\nMi-Go are first named as such in Lovecraft's short story \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1931). However, since they are described in this story as \"fungi\" that come \"from Yuggoth,\" they can be considered an elaboration on earlier references to alien vegetation on dream-worlds in Lovecraft's sonnet cycle \"Fungi from Yuggoth\" (1929\u201330).\nDescription.\nThe Mi-Go are large, pinkish, fungoid, crustacean-like entities the size of a man; where a head would be, they have a \"convoluted ellipsoid\" composed of pyramided, fleshy rings and covered in antennae. They are about long, and their crustacean-like bodies bear numerous sets of paired appendages. They possess a pair of membranous bat-like wings which are used to fly through the \"aether\" of outer space. The wings do not function well on Earth. Several other races in Lovecraft's Mythos also have wings like these.\nIn the original short story, the creatures cannot be recorded using ordinary photographic film, due to their bodies being formed from otherworldly matter.\nThey are capable of going into suspended animation until softened and reheated by the sun or some other source of heat.\nThe Mi-Go can transport humans from Earth to Pluto (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's living brain and placing it into a \"brain cylinder\", which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.\nIn \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" the Mi-Go are heard to give praise to Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, suggesting some form of worship. Their moral system is completely alien, making them seem highly malicious from a human perspective.\nOne of the moons of Yuggoth holds designs that are sacred to the Mi-Go; these are useful in various processes mentioned in the \"Necronomicon\". It is said that transcriptions of these designs can be sensed by the Mi-Go, and those possessing them shall be hunted down by the few remaining on Earth.\nThe narrator of \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" learns that, ostensibly, a group known as the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign is dedicated to hunting down and exterminating the fungoid threat, though it is unknown if this is actually true since it was given as a pat explanation for the Mi-Go remaining hidden. The name \"Hastur\" is mentioned in passing among several other places and things, was eventually applied into a god-like alien being by August Derleth who gave Hastur the title \"Him Who is Not to be Named\". However, in Lovecraft's story, a human ally of the Mi-Go mentions \"Him Who Is Not to Be Named\" in the list of honored entities along with Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, and \"Hastur\" in connection with the cult of the Yellow Sign opposing the Mi-Go's work on Earth. Lovecraft never made a connection between Hastur and \"Him Who Is Not to Be Named\", and indeed did not even imply Hastur was a being; Derleth was the one to do so.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66493", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66493", "title": "Telecommunications in Iraq", "text": "Telecommunications in Iraq include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet as well as the postal system.\nRadio and television.\nThe number of private radio and TV stations has increased rapidly since 2003. Iraqis get much of their news from TV. Radio listening has declined in tandem with the rise of TV. For private media, advertising revenues seldom produce a reliable income.\nDuring the reign of Saddam Hussein, broadcasting was largely the domain of the Iraqi Broadcasting and Television Establishment (IBTE). The IBTE, in turn, was dominated by the Ministry of Information. The IBTE often broadcast programming favorable toward Saddam Hussein, including music videos praising him and poetry readings when the station was down. Most IBTE transmitters were in the Baghdad area with a few regional stations. The IBTE aired former CBS reporter Dan Rather's interview with Saddam Hussein, as well as the news from Baghdad Bob during the run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the IBTE was dissolved.\nThe current regulator is the Iraqi Communications and Media Commission, and the public broadcaster is the Iraqi Media Network, successor to the Coalition Provisional Authority's and several other radio and television stations. The Iraqi Media Network currently operates the Radio of the Republic of Iraq and the government supported al-Iraqiya TV station. Many private TV stations are also available, such as the popular Al Sharqiya. Up to 97% of homes have a satellite dish and there are more than 30 Iraq-facing satellite networks. Iraqi radio stations showcase the diversity of popular opinion, from hard-line Islamic fundamentalism to Radio Sawa, politically oriented stations, and stations featuring content appealing to Kurdish listeners. In the northern autonomous Kurdish enclaves, rival political factions operate their own media.\nThe BBC World Service broadcasts in Iraq, as does the American Forces Network (AFN) and British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS). Other foreign radio stations operating within Iraq include the UAE's Middle East Broadcasting Centre (MBC), Paris-based Monte Carlo Doualiya, Moyen-Orient, and Radio France International (RFI).\nTelephones.\nThe 2003 Iraq War severely disrupted telecommunications throughout Iraq, including international connections. The Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) under the U.S. State Department assisted the Iraqi Ministry of Communications by advising on the repair of switching capability and helping to devise the regulatory framework and licensing regimes for construction of mobile and satellite communications facilities. Many people and companies were involved in the reconstruction including private and public telecommunications companies from the United States, China, Turkey, and the Middle East. Special recognition must be given to the government of Japan and the World Bank Group for funding the first national microwave networks. Most credit goes to the staff of the Ministry of Communications and their operating personnel, and the numerous large and small service providers, who persevere under difficult working conditions. USAID funded several IT training programs with excellent international specialists as trainers and teachers.\nToday the system has undergone a remarkable transformation with high rates of annual investment and a functioning regulatory system, that is not quite independent of the political process, but still provides the framework for a competitive telecommunications regime. In 2013-2014 the system is under stress from renewed fighting between different political factions in Iraq.\nInternet.\nUnder the government of Saddam Hussein, Internet access was tightly controlled and very few people were thought to be online; in 2002 it was estimated that only 25,000 Iraqis used the Internet. With his ouster, Internet usage has become commonplace. Uruklink, originally the sole Iraqi Internet service provider, now faces competition from other ISPs, including broadband satellite Internet access services from both Middle East and European VSAT hubs. The primary military telecom service provider in Iraq is\nTs 2. Since 2006 several more companies have emerged to provide options to individual Iraqis that make Internet access more affordable, albeit with less bandwidth. One such business is Advanced Technology Systems-Iraq (ATS-Iraq).\nInternet censorship and surveillance.\nIn August 2009 the OpenNet Initiative found no evidence of Internet filtering in Iraq in all four of the areas for which they test (political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools).\nThere are no overt government restrictions on access to the Internet or official acknowledgement that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight. NGOs report that the government could and was widely believed to monitor e\u2011mail, chat rooms, and social media sites through local Internet service providers.\nThe constitution broadly provides for the right of free expression, provided it does not violate public order and morality or express support for the banned Baath Party or for altering the country's borders by violent means. In practice the main limitation on individual and media exercise of these rights is self-censorship due to real fear of reprisals by the government, political parties, ethnic and sectarian forces, terrorist and extremist groups, or criminal gangs. Libel and defamation are offenses under the penal law and the 1968 Publications Law with penalties of up to seven years' imprisonment for publicly insulting the government.\nAfter the release and media amplification of the controversial \"Innocence of Muslims\" Internet video in September 2012, Christian groups reported an increase in death threats. One militant group called the Brigade of the Straight Path issued an ultimatum to Christians in Mosul to leave or be killed. The government provided additional security in Christian neighborhoods following the threat. There were no deaths or attacks related to the threat, and the government reduced security to normal levels by the end of 2012.\nThe constitution mandates that authorities may not enter or search homes except with a judicial order. The constitution also prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy. In practice security forces often entered homes without search warrants and took other measures interfering with privacy, family, and correspondence.\nIn 2011 when a documentary filmmaker and author of a prominent blog organized the video coverage of peaceful protests over the Internet via a short, nonsubscription messaging service, he was beaten on 22 April and again on 22 July, allegedly by individuals in civilian clothing linked to the security forces and by army officers as he attempted to videotape demonstrations in Tahrir Square for his blog. He went into hiding, and a few days after the second attack police searched his house. He later resumed blogging.\nPostal system.\nAs part of the post-invasion social and economic infrastructure reconstruction program, a contract worth $55 million was awarded to study the postal system in Iraq. The Postal system of Iraq was organized following that study.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The third installment in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, it follows four orphans from the village of Ur who are chosen by the world's crystals to defeat a great evil and return balance to the world. The gameplay returns to the traditional combat system of the original game, and adds a job system allowing players to switch between character classes with unique abilities.\nDevelopment of \"Final Fantasy III\" was handled by multiple series veterans including director Hironobu Sakaguchi, designers Hiromichi Tanaka and Kazuhiko Aoki, writer Kenji Terada, composer Nobuo Uematsu, and programmer Nasir Gebelli in his final contribution to the series. Production was a struggle due to data management, and new elements were added to encourage player experimentation. The artwork was a collaborative effort between Koichi Ishii as character and job designer, Yoshitaka Amano as monster designer, and Kazuko Shibuya as main sprite artist. When it completed development, it was described as one of the largest games on the system.\nUpon its release in Japan, the game sold 1.4 million copies, and saw generally positive reviews, with most of the praise going to its job system. While ported to multiple platforms in later years, the original was not released outside Japan until 2021. A remake for the WonderSwan Color was planned but ultimately cancelled, while a 3D remake for the Nintendo DS was released internationally in 2006. The game saw the introduction of several recurring elements including a job system, summoned monsters and the Moogle. Terada also adapted it into a manga, and its characters and settings made appearances in later \"Final Fantasy\" titles.\nGameplay.\n\"Final Fantasy III\" is a role-playing video game in which the player takes on the role of four unnamed warriors embarking on a mission to save their world from darkness. The party explores the world on foot, using a chocobo, by boat, and eventually by airship. Towns are visited to progress the main quest through interactions with characters, resting at inns to recover health, and buy weapons, items and equipment from dedicated shops using the in-game currency gil. The overworld map opens up based on the player's progress through the story.\nWhile exploring the overworld and dungeon environments, the player is pulled into random encounters with enemies; the display is split between the players on one side of the battle field and enemies on the other. The combat system uses a turn-based design carried over from earlier games; the party members can attack, defend, perform a special action, or use an item which can heal or remove negative status effects. Once all characters' actions have been selected, combat plays out between them and the enemy. If the same enemy is targeted with two attacks and the first kills it, the next attack defaults to the next living enemy. The party gains currency and experience points, which adds to a character's experience level and raises their health and attack power. If the party is defeated, the game must be reloaded from a previous save point.\nA notable part of combat is a character class-based job system, which unlock dedicated abilities when equipped. The party starts out with the defeault Onion Knight job, but can gain and change jobs. Jobs include warriors, monks, black and white mages, ninjas, dragoon and summoners. Each job has a specific actions; summoners can call summoned monsters into battle to deal heavy damage, ninjas can steal, and dragoons can perform a jump attack. What job a character has equipped also changes what weapons and equipment they can use, and how the character levels up. Both changing jobs and unlocking job abilities are controlled with \"capacity points\" which are awarded to the party after battle, allowing the player to switch jobs at any time outside combat.\nSynopsis.\nSetting and characters.\n\"Final Fantasy III\" is set in an unnamed fantasy world protected by four elemental crystals. A millennium in the world's past, an ancient civilization based on a network of floating continents overused the power of light and triggered a disaster by upsetting the balance between light and darkness. This imbalance summoned the Cloud of Darkness, an entity which would return the world to nothingness. This threat was ended by two groups; the Warriors of Light and Warriors of Darkness. Balance was restored to the world, and the ancient civilization was destroyed. In the present, darkness is overtaking the world and spawning monsters, disrupting the balance again. The story opens in a region dubbed the Floating Continent, a land hovering above the rest of the planet.\nThe main characters of \"Final Fantasy III\" are four orphans from the village of Ur, chosen by the dying crystals to restore balance to the world as Warriors of Light; they begin using a default class dubbed the \"Onion Knight\", but can switch to any job role. The Warriors of Light meet several characters on their journey including Sara, a strong-willed princess; Desch, the last survivor of the ancient civilization; the elderly engineer Cid; Alus, prince of the surface kingdom of Saronia; and Doga and Unei, students of the ancient Magus Noah. The main antagonist is Xande, another student of Magus Noah who is creating the flood of darkness to achieve immortality. The Cloud of Darkness makes a brief appearance during the game's ending.\nPlot.\nAn earthquake opens up a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave near the village of Ur on the Floating Continent. Four young orphans explore the new cave, fighting a monster which turns out to be a test of strength from the dying Wind Crystal. Dubbing them the Warriors of Light, the crystal grands them the last of its power and instructs them to restore balance to the world. The Warriors set out to explore the Floating Continent, which has seen increased attacks from monsters. On their journey they aid the princess Sara in pacifying a rogue djinn, find Desch during a quest to destroy a tower threatening the region, and gain access to the airship Invincible from Cid. The Warriors also receive power from the Fire Crystal, which is under attack from servants of the mage Xande.\nAfter gaining the Invincible, they go beyond the Floating Continent for the first time in their lives, finding the surface world almost entirely flooded. On the surface, they complete further trials, receive the blessing of the Water Crystal, and help Alus reclaim his kingdom from his possessed father. The warriors then meet with Doga and Unei, who reveal Xande resents the gift of mortality their master gave and attacked the Crystals to halt time's flow, an attack which caused the Wind Crystal to raise the Floating Continent to safety. Gaining the final blessing from the Earth Crystal, and taking keys from Xande's most powerful servants, the Warriors and their allies break into his stronghold the Crystal Tower.\nThe Warriors of Light defeat Xande, but are too late to stop the imbalance he started, which summons the Cloud of Darkness who absorbs Xande and states its intent to return existence to the void. The Cloud of Darkness kills the Warriors, but Doga and Unei sacrifice themselves to revive them, allowing the Warriors to enter the world of darkness where the Dark Crystals reside and ally with the original Warriors of Darkness. The Warriors of Darkness sacrifice themselves to weaken the Cloud of Darkness, allowing the Warriors of Light to defeat and drive it back. The Crystals are revived and the world's balance restored, and the Warriors and their allies return to their old lives.\nDevelopment.\n\"Final Fantasy III\" was developed and published by series creator Square. Returning staff included series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi as director, and designers Hiromichi Tanaka and Kazuhiko Aoki. The producer was Masafumi Miyamoto, founder and former president of Square. It was the last \"Final Fantasy\" produced for Nintendo's Family Computer (Famicom) console, and was reportedly one of the largest games released for the platform as it required a 512 KB cartridge, the console's second-highest capacity. Tanaka described the game's development as \"a struggle\" due to how to properly use the game's limited data. The project was also the last original \"Final Fantasy\" to be programmed by Iranian-American programmer Nasir Gebelli, who had worked on the series since the first game. Midway through the development of the game, Gebelli was forced to return to Sacramento, California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there.\nThe battle system reverted to the traditional turn-based design of the original game following negative player feedback of \"Final Fantasy II\"'s design being difficult to understand. The character class-besed job system was suggested by Sakaguchi, who wanted to give players freedom to customize the party members; early in production it was dubbed the \"Crystal\" system. To differentiate character jobs within the game's limited combat options, each job was given a unique action such as the Dragoon's Jump ability. For \"Final Fantasy III\", the team developed a dedicated script engine to manage character movements within environments later dubbed \"Ether\", which would be carried forward into future titles. The final dungeon was notably difficult due to the lack of save points, which was attributed to Sakaguchi removing them in annoyance when a play tester complained that the final area was too easy. Several concepts originally planned for \"Final Fantasy II\" were implemented, including summoned monsters, and the Moogle creatures that were originally designed for \"Final Fantasy II\". Some of the technical aspects of handling battle animations, such as with the first completed summon Odin's signature attack, drew from the team's experience with creating scrolling environments in \"Rad Racer\" (1987).\nTanaka commented later that the story was given less focus due to the absence of Akitoshi Kawazu, and cited the world building as a collaborative process across the whole team. The scenario was written by Kenji Terada, who had worked on the previous two \"Final Fantasy\" titles; it would be his last contribution to the series, and he later felt it had disproportionately impacted his public image. As with previous titles due to hardware limits, the story was described by Sakaguchi as a series of connected events without strong characters. While Sakaguchi had previously not seen narrative as important, the death of his mother Aki in an accident during production of \"Final Fantasy III\" changed his outlook for future titles. As part of his feelings at the time, he incorporated a number of character death scenes into \"Final Fantasy III\".\nThe monsters and summons were designed by Yoshitaka Amano, while the characters were designed by Koichi Ishii. Amano described the work schedule for the game as \"tight\". While designs for earlier games used black and white line art, for \"Final Fantasy III\" he drew in color first. The jobs were also were designed by Ishii, who was brought on by Sakaguchi after finishing work on \"Makai Toushi SaGa\" (1989). Ishii remembered feeling dissatisfied with the in-game character sprites he created due to the Famicom's limited color palette, but was intrigued that aspects of those limited designs were carried forward into later games such as the White Mage's robe design. The in-game sprite art was handled by Kazuko Shibuya, who remembered that the design team expanded for the first time for \"Final Fantasy III\". She had troubled translating Amano's monster designs into the game and needed to make some compramises, such as changing the Cloud of Darkness's originally-upright pose into a horizontal one to fit the battle arena. The in-game airship \"Invincible\" was the largest asset in the game, taking up sixteen blocks of sprite art.\nMusic.\nThe music for \"Final Fantasy III\" was created by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Speaking in a 2025 interview, he remembered the composition for \"Final Fantasy III\" being different to the previous two titles due to input from Hiroshi Nakamura, a new sound programmer. It was during \"Final Fantasy III\" that Uematsu decided to make what became the \"Prelude\" and \"Main Theme\" recurring musical staples of the series, and also began creating dedicated pieces for comedic moments. The dungeon themes were written using minor chords to create a \"sense of eeriness\". One of the most notable themes, \"Eternal Wind\" was difficult for Uematsu to create as he wanted to create an echo effect that was not easy to accomplish within the hardware. During composition, Nakamura sound a little-used fifth sound track on the Famicom that triggered when bugs occured, which they used its sound to create a rolling drum beat for the battle theme's opening sting. \"Final Fantasy III\" was the last game Uematsu worked on to use the PSG sound chip, which he remembered as being \"inconvenient, but strangely charming\".\n\"Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version\", a compilation album of almost all of the music in the game, was released by Square/NTT Publishing in 1991, and subsequently re-released by NTT Publishing in 1994 and 2004. A vocal arrangement album entitled \"Final Fantasy III Y\u016bky\u016b no Kaze Densetsu\", or literally \"Final Fantasy III Legend of the Eternal Wind\", contains a selection of musical tracks from the game, performed by Nobuo Uematsu and Dido, a duo composed of Michiaki Kato and Sizzle Ohtaka. The album was released by Data M in 1990 and by Polystar in 1994.\nSelected tracks the game were featured in various \"Final Fantasy\" arranged music compilation albums, including ' and ' (with lyrical renditions performed by singer Risa Ohki), and the and albums from Uematsu's progressive metal group, The Black Mages. Several tracks from the game were subsequently remixed and featured in later Square or Square Enix titles, including \"Chocobo Racing\" and \"\". Several pieces from the soundtrack remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in \"Final Fantasy\" orchestral concert series such as the \"Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy\" concert series and the \"Distant Worlds - Music from Final Fantasy\" series.\nRelease.\n\"Final Fantasy III\" was published by Square for the Famicom on April 27, 1990. Multiple staff members including Ishii created promotional art for magazines during production. Amano created the cover art, working from the design instruction of a design featuring two swords. While there were plans for a localization outside Japan, Tanaka said this plan was scrapped so the team could focus on development for the upcoming Super Famicom. Ports of the game would be released through Nintendo's Virtual Console service in 2011 (Wii) and 2014 (Wii U and Nintendo 3DS); these versions became unavailable when the service shut down in 2019. It was also ported to iOS in 2011, Android in 2012, and Windows Phone in 2013. The first international release of its original version came as part of the \"Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster\" series, initially releasing on Windows and mobile platforms on July 28, 2021.\nCancelled WonderSwan Color remake.\nBandai unveiled their WonderSwan Color handheld system in 2000 and had immediately headed up a deal with Square to release enhanced remakes of their first three \"Final Fantasy\" titles on the new console. Although \"Final Fantasy\" and \"Final Fantasy II\" were both released within a year of the announcement, \"Final Fantasy III\" was ultimately delayed from its late 2001 release date, even after Bandai picked up the game's publishing rights. While a port of \"Final Fantasy IV\" was eventually released for the WonderSwan Color, Square remained silent regarding \"Final Fantasy III\". Although the game was never formally cancelled, the official website was taken offline once production of the WonderSwan Color consoles ceased in 2002. In 2007, Hiromichi Tanaka explained in an interview that the WonderSwan Color remake had been abandoned because the size and structure of the coding of the original Famicom game was too difficult to recreate on the WonderSwan Color.\n3D Remake.\nFollowing the WonderSwan's failure and the merger of Square with Enix in 2003, the newly-formed Square Enix sought to expand its game library onto more platforms, with the company promising to deliver a \"Final Fantasy III\" remake. \"Final Fantasy III\" was eventually remade by Square Enix and Matrix Software for the Nintendo DS, which had seen worldwide commercial success, with Tanaka returning as director and executive producer. The game was a complete 3D remake with an expanded story and CGI opening, while carrying over gameplay elements. The characters and jobs were redesigned by Akihiko Yoshida. The remake was released in 2006, and saw ports to other platforms in later years.\nReception.\nWithin its first week on sale, \"Final Fantasy III\" reportedly sold 500,000 copies. As of March 2003, the original Famicom game had shipped 1.4 million copies in Japan, outselling the domestic releases of the previous two \"Final Fantasy\" games.\nThe four reviewers of \"Famicom Ts\u016bshin\" (now \"Famitsu\") were generally positive, giving praise to the job system and combat design, with one reviewer feeling that it surpassed the design of \"Dragon Quest IV\" (1990) in some parts. One of the reviewers mentioned the story moved too quickly for comfort, leaving them confused about events, while two others criticized the lack of save points in dungeons. \"Family Computer Magazine\" enjoyed the return to the first game's traditional combat system while noting its new additions, and found the job system entertaining to experiment with. In 2006, readers of the Japanese gaming magazine \"Famitsu\" voted the original \"Final Fantasy III\" the eighth best video game of all-time, above \"Dragon Quest IV\".\nThe Windows release of the \"Pixel Remaster\" version earned a score of 79 points out of 100 on review aggregate website \"Metacritic\". In his review of the first three \"Pixel Remaster\" titles, \"RPG Site\"'s Scott White called \"Final Fantasy III\" \"the easiest one to recommend to long-time fans\" due to the replayability lent by its job system and the differences from its later 3D remake. Shaun Musgrave of \"Touch Arcade\" was very positive about the \"Pixel Remaster\" release compared to the 3D remake, enjoying its scale and implementation of the job system while noting that it might be difficult for series newcomers.\nZach Wilkerson of \"RPGFan\" positively noted its experimental design for its time and enjoyed the narrative despite its simplicity, but also noted a lack of depth with its mechanics and the need to grind for progression. \"Hardcore Gamer\"'s Chris Shive praised the game as a welcome refinement of mechanics introduced in the first two \"Final Fantasy\" games, but admitted some of its elements would appear archaic to modern players. \"Nintendo World Report\"'s Jordan Rudek noted the storytelling as saying within series conventions, and while positively noting the job system he felt it lacked depth compared to later iterations. His main praise went to the \"Pixel Remaster\" version's updated visuals and updates to help players. The \"Pixel Remaster\"'s reworked score met with general praise.\nLegacy.\nA manga adaptation of the game titled \"Legend of the Eternal Wind, from Final Fantasy III\" was written by Terada and illustrated by Yu Kinutani. Originally serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's \"Maru Katsu Famicom\" magazine between 1990 and 1992, it was collected into three three tank\u014dbon under Kadokawa Shoten's Dragon Comics imprint. A novelization written by Takashi Umemura, which novelised the events of the first three \"Final Fantasy\" games, was published in Japan by Square Enix in 2019 and by Yen Press worldwide in 2020.\nThe Onion Knight and Cloud of Darkness were the respective hero and villainess representing \"Final Fantasy III\" in the fighting game spin-off \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\" (2009) and its sequels. Several aspects of \"Final Fantasy III\", including characters such as the Cloud of Darkness and locations like the Crystal Tower, were incorporated into the world and lore of \"Final Fantasy XIV\" (2013).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Within the poem, the hippogriff is a steed born of a mare and a griffin\u2014something considered impossible. It is extremely fast and is presented as being able to fly around the world and to the Moon. It is ridden by magicians and the wandering knight Ruggiero, who, from the creature's back, frees the beautiful Angelica. Astolfo also borrows the hippogriff from Bradamante to go search for Roland's wits.\nThe hippogriff became a subject of visual art in the 19th century, when it was often drawn by Gustave Dor\u00e9.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"hippogriff\", also spelled \"hippogryph\", is derived from the , meaning \"horse\", and the Italian \"grifo\" meaning \"griffin\" (from Latin: \"gryp\" or \"grypus\" from ), which denotes another mythical creature, with the head of an eagle and body of a lion, that is purported to be the father of the hippogriff. The word \"hippogriff\" was adopted into English shortly before 1615; prior to this, John Harington's 1591 translation of \"Orlando furioso\" called the creature a \"Griffith horse.\"\nThe Hippogypians mentioned in \"Vera Historia\", a fantastic travelogue written by the Roman author Lucian of Samosata in the Second Century A.D. suggest another likely source for the word. However, in that text, the term is used to refer to a race of moon-dwelling riders that employ gigantic three-headed vultures as steeds.\nDescription.\nOf the heraldic representations of the hippogriff, Arthur Charles Fox-Davies states that hybrid fantastical creatures' depictions are \"ugly, inartistic, and unnecessary. Their representation leaves one with a disappointed feeling of crudity of draughtsmanship.\" John Vinycomb states that the hippogriff is not used in the British heraldic tradition.\nLudovico Ariosto's poem, \"Orlando furioso\" (1516) contains the following description (canto IV):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to Thomas Bulfinch's \"Legends of Charlemagne\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Like a griffin, it has the head of an eagle, claws armed with talons, and wings covered with feathers, the rest of its body being that of a horse. This strange animal is called a Hippogriff. The hippogriff is said to be an evil spirit resting and possessing its soul in that of a horse and griffon.\nBeliefs and symbolism.\nAccording to Vidal, a Spanish historian, this creature was supposed to live near C\u00e9ret, in the County of Roussillon of modern-day France, during the Middle Ages. Claw marks were found on a rock near Mas Carol. The belief in the existence of the hippogriff, such as Ariosto describes, is fiercely attacked in a scientific essay on religion in 1862, which argues that such an animal can neither be a divine creation, nor truly exist. The Book of Enoch quite clearly details how Satan and his fallen angels created various hybrids by admixture. The Sphinx is the best known such hybrid. The hippogriff is supposed to be a mixture of several animals and the author notes that in order to support its weight, the wings would be so heavy that flight would be impossible, which proves\u2014without question\u2014that it does not exist.\nIn some traditions, the hippogriff is said to be the symbol of love, as its parents, the mare and griffin, are natural enemies. In other traditions, the hippogriff represents Christ's dual nature as both human and divine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66499", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66499", "title": "Informal economy", "text": "Economic activity unregulated by government\nAn informal economy (informal sector or grey economy) is the part of any economy that is neither taxed nor monitored by any form of government. Although the informal sector makes up a significant portion of the economies in developing countries, it is sometimes stigmatized as troublesome and unmanageable. However, the informal sector provides critical economic opportunities for the poor and has been expanding rapidly since the 1960s. Integrating the informal economy into the formal sector is an important policy challenge.\nIn many cases, unlike the formal economy, activities of the informal economy are not included in a country's gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP). However, Italy has included estimates of informal activity in their GDP calculations since 1987, which swells their GDP by an estimated 18% and in 2014, a number of European countries formally changed their GDP calculations to include prostitution and narcotics sales in their official GDP statistics, in line with international accounting standards, prompting an increase between 3-7%. The informal sector can be described as a grey market in labour. Other concepts that can be characterized as informal sector can include the black market (shadow economy, underground economy), agorism, and System D. Associated idioms include \"under the table\", \"off the books\", and \"working for cash\".\nDefinition.\nThe original use of the term 'informal sector' is attributed to the economic development model put forward in 1955 by W. Arthur Lewis, used to describe employment or livelihood generation primarily within the developing world. It was used to describe a type of employment that was viewed as falling outside of the modern industrial sector. \nAn alternative definition from 2007 uses job security as the measure of formality, defining participants in the informal economy as those \"who do not have employment security, work security and social security\". While both of these definitions imply a lack of choice or agency in involvement with the informal economy, participation may also be driven by a wish to avoid regulation or taxation. This may manifest as unreported employment, hidden from the state for tax, social security or labour law purposes, but legal in all other aspects.\nIn 2016 Edgar L. Feige proposed a taxonomy for describing unobserved economies including the informal economy as being characterized by some form of \"non-compliant behavior with an institutional set of rules\". He argues that circumvention of labor market regulations specifying minimum wages, working conditions, social security, unemployment and disability benefits gives rise to an informal economy, which deprives some workers of deserved benefits while conveying undeserved benefits to others.\nThe term is also useful in describing and accounting for forms of shelter or living arrangements that are similarly unlawful, unregulated, or not afforded protection of the state. 'Informal economy' is increasingly replacing 'informal sector' as the preferred descriptor for this activity.\nInformality, both in housing and livelihood generation has historically been seen as a social ill, and described either in terms of what participant's lack, or wish to avoid. In 2009, the Dutch sociologist Saskia Sassen viewed the new 'informal' sector as the product and driver of advanced capitalism and the site of the most entrepreneurial aspects of the urban economy, led by creative professionals such as artists, architects, designers and software developers. While this manifestation of the informal sector remains largely a feature of developed countries, increasingly systems are emerging to facilitate similarly qualified people in developing countries to participate.\nHistory.\nGovernments have tried to regulate aspects of their economies for as long as surplus wealth has existed which is at least as early as Sumer. Yet no such regulation has ever been wholly enforceable.\nArchaeological and anthropological evidence strongly suggests that people of all societies regularly adjust their activity within economic systems in attempt to evade regulations. Therefore, if informal economic activity is that which goes unregulated in an otherwise regulated system then informal economies are as old as their formal counterparts, if not older. The term itself, however, is much more recent.\nThe optimism of the modernization theory school of development had led people in the 1950s and 1960s to believe that traditional forms of work and production would disappear as a result of economic progress in developing countries. As this optimism proved to be unfounded, scholars turned to study more closely what was then called the traditional sector and found that the sector had not only persisted, but in fact expanded to encompass new developments. In accepting that these forms of productions were there to stay, scholars and some international organizations quickly took up the term informal sector (later known as the informal economy or just informality). The term Informal income opportunities is credited to the British anthropologist Keith Hart in a 1971 study on Ghana published in 1973, and was coined by the International Labour Organization in a widely read study on Kenya in 1972.\nIn his 1989 book \"The Underground Economies: Tax Evasion and Information Distortion\", Edgar L. Feige examined the economic implications of a shift of economic activity from the observed to the non-observed sector of the economy. Such a shift not only reduces the government's ability to collect revenues, it can also bias the nation's information systems and therefore lead to misguided policy decisions. The book examines alternative means of estimating the size of various unobserved economies and examines their consequences in both socialist and market oriented economies. Feige goes on to develop a taxonomic framework that clarifies the distinctions between informal, illegal, unreported and unrecorded economies, and identifies their conceptual and empirical linkages and the alternative means of measuring their size and trends.\nSince then, the informal sector has become an increasingly popular subject of investigation in economics, sociology, anthropology and urban planning. With the turn towards so called post-fordist modes of production in the advanced developing countries, many workers were forced out of their formal sector work and into informal employment. In a 2005 collection of articles, \"The Informal Economy. Studies in Advanced and Less Developed Countries\", the existence of an informal economy in all countries was demonstrated with case studies ranging from New York City and Madrid to Uruguay and Colombia.\nAn influential book on the informal economy is Hernando de Soto's \"El otro sendero\" (1986), which was published in English in 1989 as \"The Other Path\" with a preface by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa. De Soto and his team argued that excessive regulation in the Peruvian and other Latin American economies forced a large part of the economy into informality and thus prevented economic development. While accusing the ruling class of 20th century mercantilism, de Soto admired the entrepreneurial spirit of the informal economy. In a widely cited experiment, his team tried to legally register a small garment factory in Lima. This took more than 100 administrative steps and almost a year of full-time work. Feige's review of the Other Path places the work in the context of the informal economy literature. Whereas de Soto's work is popular with policymakers and champions of free market policies like \"The Economist\", some scholars of the informal economy have criticized it both for methodological flaws and normative bias.\nIn the second half of the 1990s many scholars started to consciously use the term \"informal economy\" instead of \"informal sector\" to refer to a broader concept which includes enterprises as well as employment in developing, transition, and advanced industrialized economies.\nAmong the surveys about the size and development of the shadow economy (mostly expressed in percent of official GDP) are those by Feige (1989), and Schneider and Enste (2000) with an intensive discussion about the various estimation procedures of the size of the shadow economy as well as a critical evaluation of the size of the shadow economy and the consequences of the shadow economy on the official one. Feige's most recent survey paper on the subject from 2016 reviewed the meaning and measurement of unobserved economies and is particularly critical of estimates of the size of the so-called shadow economy which employ Multiple Indicator multiple cause methods, which treat the shadow economy as a latent variable.\nCharacteristics.\nThe informal sector is largely characterized by several qualities: skills gained outside of a formal education, easy entry (meaning anyone who wishes to join the sector can find some sort of work which will result in cash earnings), a lack of stable employer-employee relationships, and a small scale of operations. Workers who participate in the informal economy are typically classified as employed. The type of work that makes up the informal economy is diverse, particularly in terms of capital invested, technology used, and income generated.\nThe spectrum ranges from self-employment or unpaid family labor to street vendors, shoe shiners, and junk collectors. On the higher end of the spectrum are upper-tier informal activities such as small-scale service or manufacturing businesses, which have more limited entry. The upper-tier informal activities have higher set-up costs, which might include complicated licensing regulations, and irregular hours of operation. However, most workers in the informal sector, even those are self-employed or wage workers, do not have access to secure work, benefits, welfare protection, or representation.\nThese features differ from businesses and employees in the formal sector which have regular hours of operation, a regular location and other structured benefits.\nAccording to a 2018 study on informality in Brazil, there are three views to explain the causes of informality. The first view argues that the informal sector is a reservoir of potentially productive entrepreneurs who are kept out of formality by high regulatory costs, most notably entry regulation. The second sees informal forms as \"parasitic forms\" which are productive enough to survive in the formal sector but choose to remain informal to earn higher profits from the cost advantages of not complying with taxes and regulations. The third argues that informality is a survival strategy for low-skill individuals, who are too unproductive to ever become formal. According to the study the first view corresponds to 9.3 percent of all informal forms, while the second corresponds to 41.9 percent. The remaining forms correspond to low-skill entrepreneurs who are too unproductive to ever become formal. The author suggests that informal forms are to a large extent \"parasitic\" and therefore eradicating them (e.g., through tighter enforcement) could produce positive effects on the economy.\nThe most prevalent types of work in the informal economy are home-based workers and street vendors. Home-based workers are more numerous while street vendors are more visible. Combined, the two fields make up about 10\u201315% of the non-agricultural workforce in developing countries and over 5% of the workforce in developed countries.\nWhile participation in the informal sector can be stigmatized, many workers engage in informal ventures by choice, for either economic or non-economic reasons. Economic motivations include the ability to evade taxes, the freedom to circumvent regulations and licensing requirements, and the capacity to maintain certain government benefits. A study of informal workers in Costa Rica illustrated other economic reasons for staying in the informal sector, as well as non-economic factors. First, they felt they would earn more money through their informal sector work than at a job in the formal economy. Second, even if workers made less money, working in the informal sector offered them more independence, the chance to select their own hours, the opportunity to work outside and near friends, etc. While jobs in the formal economy might bring more security and regularity, or even pay better, the combination of monetary and psychological rewards from working in the informal sector proves appealing for many workers.\nThe informal sector was historically recognized as an opposition to formal economy, meaning it included all income earning activities beyond legally regulated enterprises. However, this understanding is too inclusive and vague, and certain activities that could be included by that definition are not considered part of the informal economy. As the International Labour Organization defined the informal sector in 2002, the informal sector does not include the criminal economy. While production or employment arrangements in the informal economy may not be strictly legal, the sector produces and distributes legal goods and services. The criminal economy produces illegal goods and services. The informal economy also does not include the reproductive or care economy, which is made up of unpaid domestic work and care activities. The informal economy is part of the market economy, meaning it produces goods and services for sale and profit. Unpaid domestic work and care activities do not contribute to that, and as a result, are not a part of the informal economy.\nStatistics.\nThe informal economy under any governing system is diverse and includes small-scaled, occasional members (often street vendors and garbage recyclers) as well as larger, regular enterprises (including transit systems such as that of La Paz, Bolivia). Informal economies include garment workers working from their homes, as well as informally employed personnel of formal enterprises. Employees working in the informal sector can be classified as wage workers, non-wage workers, or a combination of both.\nStatistics on the informal economy are unreliable by virtue of the subject, yet they can provide a tentative picture of its relevance. For example, informal employment makes up 58.7% of non-agricultural employment in Middle East \u2013 North Africa, 64.6% in Latin America, 79.4% in Asia, and 80.4% in sub-Saharan Africa. If agricultural employment is included, the percentages rise, in some countries like India and many sub-Saharan African countries beyond 90%. Estimates for developed countries are around 15%. In recent surveys, the informal economy in many regions has declined over the past 20 years to 2014. In Africa, the share of the informal economy has decreased to an estimate of around 40% of the economy.\nIn developing countries, the largest part of informal work, around 70%, is self-employed. Wage employment predominates. The majority of informal economy workers are women. Policies and developments affecting the informal economy have thus a distinctly gendered effect.\nEstimated size of countries' informal economy.\nTo estimate the size and development of any underground or shadow economy is quite a challenging task since participants in such economies attempt to hide their behaviors. One must also be very careful to distinguish whether one is attempting to measure the unreported economy, normally associated with tax evasion, or the unrecorded or non-observed economy, associated with the amount of income that is readily excluded from national income and produce accounts due to the difficulty of measurement.\nThere are numerous estimates of tax noncompliance as measured by tax gaps produced by audit methods or by \"top down\" methods.\nFriedrich Schneider and several co-authors claim to have estimated the size and trend of what they call the \"shadow economy\" worldwide by a currency demand /MIMIC model approach that treats the \"shadow economy\" as a latent variable. Trevor S. Breusch has critiqued the work and warned the profession that the literature applying this model to the underground economy\nabounds with alarming Procrustean tendencies. Various kinds of sliding and scaling of the results are carried out in the name of \"benchmarking\", although these operations are not always clearly\ndocumented. The data are typically transformed in ways that are not only undeclared but have the unfortunate effect of making the results of the study sensitive to the units in which the variables are measured.\nThe complexity of the estimation procedure, together with its deficient documentation, leave the reader unaware of how these results have been shorted to fit the bed of prior belief. There are many\nother results in circulation for various countries, for which the data cannot be identified and which are given no more documentation than \"own calculations by the MIMIC method\". Readers are advised to\nadjust their valuation of these estimates accordingly.\nEdgar L. Feige finds that Schneider's shadow economy \"estimates suffer from conceptual flaws, apparent manipulation of results and insufficient documentation for replication, questioning their place in the academic, policy and popular literature\".\nComparison of shadow economies in EU countries.\nAs of 2013, the total EU shadow economy had been growing to about 1.9 trillion \u20ac in preparation of the EURO driven by the motor of the European shadow economy, Germany, which had been generating approx. 350 bn \u20ac per year since the establishment of the Single Market in Maastricht 1993, (see diagram on the right). Hence, the EU financial economy had developed an efficient tax haven bank system to protect and manage its growing shadow economy. As per the Financial Secrecy Index (FSI 2013) Germany and some neighbouring countries, ranked among the world's top tax haven countries.\nThe diagram below shows that national informal economies per capita vary only moderately in most EU countries. This is because market sectors with a high proportion of informal economy (above 45%) like the construction sector or agriculture are rather homogeneously distributed across countries, whereas sectors with a low proportion of informal economy (below 30%) like the finance and business sector (e.g. in Switzerland, Luxembourg), the public service and personal Service Sector (as in Scandinavian countries) as well as the retail industry, wholesale and repair sector are dominant in countries with extremely high GDP per capita i.e. industrially highly developed countries. The diagram also shows that in absolute numbers the shadow economy per capita is related to the wealth of a society (GDP). Generally spoken, the higher the GDP the higher the shadow economy, albeit non-proportional.\nThere is a direct relationship between high self-employment of a country to its above average shadow economy. In highly industrialized countries where shadow economy (per capita) is high and the huge private sector is shared by an extremely small elite of entrepreneurs a considerable part of tax evasion is practised by a much smaller number of (elite) people. As an example German shadow economy in 2013 was \u20ac4.400 per capita, which was the 9th highest place in EU, whereas according to OECD only 11.2% of employed people were self-employed (place 18). On the other hand, Greece's shadow economy was only \u20ac3.900 p.c (place 13) but self-employment was 36.9% (place 1).\nAn extreme example of shadow economy camouflaged by the financial market is Luxembourg where the relative annual shadow economy is only 8% of the GDP which is the second lowest percentage (2013) of all EU countries whereas its absolute size (\u20ac6.800 per capita) is the highest.\nSocial and political implications and issues.\nAccording to development and transition theories, workers in the informal sector typically earn less income, have unstable income, and do not have access to basic protections and services. The informal economy is also much larger than most people realize, with women playing a huge role. The working poor, particularly women, are concentrated in the informal economy, and most low-income households rely on the sector to provide for them. However, informal businesses can also lack the potential for growth, trapping employees in menial jobs indefinitely. On the other hand, the informal sector can allow a large proportion of the population to escape extreme poverty and earn an income that is satisfactory for survival. Also, in developed countries, some people who are formally employed may choose to perform part of their work outside of the formal economy, exactly because it delivers them more advantages. This is called 'moonlighting'. They derive social protection, pension and child benefits and the like, from their formal employment, and at the same time have tax and other advantages from working on the side.\nFrom the viewpoint of governments, the informal sector can create a vicious cycle. Being unable to collect taxes from the informal sector, the government may be hindered in financing public services, which in turn makes the sector more attractive. Conversely, some governments view informality as a benefit, enabling excess labor to be absorbed, and mitigating unemployment issues. Recognizing that the informal economy can produce significant goods and services, create necessary jobs, and contribute to imports and exports is critical for governments.\nAs the work in informal sector is not monitored or registered with the state, its workers are not entitled to social security, and they face unique challenges when affiliated in or creating trade unions. Informal economy workers are more likely to work long hours than workers in the formal economy who are protected by employment laws and regulations. A landmark study conducted by the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization found that exposure to long working hours caused an estimated 745,000 fatalities from ischemic heart disease and stroke events in 2016. A systematic review and meta-analysis of health services use and health outcomes among informal economy workers, when compared with formal economy workers, found that these workers are less likely to use health services and more likely to have depression, highlighting their substantial health disadvantage.\nGender.\nIn developing countries, most of the female non-agricultural labor force is in the informal sector. Female representation in the informal sector is attributed to a variety of factors. One such factor is that employment in the informal sector is the source of employment that is most readily available to women. A 2011 study of poverty in Bangladesh noted that cultural norms, religious seclusion, and illiteracy among women in many developing countries, along with a greater commitment to family responsibilities, prevent women from entering the formal sector.\nMajor occupations in the informal sector include home-based workers (such as dependent subcontract workers, independent own account producers, and unpaid workers in family businesses) and street vendors, which both are classified in the informal sector. Women tend to make up the greatest portion of the informal sector, often ending up in the most erratic and corrupt segments of the sector. In India, women working in the informal sector often work as ragpickers, domestic workers, coolies, vendors, beauticians, construction laborers, and garment workers.\nAccording to a 2002 study commissioned by the ILO, the connection between employment in the informal economy and being poor is stronger for women than men. While men tend to be over-represented in the top segment of the informal sector, women overpopulate the bottom segment. Men are more likely to have larger-scale operations and deal in non-perishable items while few women are employers who hire others. Instead, women are more likely to be involved in smaller-scale operations and trade food items. Women are under-represented in higher-income employment positions in the informal economy and over-represented in lower-income statuses. As a result, the gender gap in terms of wage is higher in the informal sector than the formal sector. Labor markets, household decisions, and states all propagate this gender inequality.\nPolitical power of agents.\nWorkers in the informal economy lack a significant voice in government policy. Not only is the political power of informal workers limited, but the existence of the informal economy creates challenges for other politically influential actors. For example, the trade unions struggle to organize the informal economy and often formal workers organized in unions have no immediate interest in improving the status of informal workers due to fears of status loss. Yet the informal economy negatively affects membership and investment in the trade unions. Laborers who might be formally employed and join a union for protection may choose to branch out on their own instead. While this hostile attitude is not always the case, the nature of informal employment - low and irregular income that is not enough to pay union dues, fast-changing decentralized work locations and a self-perception of informal workers as self-employed pose barriers to informal economy trade union organizing. As a result, trade unions are inclined to oppose the informal sector, highlighting the costs and disadvantages of the system. Producers in the formal sector can similarly feel threatened by the informal economy. The flexibility of production, low labor and production costs, and bureaucratic freedom of the informal economy can be seen as consequential competition for formal producers, leading them to challenge and object to that sector. Last, the nature of the informal economy is largely anti-regulation and free of standard taxes, which diminishes the material and political power of government agents. Whatever the significance of these concerns are, the informal sector can shift political power and energies.\nPoverty.\nThe relationship between the informal sectors and poverty certainly is not simple nor does a clear, causal relationship exist. An inverse relationship between an increased informal sector and slower economic growth has been observed though.\nAverage incomes are substantially lower in the informal economy and there is a higher preponderance of impoverished employees working in the informal sector. In addition, workers in the informal economy are less likely to benefit from employment benefits and social protection programs. For instance, a survey in Europe shows that the respondents who have difficulties to pay their household bills have worked informally more often in the past year than those that do not (10% versus 3% of the respondents).\nChildren and child labour.\nChildren work in the informal economy in many parts of the world. They often work as scavengers (collecting recyclables from the streets and dump sites), day laborers, cleaners, construction workers, vendors, in seasonal activities, domestic workers, and in small workshops; and often work under hazardous and exploitative conditions.\n It is common for children to work as domestic servants in parts of Latin America and parts of Asia. Such children are very vulnerable to exploitation: often they are not allowed to take breaks or are required to work long hours; many suffer from a lack of access to education, which can contribute to social isolation and a lack of future opportunity. UNICEF considers domestic work to be among the lowest status, and reports that most child domestic workers are live-in workers and are under the round-the-clock control of their employers. Some estimates suggest that among girls, domestic work is the most common form of employment.\nDuring times of economic crisis many families experience unemployment and job loss, thus compelling adolescents to supplement their parents\u2019 income by selling goods or services to contribute to the family economy. At the core, youth must compromise their social activities with other youth, and instead prioritize their participation in the informal economy, thus manufacturing a labor class of adolescents who must take on an adult role within the family. Although it revolves around a negative stigma of deviance, for a majority of individuals, mostly people of color, the informal economy is not an ideal choice but a necessity for survival. Participating in the informal economy is becoming normalized due to the lack of resources available in low-income and marginalized communities, and no matter how hard they have to work, will not advance in the economic hierarchy. When a parent is either unemployed or their job is on low demand, they are compelled to find other methods to provide for themselves but most importantly their children. Yet, due to all the limitations and the lack of jobs, children eventually cooperate with their parent/s and also work for their family's economic well-being. By having to assist in providing for the family, children miss out on their childhood because instead of engaging in activities other youth their age participate in, they are obligated to take on an adult role, put the family first and contribute to the family's well-being.\nThe participation of adolescents in the informal economy, is a contentious issue due to the restrictions and laws in place for youth have to work. One of the main dilemmas that arise when children engage in this type of work, is that privileged adults, denounce children participation as forced labor. Due to the participant being young, the adults are viewed as \u201cbad\u201d parents because first they cannot provide for their children, second they are stripping the child from a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood, and third, child labor is frowned upon. Furthermore, certain people believe that children should not be working because children do not know the risks and the pressure of working and having so much responsibility, but the reality is that for most families, the children are not being forced to work, rather they choose to help sustain their family's income. The youth become forced by their circumstances, meaning that because of their conditions, they do not have much of a choice. Youth have the capability to acknowledge their family's financial limitations and many feel that it is their moral obligation to contribute to the family income. Thus, they end up working without asking for an allowance or wage, because kids recognize that their parents cannot bring home enough income alone, thus their contribution is necessary and their involvement becomes instrumental for their family's economic survival.\nEmir Estrada and Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo have gone to predominantly Latino communities of Los Angeles, CA. to observe the daily actions of street vendors. They analyze why adults participate in the informal economy. Although it revolves around a negative stigma of deviance, for a majority of individuals, the informal economy is not an ideal choice but an action necessary for survival. While witnessing the constant struggle of Latino individuals to make ends meet and trying to earn money to put food on the table, they witnessed how the participation of children either benefits the family or even hurt it. Through field notes derived from their participation, Estrada states, \u201cchildren are not the \u2018baggage\u2019 that adult immigrants simply bring along. In the case of street vendors, we see that they are also contributors to family processes\u201d. Estrada's findings demonstrate that children are working in order to help contribute to their household income, but most importantly, they play a vital role when it comes to language barriers. The kids are not simply workers, they achieve an understanding of how to manage a business and commerce.\nExpansion and growth.\nThe division of the economy into formal and informal sectors has a long heritage. Arthur Lewis in his seminal work \"Economic Development with Unlimited Supply of Labour\", published in the 1950s, was the celebrated paradigm of development for the newly independent countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The model assumed that the unorganized sector with the surplus labour will gradually disappear as the surplus labour gets absorbed in the organised sector. The Lewis model is drawn from the experience of capitalist countries in which the share of agriculture and unorganized sector showed a spectacular decline, but it didn't prove to be true in many developing countries, including India. On the other hand, probabilistic migration models developed by Harris and Todaro in the 1970s envisaged the phenomenon of the informal sector as a transitional phase through which migrants move to the urban centers before shifting to formal sector employment. Hence it is not a surprise to see policy invisibility in the informal sector. Curiously, the informal sector does not find a permanent place in the Marxian theory since they anticipate the destruction of the pre-capitalist structure as a result of the aggressive growth of capitalism. To them, in the course of development, 'the small fish is being eaten by the big fish'. Therefore, neither in the Marxian theory nor in the classical economic theory, the unorganized sector holds a permanent place in the economic literature.\nThe informal sector has been expanding as more economies have started to liberalize.\nThis pattern of expansion began in the 1960s when a lot of developing countries didn't create enough formal jobs in their economic development plans, which led to the formation of an informal sector that didn't solely include marginal work and actually contained profitable opportunities. In the 1980s, the sector grew alongside formal industrial sectors. In the 1990s, an increase in global communication and competition led to a restructuring of production and distribution, often relying more heavily on the informal sector.\nOver the past decade, the informal economy is said to account for more than half of the newly created jobs in Latin America. In Africa it accounts for around eighty percent. Many explanations exist as to why the informal sector has been expanding in the developing world throughout the past few decades. It is possible that the kind of development that has been occurring has failed to support the increased labor force in a formal manner. Expansion can also be explained by the increased subcontracting due to globalization and economic liberalization. Finally, employers could be turning toward the informal sector to lower costs and cope with increased competition.\nSuch extreme competition between industrial countries occurred after the expansion of the EC to markets of the then new member countries Greece, Spain and Portugal, and particularly after the establishment of the Single European Market (1993, Treaty of Maastricht). Mainly for French and German corporations it led to systematic increase of their informal sectors under liberalized tax laws, thus fostering their mutual competitiveness and against small local competitors. The continuous systematic increase of the German informal sector was stopped only after the establishment of the EURO and the execution of the Summer Olympic Games 2004, which has been the first and (up to now) only in the Single Market. Since then the German informal sector stabilized on the achieved 350 bn \u20ac level which signifies an extremely high tax evasion for a country with 90% salary-employment.\nAccording to the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the key drivers for the growth of the informal economy in the twenty-first century include:\nHistorically, development theories have asserted that as economies mature and develop, economic activity will shift from the informal to the formal sphere. In fact, much of the economic development discourse is centered around the notion that formalization indicates how developed a country's economy is; for more on this discussion see the page on fiscal capacity. However, evidence suggests that the progression from informal to formal sectors is not universally applicable. While the characteristics of a formalized economy \u2013 full employment and an extensive welfare system \u2013 have served as effective methods of organizing work and welfare for some nations, such a structure is not necessarily inevitable or ideal. Indeed, development appears to be heterogeneous in different localities, regions, and nations, as well as the type of work practiced. For example, at one end of the spectrum of the type of work practiced in the informal economy are small-scale businesses and manufacturing; on the other \"street vendors, shoe shiners, junk collectors and domestic servants.\" Regardless of how the informal economy develops, its continued growth that it cannot be considered a temporary phenomenon.\nPolicy suggestions.\nAs it has been historically stigmatized, policy perspectives viewed the informal sector as disruptive to the national economy and a hindrance to development. The justifications for such criticisms include viewing the informal economy as a fraudulent activity that results in a loss of revenue from taxes, weakens unions, creates unfair competition, leads to a loss of regulatory control on the government's part, reduces observance of health and safety standards, and reduces the availability of employment benefits and rights. These characteristics have led to many nations pursuing a policy of deterrence with strict regulation and punitive procedures.\nIn a 2004 report, the Department for Infrastructure and Economic Cooperation under SIDA explained three perspectives on the role of government and policy in relation to the informal economy.\nAs informal economy has significant job creation and income generation potential, as well as the capacity to meet the needs of poor consumers by providing cheaper and more accessible goods and services, many stakeholders subscribe to the third perspective and support government intervention and accommodation. Embedded in the third perspective is the significant expectation that governments will revise policies that have favored the formal sphere at the expense of the informal sector.\nTheories of how to accommodate the informal economy argue for government policies that, recognizing the value and importance of the informal sector, regulate and restrict when necessary but generally work to improve working conditions and increase efficiency and production.\nThe challenge for policy interventions is that so many different types of informal work exist; a solution would have to provide for a diverse range of circumstances. A possible strategy would be to provide better protections and benefits to informal sector players. However, such programs could lead to a disconnect between the labor market and protections, which would not actually improve informal employment conditions. In a 2014 report monitoring street vending, WIEGO suggested urban planners and local economic development strategists study the carrying capacity of areas regularly used by informal workers and deliver the urban infrastructure necessary to support the informal economy, including running water and toilets, street lights and regular electricity, and adequate shelter and storage facilities. That study also called for basic legal rights and protections for informal workers, such as appropriate licensing and permit practices.\nAn ongoing policy debate considers the value of government tax breaks for household services such as cleaning, babysitting and home maintenance, with an aim to reduce the shadow economy's impact. There are currently systems in place in Sweden and France which offer 50 percent tax breaks for home cleaning services. There has also been debate in the UK about introducing a similar scheme, with potentially large savings for middle-class families and greater incentive for women to return to work after having children. The European Union has used political measures to try to curb the shadow economy. Although no definitive solution has been established, the EU council has led dialogue on a platform that would combat undeclared work.\nThe World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on \"The Changing Nature of Work\" discusses the extension of social assistance and insurance schemes to informal workers given that, in 2018, 8 in 10 people in developing countries still receive no social assistance and 6 in 10 work informally.\nAsia-Pacific.\nThe International Labour Organization mentioned that in most developing nations located in the Asia-Pacific, the informal sector comprises a significant and vital percentage of the labor force. This sector constitutes around 60 percent of the labor force. Informal economy includes economic activities of laborers (legally and in practice) which are not or inadequately covered by official employment contracts or agreements. Informal employment means payment of wagers may not be guaranteed and retrenchment can be implemented without prior notice or compensation from employers. There are generally substandard health and safety conditions as well as nonexistence of social benefits which include sick pay, pension, and health coverage. The informal economy absorbs a larger part of the ever-growing workforce in urban hubs. In 2015, urban populations of Asian countries started to grow while the service sector also continued to increase. These developments contributed to the extensive expansion of urban informal economy in practically all of Asia.\nIn India, the country's informal sector accounted for over 80 percent of the non-agricultural industry during the last 20 years. Inadequate employment denotes the option for majority of India's citizens is to find work in the informal sector which continues to grow because of the contract system and outsourcing of production. An article in First Post (June 2018) said approximately 1.3 billion people or more than 68 percent of employed persons in the Asia-Pacific earn through the informal economy. It is prevalent in the countryside (around 85 percent) and almost 48 percent in urban locations. 2 billion of the global population (61 percent) works in the informal sector. According to an article published in Eco-Business in June 2018, the informal sector has emerged as an essential component of the economic environment of cities in this region. Henceforth, the importance of contribution of informal workers deserves recognition.\nFor a more detailed overview focused on informal employment in South Asian countries, see Informal economy of South Asia.\nIconography.\nThe triptych \"La familia informal\" (The Informal Family, 1992) by painter Herman Braun-Vega, held in the permanent collection of the Ralli Museum in Marbella, explores the theme of the informal economy. Created as part of a series of sixteen paintings on syncretism and mestizaje (racial and cultural mixing) for a retrospective exhibition in Madrid in 1992 during the celebrations of the fifth centenary of the Encounter of Two Worlds, this triptych associates the informal economy in developing countries \u2013 defined by the artist as \"an economic system linked to survival, autonomous from the State and escaping taxation\" \u2013 with a reflection on mestizaje and social integration.\nDrawing inspiration from the architectural structure of Vel\u00e1zquez's \"Las Meninas\", Braun-Vega depicts \"popular characters from the informal economy\" alongside members of his family and artistic and literary figures, constituting what he calls an \"informal family\". The work was used in an educational program by the French Ministry of Education, Culture and Francophonie during the 1994-1995 school year, where it was presented in thirteen schools as educational material on subsistence economies and cultural exchange between peoples.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

That which is kept hidden is known as the secret.\nSecrecy is often controversial, depending on the content or nature of the secret, the group or people keeping the secret, and the motivation for secrecy.\nSecrecy by government entities is often decried as excessive or in promotion of poor operation; excessive revelation of information on individuals can conflict with virtues of privacy and confidentiality. It is often contrasted with social transparency.\nSecrecy can exist in a number of different ways: encoding or encryption (where mathematical and technical strategies are used to hide messages), true secrecy (where restrictions are put upon those who take part of the message, such as through government security classification) and obfuscation, where secrets are hidden in plain sight behind complex idiosyncratic language (jargon) or steganography.\nAnother classification proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948 reads that there are three systems of secrecy within communication:\nSociology.\nAnimals conceal the location of their den or nest from predators. Squirrels bury nuts, hiding them, and they try to remember their locations later.\nHumans attempt to consciously conceal aspects of themselves from others due to shame, or from fear of violence, rejection, harassment, loss of acceptance, or loss of employment. Humans may also attempt to conceal aspects of their own self which they are not capable of incorporating psychologically into their conscious being. Families sometimes maintain \"family secrets\", obliging family members never to discuss disagreeable issues concerning the family with outsiders or sometimes even within the family. Many \"family secrets\" are maintained by using a mutually agreed-upon construct (an official family story) when speaking with outside members. Agreement to maintain the secret is often coerced through \"shaming\" and reference to family honor. The information may even be something as trivial as a recipe.\nSecrets are sometimes kept to provide the pleasure of surprise. This includes keeping secret about a surprise party, not telling spoilers of a story, and avoiding exposure of a magic trick.\nKeeping one's strategy \"secret\"\u2013 is important in many aspects of game theory.\nIn anthropology secret sharing is one way for people to establish traditional relations with other people. A commonly used narrative that describes this kind of behavior is Joseph Conrad's short story \"The Secret Sharer\".\nGovernment.\nGovernments often attempt to conceal information from other governments and the public. These state secrets can include weapon designs, military plans, diplomatic negotiation tactics, and secrets obtained illicitly from others (\"intelligence\"). Most nations have some form of Official Secrets Act (the Espionage Act in the U.S.) and classify material according to the level of protection needed (hence the term \"classified information\"). An individual needs a http:// for access and other protection methods, such as keeping documents in a safe, are stipulated.\nFew people dispute the desirability of keeping Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information secret, but many believe government secrecy to be excessive and too often employed for political purposes. Many countries have laws that attempt to limit government secrecy, such as the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and sunshine laws. Government officials sometimes leak information they are supposed to keep secret. (\"For a recent (2005) example, see Plame affair.\")\nSecrecy in elections is a growing issue, particularly secrecy of vote counts on computerized vote counting machines. While voting, citizens are acting in a unique sovereign or \"owner\" capacity (instead of being a subject of the laws, as is true outside of elections) in selecting their government servants. It is argued that secrecy is impermissible as against the public in the area of elections where the government gets all of its power and taxing authority. In any event, permissible secrecy varies significantly with the context involved.\nCorporations.\nOrganizations, ranging from multi-national for profit corporations to nonprofit charities, keep secrets for https://, to meet legal requirements, or, in some cases, to conceal nefarious behavior. New products under development, unique manufacturing techniques, or simply lists of customers are types of information protected by trade secret laws.\nResearch on corporate secrecy has studied the factors supporting secret organizations. In particular, scholars in economics and management have paid attention to the way firms participating in cartels work together to maintain secrecy and conceal their activities from antitrust authorities. The diversity of the participants (in terms of age and size of the firms) influences their ability to coordinate to avoid being detected.\nThe patent system encourages inventors to publish information in exchange for a limited time monopoly on its use, though patent applications are initially secret. Secret societies use secrecy as a way to attract members by creating a sense of importance.\nShell companies may be used to launder money from criminal activity, to finance terrorism, or to evade taxes. Registers of beneficial ownership aim at fighting corporate secrecy in that sense.\nOther laws \"require\" organizations to keep certain information secret, such as medical records (HIPAA in the U.S.), or financial reports that are under preparation (to limit insider trading). Europe has particularly strict laws about database privacy.\nComputing.\nPreservation of secrets is one of the goals of information security. Techniques used include physical security and cryptography. The latter depends on the secrecy of https://. Many believe that security technology can be more effective if it itself is not kept secret.\nhttps:// is a design principle in much software engineering. It is considered easier to verify software reliability if one can be sure that different parts of the program can only access (and therefore depend on) a known limited amount of information.\nMilitary.\nMilitary secrecy is the concealing of information about martial affairs that is purposely not made available to the general public and hence to any enemy, in order to gain an advantage or to not reveal a weakness, to avoid embarrassment, or to help in propaganda efforts. Most military secrets are tactical in nature, such as the strengths and weaknesses of weapon systems, tactics, training methods, plans, and the number and location of specific weapons. Some secrets involve information in broader areas, such as secure communications, cryptography, intelligence operations, and cooperation with third parties.\nUS Government rights in regard to military secrecy were uphold in the landmark legal case of \"United States v. Reynolds\", decided by the Supreme Court in 1953.\nViews.\nExcessive secrecy is often cited as a source of much human conflict. One may have to lie in order to hold a secret, which might lead to psychological repercussions. The alternative, declining to answer when asked something, may suggest the answer and may therefore not always be suitable for keeping a secret. Also, the other may insist that one answer the question.\nNearly 2500 years ago, Sophocles wrote: 'Do nothing secretly; for Time sees and hears all things, and discloses all.'.

{"id": "66511", "revid": "1318767086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66511", "title": "MX record", "text": "Type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS)\nA mail exchanger record (MX record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. It is a resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS). It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of mail servers for load balancing and redundancy. \nOverview.\nResource records are the basic information element of the Domain Name System (DNS). An MX record is one of these, and a domain may have one or more of these set up, as below:\nThe characteristic payload information of an MX record is a preference value (above labelled \"Priority\"), and the domain name of a mailserver (\"Host\" above). \nThe priority field identifies which mailserver should be preferred - in this case the values are both 10, so mail would be expected to flow evenly to both \"onemail.example.com\" and \"twomail.example.com\" - a common configuration. The host name must map directly to one or more address records (A, or AAAA) in the DNS, and must not point to any CNAME records.\nWhen an e-mail message is sent through the Internet, the sending mail transfer agent (MTA) queries the Domain Name System for the MX records of each recipient's domain name. This query returns a list of host names of mail exchange servers accepting incoming mail for that domain and their preferences. The sending agent then attempts to establish an SMTP connection, trying the host with the lowest \"Priority\" value first. The system allows high-availability clusters of mail gateways to be built for one domain if necessary.\nThe MX mechanism does not grant the ability to provide mail service on alternative port numbers, nor does it provide the ability to distribute mail delivery across a set of unequal-priority mail servers by assigning a weighting value to each one.\nMX preference, distance, and priority.\nAccording to RFC 5321, the lowest-numbered records are the most preferred. This phrasing can be confusing, and so the \"preference number\" is sometimes referred to as the \"distance\": smaller distances are more preferable. An older RFC, RFC 974, indicates that when the preference numbers are the same for two servers, they have the same \"priority\", hence those two terms are used interchangeably.\nThe preference number is an unsigned 16-bit field, thus valid values range from 0 to 65535.\nThe basics.\nIn the simplest case, a domain may have just one mail server. For example, if an MTA looks up the MX records for example.com, and the DNS server replied with only mail.example.com with a preference number of 50, then the MTA will attempt delivery of the mail to the server listed. In this case, the number 50 could have been any integer permitted by the SMTP specification.\nWhen more than one server is returned for an MX query, the server with the smallest preference number must be tried first. If there is more than one MX record with the same preference number, all of those must be tried before moving on to lower-priority entries. An SMTP client \"must\" be able to try (and retry) each of the relevant addresses in the list in order, until a delivery attempt succeeds.\nLoad distribution.\nThe standard approach to distributing a load of incoming mail over an array of servers is to return the same preference number for each server in the set. When determining which server of equal preference to send mail to, \"the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific organization\", unless there is a clear reason to favor one. \nAn alternative approach is to use multihomed servers, where the one host returns several IP addresses. This method places the burden on the DNS rather than the SMTP-sender to perform the load balancing, which in this case will present a list of IP addresses in a specific order to the clients querying the A record of the mail exchanger. Since the RFC requires that the SMTP-sender use the order given in the A record query, the DNS server is free to carefully manipulate its balancing based on any method, including round robin DNS, mail server load, or some undisclosed priority scheme.\nSpammers.\nSpammers may deliberately direct mail to one of the backup (high distance) MX servers of a domain first, on the assumption that such a server will have less effective anti-spam filters. An anti-spam technique called nolisting is based on assuming this behaviour.\nHandling of delivery failure.\nThe SMTP RFC is ambiguous about exactly what kinds of delivery failure must result in re-attempting delivery via more distant MX records (those with higher preference values).\nWhen servers indicate temporary failures, either by explicitly sending a 4xx error or by ending the connection unexpectedly (which must be treated as a 451 error, according to http:// of the RFC), http:// says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The sender MUST delay retrying a particular destination after one attempt has failed.\nHowever, when the sender retries, the RFC is silent about whether this should be to the same server, or a more \"distant\" MX record. It does say, in http://:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When the lookup succeeds, the mapping can result in a list of alternative delivery addresses rather than a single address, because of multiple MX records, multihoming, or both. To provide reliable mail transmission, the SMTP client MUST be able to try (and retry) each of the relevant addresses in this list in order, until a delivery attempt succeeds.\nSome servers (such as Sendmail and Postfix 2.1 or later), will attempt the next-furthest MX server after some types of temporary delivery failures, such as greeting failures. Other servers (such as qmail and Postfix 2.0 or earlier) will only use more distant MX records if the servers specified in the shortest-distance MX records could not be contacted at all. Despite the difference, both behaviors are valid - since the RFC is not specific.\nFallback to the address record.\nIn the absence of an MX record, email senders will attempt delivery to the address record - e.g. example.com.\nThis is based on RFC 5321 sec. 5.1, which states :\nHistorical background.\nRFC 821 was published in 1982. It makes only passing references to DNS, because at the time the transition from HOSTS.TXT to the DNS had not yet started. RFC 883, the first description of the DNS, was published over a year later in late 1983. It described the experimental and little used MD and MF records. According to RFC 897 and RFC 921, the transition to DNS started in 1983, but HOSTS.TXT was not scheduled to be phased out until the end of 1985 and was not totally phased out until the late 1990s.\nIn January 1986, RFC 973 and RFC 974 deprecated the MD and MF records, replaced them with MX, and defined the MX lookup with fallback to A. RFC 974 recommends that clients do a WKS lookup on each MX host to see if it actually supports SMTP and discard the MX entry if not. However, RFC 1123 changed this to say that WKS \"should not\" be checked.\nThis means that SMTP had been in use for at least a year using HOSTS.TXT, and then another couple of years using A, MD, and MF, before MX came along. MD and MF were hard to use, so most people just used the A record. Under the circumstances, MX without fallback to A would not have worked because of the substantial installed base of mail servers using A records. The early use of MX was to identify gateways to other networks, but it did not come into wide use until the DNS was well established in the early 1990s.\nStandards documents.\nObsoletes:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66512", "revid": "47120006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66512", "title": "Fern", "text": "Class of vascular plants\nThe ferns (Polypodiopsida or Polypodiophyta) are a group of vascular plants (land plants with vascular tissues such as xylem and phloem) that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from non-vascular plants (mosses, hornworts and liverworts) by having specialized transport bundles that conduct water and nutrients from and to the roots, as well as life cycles in which the branched sporophyte is the dominant phase.\nFerns have complex leaves called megaphylls that are more complex than the microphylls of clubmosses. Most ferns are leptosporangiate ferns that produce coiled fiddleheads that uncoil and expand into fronds. The group includes about 10,560 known extant species. Ferns are defined here in the broad sense, being all of the Polypodiopsida, comprising both the leptosporangiate (Polypodiidae) and eusporangiate ferns, the latter group including horsetails, whisk ferns, marattioid ferns and ophioglossoid ferns.\nThe fern crown group, consisting of the leptosporangiates and eusporangiates, is estimated to have originated in the late Silurian period 423.2 million years ago during the rapid radiation of land plants, but Polypodiales, the group that makes up 80% of living fern diversity, did not appear and diversify until the Cretaceous, contemporaneous with the rise of flowering plants that came to dominate the world's flora.\nFerns are not of major economic importance, but some are used for food, medicine, as biofertilizer, as ornamental plants, and for remediating contaminated soil. They have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the atmosphere. Some fern species, such as bracken (\"Pteridium aquilinum\") and water fern (\"Azolla filiculoides\"), are significant weeds worldwide. Some fern genera, such as \"Azolla\", can fix nitrogen and make a significant input to the nitrogen nutrition of rice paddies. They also play certain roles in folklore.\nDescription.\nSporophyte.\nExtant ferns are herbaceous perennials and most lack woody growth. When woody growth is present, it is found in the stem. Their foliage may be deciduous or evergreen, and some are semi-evergreen depending on the climate. Like the sporophytes of seed plants, those of ferns consist of stems, leaves and roots. Ferns differ from spermatophytes in that they reproduce by spores rather than having flowers and producing seeds. However, they also differ from spore-producing bryophytes in that, like seed plants, they are polysporangiophytes, their sporophytes branching and producing many sporangia. Also unlike bryophytes, fern sporophytes are free-living and only briefly dependent on the maternal gametophyte.\nThe green, photosynthetic part of the plant is technically a and in ferns, it is often called a \"frond\". New leaves typically expand by the unrolling of a tight spiral called a crozier or fiddlehead into fronds. This uncurling of the leaf is termed circinate vernation. Leaves are divided into two types: sporophylls and tropophylls. Sporophylls produce spores; tropophylls do not. Fern spores are borne in sporangia which are usually clustered to form sori. The sporangia may be covered with a protective coating called an indusium. The arrangement of the sporangia is important in classification.\nIn monomorphic ferns, the fertile and sterile leaves look morphologically the same, and both are able to photosynthesize. In hemidimorphic ferns, just a portion of the fertile leaf is different from the sterile leaves. In dimorphic (holomorphic) ferns, the two types of leaves are morphologically distinct. The fertile leaves are much narrower than the sterile leaves, and may have no green tissue at all, as in the Blechnaceae and Lomariopsidaceae.\nThe anatomy of fern leaves can be anywhere from simple to highly divided, or even indeterminate (e.g. Gleicheniaceae, Lygodiaceae). The divided forms are pinnate, where the leaf segments are completely separated from one other, or pinnatifid (partially pinnate), where the leaf segments are still partially connected. When the fronds are branched more than once, it can also be a combination of the pinnatifid are pinnate shapes. If the leaf blades are divided twice, the plant has bipinnate fronds, and tripinnate fronds if they branch three times, and all the way to tetra- and pentapinnate fronds. In tree ferns, the main stalk that connects the leaf to the stem (known as the stipe), often has multiple leaflets. The leafy structures that grow from the stipe are known as pinnae and are often again divided into smaller pinnules.\nFern stems are often loosely called rhizomes, even though they grow underground only in some of the species. Epiphytic species and many of the terrestrial ones have above-ground creeping stolons (e.g., Polypodiaceae), and many groups have above-ground erect semi-woody trunks (e.g., Cyatheaceae, the scaly tree ferns). These can reach up to tall in a few species (e.g., \"Cyathea brownii\" on Norfolk Island and \"Cyathea medullaris\" in New Zealand).\nRoots are underground non-photosynthetic structures that take up water and nutrients from soil. They are always fibrous and are structurally very similar to the roots of seed plants.\nGametophyte.\nAs in all vascular plants, the sporophyte is the dominant phase or generation in the life cycle. The gametophytes of ferns, however, are very different from those of seed plants. They are free-living and resemble liverworts, whereas those of seed plants develop within the spore wall and are dependent on the parent sporophyte for their nutrition. A fern gametophyte typically consists of:\nLife cycle and reproduction.\nThe lifecycle of a fern involves two stages, as in club mosses and horsetails. In stage one, the spores are produced by sporophytes in sporangia, which are clustered together in sori (s.g. \"sorus\"), developing on the underside of fertile fronds. In stage two, the spores germinate into short-lived gamete-producing structures called gametophytes anchored to the ground by rhizoids. When a mature fertile frond bears sori, and spores are released, the spores will settle on the soil and germinate to form initial rhizoids and protonemata that develop into the gametophyte's prothallus. The prothallus bears spherical antheridia (s.g. \"antheridium\") which produce antherozoids (male gametophytes) and archegonia (s.g. \"archegonium\") which release a single oosphere. The antherozoid swims up the archegonium and fertilizes the oosphere, resulting in a zygote, which will grow into a separate sporophyte, while the gametophyte shortly persists as a free-living plant.\nTaxonomy.\nCarl Linnaeus (1753) originally recognized 15 genera of ferns and fern allies, classifying them in class Cryptogamia in two groups, Filices (e.g. \"Polypodium\") and Musci (mosses). By 1806 this had increased to 38 genera, and has progressively increased since (\"see \"). Ferns were traditionally classified in the class Filices, and later in a Division of the Plant Kingdom named Pteridophyta or Filicophyta. Pteridophyta is no longer recognised as a valid taxon because it is paraphyletic. The ferns are also referred to as Polypodiophyta or, when treated as a subdivision of Tracheophyta (vascular plants), Polypodiopsida, although this name sometimes only refers to leptosporangiate ferns. Traditionally, all of the spore producing vascular plants were informally denominated the pteridophytes, rendering the term synonymous with ferns and fern allies. This can be confusing because members of the division Pteridophyta were also denominated pteridophytes (\"sensu stricto\").\nTraditionally, three discrete groups have been denominated ferns: two groups of eusporangiate ferns, the families Ophioglossaceae (adder's tongues, moonworts, and grape ferns) and Marattiaceae; and the leptosporangiate ferns. The Marattiaceae are a primitive group of tropical ferns with large, fleshy rhizomes and are now thought to be a sibling taxon to the leptosporangiate ferns. Several other groups of species were considered fern allies: the clubmosses, spikemosses, and quillworts in Lycopodiophyta; the whisk ferns of Psilotaceae; and the horsetails of Equisetaceae. Since this grouping is polyphyletic, the term fern allies should be abandoned, except in a historical context. More recent genetic studies demonstrated that the Lycopodiophyta are more distantly related to other vascular plants, having radiated evolutionarily at the base of the vascular plant clade, while both the whisk ferns and horsetails are as closely related to leptosporangiate ferns as the ophioglossoid ferns and Marattiaceae. In fact, the whisk ferns and ophioglossoid ferns are demonstrably a clade, and the horsetails and Marattiaceae are arguably another clade.\nMolecular phylogenetics.\nSmith et al. (2006) carried out the first higher-level pteridophyte classification published in the molecular phylogenetic era, and considered the ferns as monilophytes, as follows:\nMolecular data, which remain poorly constrained for many parts of the plants' phylogeny, have been supplemented by morphological observations supporting the inclusion of Equisetaceae in the ferns, notably relating to the construction of their sperm and peculiarities of their roots.\nThe leptosporangiate ferns are sometimes called \"true ferns\". This group includes most plants familiarly known as ferns. Modern research supports older ideas based on morphology that the Osmundaceae diverged early in the evolutionary history of the leptosporangiate ferns; in certain ways this family is intermediate between the eusporangiate ferns and the leptosporangiate ferns. Rai and Graham (2010) broadly supported the primary groups, but queried their relationships, concluding that \"at present perhaps the best that can be said about all relationships among the major lineages of monilophytes in current studies is that we do not understand them very well\". Grewe et al. (2013) confirmed the inclusion of horsetails within ferns \"sensu lato\", but also suggested that uncertainties remained in their precise placement. Other classifications have raised Ophioglossales to the rank of a fifth class, separating the whisk ferns and ophioglossoid ferns.\nPhylogeny.\nThe ferns are related to other groups as shown in the following cladogram:\nNomenclature and subdivision.\nThe classification of Smith et al. in 2006 treated ferns as four classes:\nIn addition they defined 11 orders and 37 families. That system was a consensus of a number of studies, and was further refined. The phylogenetic relationships are shown in the following cladogram (to the level of orders). This division into four major clades was then confirmed using morphology alone.\nSubsequently, Chase and Reveal considered both lycopods and ferns as subclasses of a class Equisetopsida (Embryophyta) encompassing all land plants. This is referred to as Equisetopsida \"sensu lato\" to distinguish it from the narrower use to refer to horsetails alone, Equisetopsida \"sensu stricto\". They placed the lycopods into subclass Lycopodiidae and the ferns, keeping the term monilophytes, into five subclasses, Equisetidae, Ophioglossidae, Psilotidae, Marattiidae and Polypodiidae, by dividing Smith's Psilotopsida into its two orders and elevating them to subclass (Ophioglossidae and Psilotidae). Christenhusz et al. (2011) followed this use of subclasses but recombined Smith's Psilotopsida as Ophioglossidae, giving four subclasses of ferns again.\nChristenhusz and Chase (2014) developed a new classification of ferns and lycopods. They used the term Polypodiophyta for the ferns, subdivided like Smith et al. into four groups (shown with equivalents in the Smith system), with 21 families, approximately 212 genera and 10,535 species;\nThis was a considerable reduction in the number of families from the 37 in the system of Smith et al., since the approach was more that of lumping rather than splitting. For instance a number of families were reduced to subfamilies. Subsequently, a consensus group was formed, the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG), analogous to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, publishing their first complete classification in November 2016. They recognize ferns as a class, the Polypodiopsida, with four subclasses as described by Christenhusz and Chase, and which are phylogenetically related as in this cladogram:\nIn the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the Polypodiopsida consist of four subclasses, 11 orders, 48 families, 319 genera, and an estimated 10,578 species. Thus Polypodiopsida in the broad sense (\"sensu lato\") as used by the PPG (Polypodiopsida \"sensu\" PPG I) needs to be distinguished from the narrower usage (\"sensu stricto\") of Smith et al. (Polypodiopsida \"sensu\" Smith et al.) Classification of ferns remains unresolved and controversial with competing viewpoints (splitting vs lumping) between the systems of the PPG on the one hand and Christenhusz and Chase on the other, respectively. In 2018, Christenhusz and Chase explicitly argued against recognizing as many genera as PPG I.\nEvolution and biogeography.\nFern-like taxa (\"Wattieza\") first appear in the fossil record in the middle Devonian period, ca. 390\u00a0Mya. By the Triassic, the first evidence of ferns related to several modern families appeared. The great fern radiation occurred in the late Cretaceous, when many modern families of ferns first appeared. Ferns evolved to cope with low-light conditions present under the canopy of angiosperms.\nRemarkably, the photoreceptor neochrome in the two orders Cyatheales and Polypodiales, integral to their adaptation to low-light conditions, was obtained via horizontal gene transfer from hornworts, a bryophyte lineage.\nDue to the very large genome seen in most ferns, it was suspected they might have gone through whole genome duplications, but DNA sequencing has shown that their genome size is caused by the accumulation of mobile DNA like transposons and other genetic elements that infect genomes and get copied over and over again.\nFerns appear to have evolved extrafloral nectaries 135 million years ago, nearly simultaneously with the trait's evolution in angiosperms. However, nectary-associated diversifications in ferns did not hit their stride until nearly 100 million years later, in the Cenozoic. There is weak support for the rise of fern-feeding arthropods driving this diversification.\nDistribution and habitat.\nFerns are widespread in their distribution, with the greatest richness in the tropics and least in arctic areas. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical rainforests. New Zealand, for which the fern is a symbol, has about 230 species, distributed throughout the country. It is a common plant in European forests.\nEcology.\nFern species live in a wide variety of habitats, from remote mountain elevations, to dry desert rock faces, bodies of water or open fields. Ferns in general may be thought of as largely being specialists in marginal habitats, often succeeding in places where various environmental factors limit the success of flowering plants. Some ferns are among the world's most serious weed species, including the bracken fern growing in the Scottish highlands, or the mosquito fern (\"Azolla\") growing in tropical lakes, both species forming large aggressively spreading colonies. There are four particular types of habitats that ferns are found in: moist, shady forests; crevices in rock faces, especially when sheltered from the full sun; acid wetlands including bogs and swamps; and tropical trees, where many species are epiphytes (something like a quarter to a third of all fern species).\nEspecially the epiphytic ferns have turned out to be hosts of a huge diversity of invertebrates. It is assumed that bird's-nest ferns alone contain up to half the invertebrate biomass within a hectare of rainforest canopy.\nMany ferns depend on associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Many ferns grow only within specific pH ranges; for instance, the climbing fern (\"Lygodium palmatum\") of eastern North America will grow only in moist, intensely acid soils, while the bulblet bladder fern (\"Cystopteris bulbifera\"), with an overlapping range, is found only on limestone.\nThe spores are rich in lipids, protein and calories, so some vertebrates eat these. The European woodmouse (\"Apodemus sylvaticus\") has been found to eat the spores of \"Culcita macrocarpa\", and the bullfinch (\"Pyrrhula murina\") and the New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat (\"Mystacina tuberculata\") also eat fern spores.\nLife cycle.\nFerns are vascular plants differing from lycophytes by having true leaves (megaphylls), which are often pinnate. They differ from seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) in reproducing by means of spores and lacking flowers and seeds. Like all land plants, they have a life cycle referred to as alternation of generations, characterized by alternating diploid sporophytic and haploid gametophytic phases. The diploid sporophyte has 2\"n\" paired chromosomes, where \"n\" varies from species to species. The haploid gametophyte has \"n\" unpaired chromosomes, i.e. half the number of the sporophyte. The gametophyte of ferns is a free-living organism, whereas the gametophyte of the gymnosperms and angiosperms is dependent on the sporophyte.\nThe life cycle of a typical fern proceeds as follows:\nSometimes a gametophyte can give rise to sporophyte traits like roots or sporangia without the rest of the sporophyte.\nUses.\nFerns are not as important economically as seed plants, but have considerable importance in some societies. Some ferns are used for food, including the fiddleheads of \"Pteridium aquilinum\" (bracken), \"Matteuccia struthiopteris\" (ostrich fern), and \"Osmundastrum cinnamomeum\" (cinnamon fern). \"Diplazium esculentum\" is also used in the tropics (for example in \"budu pakis\", a traditional dish of Brunei) as food. Tubers from the \"para\", \"Ptisana salicina\" (king fern) are a traditional food in New Zealand and the South Pacific. Fern tubers were used for food 30,000 years ago in Europe. Fern tubers were used by the Guanches to make gofio in the Canary Islands. Ferns are generally not known to be poisonous to humans. Licorice fern rhizomes were chewed by the natives of the Pacific Northwest for their flavor. Some species of ferns are carcinogenic, and the British Royal Horticultural Society has advised not to consume any species for health reasons of both humans and livestock.\nFerns of the genus \"Azolla\", commonly known as water fern or mosquito ferns are very small, floating plants that do not resemble ferns. The mosquito ferns are used as a biological fertilizer in the rice paddies of southeast Asia, taking advantage of their ability to fix nitrogen from the air into compounds that can then be used by other plants.\nFerns have proved resistant to phytophagous insects. The gene that express the protein Tma12 in an edible fern, \"Tectaria macrodonta\", has been transferred to cotton plants, which became resistant to whitefly infestations.\nMany ferns are grown in horticulture as landscape plants, for cut foliage and as houseplants, especially the Boston fern (\"Nephrolepis exaltata\") and other members of the genus \"Nephrolepis\". The bird's nest fern (\"Asplenium nidus\") is also popular, as are the staghorn ferns (genus \"Platycerium\"). Perennial (also known as hardy) ferns planted in gardens in the northern hemisphere also have a considerable following.\nSeveral ferns, such as bracken and \"Azolla\" species are noxious weeds or invasive species. Further examples include Japanese climbing fern (\"Lygodium japonicum\"), sensitive fern (\"Onoclea sensibilis\") and Giant water fern (\"Salvinia molesta\"), one of the world's worst aquatic weeds. The important fossil fuel coal consists of the remains of primitive plants, including ferns.\nCulture.\nPteridology.\nThe study of ferns and other pteridophytes is called pteridology. A pteridologist is a specialist in the study of pteridophytes in a broader sense that includes the more distantly related lycophytes.\nPteridomania.\nPteridomania was a Victorian era craze which involved fern collecting and fern motifs in decorative art including pottery, glass, metals, textiles, wood, printed paper, and sculpture \"appearing on everything from christening presents to gravestones and memorials.\" The fashion for growing ferns indoors led to the development of the Wardian case, a glazed cabinet that would exclude air pollutants and maintain the necessary humidity.\nOther applications.\nThe Barnsley fern is a fractal named after the British mathematician Michael Barnsley who first described it in his book \"Fractals Everywhere\". A self-similar structure is described by a mathematical function, applied repeatedly at different scales to create a frond pattern.\nThe dried form of ferns was used in other arts, such as a stencil or directly inked for use in a design. The botanical work, \"The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland\", is a notable example of this type of nature printing. The process, patented by the artist and publisher Henry Bradbury, impressed a specimen on to a soft lead plate. The first publication to demonstrate this was Alois Auer's \"The Discovery of the Nature Printing-Process\".\nFern bars were popular in America in the 1970s and 80s.\nFolklore.\nFerns figure in folklore, for example in legends about mythical flowers or seeds. In Slavic folklore, ferns are believed to bloom once a year, during the Ivan Kupala night. Although alleged to be exceedingly difficult to find, anyone who sees a fern flower is thought to be guaranteed to be happy and rich for the rest of their life. Similarly, Finnish tradition holds that one who finds the seed of a fern in bloom on Midsummer night will, by possession of it, be guided and be able to travel invisibly to the locations where eternally blazing Will o' the wisps called \"aarnivalkea\" mark the spot of hidden treasure. These spots are protected by a spell that prevents anyone but the fern-seed holder from ever knowing their locations. In Wicca, ferns are thought to have magical properties such as a dried fern can be thrown into hot coals of a fire to exorcise evil spirits, or smoke from a burning fern is thought to drive away snakes and such creatures.\nNew Zealand.\nThe Silver fern is the national emblem of New Zealand and feature on its passport and in the design of its national airline, Air New Zealand, and of its rugby team, the All Blacks.\nOrganisms confused with ferns.\nMisnomers.\nSeveral non-fern plants (and even animals) are called ferns and are sometimes confused with ferns. These include:\nFern-like flowering plants.\nSome flowering plants such as palms and members of the carrot family have pinnate leaves that somewhat resemble fern fronds. However, these plants have fully developed seeds contained in fruits, rather than the microscopic spores of ferns.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Members of the movement are referred to as the \"Temple Mount Faithful\". The group was established in 1967.\nOn 8 October 1990, seventeen Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police in the 1990 Temple Mount riots triggered by an announcement by the Temple Mount Faithful that they were going to lay a cornerstone for a Third Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. After the riots, the police prohibited Salomon from entering the Temple Mount; his appeal of that decision was subsequently denied by Israel's High Court of Justice.\nThe Temple Mount Faithful was the first significant group to advocate the Jewish takeover of the Temple Mount, and during the 1970s and 1980s, it remained the most visible group with that position. Initially, the group presented its argument largely in terms of nationalistic, rather than religious, symbolism. In a 1983 interview, Salomon stated that \"whoever controls the Temple Mount has rights over the Land of Israel\". Over time, Gershon Salomon developed a more religiously oriented apocalyptic and messianic platform, which, however, was distinctly non-Orthodox in character. Tensions with the more Orthodox elements in the group caused a formal split in 1987, when a more religiously-oriented splinter group, called the \"Movement for the Establishment of the Temple\", was founded. Subsequently, the influence of the Temple Mount Faithful among the radical Jewish activists gradually waned, although the group still retains significant visibility.\nOrganization operations.\nThe Temple Mount Faithful functions as a protest movement, but, unlike some other radical Jewish groups, it attempts to operate within Israeli law. Typically, shortly before major Jewish religious festivals, the group requests a permit from the Israeli police to enter the Temple Mount compound and conduct prayer services there. These requests are routinely denied, and are followed by petitions to Israel's High Court of Justice. The High Court, also routinely, permits the group to enter the site, but not to pray there; and such permit is contingent on the Israeli police concluding that the security situation would allow such entry. The police conclude that the entry cannot be permitted for security reasons, and the Temple Mount Faithful are not allowed to enter the Temple Mount compound. As a result, their demonstrations usually proceed to the Mograbi Gate, and are stopped by the police there, outside of the compound.\nIn recent years, Salomon increasingly shifted the focus of the Temple Mount Faithful in the apocalyptic and messianic direction, and restoration of the Jewish Temple became one of the central objectives of the movement. During the same period, the movement developed close ties with Christian fundamentalist circles, and it receives significant financial assistance from some Christian groups, particularly in the United States.\nDeath of Gershon Solomon.\nOn November 23, 2022, Gershon Salomon, founder of the Temple Mount Faithful, died. Although banned from the Temple Mount for many years, he was allowed to make one visit during the last year of his life.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He went on to be a military commander during the War of the Austrian Succession and Commander-in-Chief of the Forces during the Jacobite rising of 1745. While commanding the British Crown forces in Scotland, Wade was responsible for constructing hundreds of miles of military roads, many of which remain in use.\nEarly career.\nBorn the son of Jerome Wade in Killavally, County Westmeath, Ireland, he spent his early years in English Tangier, where his father was a member of the Tangier Garrison. Wade was commissioned into the Earl of Bath's Regiment on 26 December 1690 and served in Flanders in 1692, fighting at the Battle of Steenkerque in August 1692 during the Nine Years' War and earning a promotion to lieutenant on 10 February 1693. He transferred to Sir Bevil Granville's Regiment on 19 April 1694 and was promoted to captain on 13 June 1695.\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession, he first served under Marlborough, seeing action in Flanders at the Siege of Kaiserwerth in April 1702, the Siege of Venlo in September 1702, the Siege of Roermond in October 1702 and the Capture of Li\u00e8ge also in October 1702. He was promoted to major on 20 March 1703 and to lieutenant colonel in October 1703. In 1704 he joined the staff of Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway as adjutant-general in Portugal, and distinguished himself as colonel of the Huntingdon's Regiment during the Battle of Alc\u00e1ntara, where he was wounded in April 1706. He repelled a large force of cavalry at Vila Nova and then commanded the 3rd infantry brigade during the Battle of Almansa in April 1707. He was promoted to brigadier general on 1 January 1708.\nHe served as second in command to James Stanhope in Menorca in 1708, leading one of the storming parties on Fort St. Philip, before returning to Spain in 1710, where he fought at the Battle of Saragossa in August 1710. He was promoted to major-general on 3 October 1714 and became commander of the British forces in Ireland in November 1714.\nWade returned home to join in the suppression of the Jacobite rising of 1715 and undertook security duties in Bath, where he unearthed a haul of Jacobite weapons. He entered politics as MP for Hindon in 1715. On 19 March 1717, he became colonel of the Earl of Plymouth's Regiment of Horse.\nIn 1719, he served as second-in-command to Viscount Cobham during the War of the Quadruple Alliance when Cobham led a force of 4,000 troops on a raid on the Spanish coastline which captured Vigo and occupied it for ten days before withdrawing. The same year he was one of the original backers of the Royal Academy of Music, establishing a London opera company that commissioned numerous works from Handel and others.\nHe became MP for Bath in 1722, retaining the seat for 25 years. His house, built around 1700, is situated next to Bath Abbey and is now a Grade I listed building.\nScotland.\nThe government of George I sent Wade to inspect Scotland in 1724. He recommended the construction of barracks, bridges and proper roads to assist in the control of the country. On 10 May 1725, he was appointed \"Commander in Chief of His Majesty's forces, castles, forts and barracks in North Britain\" and was tasked with carrying out his own recommendations. Over the next twelve years Wade directed the construction of some of roads and 30 bridges (including the Wade's Bridge at Aberfeldy). General Wade's military roads linked the garrisons at Ruthven, Fort George, Fort Augustus, and Fort William.\nA reference in verse is said to be inscribed on a stone at the start of one of his military roads in Scotland:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWade also organised a militia, \"Highland Watches\", and called on members of the landed gentry to sign up and raised the first six companies in 1725 (three of Campbells and one each of Frasers, Grants, and Munros). Also in 1725, Wade put down an insurrection after the government attempted to extend the \"malt tax\" to Scotland, and enraged citizens in Glasgow drove out the military and destroyed the home of their representative in Parliament. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 15 April 1727.\nOn 1 June 1732, he became Governor of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and on 19 June 1733, he became Governor of Fort William, Fort George and Fort Augustus. He was promoted to general of horse on 17 July 1739.\nHe raised four more \"Highland Watch\" companies in 1739, which were subsequently reorganized as the Black Watch regiment. He still had the time to sign his support to the Foundling Hospital, which was established in 1739 in London. On 22 June 1742, he was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, and on 24 June 1742, he was appointed a member of the Privy Council.\nWar of the Austrian Succession.\nOn 17 December 1743 he became a field marshal with his appointment to the joint command of the Anglo-Austrian force in Flanders against the French in the War of the Austrian Succession. Wade organised an advance towards Lille in July 1744, but the action became stalled in the face of logistical problems. He resigned from his command in March 1745 and returned home to become Commander-in-Chief of the Forces.\nJacobite rising.\nIn October 1745, during the Jacobite rising, Wade concentrated his troops in Newcastle upon Tyne, on the east coast of England; however, the Jacobite forces advanced from Scotland down the west coast of England via Carlisle into Lancashire and the speed of their advance left Wade scrambling. In freezing conditions and with his men starving, he failed to counter their march into England or their subsequent retreat back from Derby to Scotland. Wade was replaced as Commander-in-Chief by Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, who led the army to success at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746.\nIt was because of the difficulties Wade encountered marching his troops cross-country from Newcastle to Carlisle that he built his Military Road west of Newcastle in 1746, entailing such destruction of Hadrian's Wall. Wade helped plan the road but had died before construction began in 1751. His Military Road is still in use today as the B6318; it should not be confused with the Military Way built by the Romans immediately south of Hadrian's Wall.\nWade received mention in a verse sung as part of God Save the King around 1745:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFamily life.\nWade died unmarried on 14 March 1748 and is buried at Westminster Abbey, where his life is recognised by a monument created by Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac.\nWade left two natural (illegitimate) sons, Captains William and John Wade, and two natural daughters, Jane Erle and Emilia. Wade left most of his estate to his natural children although he provided generously for the widow and children of his brother William, Canon of Windsor, Berkshire. Wade had a second natural daughter named Emilia, who was married first in 1728 to a Mr John Mason and then to a Mr Jebb.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city is located on the Iset River between the Volga-Ural region and Siberia, with a population of roughly 1.5\u00a0million residents, up to 2.2\u00a0million residents in the urban agglomeration. Yekaterinburg is the fourth most populous city in Russia, the largest city in the Ural Federal District, and one of Russia's main cultural and industrial centres. Yekaterinburg has been dubbed the \"Third capital of Russia\", as it is ranked third by the size of its economy, culture, transportation and tourism.\nYekaterinburg was founded on 18 November 1723 and named after the Orthodox name of Catherine I (born Marta Helena Skowro\u0144ska), the wife of Russian Emperor Peter the Great. The city served as the mining capital of the Russian Empire as well as a strategic connection between Europe and Asia. In 1781, Catherine the Great gave Yekaterinburg the status of a district town of Perm Province, and built the historical Siberian Route through the city. Yekaterinburg became a key city to Siberia, which had rich resources. In the late 19th century, Yekaterinburg became one of the centres of revolutionary movements in the Urals. In 1924, after the Russian SFSR founded the Soviet Union, the city was renamed \"Sverdlovsk\" after the Bolshevik leader Yakov Sverdlov. During the Soviet era, Sverdlovsk was turned into an industrial and administrative powerhouse. On 23 September 1991 the city returned to its historical name.\nYekaterinburg is one of Russia's most important economic centres and was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The city is currently experiencing an economic and population boom, which resulted in some of the tallest skyscrapers of Russia being located in the city. Yekaterinburg is home to the headquarters of the Central Military District of the Russian Armed Forces, as well as the presidium of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nYekaterinburg is famous for its constructivist architecture and is also considered the \"Russian capital of street art\".\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe area was settled in prehistory. The earliest settlements date to 8000\u20137000\u00a0BC, in the Mesolithic period. The Isetskoe Pravoberezhnoye I archaeological site contains a Neolithic settlement dated to 6000\u20135000\u00a0BC. It includes stone processing workshops with artefacts such as grinding plates, anvils, clumps of rock, tools, and finished products. Over 50 different types of rock and minerals were used in tool making, indicating extensive knowledge of the region's natural resources. The Gamayun peninsula (left bank of the Verkh-Isetsky Pond) has archaeological findings from the Chalcolithic Period: workshops for producing stone tools (upper area) and two dwellings of the Ayat culture (lower area). There are also traces of the Koptyak culture from 2000\u00a0BC: dishes decorated with bird images and evidence of metallurgical production. The Tent I site contains the only Koptyak culture burials discovered in the Ural Mountains. In the Bronze Age, the people of Gamayun culture lived in the area. They left fragments of ceramics, weapons, and ornaments.\nArchaeological artifacts in the vicinity of Yekaterinburg were first discovered during railway construction, at the end of the 19th century. Excavation and research began in the 20th century. Artifacts are held at the Sverdlovsk Regional Museum of Local Lore, at the Hermitage, at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences, and at other museums.\nImperial era.\nThe first Russian settlements within the boundaries of modern Yekaterinburg appeared in the second half of the 17th century \u2014 in 1672, an Old Believers village arose in the area of Shartash lake (this fact is disputed by historians, since no evidence of the founding of the village at that time was found in the sources), and in 1680\u20131682, the villages of Nizhny and Verkhny Uktus appeared on the banks of Uktus River (now the territory of the Chkalovsky district of the city). In 1702, by the initiative of the head of Sibirskiy prikaz Andrew Vinius, the Uktus state ironwork plant was founded near Nizhny Uktus \u2014 the first ironworks within the boundaries of modern Yekaterinburg. In 1704, the Shuvakish ironworks was built (now the territory of the Zheleznodorozhny district of the city). With the beginning of active construction of factories in the Urals in the 18th century, relations with their southern neighbors, the Bashkirs, became strained. As a result of the Bashkir raid in 1709, the village of Verkhny Uktus was devastated, all buildings, including the wooden church and chapel, were burned, the residents fled to the protection of the Uktus plant fortifications. On the night of 5 April 1718, a fire destroyed all the factory buildings of the Uktus plant, except for the dam, and the plant was restored only by 1720 under the supervision of Timofey Burtsev. However, the plant did not receive further development due to the lack of water in Uktus river.\nIn 1720, by decree of Peter I, a delegation led by mining specialist Johann Bl\u00fcher and statesman Vasily Tatishchev was sent to the Urals. They were entrusted with managing the mining industry, identifying the causes of the collapse and reduction of production at state-owned factories. On 29 December 1720, Tatishchev and Bl\u00fcher arrive at the Uktus plant, which became their main residence in the Urals. As a result of familiarizing himself with the state of nearby state-owned factories, Tatishchev came to the conclusion that on the basis of these factories, even if they were reconstructed and expanded, it would not be possible to quickly increase the production of iron, and it would be more profitable to build a new large plant. After inspecting the immediate area, together with the commissary of the Uktus plant, Timofey Burtsev, a place rich in ore and forest was chosen on the banks of the more full-flowing Iset River, 7 versts from Uktus. On 6 February 1721, Tatishchev sent a message to the Collegium of Mining, in which he asked permission to begin construction of the plant, with detailed explanations and justification for this project. On 1 March 1721, without waiting for a response from the Collegium, Tatishchev began construction of the new plant, but he failed to convince Collegium, and by the Collegium decree of 10 December 1721, he was removed from the leadership of mining affairs in the Urals. In 1722, by decree of Peter the Great, a mining engineer, Major General Georg Wilhelm de Gennin, was sent to the Urals in place of Tatishchev. Having studied all the circumstances, de Gennin fully supported Tatishchev\u2019s project, and on 12 March 1723, construction of the plant on Iset resumed.\nRussian historian Vasily Tatishchev and Russian engineer Georg Wilhelm de Gennin founded Yekaterinburg with the construction of a massive iron-making plant under the decree of Russian emperor Peter the Great in 1723. They named the city after the emperor's wife, Yekaterina, who later became empress regnant Catherine\u00a0I. Officially, the city's founding date is 18 November 1723, when the shops carried out a test run of the bloomery for trip hammers. The plant was commissioned 6 days later, on 24 November. 1723 also saw the establishment of Yekaterinburg fortress, which would encompass many of the settlement's earliest buildings. Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak very vividly described the beginning of the construction of a mining plant and a fortress: \"Imagine completely deserted banks of the Iset river, covered with forest. In the spring of 1723, soldiers from Tobolsk, peasants of the assigned settlements, hired craftsmen appeared, and everything around came to life, as if by the dictates of a fairy tale. They dropped the forest, prepared a place for the dam, laid blast furnaces, raised the rampart, set up barracks and houses for the authorities... \".\nIn 1722\u20131726 the Verkhne-Uktussky mining plant was built, which was officially called the plant of the princess Elizabeth (the future village of Elizabeth, or Elizavetinskoe) and became a part of modern Yekaterinburg in 1934. In 1726, Wilhelm de Gennin founded an auxiliary Verkh-Isetsky plant with a working settlement 2 versts from Yekaterinburg upstream ('verkh' in Russian) the Iset River. The plant's dam formed the Verkh-Isetsky pond. Colloquially called by the Russian acronym VIZ, it was a satellite town until in 1926, with a population of over 20,000 people by this time, it was incorporated into Yekaterinburg as the core of the Verkh-Isetsky district.\nYekaterinburg was one of the industrial cities of Russia prompted at the beginning of the 18th century by decrees of Tsar Peter the Great which demanded the development of the metalworking industry. With extensive use of iron, the city was built to a regular square plan with ironworks and residential buildings at the centre. These were surrounded by fortified walls so that Yekaterinburg was at the same time both a manufacturing centre and a fortress at the frontier between Europe and Asia. It, therefore, found itself at the heart of Russia's strategy for further development of the entire Ural region. The so-called Siberian Route became operational in 1763 and placed the city on an increasingly important transit route, which led to its development as a focus of trade and commerce between east and west, and gave rise to the description of the city as the \"window to Asia\". With the growth in trade and the city's administrative importance, the ironworks became less critical, and the more important buildings were increasingly built using expensive stone. Small manufacturing and trading businesses proliferated. In 1781 Russia's empress, Catherine the Great, granted Yekaterinburg town status and nominated it as the administrative centre for the wider region within Perm Governorate. In 1807, the role of the capital of the mining and smelting region was confirmed by assigning it the status of the only \"mountain city\" in Russia. Until 1863, Yekaterinburg remained subordinate to the head of the mining plants of the Ural ridge, the minister of finance and personally to the emperor, and enjoyed considerable freedom from the governor's power. Since the 1830s, mountainous Yekaterinburg has become the center of mechanical engineering. \nIn 1820\u20131845, 45% of the world's gold was mined in Yekaterinburg. This is the first ever \"Gold Rush\". Until 1876, 80% of the coins in circulation in the Russian Empire were produced at the Yekaterinburg mint.\nFollowing the October Revolution, the family of deposed Tsar Nicholas II was sent to internal exile in Yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the Ipatiev House in the city. In July 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions were closing on Yekaterinburg. In the early hours of the morning of 17 July, the deposed Tsar, his wife Alexandra, and their children Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and Tsarevich Alexei were murdered by the Bolsheviks at the Ipatiev House. Other members of the Romanov family were killed at Alapayevsk later the same day. The Legions arrived less than a week later and captured the city. The city remained under the control of the White movement in which a provisional government was established. The Red Army took back the city and restored Soviet authority on 14 July 1919.\nSoviet era.\nIn the years following the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War, political authority of the Urals was transferred from Perm to Yekaterinburg. On 19 October 1920, Yekaterinburg established its first university, the Ural State University, as well as polytechnic, pedagogical, and medical institutions under the decree of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. Enterprises in the city ravaged by the war were nationalised, including: the Metalist (formerly Yates) Plant, the Verkh-Isetsky (formerly Yakovleva) Plant, and the Lenin flax-spinning factory (formerly Makarov). In 1924, the city of Yekaterinburg was renamed Sverdlovsk after the Bolshevik leader Yakov Sverdlov.\nBy the 1934, following a series of administrative reforms carried by the early Soviet government, the earliest Russian settlements which predated Yekaterinburg and laid the basis of its founding, were incorporated into the city proper.\nDuring the reign of Stalin, Sverdlovsk was one of several places developed by the Soviet government as a centre of heavy industry. Old factories were reconstructed and new large factories were built, especially those specialised in machine-building and metalworking. These plants included Magnitogorsk and the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant in Chelyabinsk oblast, and Uralmash in Sverdlovsk. During this time, the population of Sverdlovsk tripled in size, and it became one of the fastest-growing cities of the Soviet Union. At that time, very large powers were given to the regional authorities. By the end of the 1930s, there were 140 industrial enterprises, 25 research institutes, and 12 higher education institutions in Sverdlovsk.\nDuring World War II, the city became the headquarters of the Ural Military District on the basis of which more than 500 different military units and formations were formed, including the 22nd Army and the Ural Volunteer Tank Corps. Uralmash became the main production site for armoured vehicles. Many state technical institutions and whole factories were relocated to Sverdlovsk away from cities affected by war (mostly Moscow), with many of them staying in Sverdlovsk after the victory. The Hermitage Museum collections were also partly evacuated from Leningrad to Sverdlovsk in July 1941 and remained there until October 1945. In the postwar years, new industrial and agricultural enterprises were put into operation and massive housing construction began. The lookalike five-story apartment blocks that remain today in Kirovsky, Chkalovsky, and other residential areas of Sverdlovsk sprang up in the 1960s, under the direction of Nikita Khrushchev's government. In 1977, Ipatiev House was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in accordance to a resolution from the Politburo in order to prevent it from being used as a rallying location for monarchists. Yeltsin later became the first President of Russia and represented the people at the funeral of the former Tsar in 1998. There was an anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk in April and May 1979, which was attributed to a release from the Sverdlovsk-19 military facility.\nContemporary era.\nDuring the 1991 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Sverdlovsk, the home city of President Boris Yeltsin, was selected by him as a temporary reserve capital for the Russian Federation, in case Moscow became too dangerous for the Russian government. A reserve cabinet headed by Oleg Lobov was sent to the city, where Yeltsin enjoyed strong popular support at that time. Shortly after the failure of the coup and subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city regained its historical name of Yekaterinburg on 23 September 1991. However, Sverdlovsk Oblast, of which Yekaterinburg is the administrative centre, kept its name.\nIn the 2000s, an intensive growth of trade, business, and tourism began in Yekaterinburg. In 2003, Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der negotiated in Yekaterinburg. On 15\u201317 June 2009, the SCO and BRIC summits were held in Yekaterinburg, which greatly improved the economic, cultural, and tourist situation in the city. On 13\u201316 July 2010, a meeting between Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and German Chancellor Angela Merkel took place in the city.\nIn 2018, Yekaterinburg hosted four matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup and hosted the inaugural University International Sports Festival in 2023.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nGeographically, Yekaterinburg is in North Asia, close to the Ural Mountains (which divide Europe from Asia), east of the nation's capital Moscow.\nThe city has a total area of .\nYekaterinburg is on the eastern side of the Urals. The city is surrounded by wooded hills, partially cultivated for agricultural purposes. Yekaterinburg is located on a natural watershed, so there would be many bodies of water close and in the city. The city is bisected by the Iset River, which flows from the Urals into the Tobol River. There are two lakes in the city, Lake Shuvakish and Lake Shartash. The city borders Verkh-Isetskiy Pond, through which the Iset River flows. Lake Isetskoye and Lake Baltym are both near the city, with Lake Isetskoye located near Sredneuralsk, and Lake Baltym located near the towns of Sanatornyy and Baltym.\nTime.\nYekaterinburg uses Yekaterinburg Time, which is five hours ahead of UTC (UTC+5), and two hours ahead of Moscow Time.\nClimate.\nThe city possesses a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\") under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. It is characterised by sharp variability in weather conditions, with well-marked seasons. The Ural Mountains, despite their insignificant height, block air from the west, from the European part of Russia. As a result, the Central Urals are open to the invasion of cold arctic air and continental air from the West Siberian Plain. Equally, warm air masses from the Caspian Sea and the deserts of Central Asia can freely penetrate from the south. Therefore, the weather in Yekaterinburg is characterised by sharp temperature fluctuations and weather anomalies: in winter, from frost at \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C to thaw and rain; in summer, from frosts to temperatures above .\nThe distribution of precipitation is determined by the circulation of air masses, relief, and air temperatures. The main part of the precipitation is brought by cyclones with a western air mass transfer, that is, from the European part of Russia, while their average annual amount is 601\u00a0mm. The maximum falls on a warm season, during which about 60\u201370% of the annual amount falls. For the winter period is characterized by snow cover with an average capacity of 40\u201350\u00a0cm. The coefficient of moistening(the ratio of yearly precipitation and potential evaporation) \u2013 1.\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;According to the results of the 2021 Census, the population of Yekaterinburg was 1,544,376; up from 1,349,772 recorded in the 2010 Census.\nAs of 2021,[ [update]] the ethnic composition of Yekaterinburg was:\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChristianity is the predominant religion in the city, of which most are adherents to the Russian Orthodox Church. The Yekaterinburg and Verkhotursky diocese is located in the Holy Trinity Cathedral in the city. Other religions practised in Yekaterinburg include Islam, Old Believers, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Judaism.\nYekaterinburg has a significant Muslim community, but it suffers from a lack of worship space: there are only two small mosques. Another mosque was built in the nearby city of Verkhnyaya Pyshma. On 24 November 2007, the first stone was laid in the construction of a large Cathedral Mosque with four minarets, and space for 2,500 parishioners in the immediate vicinity of the cathedral and a synagogue, thus forming the \"area of the three religions\". The mosque was planned to be built for the SCO summit, but due to funding problems, construction did not move from zero and is now frozen.\nConstruction of a Methodist church started in 1992, and with the help of American donations, finished in 2001. A synagogue was opened in 2005, on the same place a 19th-century synagogue was demolished in 1962.\nMost of the city's religious buildings were destroyed during the Soviet era, in addition to the synagogue, the three largest Orthodox churches in Yekaterinburg were demolished \u2013 the Epiphany Cathedral, the Ekaterininsky Cathedral, and the Great Zlatoust Church. Other Christian churches such as the Lutheran Church of Yekaterinburg and the Roman Catholic Church of St. Anne (a new Catholic St. Anne's Church was built in 2000) were demolished as well. Other churches were used as warehouses and industrial sites. The only religious building in Yekaterinburg in the Soviet era was the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. Recently, some churches are being rebuilt. Since 2006, according to the surviving drawings, the Great Zlatoust Church was restored in 2012. On 17 April 2010, the city was visited by Patriarch Kirill.\nGovernment.\nYekaterinburg is the administrative centre of Sverdlovsk Oblast. Within the framework of the administrative divisions, it is, together with twenty-nine rural localities, incorporated as the City of Yekaterinburg, an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Yekaterinburg is incorporated as Yekaterinburg Urban Okrug.\nAdministrative districts.\nEach district is not a municipal formation, and the historical centre of the city is divided into five inner-city districts (except Chkalovsky and Ordzhonikidzevsky).\nA district named Akademicheskiy was formed from the parts of Leninsky and Verkh-Isetsky districts on 3 January 2020. On 1 October 2021, more settlements were transferred from Verkh-Isetsky to Akademicheskiy district.\nAdministration.\nUrban.\nThe Charter of Yekaterinburg establishes a four-link system for the organisation of local authorities, which includes: the Head of Yekaterinburg, who serves as the chairman of the Yekaterinburg City Duma, the Yekaterinburg City Duma, the Administration of the City of Yekaterinburg, and the Chamber of Accounts.\nAccording to the charter of Yekaterinburg, the highest official of the municipal formation is the mayor of Yekaterinburg. The mayor is elected by universal suffrage, but since 3 April 2018, the procedure for direct elections of the mayor of the City of Yekaterinburg was abolished. The mayor of the city is endowed with representative powers and powers to organize activities and guide the activities of the City Duma. In addition, the mayor of the city exercises other powers such as concluding a contract with the head of the city administration and ensuring compliance with the Russian Constitution, Russian legislation, the city charter, and other normative acts.\nIn the event of a temporary absence of the mayor of Yekaterinburg, his authority under his written order is exercised by the deputy mayor of Yekaterinburg.\nThe representative body of the municipal formation is the Yekaterinburg City Duma, which represents the city's entire population. The membership of the Duma is 36 deputies (18 deputies were elected in single-mandate constituencies and 18 in a single electoral district). Residents of the city elect deputies on the basis of universal suffrage for a period of 5 years.\nThe executive and administrative body of the municipal formation is the Administration of the City of Yekaterinburg, led by the head of the Administration, currently held by Aleksandr Yacob. The administration is endowed with its own powers to resolve issues of local importance, but it is under the control and accountable to the Yekaterinburg City Duma. The building of the Administration of Yekaterinburg is located on 1905 Square.\nThe Chamber of Accounts is a permanently operating body of external municipal financial control. The Chamber is formed by the apparatus of the City Duma and is accountable to it. The Chamber consists of the chairman, deputy chairman, auditors and staff. The structure and number of staff of the chamber, including the number of auditors, is determined by the decision of the City Duma. The term of office of the Chamber staff is 5 years. The Chamber of Accounts is a legal entity.\nOblast.\nIn accordance with the regional charter, Yekaterinburg is the administrative centre of the Sverdlovsk Oblast. The executive power is exercised by the governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast, the legislative power by the legislative assembly of Sverdlovsk Oblast, and the judicial power by the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, located in the building of the Palace of Justice. The building serving the regional government is the White House and the building serving the legislative assembly is located next to it on October Square. The ministries of the Sverdlovsk Region are located in the building of the regional government, as well as in other separate buildings of the city.\nFederal.\nYekaterinburg serves as the centre of the Ural Federal District. As a result, it serves as the residence of the presidential envoy, the highest official of the district and part of the administration of the President of Russia. The residence is located the building of the regional government on October Square near the Iset River embankment.\nIn addition, Yekaterinburg serves as the centre of the Central Military District and more than 30 territorial branches of the federal executive bodies, whose jurisdiction extends not only to Sverdlovsk Oblast, but also to other regions in the Ural Mountains, Siberia, and the Volga Region.\nPolitics.\nAccording to the results of the September 2013 elections, the mayor of the city was Yevgeny Roizman, nominated by the Civil Platform party. Out of the 36 seats in the City Duma, 21 belong to United Russia, 7 to A Just Russia, 3 to the Civil Platform, 2 to the Communist Party and 1 seat to the LDPR. The turnout in the mayoral elections was 33.57%.\n2018 FIFA World Cup.\nYekaterinburg hosted four matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Yekaterinburg is one of the 11 Russian cities that hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were played on the upgraded Yekaterinburg Arena.\nFor the World Cup 2018, from 7 October 2015 to 29 December 2017, the Central Stadium was upgraded to bring it into compliance with FIFA requirements for the World Cup and was renamed Yekaterinburg Arena. The architectural concept of the new stadium is built on a combination of historical walls and the built-in core of the modern arena. During the reconstruction of the sports facility, which is a monument of history and culture, the facades are carefully preserved, and the arena itself is equipped with the latest technical achievements of the sports industry. Temporary stands extending outside the stadium's original perimeter were erected to comply with the FIFA requirement of seating for 35,000 spectators. They can hold a total of 12,000 spectators, but the seating will be removed after the World Cup, decreasing the seating capacity back to 23,000.\nThe FIFA Fan Fest in Yekaterinburg is located in the Mayakovsky Central Park of Entertainment and Culture. Located just outside the city centre in a popular and well-known amusement park, it will have a capacity to hold 17,000 people.\nKoltsovo Airport was also reconstructed and had a second runway built. In addition, work was done to prepare another passenger terminal, modernize the technical infrastructure, and launch the business aviation hangar.

The foreign ministers of the BRIC countries had also met in Yekaterinburg previously on 16 May 2008.\nWorld Expo.\nIn June 2013, at the 153rd General Assembly of the Bureau of International Expositions held in Paris, representatives from Yekaterinburg presented the city's bid to host the Expo 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed during a televised statement in English to earmark the required funds to build an exhibition complex large enough to receive the estimated 30 million visitors from more than 150 countries. Ultimately, Dubai was chosen to host the exhibition. Yekaterinburg later bid for the Expo 2025. Yekaterinburg's concept for the bid exhibition relates to the technologies to make people happy by changing the world with innovation and quality of life. The host was announced on 23 November 2018 and Yekaterinburg lost out to Osaka, Japan.\nYekaterinburg hosted the Global Summit on Manufacturing and Industrialization (GMIS \u2014 2019) under the auspices of the United Nations. The annual INNOPROM exhibition is among the five largest industrial exhibitions in the world.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nYekaterinburg is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is in the province of Leinster and is part of the Southern Region. It is named after the city of Kilkenny. Kilkenny County Council is the local authority for the county. At the 2022 census the population of the county was 103,685. The county was based on the historic Gaelic kingdom of Ossory (\"Osraighe\"), which was coterminous with the Diocese of Ossory.\nGeography and subdivisions.\nKilkenny is the 16th-largest of Ireland's 32 counties by area and the 21st-largest in terms of population. It is the third-largest of Leinster's 12 counties in size, the seventh-largest in terms of population, and has a population density of 50 people per km2. Kilkenny borders five counties \u2013 Tipperary to the west, Waterford to the south, Carlow and Wexford to the east, and Laois to the north. Kilkenny city is the county's seat of local government and largest settlement, and is situated on the River Nore in the centre of the county. Kilkenny city is approximately from Waterford, from Dublin and from Cork.\nPhysical geography.\nThe River Nore flows through the county, and the River Suir forms the border with County Waterford. Brandon Hill is the highest point with an elevation of . Most of the county has a hilly surface of moderate elevation with uplands in the north-east, the north-west and the South of the county; the middle is lower by comparison.\nThe county is located at and has an area of .https:// The county extends from 52 degrees 14 minutes to 52 degrees 52 minutes north latitude, and from 6 degrees 56 minutes to 7 degrees 37 minutes west longitude. The north\u2013south length of the county is ; and its greatest breadth from east to west, is about and its narrowest part is about from where it widens irregularly towards the north.\nKilkenny extends southward from Laois to the valley of the Suir and eastward from the Munster\u2013Leinster border to the River Barrow. The River Nore bisects the county, and the River Barrow and River Suir are natural boundaries to the east and south of the county. County Kilkenny is bordered by Laois, Carlow, Wexford, Waterford and Tipperary.\nRivers.\nThe main rivers in County Kilkenny, called the Three Sisters, are the Nore, Barrow and Suir. The River Nore bisects the county and flows through Ballyragget, Kilkenny City and the villages of Bennettsbridge, Thomastown and Inistioge. The River Suir forms the border between County Waterford and County Kilkenny.\nThe Barrow forms part of the county's eastern boundary. Tributaries of the Barrow in the county include the Gowran River and the Ballyvalden River (with its tributary the Monefelim River).\nAlthough County Kilkenny lies inland it has access to the sea via Belview Port, Port of Waterford, on the Suir Estuary and via New Ross on the River Barrow. On the River Barrow, from the villages of Goresbridge and Graiguenamanagh, there is a navigable river with traditional barges to the River Shannon or to Dublin Bay. Kilkenny's river network helps drain the land giving the county a highly fertile lower central plain.\nKings River and the Dinan are used for canoeing and kayaking as they contain stretches of peaceful waterways and a number of weirs and rapids. The wide and meandering Rivers Nore and Barrow are used for angling, boating and water sports.\nProtected areas.\nSpecial Areas of Conservation, under the European Union Habitats Directive, in County Kilkenny includes Hugginstown Fen south-west of Ballyhale, The Loughans near Urlingford, Cullahill Mountain on the Castlecomer Plateau near Johnstown, Spahill and Clomantagh Hill which form part of an escarpment which links the Slieveardagh Hills with the Castlecomer Plateau, Galmoy Fen north of Johnstown, Lower River Suir south of Thurles, the freshwater stretches of the Barrow/River Nore and Thomastown Quarry, near Thomastown.\nIn 2005 Coan Bogs was defined as a \"Natural Heritage Area\" under section 18 of the Wildlife Act 2000. The blanket bog consists of two small areas of upland blanket bog located near Castlecomer in the townlands of Coan East and Smithstown. Bedrock geology for both areas is shale overlain locally by glacial till and blanket bog vegetation is well developed.\nFiddown Island is a 62.6 ha state-owned \"Nature Reserve\" established in 1988. Near Fiddown along the River Suir it consists of a long narrow island of marsh/woodland covered in willow scrub and bordered by reed swamps \u2013 it is the only known site of its type in Ireland.\nWildlife.\nThe wildlife of County Kilkenny is part of the county's biodiversity and is an environmental, economic, amenity and resource.\nFauna of County Kilkenny includes hedgehogs, otters, badgers, red foxes, and bats such as Leisler's bat, Daubenton's bat, the brown long-eared bat and the common pipistrelle. There is also sika deer, fallow deer, stoat, red squirrel and pygmy shrew. The bird nesting period is from 1 March until 1 September. Woodlands, trees and hedgerows form a network of habitats, ecological 'corridors' essential for wildlife to flourish and move between habitats.\nFlora of County Kilkenny includes the endangered autumn crocus, also rare species such as the bog orchid, the Killarney fern and the tufted salt-marsh grass. There are also vulnerable species like lesser snapdragon, meadow barley, small-white orchid, opposite-leaved pondweed, betony, red hemp nettle, narrow-leaved helleborine, lanceolate spleenwort, annual knawel and basil thyme.\nWoodlands.\nSurveys of woodlands of County Kilkenny include \"A Woodland Survey of Kilkenny\", undertaken in 1997 to identify woodlands in the county and \"A survey of broadleaved woodlands in three special Areas of Conservation, Barrow-Nore, River Unshin and Lough Forbes (2000)\" which covers some of County Kilkenny, and \"National Survey of Native Woodlands (NSNW) 2003\u20132008\" which was one of the largest ecological surveys to be completed in Ireland and did its fieldwork in the county in 2003.\nEstimates of the woodlands in County Kilkenny include the \"Forest Inventory Planning System (1998)\" which estimated Kilkenny had 2251\u00a0ha of mixed woodland and broadleaf woodland not dominated by beech, representing 1.09% of the county and the \"National Forest Inventory 2004 and 2006\" which estimated that 4430\u00a0ha of the county is native forested land, Scots pine was regarded as non-native, representing 2.15% of the county.\nThe best quality sites in the county in terms of their conservation value include Kylecorragh Wood (SAC) along the River Nore, Grenan Wood (SAC), Knockadrina, Garryricken North (NHA/SNR), Ballytobin/Ballaghtobin, Brownstown Wood (NHA/SAC), Kyleadohir Wood (NHA/SNR), Brown's Wood, Thomastown, Ballykeeffe Wood, Cullentragh, Rossenarra, Newrath and Garryricken South. The most threatened forested area in the county is Greatwood.\nThe main governmental organisations responsible for ensuring the development of forestry within Kilkenny are the National Parks and Wildlife Service (under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage) and the Forest Service (under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine). There are legislative measures which recognise the importance of trees woodlands and hedgerows and provide for their protection including the Forestry Act 1946 and Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. These prohibit trees from being cut down unless a notice of intention is given and prohibit the cutting of hedges within the bird nesting period. The main threats come mainly from invasive species, heavy grazing and damaging activities such as non-native planting, native felling and dumping. There are instances of felling (both legal and illegal) of ash trees for the production of hurleys.\nThere are around 180 significant trees in County Kilkenny included in the Tree Register of Ireland, compiled by the Tree Council of Ireland, based on characteristics such as age, height, diameter, historical or folklore connections. The tallest tree in Kilkenny is a silver fir of 5.39\u00a0x\u00a043m located at Woodstock Gardens in Inistioge and the tree with the largest girth is a common lime of 9.01\u00a0x\u00a027m located at Coolmore House in Thomastown. At present, under the Planning and Development Act 2000, there are 4 Tree Preservation Orders (TPO) in County Kilkenny for the protection of trees, groups of trees and woods of amenity value. These include Oldcourt in Inistioge, Keatingstown, Barna in Freshford, Sawney's Wood in Castlecomer and the Castle Gardens in Kilkenny City.\nImportant trees in county Kilkenny include two cedars of Lebanon at \"Kildalton Agricultural College\" in Piltown, a Monterey cypress, beech, silver fir and two coastal redwood at Woodstock Gardens in Inistioge. In Thomastown there is a common lime at \"Coolmore House\", an English/common oak at \"Stoneen Kilfawe\", an English/common oak at Mount Juilliet Estate and a Wellingtonia, giant sequoia, Monterey cypress, sweet/Spanish chestnut and a holm oak/evergreen oak at \"Kilfane Glebe\". There is also a Turkey oak at \"Threecastles House\" in Kilkenny, an ash and two English/common oak at \"Ballytobin House\" in Callan, a common lime, Wellingtonia giant sequoia and two Monterey cypress at Shankill Castle in Paulstown, an English/common oak at \"Ballykeefe House\" in Kilmanagh, an English/common oak at Fanningstown House in Owning and a beech at \"Castlecomer Golf Club\" in Castlecomer.\nClimate.\nThe climate of County Kilkenny, like the climate of Ireland, is a changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. It is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or \"Cfb\" on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system. Kilkenny lies in plant Hardiness zone\n9. Weatherwise, the county is generally representative of wide river valleys in the region with low temperatures on cloudless nights, and is significant in that it records some of the highest summer and lowest winter temperatures in Ireland. The highest air temperature ever recorded in Ireland was , at Kilkenny Castle on 26 June 1887.\nThe Met \u00c9ireann Kilkenny Weather Observing Station, 2\u00a0km north-west of Kilkenny City centre, on the Duningstown Road, opened in May 1957, and observations ceased in April 2008. A climatological station is currently in operation within 1\u00a0km of the old site, and as of March 2010, was providing live weather data to the general public and climate data to Met \u00c9ireann.\nThe maximum temperature recorded at the Met Station was on 2 August 1995. Extremes recorded at the station include the highest air temperature of on 29 June 1976, the lowest air temperature of on 2 January 1979 and the lowest ground temperature of on 12 January 1982. The maximum daily sunshine was 16.3 hours on 18 June 1978. The warmest and sunniest month on record in Kilkenny was August 1995 with a total of 274.9\u00a0hours sunshine and very high temperatures throughout. The maximum daily sunshine was 16.3\u00a0hours on 18 June 1978. The overall trend in temperatures has been on the rise with a marked increase from 1988 onwards. Annual temperatures are running over 0.5 degrees above 20th-century levels.\nThe maximum daily rainfall recorded at Kilkenny station was on 17 July 1983. The late 1950s and early 1960s were wet but rainfall had been steady throughout the century. 2002 was a very wet year and since 2005 annual rainfall has been increased steadily, with 2009 being the wettest year since records commenced in 1958. At the centre of the county, Kilkenny is in a sheltered location, over 60\u00a0km inland and is surrounded by hills over 200m, which ensures that it is not a windy location. The highest wind gust of 77\u00a0knots, from a south-west direction, was recorded on 12 January 1974.\nGeology.\nThe geology of Kilkenny includes the Kiltorcan Formation which is early Carboniferous in age. The formation is located around Kiltorcan Hill near Ballyhale in the Callan and Knocktopher areas. It forms the uppermost part of the Old Red Sandstone and is the distinctive Upper Devonian\u2013Lower Carboniferous unit in southern Ireland. It contains non-red lithologies, green mudstones, siltstones, fine sandstones and yellow sandstones. There is a fossil assemblage containing Cyclostigma and Archaeopteris and Archaeopteris hibernica.\nMost of the county is principally limestone of the upper and lower group, corresponding with the rest of Ireland. A large area in the north and east contains beds of coal, surrounded by limestone strata, alternated with shale, argillaceous ironstone, and sandstone. This occurs eastward of the Nore around Castlecomer, along the border with Laois. It is generally accompanied by culm, which was used extensively for burning lime.\nThe natural environment and resources of County Kilkenny includes its rivers, wildlife (mammals, birds, plants), woodlands, hedgerows, and diverse landscapes and geological features. The main land use is grassland, dairy farming and tillage farming especially around Kilkenny City and in the fertile central plain of the Nore Valley. Conifer forests are found on the upland areas.\nHabitats of international and national importance, are designated under European Union and national legislation. The four categories of designated site in effect in County Kilkenny are Special Areas of Conservation, Natural Heritage Areas, Statutory Nature Reserves and Wildfowl Sanctuaries. The 2008\u20132014 county development plan recorded 36 designated natural heritage sites of international and national importance in County Kilkenny, covering approximately 4.5% of the county.\nMountains and hills.\nCounty Kilkenny is comparably low compared to other mountain ranges in Ireland with the highest peak being Brandon Hill (), at above sea level. The majority of rest of the county is hilly except for the centre of the county, just south of the city of Kilkenny, which is comparably lower than the rest of the county. There are highlands in the North-East, the North-West and in the South of the county.\nIn the north of the county the uplands of the Castlecomer district, the Castlecomer Plateau includes the Culla Hills to the west of the Nore Valley with Castlecomer Hills and Slieve Marcy to the east. These hills are divided by the valley of the Dinan river which joins the Nore from the east. The highest point of the Castlecomer Hills is , and located North-West of the town of Castlecomer and near the border with Laois. The highest point of the Culla Hills is in Laois at , but its undulating slopes spread over a considerable area of Kilkenny in the north-westerly area.\nIn the west of the county the Slieveardagh Hills and Booley Hills extend westwards to County Tipperary. The highest point in the Slieveardagh Hills is Knocknamuck at . The Booley Mountains partly divide from Tory Hill to the valley of the Kilmacow River which flows into the Suir.\nIn the south of the county is Brandon Hill, at and is near the Barrow and Graiguenamanagh. The area enclosed between the rivers Nore and Barrow towards their point of joining is elevated. Along the west of the Barrow and Nore is mostly covered by hills of nearly equal elevation except along the left bank of the river Suir. Here there is a rich area of land between the river and the hills.\nBaronies.\nThe county is subdivided into twelve baronies which are in turn divided into civil parishes and townlands. There are about 800 townlands in Kilkenny. Each barony was made up of a number of parishes or parts of parishes. Both civil parishes and baronies are now largely obsolete (except for purposes such as legal transactions involving land) and are no longer used for local government purposes.\nCivil parishes and townlands.\nFor religious administration, the county was divided into parishes. Every parish had at least one church. The barony boundaries and the parish boundaries were not connected.\nFrom the 17th to mid-19th centuries, civil parishes were based on early Christian and medieval monastic and church settlements. The civil parishes are divided into townlands (See List of townlands in County Kilkenny). As the population grew, new parishes were created and the civil parish covered the same area as the established Church of Ireland. The Roman Catholic Church adapted to a new structure based on towns and villages. There 2,508 civil parishes in Ireland, which often break both barony and county boundaries.\nTowns and Villages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEuropean region.\nFor statistical purposes at European level, the county is part of the South-East Region, a NUTS III entity; this is in turn part of the level II NUTS entity, Southern Region.\nGovernance and politics.\nLocal government.\nLocal government in County Kilkenny is governed by the Local Government Acts. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 established a unitary structure of local government. This single-tier structure consists of Kilkenny County Council.\nFor the purposes of local government, Kilkenny is divided into 4 local electoral areas \u2013 Callan\u2013Thomastown (6), Castlecomer (6), Kilkenny city (7) and Piltown (5) \u2013 which return a total of 24 members to Kilkenny County Council. The 2019 Kilkenny local elections had a voter turnout of 53%, a decrease of 4.1% on the 2014 election. The highest turnout was in Callan\u2013Thomastown (56.4%) and the lowest was in Kilkenny city (50.4%).\nIn the 2019 local elections, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael emerged as the two dominant parties, holding 20 of the 24 seats between them. The Labour Party hold 2 seats, the Green Party hold 1 seat, and there is 1 independent. Sinn F\u00e9in, which had held 3 seats, failed to gain a seat in the 2019 election. Council elections are held every 5 years, with the next election due to be held in May 2024.\nAs the county is part of the South-East Region, some county councillors are also representatives on the Southern Regional Assembly.\nFormer districts.\nUntil 2014, the second tier of local government consisted of Kilkenny Borough Council which was a town council. The city of Kilkenny was allowed to use the title of \"Borough Council\" instead of \"Town Council\", but Kilkenny Borough Council had no additional responsibilities. Since the enactment of the aforementioned Act on 1 June 2014, which abolished the borough, the county council is solely responsible for local services.\nNational politics.\nThe county is part of the D\u00e1il constituency of Carlow\u2013Kilkenny (5 TDs). The constituency has been in use since the 1948 general election.\nKilkenny has been represented through several parliamentary constituencies in the past. From 1918 to 1921, County Kilkenny was divided between the United Kingdom parliamentary constituencies of North Kilkenny and South Kilkenny. In 1921 the Carlow\u2013Kilkenny D\u00e1il constituency was created and continued until the creation of a separate Kilkenny constituency in 1937, which existed until 1948.\nThe county is part of the South constituency for elections to the European Parliament. The constituency has 5 seats.\nHistory.\nCounty Kilkenny takes its name from the city of Kilkenny. Kilkenny is the anglicised version of the Irish \"Cill Chainnigh\", meaning \"Church (Cell) of Cainneach or Canice\". This probably relates to the church and round tower, now St. Canice's Cathedral, which was built in honour of St. Canice.\nThe Kingdom of Osraige was one of the ancient Kingdoms of Ireland. The Kings of Osraige, the Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig family, reigned over Osraige and Cill Chainnigh was their stronghold. The Kingdom of Ossory existed from at least the 2nd century until the 13th century AD. The current ecclesiastical dioceses of that area is still known as Ossory. The medieval Diocese of Ossory and was established in 549 AD, and its territory corresponded to the medieval Kingdom of Ossory. In historic times, Kilkenny replaced Aghaboe as the chief church in Osraige.\nThe kingdom was bounded by two of the Three Sisters the rivers Barrow and Suir and the northern limit was, generally, the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The Osraige \u2014their name means people of the deer\u2014 inhabited much of modern County Kilkenny and parts of neighbouring County Laois. To the west and south, Osraige was bounded by the River Suir, to the east the watershed of the River Barrow marked the boundary with Leinster, and to the north it extended into and beyond the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The River Nore ran through the Kingdom.\nOsraige formed the easternmost part of the kingdom and province of Munster until the middle of the 9th century, after which it was attached to Leinster. Osraige was largely a buffer state between Leinster and Munster. Its most significant neighbours were the Lo\u00edgsi, U\u00ed Cheinnselaig and U\u00ed Baircche of Leinster to the north and east and the D\u00e9isi Muman, E\u00f3ganacht Chaisil and \u00c9ile of Munster to the south and west.\nThe name Osraige is said to be from the Usdaie, a Celtic tribe that Ptolemy's map of Ireland places in roughly the same area that Osraige would later occupy. The territory indicated by Ptolemy probably included the major late Iron Age hill-fort at Freestone Hill which produced some Roman finds. Also the interesting burial at Stoneyford which is of typical Roman type and probably dates to the 1st century AD. The Osraighe themselves claimed to be descended from the \u00c9rainn people. Others propose that the Ivernic groups included the Osraige of the Kingdom of Osraige/Ossory. The Brigantes were the only Celtic tribe to have a presence in both England and Ireland, in the latter of which they could be found around Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford.\nPope Adrian IV gave Norman King Henry II of England permission to claim Ireland 1154. The Cisternians came to Jerpoint and Kilkenny around 1155/60. Jerpoint Abbey is founded by Donal MacGiollaPhadruig, King of Ossory 1158. In 1168, Dermot MacMurrough the King of Leinster was driven out of his kingdom by Rory O'Connor the High King of Ireland with the help of Tiernan O'Rourke. MacMurrough looked for help from Henry II and got help from a Cambro-Norman lord notable Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, known to history as Strongbow. MacMurrough secured the services of Richard, promising him the hand of his daughter Aoife of Leinster and the succession to Leinster. Richard and other Marcher barons and knights by King Henry assembled an army. The army, under Raymond le Gros, took Wexford, Waterford and Dublin in 1169 and 1170, and Strongbow joined them in August 1170. The day after the capture of Waterford, he married MacMorrough's daughter, Aoife.\nThe Lordship of Ireland was a lordship created in the wake of the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169\u201371. Kilkenny formed part of the lordship of Leinster. Strongbow became Lord of Leinster in 1171.\nPlaces of interest.\nArchitecture.\nThe architecture of County Kilkenny contains features from all eras since the Stone Age including Norman and Anglo-Irish castles, Georgian urban buildings, towns and villages with unique architectures, palladian and rococo country houses, Gothic and neo-Gothic cathedrals and buildings. In the late 20th century a new economic climate resulted in a renaissance of culture and design, with some at the cutting edge of modern architecture. County Kilkenny contains varied architecture including passage graves, ringforts, Irish round towers, castles, churches and cathedrals, abbeys and priories, bridges and roads, and townhouses of varying style.\nEarly architecture.\nEvidence of Neolithic settlement can be found throughout the county. There are great burial mounds including the portal tombs and dolmens at Owning, Kilmogue-Harristown and Borrismore. There are passage graves at Clomantagh Hill and Knockroe. There were non-megalith single-grave burial tombs, Linkardstown-type Cists, excavated at Jerpoint West. These are late Neolithic and before the single-grave rite of the Bronze Age. A Neolithic house was identified in Granny near Waterford, making it the oldest house in County Kilkenny. The square house consisted of slot-trenches, internal floor surfaces, a hearth and wooden posts at each corner, one of the post-holes was radiocarbon-dated to 3997\u20133728 BC. A new form of early Neolithic pottery with a lip around the inside of the rim were found. This Granny pottery is similar to pottery found in the south-east of England.\nOgham stones are found throughout County Kilkenny. The Gowran Ogham Stone which is on display in St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran is an example of a Christianised ogham stone. The ogham lettering is from the 3rd or 4th century. The Christian cross was carved c.\u20096th century following St. Patrick's arrival in Ireland in 432 AD. The ogham stone was found on the site during the rebuilding of the chancel in 1826. The Gowran Ogham Stone has survived to the present day due to the fact that it was used as a building stone in another part of the church and lay undisturbed for centuries.\nPassage graves consisted of a central burial chamber, with a long passageway to the entrance. Knockroe contains a passage tomb which is protected by listing order. From some time beginning around the Iron Age, Ireland has thousands of ringforts, or \"raths\". Carigeen, Danesfort, Dunbell big and Tullaroan all contain ring forts protected by preservation order.\nThe round stone tower is one feature of \"early historic architecture\" not usually found outside Ireland with only three in Scotland and one on the Isle of Man. The tower at St Canice's Cathedral in Kilkenny City is a good example. Other round towers are situated around the county such as Tullaherin round tower, one near Bennettsbridge, Kells, Johnstown, and Aghaviller near Knocktopher.\nCastles.\nKilkenny Castle is a castle in Kilkenny. It was the seat of the Butler family. Formerly the family name was FitzWalter. The castle was sold to the local Castle Restoration Committee in the middle of the 20th century for \u00a350. Shortly afterwards it was handed over to the State, and has since been refurbished and is open to visitors. Part of the National Art Gallery is on display in the castle. There are ornamental gardens on the town side of the castle, and extensive land and gardens to the front. It has become one of the most visited tourist sites in Ireland.\nFoulksrath Castle is a 15th-century Anglo-Norman tower house located in Jenkinstown in County Kilkenny. It was built by the Purcell clan, who also constructed several others nearby. After over three centuries as owners, the family was reduced to living as peasants in the castle stables after it was confiscated by Oliver Cromwell and given to his officers after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.\nAbbeys and priories.\nJerpoint Abbey is a Cistercian abbey near Thomastown. It was constructed in 1180, probably on the site of an earlier Benedictine monastery built in 1160 by Domnall Mac Gilla Patraic, King of Osraige. Jerpoint is notable for its stone carvings, including one at the tomb of Felix Ua Duib Sl\u00e1in, Bishop of the Diocese of Ossory when the abbey was founded.\nDuiske Abbey in Graiguenamanagh founded in 1204 was one of the first and largest Cistercians monasteries in Ireland. What remains of the monastery is a large gothic church which dominates the town centre in Graiguenamanagh. The abbey derives its name from the river Duiske or D\u00fabh Uisce which flows through the town on its way to the river Barrow which also flows through this town. Original floor tiles from the original building can be seen in the abbey along with the gothic and romanesque architecture.\nThe Black Abbey in Kilkenny, founded 1225, is a Dominican abbey with two-bay double-height lean-to lower aisle to south. It was extended, c.\u20091325, with four-bay double-height transept to south having four-bay double-height lean-to lower aisle to west.\nKells Priory is one of the largest medieval historic monuments in Ireland. It is a national monument and is in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works. The priory is scenically situated alongside King's River, about fifteen kilometres south of Kilkenny. One of its most striking feature is a collection of medieval tower houses spaced at intervals along and within walls which enclose a site of just over . These give the priory the appearance more of a fortress than of a place of worship and from them comes its local name of \"Seven Castles\".\nThe Callan Augustinian Friary is situated in Callan. It is known locally as the \"Abbey Meadow\" and is located at the North East of the town on the banks of the Kings Rover. Edmund Butler of Pottlerath, a noted patron of literature, successfully petitioned Pope Pius II for the foundation of the friary in 1461. After Edmund died in 1462, the actual buildings were erected by his son, James, probably after 1467 when he received a papal dispensation to marry his concubine, to whom he was related.\n18th-century bridges.\nThere are many 18th-century bridges in County Kilkenny. These bridges are an important element of the civil engineering and transport heritage of County Kilkenny and so are included in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) Building Survey.\nThe Great Flood of 1763 washed away many of the major bridges crossing the River Nore, and a comprehensive rebuilding programme was initiated. Many of the bridges are built to designs prepared by George Smith (1763\u201367), a pupil of George Semple, and they feature Classical-style detailing, indicating the lasting influence of the illustrations included in Andrea Palladio's \"I quattro libri dell'architettura\" (1570). Smith designed Green's Bridge in Kilkenny, Castlecomer Bridge on the Dinin (Deen) River; Thomastown Bridge on the River Nore; Graiguenamanagh Bridge on the River Barrow and Inistioge Bridge on the River Nore.\nOther 18th-century bridges include; the bridges in Goresbridge, Bennettsbridge, Kells, Threecastles, Dinin Bridge and the bridge at Mount Juliet.\nChurches.\nIn medieval times many fine churches in Ireland were also built such as St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran, St. Canice's Cathedral in Kilkenny and St. Mary's Cathedral.\nSt. Lachtain's Church, Freshford was built in 1731, incorporating a portal from 1100 as its main entrance, all that is left of the original church is the Hiberno-Romanesque (Irish-Roman) architectural porch and doorway. The remainder of the present church was built for Protestant worship in 1731. In St. Lachtains time Freshford was a diocese. In 1225 a bishops palace was built at Aghore (Achadh Ur), now Uppercourt. It was used as a summer residence for over 300 years.\nTourist attractions.\nIn County Kilkenny Jerpoint Abbey near Thomastown, Kells Priory at Kells. Kilkenny City including St Canice's Cathedral and St Mary's Cathedral, Rothe House and Kilkenny Castle.\nDunmore Cave is a show cave in Ballyfoyle, with a tourist centre established at the site. As well as a variety of cave formations, it is also one of the most documented archaeological sites in Ireland. Jenkinstown Park is about north of the town of Kilkenny and south of Castlecomer off the N78 road.\nGardens and Trails.\nGardens include Kilfane Glen in Thomastown, Woodstock Garden in Inistioge, the Discover Park in Castlecomer, Darver House garden in Jenkinstown, \"Coolcashin Garden\" near Johnstown, Emoclew Garden in Goresbridge, Shankill Gardens &amp; Castle in Paulstown, Rothe Family Garden in Kilkenny, Dahlia garden in The Rower and the rose garden at Kilkenny Castle. Hedgerows also have historical significance as townland and field boundaries.\nThe Nore Valley Way is a long-distance trail under development. When completed it will begin in Kilkenny City and end in Inistioge. It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by Trail Kilkenny, a group made up of representatives of Kilkenny County Council, County Kilkenny LEADER Partnership, Kilkenny Sports Partnership and local landowners.\nThe scenic South Leinster Way, a very scenic trail, journeys along the lower Barrow Valley before leaving the riverside at Graiguenamanagh to traverse the lower slopes of Brandon Hill.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2016 census, by the Central Statistics Office, County Kilkenny's population was 99,232, of whom 38,722 people reported some level of Irish language usage. There were 41,363 people reported as at work in the county in 2016. There were 1,251 births and 546 deaths in 2007. Disposable household income per person as of 2005 was 18,032 euros and the index of disposable household was 89.4.\nThe main religion is Catholic, however there are Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist, Jewish and other religious traditions living in Kilkenny.\nIrish language.\nCounty Kilkenny was the last county in Leinster to have native Irish speakers other than Louth (which was historically and linguistically a part of Ulster). The dialect shared the majority of its features with the surviving dialect of Ring in County Waterford. One distinct feature of the traditional Irish of Kilkenny (and Laois) as part of the Ossory dialect region was the pronunciation of slender R [\u027e\u02b2] as [\u0292\u02b2] similar to but not exactly like the G in the English word \"regime\". This [\u0292\u02b2] sound was devoiced to an \"sh\" sound when slender R was adjacent to the sound /h/. The Irish language scholar Riste\u00e1rd A. Breatnach wrote an MA thesis entitled \"Kilkenny Irish\" but this remains unpublished.\nBaile Sh\u00e9amais, in Glenmore, was home to P\u00e1draig Paor who is believed to have been the last traditional native speaker of the Irish language in County Kilkenny. Audio-recordings were made of his speech in 1936 for the Irish Folklore Commission (Coimisi\u00fan B\u00e9aloideasa \u00c9ireann) by S\u00e9amus \u00d3 Duilearga and Riste\u00e1rd A Breatnach. His speech contains the well-documented Ossory pronunciation of slender R as , resembling the \u27e8j\u27e9 sound of Standard French.\nEconomy.\nCooperatives.\nIn 1966, County Kilkenny village creameries amalgamated to create Avonmore Creameries, becoming Avonmore Food plc in 1988. The company joined with Waterford Food plc in 1997 to form Glanbia plc, a large multinational nutrition company with 2019 revenues of over \u20ac2.3 billion and 6,900 employees.\nThe local operations have returned to co-operative control under the Tirl\u00e1n brand in 2022.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann (Irish Rail) provides rail services from Dublin to Waterford which pass through Kilkenny MacDonagh Station in Kilkenny and Thomastown railway station. Waterford railway station is located just outside County Kilkenny. The stations served are Dublin Heuston, Newbridge, Kildare, Athy, Carlow, Muine Bheag (Bagenalstown), Kilkenny, Thomastown, Waterford Plunkett. Since Kilkenny is a stub station, reversal is necessary. Non Passenger trains such as the DFDS Freight train from Ballina \u2013 Waterford avoid Kilkenny by using Lavistown loop which joins both lines going into Kilkenny. All direct services are operated by 22000 railcars. There is a service every 2 hours.\nBus \u00c9ireann and JJ Kavanagh and Sons provide bus services throughout the county.\nKilkenny Airport is a small airport located just 1.5\u00a0km West of Kilkenny. There are 6 powered resident aircraft and two gliders based at the aerodrome.\nHospitals.\nHospitals in County Kilkenny include three public and one private hospitals. St. Luke's General Hospital is a general medical and surgical hospital built in 1942. It is situated on the Freshford Road and provides a range of local and regional services, including general medicine, general surgery, obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics. St. Canice's is a psychiatric hospital, opened in 1852 and located on the Dublin Road. It provides a range of mental health services including acute and long stay care, out-patient services throughout the county including addiction counselling services, respite care community hostel facilities and day care facilities. Kilcreene is the regional orthopaedic hospital based outside Kilkenny in Kilcreene. Aut Even is a private hospital based outside the city of Kilkenny. In Castlecomer there is Castlecomer District Hospital.\nMost maternity services for County Kilkenny are proved in Waterford at University Hospital Waterford.\nThere are also health centres based around County Kilkenny including in Ballyhale, Ballyragget, Bennettsbridge, Callan, Castlecomer, Clogh, Castlecomer, Freshford, Gowran, Graiguenamanagh, Marley and Tinnahinch in Graiguenamanagh, Inistioge, Johnstown, Loughboy in Kilkenny, Stoneyford, Kilmacow, Mullinavat, Paulstown, Rosbercon, Thomastown, Urlingford and Windgap.\nSport.\nGAA.\nIn hurling, by far the dominant sport in the county, Kilkenny GAA compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, which they have won a record thirty-six times, the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship, which they have won seventy times, and the National Hurling League, which they have won seventeen times. Kilkenny, along with Cork and Tipperary, are regarded as 'the Big Three' in the world of hurling. Brian Cody has been manager of the Kilkenny senior hurling team since 1998. The current senior hurling captain is Joey Holden from Ballyhale Shamrocks.\nThe Kilkenny flag or county colours are black and amber. The County Kilkenny hurling team, Tullaroan, were the first Kilkenny team to wear the famous black and amber colours. In 1886, after winning the first-ever county championship in Kilkenny they held a fund-raising event in Tullaroan to provide the team with a playing strip. After intensive debate and consultations the club chose the black and amber stripes as the design for the jerseys that they would wear against Limerick that August.\nHorse racing.\nGowran Park is a horse racing course near Gowran. The first meeting was held in 1914 and the racecourse hosts 16 race days throughout the year including the Thyestes Chase (The Grand National of the South), one of the prestigious steeplechases in Ireland which has been won by three time Cheltenham Gold Cup Winner, Arkle in 1964 and Aintree Grand National winners Hedgehunter and Numbersixvalverde. It has 16 National Hunt and Flat meetings all year round.\nGolf.\nMount Juliet Golf Course is a golf resort situated in Thomastown. It was the venue for the 2002 and 2004 WGC-American Express Championship, having previously hosted the European Tour's Irish Open on three occasions between 1993 and 1995. The par 72, Jack Nicklaus designed golf course opened in 1991, and was voted \"Best Parkland Golf Course\" by Backspin Golf Magazine in March 2008. There is also a full 18-hole putting course set in the grounds of Mount Juliet House, which is the venue for the annual National Putting Championship.\nKilkenny Golf Club is 18-hole championship parkland course within the town to the North West, close to town centre. It hosted several Professional Championship events. In 1984 and 1996, it was the venue for the All Ireland Mixed Foursome Finals and in 1985 hosted the All Ireland Cups and Shields Finals. The course is mostly flat terrain with an abundance of trees. Around Kilkenny City there is also a Driving Range in Newpark and an 18-hole all weather Par 3 golf course in Pocoke.\nOther golf courses include Gowran Park Golf Course in Gowran, Callan Golf Club in Callan, Castlecomer Golf Club in Castlecomer, Mountain View Golf Course in Ballyhale and Carrigleade Golf Course in Graiguenamanagh.\nCulture.\nThe Riordans (1965 to 1979) made by Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann (then called \"Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann\") was set in the fictional townland of Leestown in County Kilkenny. Its use of Outside Broadcast Units and its filming of its episodes \"on location\" rather than in studio, broke the mould of broadcasting in the soap opera genre. It was the second Irish soap opera and inspired the creation of its British equivalent, \"Emmerdale Farm\" (now called \"Emmerdale\") by Yorkshire Television in 1972.\nCounty anthem.\nThe song \"The Rose of Mooncoin\" is the traditional anthem of the county at GAA fixtures.\nThe recently released, \"Kilkenny by the Nore\" sung by Alice O'Hanlon is also now considered an anthem.\nNotable people.\nIn the book: \"Kilkenny: The Landed Gentry &amp; Aristocracy\" by Art Kavanagh (2004), he had devoted a chapter each to eighteen of the most prominent Kilkenny Families, chosen 'on a random geographical basis to ensure even distribution over the entire County', as follows \u2013 Agar of Gowran, Blunden of Castle Blunden, Bryan of Jenkinstown, Butler (Lords Carrick), Butler of Maidenhall, Butler (Lords Mountgarret), Butler (Earls of Ormonde), Cuffe (Lords Desart), De Montmorency, Flood of Farmley, Langrishe of Knocktopher, Loftus of Mount Juliet, McCalmont of Mount Juliet, Ponsonby (Earls of Bessborough), Power of Kilfane, Smithwick of Kilcreene, St George of Freshford and Wandesforde of Catlecomer.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

The company was formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation with Martin Marietta on March 15, 1995. \nLockheed Martin operates 4 divisions: Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (39% of 2024 revenues), which includes Skunk Works, the F-35 Lightning II strike fighter, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the F-22 Raptor; Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (18% of 2024 revenues), which includes the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System, the Precision Strike Missile, the AGM-158 JASSM air-launched cruise missile, the AGM-158C LRASM anti-ship missile, the AGM-114 Hellfire, the Apache fire-control system, the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod, Infrared search and track, and support services for special forces; Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems (24% of 2024 revenues), which includes Sikorsky Aircraft such as the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk, Sikorsky VH-92 Patriot, Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion, and Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk, the Aegis Combat System, Littoral combat ships, Freedom-class littoral combat ships, River-class destroyers, and the C2BMC missile defense program; and Lockheed Martin Space (18% of 2024 revenues), which includes the UGM-133 Trident II ballistic missile, the Orion spacecraft, the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared, GPS Block III, hypersonic weapons and transport layer programs and the Ground-Based Interceptor.\nIn 2024, 73% of the company's revenue came from the federal government of the United States, including 65% from the United States Department of Defense. In 2024, 26% of revenue was from sales of the F-35 fighter.\nLockheed Martin is also a contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It also provides products and services to the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is involved in surveillance and information processing for the CIA, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Pentagon, the Census Bureau, and the Postal Service.\nThe company has received the Collier Trophy six times, including in 2001 for being part of developing the X-35/F-35B LiftFan Propulsion System and in 2018 for the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS). Lockheed Martin currently produces the F-35 and leads the international supply chain, leads the team for the development and implementation of technology solutions for the new USAF Space Fence (AFSSS replacement), and is the primary contractor for the development of the Orion command module. The company also invests in healthcare systems, renewable energy systems, intelligent energy distribution, and compact nuclear fusion.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nMerger talks between Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta began in March 1994, with the companies announcing their $10\u00a0billion planned merger on August 30, 1994. The headquarters for the combined companies would be at Martin Marietta headquarters in North Bethesda, Maryland. The deal was finalized on March 15, 1995, when the two companies' shareholders approved the merger. The segments of the two companies not retained by the new company formed the basis for L-3 Communications, a mid-size defense contractor in its own right. Lockheed Martin also later spun off the materials company Martin Marietta Materials.\nThe company's executives received large bonuses directly from the government as a result of the merger. Norman R. Augustine, who was at the time CEO of Martin Marietta, received an $8.2 million bonus.\nBoth companies contributed important products to the new portfolio. Lockheed products included the Trident missile, P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance airplanes, F-117 Nighthawk, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, C-130 Hercules, A-4AR Fightinghawk and the DSCS-3 satellite. Martin Marietta products included Titan rockets, Sandia National Laboratories (management contract acquired in 1993), Space Shuttle External Tank, Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers, the Transfer Orbit Stage (under subcontract to Orbital Sciences Corporation) and various satellite models.\nOn April 22, 1996, Lockheed Martin completed the acquisition of Loral Corporation's defense electronics and system integration businesses for $9.1\u00a0billion, the deal having been announced in January. The remainder of Loral became Loral Space &amp; Communications. Lockheed Martin abandoned plans for an $8.3\u00a0billion merger with Northrop Grumman on July 16, 1998, due to government concerns over the potential strength of the new group; Lockheed/Northrop would have had control of 25% of the Department of Defense's procurement budget.\nFor the Mars Climate Orbiter, Lockheed Martin incorrectly provided NASA with software using measurements in US Customary force units when metric units were expected; this resulted in the loss of the Orbiter at a cost of $125\u00a0million. The development of the spacecraft cost $193\u00a0million.\nIn addition to their military products, in the 1990s Lockheed Martin developed the texture mapping chip for the Sega Model 2 arcade system board and the entire graphics system for the Sega Model 3, which were used to power some of the most popular arcade games of the time.\n2000s.\nIn May 2001, Lockheed Martin sold Lockheed Martin Control Systems to BAE Systems. On November 27, 2000, Lockheed completed the sale of its Aerospace Electronic Systems business to BAE Systems for $1.67\u00a0billion, a deal announced in July 2000. This group encompassed Sanders Associates, Fairchild Systems, and Lockheed Martin Space Electronics &amp; Communications. In 2001, Lockheed Martin won the contract to build the F-35 Lightning II; this was the largest fighter aircraft procurement project since the F-16, with an initial order of 3,000 aircraft. In 2001, Lockheed Martin settled a nine\u2013year investigation conducted by NASA's Office of Inspector General with the assistance of the Defense Contract Audit Agency. The company paid the United States government $7.1\u00a0million based on allegations that its predecessor, Lockheed Engineering Science Corporation, submitted false lease costs claims to NASA.\nOn July 8, 2003, a Lockheed Martin plant in Meridian, Mississippi became the scene of a racially motivated mass shooting when an assembly line worker murdered six co-workers (five of whom were black) and wounded eight before killing himself. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Lockheed Martin's President refused to disclose whether company officials were previously aware of any red flags regarding the worker. The company had launched its own investigation into the worker's behavior prior to the massacre following complaints from numerous black employees regarding incidents involving the worker. He had been ordered to attend anger management courses and diversity training but refused.\nOn May 12, 2006, \"The Washington Post\" reported that when Robert Stevens took control of Lockheed Martin in 2004, he faced the dilemma that within 10 years, 100,000 of the about 130,000 Lockheed Martin employees \u2013 more than three-quarters \u2013 would be retiring. On August 31, 2006, Lockheed Martin won a $3.9\u00a0billion contract from NASA to design and build the CEV capsule, later named \"Orion\" for the Ares I rocket in the Constellation Program. In 2009, NASA reduced the capsule crew requirements from the initial six seats to four for transport to the International Space Station.\nIn August 2007, Lockheed Martin acquired 3Dsolve, a Cary, North Carolina, company that created simulations and training modules for the military and corporate clients. Renamed Lockheed Martin 3D Learning Systems, the company remained in Cary with 3D's founder Richard Boyd as director. The name was eventually shortened to Lockheed Martin 3D Solutions.\nOn August 13, 2008, Lockheed Martin acquired the government business unit of Nantero, Inc., a company that had developed methods and processes for incorporating carbon nanotubes in next-generation electronic devices. In 2009, Lockheed Martin bought Unitech.\n2010s.\nOn November 18, 2010, Lockheed Martin announced that it would be closing its Eagan, Minnesota, location by 2013 to reduce costs and optimize capacity at its locations nationwide. In January 2011, Lockheed Martin agreed to pay the U.S. Government $2\u00a0million to settle allegations that the company submitted false claims on a U.S. government contract for that amount. The allegations came from a contract with the Naval Oceanographic Office Major Shared Resource Center in Mississippi.\nOn May 25, 2011, Lockheed Martin bought the first Quantum Computing System from D-Wave Systems. Lockheed Martin and D-Wave will collaborate to realize the benefits of a computing platform based upon a quantum annealing processor, as applied to some of Lockheed Martin's most challenging computation problems. Lockheed Martin established a multi-year contract that includes one system, maintenance, and services.\nOn May 28, 2011, it was reported that a cyberattack using previously stolen EMC files had broken through to sensitive materials at the contractor. It is unclear if the Lockheed incident is the specific prompt whereby on June 1, 2011, the new United States military strategy, makes explicit that a cyberattack is \"casus belli\" for a traditional act of war.\nOn March 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said that Lockheed Martin had agreed to settle allegations that the defense contractor had sold overpriced perishable tools used on many contracts. The DOJ said the allegations were based specifically on the subsidiary Tools &amp; Metals Inc's inflation of costs between 1998 and 2005, which Lockheed Martin then passed on to the U.S. government under its contracts. Further, in March 2006, Todd B. Loftis, a former TMI president, was sentenced to 87 months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of $20 million following his guilty plea.\nOn July 10, 2012, Lockheed Martin announced it was cutting its workforce by 740 workers to reduce costs and remain competitive as necessary for future growth. On November 27, 2012, Lockheed Martin announced that Marillyn Hewson would become the corporation's chief executive officer on January 1, 2013.\nOn January 7, 2013, Lockheed Martin Canada announced that it would be acquiring the engine maintenance, repair, and overhaul assets from Aveos Fleet Performance in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. On February 20, 2013, Lockheed Martin Corp complied with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, agreeing to pay a $19.5 million lawsuit to conclude a securities fraud class-action legal battle that had accused the company of deceiving shareholders in regards to expectations for the company's information technology division. On July 3, 2013, Lockheed Martin announced that it was partnering with DreamHammer to use the company's software for integrated command and control of its unmanned aerial vehicles. Lockheed Martin teamed up with Bell Helicopter to propose the V-280 Valor tiltrotor for the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. In September 2013, Lockheed Martin acquired the Scotland-based tech firm, Amor Group, saying the deal would aid its plans to expand internationally and into non-defense markets. On November 14, 2013, Lockheed announced they would be closing their Akron, Ohio facility laying off 500 employees and transferring other employees to other locations.\nIn October 2013, Lockheed announced it expected to finalize a $2.2 billion contract with the United States Air Force for two advanced military communications satellites.\nIn March 2014, Lockheed Martin acquired Beontra AG, a provider of integrated planning and demand forecasting tools for airport, planning to expand their business in commercial airport information technology solutions. Also, in March 2014, Lockheed Martin announced its acquisition of Industrial Defender Inc. On June 2, 2014, Lockheed Martin received a Pentagon contract to build a space fence that would track debris, keeping it from damaging satellites and spacecraft.\nOn December 20, 2014, Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems agreed to settle a False Claims Act lawsuit paying $27.5 million to finalize allegations that it had knowingly overbilled taxpayers for work performed by company staff who did not hold the relevant essential qualifications for the contract.\nOn July 20, 2015, Lockheed Martin announced plans to purchase Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corporation at a cost of $7.1 billion. The Pentagon has criticized the acquisition as causing a reduction in competition. In November 2015, the acquisition received final approval from the Chinese government, with a total cost of $9 billion. Dan Schulz was named the president of Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky company. Lockheed Martin has shown sketches for a twin-engine, blended wing body strategic airlifter similar in size to the C-5. On March 31, 2015, the US Navy awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth $362 million for the construction of Freedom-class ship LCS 21 and $79 million for advance procurement for LCS 23. The Freedom-class ships are built by Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin. In December 2015, Lockheed won an $867 million seven-year contract to train Australia's next generation of military pilots. The deal also has the option to extend this contract across 26 years, which would greatly increase the deal's value.\nIn August 2016, Canadian Forces Maritime tested an integrated submarine combat system developed by Lockheed Martin. The test marked Canada's first use of the combat system with the MK 48 heavyweight torpedo, variant 7AT. The same month, a deal to merge Leidos with the entirety of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions (IS&amp;GS) business came to a close.\nIn May 2017, during a visit to Saudi Arabia by President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia signed business deals worth tens of billions of dollars with U.S. companies, including Lockheed Martin. (See: 2017 United States\u2013Saudi Arabia arms deal)\nOn August 13, 2018, Lockheed Martin announced that the company had secured a $480 million contract from the United States Air Force to develop a hypersonic weapon prototype. A hypersonic missile can travel at one mile a second. This is the second contract for hypersonic weapons that Martin has secured; The first was from the Air Force as well and for $928 million which was announced in April 2018.\nOn November 29, 2018, Lockheed Martin was awarded a Commercial Lunar Payload Services contract by NASA, which makes it eligible to bid on delivering science and technology payloads to the Moon for NASA, worth $2.6 billion. Lockheed Martin plans to formally propose a lander called \"McCandless Lunar Lander\", named after the late astronaut and former Lockheed Martin employee Bruce McCandless II, who in 1984 performed the first free-flying spacewalk without a lifeline to the orbiting shuttle, using a jetpack built by the company. This lander would be based on the successful design of the \"Phoenix\" and \"InSight\" Mars landers.\nOn April 11, 2019, at 6:35 pm EDT, an Arabsat-6A satellite was successfully launched from (LC-39A). This satellite is one of two, the other being SaudiGeoSat-1/HellasSat-4 and they are the \"most advanced commercial communications satellites ever built by\" Lockheed Martin.\nOn September 23, 2019, Lockheed Martin and NASA signed a $4.6-billion contract to build six or more Orion capsules for NASA's Artemis program to send astronauts to the Moon.\n2020s.\nIn January 2020, the Naval Sea Systems Command awarded Lockheed Martin with a $138 million contract related with the AEGIS Combat System Engineering Agent (CSEA). The LMT Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) unit of the company is to develop, integrate, test, and deliver the AEGIS Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 20 integrated combat system. Martin will work on the AEGIS in New Jersey. The project is expected to be completed by December 2020.\nIn January 2020, the Pentagon found at least 800 software defects in Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets owned by the US Armed Forces during an annual review. The 2018 and 2019 reviews revealed a large number of defects as well.\nIn February 2020, Lockheed Martin acquired Vector Launch Inc's satellite software technology GalacticSky for $4.25 million after a bankruptcy court received no bids by the February 21 deadline.\nOn March 16, 2020, Lockheed Martin announced that James D. Taiclet would replace Marillyn Hewson as CEO, effective June 15.

The acquisition was expected to close in first quarter of 2022. On February 13, 2022, Lockheed abandoned the deal following regulatory disapproval.\nIn 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, major arms manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin, reported a sharp increase in interim sales and profits.\nIn May 2023, Lockheed formed a new microelectronics subsidiary ForwardEdge ASIC to design custom application-specific integrated circuits for its customers.\nIn November 2023, attempts at Direct action were taken against arms companies in the US and the UK, including Lockheed Martin, that supplied weapons to Israel during the Gaza war.\nIn March 2024, Lockheed Martin submitted a bid to acquire Terran Orbital.\nOn June 28, 2024, the U.S. Army awarded Lockheed Martin a $4.5 billion contract to supply Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles. The contract included 870 PAC-3 MSE missiles and related hardware. Lockheed was tasked with manufacturing the newest version of these interceptors, with each PAC-3 MSE missile costing approximately $4 million, as per Army budget documents.\nOn October 9, 2024, Lockheed Martin announced the appointment of Chauncey McIntosh as vice president and general manager of the F-35 Lightning II Program, effective December 1, 2024. He succeeded Bridget Lauderdale, who retired after 38 years with the company.\nIn December 2024, Lockheed Martin announced that it had formed a subsidiary, Astris AI, that would help\u00a0U.S. defense companies to incorporate artificial intelligence into their operations.\nFinances.\nFor the fiscal year 2020, Lockheed Martin reported earnings of $6.833 billion, with an annual revenue of $65.398 billion, an increase of 9.3% over the previous year. Backlog was 144.0 billion at the end of 2019, up from 130.5 billion at the end of the 2018. Firm orders were $94.5 billion at the end of 2019. Its shares traded at over $389 per share. Its market capitalization was valued at US$109.83 billion at the end of 2019. Lockheed Martin ranked No. 60 in the 2019 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue (down from No. 59 in 2018).\n$1.6 billion Q2 loss due to \"magical\" classified program.\nLockheed profits sharply dropped 80% in Q2 2025, owing to a highly classified U.S. government aerospace program CEO James Taiclet described as \"magical\". The loss from development of the described \"game changing\" classified aerospace program totaled $1.6 billion. Taiclet stated investors would be unable to know details of the \"magical\" classified aerospace program for many years to come. During the same earnings call, Lockheed acknowledged the existence of a second highly classified aerospace program, described as well as both magical and game-changing.\nCorporate governance.\nBoard of directors.\nThe board of directors consists of 14 members. As of 2020, members include:\nOwnership.\nAs of December 2023, Lockheed Martin shares are mainly held by institutional investors (State Street Corporation, Vanguard group, BlackRock, Capital Group Companies, and others).\nCriticism.\nLockheed Martin is listed as the largest U.S. government contractor and ranks first for the number of incidents, and fifth for the size of settlements on the 'contractor misconduct' database maintained by the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington, D.C.\u2013based watchdog group. Since 1995, the company has agreed to pay $676.8\u00a0million to settle 88 instances of misconduct.\nIn 2015, Lockheed Martin agreed to pay $4.7 million to settle charges that it illegally used taxpayer money to lobby the federal government to block competitors, including by funneling funds through its subsidiary, Sandia Corporation. This involved hiring former Representative Heather Wilson, one of the most influential ex-lawmakers in the defense sector, as an unregistered lobbyist to maintain Lockheed's lucrative nuclear weapons lab contracts. More broadly, commentators have criticized Lockheed Martin and other weapons defense firms for using secretive spending and dark money to influence defense policy, raising concerns about reduced accountability and national security risks.\nIn 2013, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan criticized the company's F-35 fighter program. The general said: \"I want them both to start behaving like they want to be around for 40 years\u00a0... I want them to take on some of the risk of this program. I want them to invest in cost reductions. I want them to do the things that will build a better relationship. I'm not getting all that love yet.\" The criticism came in the wake of previous criticism from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates regarding the same program.\nLockheed Martin has highlighted the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine as potential opportunities for future revenue growth.\nLobbying.\nAccording to the magazine \"Politico\", Lockheed Martin has \"a political network that is already the envy of its competitors\", and its contracts enjoy wide bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress thanks to it having \"perfected the strategy of spreading jobs on weapons programs in key states and congressional districts\". The company's 2022 lobbying expenditure is $13.6\u00a0million (2009 total: $13.7\u00a0million).\nThrough its political action committee (PAC), the company provides low levels of financial support to candidates who advocate national defense and relevant business issues. It was the largest contributor to the House Armed Services Committee chairman, Republican Buck McKeon of California with over $50,000 donated in the election cycle as of January 2011. It also was the top donor to Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-HI), the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee before his death in 2012.\nLockheed Martin Employees Political Action Committee is one of the 50 largest in the country, according to FEC data. With contributions from 3,000 employees, it donates $500,000 a year to about 260 House and Senate candidates.\nIn 2025, Lockheed Martin was one of the donors who funded the White House's East Wing demolition, and planned building of a ballroom.\nManagement.\nSenior management consists of the CEO, CFO, and Executive Vice Presidents (EVPs) of four business areas. The EVPs are responsible for managing major programs.\nOn March 16, 2020, Lockheed announced that CEO Marillyn Hewson would become executive chair and be succeeded as CEO by James Taiclet on June 15; Taiclet was at the time the head of American Tower, and had previously been the president of Honeywell Aerospace and before that a VP at United Technologies. Lockheed also announced that it would create the chief operating officer role, to which current EVP Frank A. St John would be promoted.\nEmployees in each program are organized into four tiers: Tier 1: Program Manager/VP, Tier 2: Functional Teams (Finance, Chief Engineer, Quality, Operations, etc.), Tier 3: Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) (Weapon System Development, Weapon System Integration, etc.), and Tier 4: detailed product development. Floor or touch workers belong to component assembly teams. Lockheed Martin manages and maintains its relationship with these touch workers through its supervisors and unions.\nLockheed Martin manages employees through its Full Spectrum Leadership and LM21 programs. The LM21 program relies on Six Sigma principles, which are techniques to improve efficiency. Senior management constructs leadership councils and assigns managers to facilitate Kaizen events, which target specific processes for improvement. A manager facilitates teams and processes stakeholders and suppliers to streamline process implementation.\nTier 2 Functional Leads and Tier 3 IPT Leads report to Tier 1. IPT leads are responsible for entire systems or products defined by the contract's Statement of Work.\nTo control quality, Lockheed Martin trains and builds IPT teams. and ensures that work is executed correctly through a Technical Performance Measure (TPM) system which emphasizes its Lean and 6 Sigma processes. Middle management uses commitment mechanisms that parallel high commitment and human relations theory.\nFloor employees assemble aircraft using Flow-to-takt lean manufacturing process which uses properties from both division of labor and scientific management. By separating tasks based on parts, Lockheed Martin utilizes the division of labor theory, specialization on a specific area creates efficiency.\nDouble Helix methodology.\nThe \"Double Helix methodology\" is a systems development methodology used by Lockheed Martin. It combines experimentation, technology, and a warfighter's concept of operations to create new tactics and weapons.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In plants, both phases are multicellular: the haploid sexual phase \u2013 the gametophyte \u2013 alternates with a diploid asexual phase \u2013 the sporophyte.\nA mature sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis, a process which reduces the number of chromosomes to half, from two sets to one. The resulting haploid spores germinate and grow into multicellular haploid gametophytes. At maturity, a gametophyte produces gametes by mitosis, the normal process of cell division in eukaryotes, which maintains the original number of chromosomes. Two haploid gametes (originating from different organisms of the same species or from the same organism) fuse to produce a diploid zygote, which divides repeatedly by mitosis, developing into a multicellular diploid sporophyte. This cycle, from gametophyte to sporophyte (or equally from sporophyte to gametophyte), is the way in which all land plants and most algae undergo sexual reproduction.\nThe relationship between the sporophyte and gametophyte phases varies among different groups of plants. In the majority of algae, the sporophyte and gametophyte are separate independent organisms, which may or may not have a similar appearance. In liverworts, mosses and hornworts, the sporophyte is less well developed than the gametophyte and is largely dependent on it. Although moss and hornwort sporophytes can photosynthesise, they require additional photosynthate from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and depend on it for supply of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen. By contrast to all modern vascular plants, the gametophyte is less well developed than the sporophyte, although their Devonian ancestors had gametophytes and sporophytes of approximately equivalent complexity. In ferns, the gametophyte is a small flattened autotrophic prothallus on which the young sporophyte is briefly dependent for its nutrition. In flowering plants, the reduction of the gametophyte is much more extreme; it consists of just a few cells which grow entirely inside the sporophyte.\nAnimals develop differently. They directly produce haploid gametes. No haploid spores capable of dividing are produced, so generally there is no multicellular haploid phase. Some insects have a sex-determining system whereby haploid males are produced from unfertilized eggs; however, females produced from fertilized eggs are diploid.\nLife cycles of plants and algae with alternating haploid and diploid multicellular stages are referred to as diplohaplontic. The equivalent terms haplodiplontic, diplobiontic and dibiontic are also in use, as is describing such an organism as having a diphasic ontogeny. Life cycles of animals, in which there is only a diploid multicellular stage, are referred to as diplontic. Life cycles in which there is only a haploid multicellular stage are referred to as haplontic.\nDefinition.\nAlternation of generations is defined as the alternation of multicellular diploid and haploid forms in the organism's life cycle, regardless of whether these forms are free-living. In some species, such as the alga \"Ulva lactuca\", the diploid and haploid forms are indeed both free-living independent organisms, essentially identical in appearance and therefore said to be isomorphic. In many algae, the free-swimming, haploid gametes form a diploid zygote which germinates into a multicellular diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte produces free-swimming haploid spores by meiosis that germinate into haploid gametophytes.\nHowever, in land plants, either the sporophyte or the gametophyte is very much reduced and is incapable of free living. For example, in all bryophytes the gametophyte generation is dominant and the sporophyte is dependent on it. By contrast, in all seed plants the gametophytes are strongly reduced, although the fossil evidence indicates that they were derived from isomorphic ancestors. In seed plants, the female gametophyte develops totally within the sporophyte, which protects and nurtures it and the embryonic sporophyte that it produces. The pollen grains, which are the male gametophytes, are reduced to only a few cells (just three cells in many cases). Here the notion of two generations is less obvious; as Bateman &amp; Dimichele say \"sporophyte and gametophyte effectively function as a single organism\". The alternative term 'alternation of phases' may then be more appropriate.\nHistory.\nIn animals.\nInitially, Adelbert von Chamisso (studying salps, colonial marine animals between 1815 and 1818) and Japetus Steenstrup (studying the development of trematodes in 1842, and also tunicates and cnidarians) described the succession of differently organized generations (sexual and asexual) in animals as \"alternation of generations\". Later, the phenomenon in animals became known as heterogamy, while the term \"alternation of generations\" was restricted to the life cycles of plants, meaning specifically the alternation of haploid gametophytes and diploid sporophytes.\nIn plants.\nIn 1851, Wilhelm Hofmeister demonstrated the morphological alternation of generations in plants, between a spore-bearing generation (sporophyte) and a gamete-bearing generation (gametophyte). By that time, a debate emerged focusing on the origin of the asexual generation of land plants (i.e., the sporophyte) and is conventionally characterized as a conflict between theories of antithetic (Ladislav Josef \u010celakovsk\u00fd, 1874) and homologous (Nathanael Pringsheim, 1876) alternation of generations.\nIn 1874, Eduard Strasburger discovered the alternation between diploid and haploid nuclear phases, also called cytological alternation of nuclear phases. Although most often coinciding, morphological alternation and nuclear phases alternation are sometimes independent of one another, e.g., in many red algae, the same nuclear phase may correspond to two diverse morphological generations. In some ferns which lost sexual reproduction, there is no change in nuclear phase, but the alternation of generations is maintained.\nAlternation of generations in plants.\nFundamental elements.\nThe diagram above shows the fundamental elements of the alternation of generations in plants. There are many variations in different groups of plants. The processes involved are as follows:\nThe 'alternation of generations' in the life cycle is thus between a diploid (2\"n\") generation of multicellular sporophytes and a haploid (\"n\") generation of multicellular gametophytes.\nThe situation is quite different from that in animals, where the fundamental process is that a multicellular diploid (2\"n\") individual directly produces haploid (\"n\") gametes by meiosis. In animals, spores (i.e. haploid cells which are able to undergo mitosis) are not produced, so there is no asexual multicellular generation. Some insects have haploid males that develop from unfertilized eggs, but the females are all diploid.\nVariations.\nThe diagram shown above is a good representation of the life cycle of some multi-cellular algae (e.g. the genus \"Cladophora\") which have sporophytes and gametophytes of almost identical appearance and which do not have different kinds of spores or gametes.\nHowever, there are many possible variations on the fundamental elements of a life cycle which has alternation of generations. Each variation may occur separately or in combination, resulting in a bewildering variety of life cycles. The terms used by botanists in describing these life cycles can be equally bewildering. As Bateman and Dimichele say \"[...] the alternation of generations has become a terminological morass; often, one term represents several concepts or one concept is represented by several terms.\"\nPossible variations are:\nThere are some correlations between these variations, but they are just that, correlations, and not absolute. For example, in flowering plants, microspores ultimately produce microgametes (sperm) and megaspores ultimately produce megagametes (eggs). However, in ferns and their allies there are groups with undifferentiated spores but differentiated gametophytes. For example, the fern \"Ceratopteris thalictrioides\" has spores of only one kind, which vary continuously in size. Smaller spores tend to germinate into gametophytes which produce only sperm-producing antheridia.\nA complex life cycle.\nPlant life cycles can be complex. Alternation of generations can take place in plants which are at once heteromorphic, sporophytic, oogametic, dioicous, heterosporic and dioecious, such as in a willow tree (as most species of the genus \"Salix\" are dioecious). The processes involved are:\nLife cycles of different plant groups.\nThe term \"plants\" is taken here to mean the Archaeplastida, i.e. the glaucophytes, red and green algae and land plants.\nAlternation of generations occurs in almost all multicellular red and green algae, both freshwater forms (such as \"Cladophora\") and seaweeds (such as \"Ulva\"). In most, the generations are homomorphic (isomorphic) and free-living. Some species of red algae have a complex triphasic alternation of generations, in which there is a gametophyte phase and two distinct sporophyte phases. For further information, see Red algae: Reproduction.\nLand plants all have heteromorphic (anisomorphic) alternation of generations, in which the sporophyte and gametophyte are distinctly different. All bryophytes, i.e. liverworts, mosses and hornworts, have the gametophyte generation as the most conspicuous. As an illustration, consider a monoicous moss. Antheridia and archegonia develop on the mature plant (the gametophyte). In the presence of water, the biflagellate sperm from the antheridia swim to the archegonia and fertilisation occurs, leading to the production of a diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte grows up from the archegonium. Its body comprises a long stalk topped by a capsule within which spore-producing cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. Most mosses rely on the wind to disperse these spores, although \"Splachnum sphaericum\" is entomophilous, recruiting insects to disperse its spores.\nThe life cycle of ferns and their allies, including clubmosses and horsetails, the conspicuous plant observed in the field is the diploid sporophyte. The haploid spores develop in sori on the underside of the fronds and are dispersed by the wind (or in some cases, by floating on water). If conditions are right, a spore will germinate and grow into a rather inconspicuous plant body called a prothallus. The haploid prothallus does not resemble the sporophyte, and as such ferns and their allies have a heteromorphic alternation of generations. The prothallus is short-lived, but carries out sexual reproduction, producing the diploid zygote that then grows out of the prothallus as the sporophyte.\nIn the spermatophytes, the seed plants, the sporophyte is the dominant multicellular phase; the gametophytes are strongly reduced in size and very different in morphology. The entire gametophyte generation, with the sole exception of pollen grains (microgametophytes), is contained within the sporophyte. The life cycle of a dioecious flowering plant (angiosperm), the willow, has been outlined in some detail in an earlier section (A complex life cycle). The life cycle of a gymnosperm is similar. However, flowering plants have in addition a phenomenon called 'double fertilization'. In the process of double fertilization, two sperm nuclei from a pollen grain (the microgametophyte), rather than a single sperm, enter the archegonium of the megagametophyte; one fuses with the egg nucleus to form the zygote, the other fuses with two other nuclei of the gametophyte to form 'endosperm', which nourishes the developing embryo.\nEvolution of the dominant diploid phase.\nIt has been proposed that the basis for the emergence of the diploid phase of the life cycle (sporophyte) as the dominant phase (e.g. as in vascular plants) is that diploidy allows masking of the expression of deleterious mutations through genetic complementation. Thus if one of the parental genomes in the diploid cells contained mutations leading to defects in one or more gene products, these deficiencies could be compensated for by the other parental genome (which nevertheless may have its own defects in other genes). As the diploid phase was becoming predominant, the masking effect likely allowed genome size, and hence information content, to increase without the constraint of having to improve accuracy of DNA replication. The opportunity to increase information content at low cost was advantageous because it permitted new adaptations to be encoded. This view has been challenged, with evidence showing that selection is no more effective in the haploid than in the diploid phases of the lifecycle of mosses and angiosperms.\nSimilar processes in other organisms.\nRhizaria.\nSome organisms currently classified in the clade Rhizaria and thus not plants in the sense used here, exhibit alternation of generations. Most Foraminifera undergo a heteromorphic alternation of generations between haploid gamont and diploid agamont forms. The diploid form is typically much larger than the haploid form; these forms are known as the \"microsphere\" and \"megalosphere\", respectively.\nFungi.\nFungal mycelia are typically haploid. When mycelia of different mating types meet, they produce two multinucleate ball-shaped cells, which join via a \"mating bridge\". Nuclei move from one mycelium into the other, forming a heterokaryon (meaning \"different nuclei\"). This process is called plasmogamy. Actual fusion to form diploid nuclei is called karyogamy, and may not occur until sporangia are formed. Karogamy produces a diploid zygote, which is a short-lived sporophyte that soon undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. When the spores germinate, they develop into new mycelia.\nSlime moulds.\nThe life cycle of slime moulds is very similar to that of fungi. Haploid spores germinate to form swarm cells or myxamoebae. These fuse in a process referred to as \"plasmogamy\" and \"karyogamy\" to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into a plasmodium, and the mature plasmodium produces, depending on the species, one to many fruiting bodies containing haploid spores.\nAnimals.\nAlternation between a multicellular diploid and a multicellular haploid generation is never encountered in animals. In some animals, there is an alternation between parthenogenic and sexually reproductive phases (heterogamy), for instance in salps and doliolids (class Thaliacea). Both phases are diploid. This has sometimes been called \"alternation of generations\", but is quite different. In some other animals, such as hymenopterans, males are haploid and females diploid, but this is always the case rather than there being an alternation between distinct generations.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Masoretic Text defines the Jewish canon and its precise letter-text, with its vocalization and accentuation known as the \"masora\". Referring to the Masoretic Text, \"masora\" specifically means the diacritic markings of the text of the Jewish scriptures and the concise marginal notes in manuscripts (and later printings) of the Tanakh which note textual details, usually about the precise spelling of words. It was primarily copied, edited, and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era (CE). The oldest known complete copy, the Leningrad Codex, dates to 1009 CE and is recognized as the most complete source of biblical books in the Ben Asher tradition. It has served as the base text for critical editions such as Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia and Adi.\nThe differences attested to in the Dead Sea Scrolls indicate that multiple versions of the Hebrew scriptures already existed by the end of the Second Temple period. Which is closest to a theoretical Urtext is disputed, as is whether such a singular text ever existed. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dating to as early as the 3rd century BCE, contain versions of the text which have some differences with today's Hebrew Bible. The Septuagint (a compilation of Koine Greek translations made in the third and second centuries BCE) and the Peshitta (a Syriac translation made in the second century CE) occasionally present notable differences from the Masoretic Text, as does the Samaritan Pentateuch, the text of the Torah preserved by the Samaritans in Samaritan Hebrew. Fragments of an ancient 2nd\u20133rd-century manuscript of the Book of Leviticus found near an ancient synagogue's Torah ark in Ein Gedi have identical wording to the Masoretic Text.\nThe Masoretic Text is the basis for most Protestant translations of the Old Testament such as the King James Version, English Standard Version, New American Standard Bible, and New International Version. After 1943, it has also been used for some Catholic Bibles, such as the New American Bible and the New Jerusalem Bible. Some Christian denominations instead prefer translations of the Septuagint as it matches quotations in the New Testament.\nOrigin and transmission.\nThe oldest manuscript fragments of the final Masoretic Text, including vocalications and the masorah, date from around the 9th century. The oldest-known complete copy, the Leningrad Codex, dates from the early 11th century. The \"Aleppo Codex\", once the oldest-known complete copy but missing large sections since the 1947 Civil war in Palestine, dates from the 10th century. However, codification of the base consonants appears to have begun earlier, perhaps even in the Second Temple period.\nSecond Temple period.\nThe discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran, dating from c. 150 BCE \u2013 75 CE, shows that in this period there was no uniform text. According to Menachem Cohen, the Dead Sea scrolls showed that \"there was indeed a Hebrew text-type on which the Septuagint-translation was based and which differed substantially from the received MT.\" The scrolls show numerous small variations in orthography, both as against the later Masoretic Text, and between each other. It is also evident from the notings of corrections and of variant alternatives that scribes felt free to choose according to their personal taste and discretion between different readings.\nThe text of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Peshitta read somewhat in-between the Masoretic Text and the old Greek. However, despite these variations, most of the Qumran fragments can be classified as being closer to the Masoretic Text than to any other text group that has survived. According to Lawrence Schiffman, 60% can be classed as being of proto-Masoretic type, and a further 20% Qumran style with a basis in proto-Masoretic texts, compared to 5% proto-Samaritan type, 5% Septuagintal type, and 10% non-aligned. Joseph Fitzmyer noted the following regarding the findings at Qumran Cave\u00a04 in particular: \"Such ancient recensional forms of Old Testament books bear witness to an unsuspected textual diversity that once existed; these texts merit far greater study and attention than they have been accorded till now. Thus, the differences in the Septuagint are no longer considered the result of a poor or tendentious attempt to translate the Hebrew into the Greek; rather they testify to a different pre-Christian form of the Hebrew text\". On the other hand, some of the fragments conforming most accurately to the Masoretic Text were found in Cave\u00a04.\nTannaitic sources relate that a standard copy of the Hebrew Bible was kept in the court of the Second Temple for the benefit of copyists and that there were paid correctors of biblical books among the officers of the Temple. The Letter of Aristeas claims that a model codex was sent to Ptolemy by the High Priest Eleazar, who asked that it be returned after the Septuagint was completed. Josephus describes the Romans taking a copy of the Law as spoil, and both he and Philo claim no word of the text was ever changed from the time of Moses.\nIn contrast, an Amoraic narrative relates that three Torah scrolls were found in the Temple court, at variance with each other. The differences between the three were resolved by majority decision. This may describe a previous period, although Solomon Zeitlin argues it is not historical.\nRabbinic period.\nAn emphasis on minute details of words and spellings, already used among the Pharisees as basis for argumentation, reached its height with the example of Rabbi Akiva (died 135\u00a0CE). The idea of a perfect text sanctified in its consonantal base quickly spread throughout the Jewish communities via supportive statements in Halakha, Aggadah, and Jewish thought; and with it increasingly forceful strictures that a deviation in even a single letter would make a Torah scroll invalid. Very few manuscripts are said to have survived the destruction of Jerusalem in 70\u00a0CE. This drastically reduced the number of variants in circulation and also gave a new urgency that the text must be preserved. Few manuscripts survive from this era, but a short Leviticus fragment recovered from the ancient En-Gedi Scroll, carbon-dated to the 3rd or 4th\u00a0century\u00a0CE, is completely identical to the consonantal Masoretic Text preserved today.\nNew Greek translations were also made. Unlike the Septuagint, large-scale deviations in sense between the Greek of Aquila of Sinope and Theodotion and what we now know as the Masoretic Text are minimal. Relatively small variations between different Hebrew texts in use still clearly existed though, as witnessed by differences between the present-day Masoretic Text and versions mentioned in the Gemara, and often even halachic midrashim based on spelling versions which do not exist in the current Masoretic Text.\nThe Age of the Masoretes.\nThe current received text finally achieved predominance through the reputation of the Masoretes, schools of scribes and Torah scholars working between the 7th and 11th centuries in the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates, based primarily in the cities of Tiberias and Jerusalem in Palestine and in Lower Mesopotamia (called \"Babylonia\"). According to Menachem Cohen, these schools developed such prestige for the accuracy and error control of their copying techniques that their texts established an authority beyond that of all others. Differences remained, sometimes bolstered by systematic local differences in pronunciation and cantillation. Every locality, following the tradition of its school, had a standard codex embodying its readings. In the talmudic academies in Babylonia, the school of Sura differed from that of Nehardea. Similar differences existed in those of Syria Palaestina, such as the one at Tiberias, which in later times increasingly became the chief seat of learning. During this period, the living tradition ceased, and the Masoretes, in preparing their codices, usually followed one school or the other, while examining the standard codices of other schools and noting their differences.\nBen Asher and Ben Naphtali.\nThe Masorah for the most part ended in the 10th century with Aaron ben Moses ben Asher and Ben Naphtali, who were the leading Masoretes of the time. Ben Asher wrote a standard codex (the Aleppo Codex) embodying his opinions. Ben Naphtali likely did as well, though it has not survived. However, the differences between the two are found in more or less complete Masoretic lists and in quotations in David \u1e32im\u1e25i, Norzi, and other medieval writers.\nThe differences between Ben Naphtali and Ben Asher number approximately 875, nine-tenths of which pertain to the placement of accents, while the rest concern vowels and consonantal spelling. The differences between the two Masoretes do not represent solely personal opinions; the two rivals represent different schools. Like the Ben Ashers there seem to have been several Ben Naftalis. The Masoretic lists often do not agree on the precise nature of the differences between the two rival authorities; it is, therefore, impossible to define with exactness their differences in every case; and it is probably due to this fact that the received text does not follow uniformly the system of either Ben Asher or Ben Naphtali.\nBen Asher was the last of a distinguished family of Masoretes extending back to the latter half of the 8th century. Despite the rivalry of ben Naphtali and the opposition of Saadia Gaon, the most eminent representative of the Babylonian school of criticism, ben Asher's codex became recognized as the standard text of the Hebrew Bible. Notwithstanding all this, for reasons unknown neither the printed text nor any manuscript which has been preserved is based entirely on Ben Asher: they are all eclectic. Aside from Ben Asher and Ben Naphtali, the names of several other Masorites have come down; but, perhaps except for one\u2014Pinehas, the head of the academy, who is supposed by modern scholars to have lived about 750\u2014neither their time, their place, nor their connection with the various schools is known.\nMost scholars conclude Aaron ben Asher was a Karaite rather than a Rabbanite. There is evidence to support the contrary view.\nThe Middle Ages.\nThe two rival authorities, ben\u00a0Asher and ben\u00a0Naphtali, practically brought the Masorah to a close. Very few additions were made by the later Masoretes, styled in the 13th and 14th\u00a0centuries \"Naqdanim\", who revised the works of the copyists, added the vowels and accents (generally in fainter ink and with a finer pen) and frequently the Masorah.\nDuring the 11th, 12th, and 13th\u00a0centuries the Franco-German school of Tosafists influenced in the development and spread of Masoretic literature. Gershom ben Judah, his brother Machir ben Judah, Joseph ben Samuel Bonfils (Tob 'Elem) of Limoges, Rabbeinu Tam (Jacob ben Me\u00efr), Menahem ben Perez of Joigny, Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil, Judah ben Isaac Messer Leon, Me\u00efr Spira, and Meir of Rothenburg made Masoretic compilations, or additions to the subject, which are all more or less frequently referred to in the marginal glosses of biblical codices and in the works of Hebrew grammarians.\nMasorah.\nTraditionally, a ritual Sefer Torah (Torah scroll) could contain only the Hebrew consonantal text \u2013 nothing added, nothing taken away. The Masoretic codices, however, provide extensive additional material, called \"masorah\", to show correct pronunciation and cantillation, protect against scribal errors, and annotate possible variants. The manuscripts thus include vowel points, pronunciation marks and stress accents in the text, short annotations in the side margins, and longer more extensive notes in the upper and lower margins and collected at the end of each book.\nThese notes were added because the Masoretes recognized the possibility of human error in copying the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes were not working with the original Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible and corruptions had already crept into the versions they copied.\nEtymology.\nFrom the Hebrew word \"masorah\" \"tradition\"\".\" Originally \"masoret\", a word found in Book of Ezekiel 20:37 (there from \u05d0\u05e1\u05e8 \"to bind\" for \"fetters\").\nAccording to the majority of scholars, including Wilhelm Bacher, the form of the Ezekiel word \"masoret\" \"fetters\" was applied by the Masoretes to the \u05de\u05e1\u05e8 root meaning \"to transmit\", for \"masoret\" \"tradition.\" (See also .)\nLater, the text was also called \"moseirah\", by a direct conjugation of \u05de\u05e1\u05e8 \"to transmit,\" and the synthesis of the two forms produced the modern word \"masorah.\"\nAccording to a minority of scholars, including Caspar Levias, the intent of the Masoretes was \"masoret\" \"fetter [upon the exposition of the text]\", and the word was only later connected to \u05de\u05e1\u05e8 and translated as \"tradition\".\nOther specific explanations are provided:\nSamuel David Luzzatto argued that \"masoret\" was a synonym for \"siman\" by extended meaning (\"transmission[ of the sign]\" became \"transmitted sign\") and referred to the symbols used in vocalizing and punctuating the text. \nZe'ev Ben-Haim argued that \"masoret\" meant \"counting\" and was later conjugated as \"moseirah\" \"thing which is counted\", referring to the Masoretic counts of the letters, words, and verses in the Bible, discussed in Qiddushin 30a.\nLanguage and form.\nThe language of the Masoretic notes is primarily Aramaic but partly Hebrew. The Masoretic annotations are found in various forms: (a) in separate works, e.g., the \"Oklah we-Oklah\"; (b) in the form of notes written in the margins and at the end of codices. In rare cases, the notes are written between the lines. The first word of each biblical book is also as a rule surrounded by notes. The latter are called the Initial Masorah; the notes on the side margins or between the columns are called the Small (\"Masora parva\" or Mp) or Inner Masorah (Masora marginalis); and those on the lower and upper margins, the Large or Outer Masorah (\"Masora magna\" or Mm[Mas.M]). The name \"Large Masorah\" is applied sometimes to the lexically arranged notes at the end of the printed Bible, usually called the Final Masorah, (\"Masora finalis\"), or the Masoretic Concordance.\nThe Small Masorah consists of brief notes with reference to marginal readings, to statistics showing the number of times a particular form is found in Scripture, to full and defective spelling, and to abnormally written letters. The Large Masorah is more copious in its notes. The Final Masorah comprises all the longer rubrics for which space could not be found in the margin of the text, and is arranged alphabetically in the form of a concordance. The quantity of notes the marginal Masorah contains is conditioned by the amount of vacant space on each page. In the manuscripts it varies also with the rate at which the copyist was paid and the fanciful shape he gave to his gloss.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There was accordingly an independent Babylonian Masora which differed from the Palestinian in terminology and to some extent in order. The Masora is concise in style with a profusion of abbreviations, requiring a considerable amount of knowledge for their full understanding. It was quite natural that a later generation of scribes would no longer understand the notes of the Masoretes and consider them unimportant; by the late medieval period they were reduced to mere ornamentation of the manuscripts. It was Jacob ben\u00a0Chayyim who restored clarity and order to them.\nIn most manuscripts, there are some discrepancies between the text and the masorah, suggesting that they were copied from different sources or that one of them has copying errors. The lack of such discrepancies in the \"Aleppo Codex\" is one of the reasons for its importance; the scribe who copied the notes, presumably Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, probably wrote them originally.\nNumerical Masorah.\nIn classical antiquity, copyists were paid for their work according to the number of s (lines of verse). As the prose books of the Bible were hardly ever written in stichs, the copyists, in order to estimate the amount of work, had to count the letters. According to some this was (also) to ensure accuracy in the transmission of the text with the production of subsequent copies that were done by hand.\nHence the Masoretes contributed the Numerical Masorah. These notes are traditionally categorized into two main groups, the marginal Masorah and the final Masorah. The category of marginal Masorah is further divided into the \"Masorah parva\" (small Masorah) in the outer side margins and the \"Masorah magna\" (large Masorah), traditionally located at the top and bottom margins of the text. The \"Masorah parva\" is a set of statistics in the outer side margins of the text. Beyond simply counting the letters, the \"Masorah parva\" consists of word-use statistics, similar documentation for expressions or certain phraseology, observations on full or defective writing, references to the Kethiv-Qere readings and more. These observations are also the result of a passionate zeal to safeguard the accurate transmission of the sacred text.\nEven though often cited as very exact, the Masoretic \"frequency notes\" in the margin of \"Codex Leningradiensis\" contain several errors.\nThe \"Masorah magna\", in measure, is an expanded \"Masorah parva\". \"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\" (BHS) includes an apparatus referring the reader to the large Masorah, which is printed separately.\nThe final Masorah is located at the end of biblical books or after certain sections of the text, such as at the end of the Torah. It contains information and statistics regarding the number of words in a book or section, etc. Thus, Book of Leviticus 8:23 is the middle verse in the Pentateuch. The collation of manuscripts and the noting of their differences furnished material for the Text-Critical Masorah. The close relation which existed in earlier times (from the Soferim to the Amoraim inclusive) between the teacher of tradition and the Masorete, both frequently being united in one person, accounts for the Exegetical Masorah. Finally, the invention and introduction of a graphic system of vocalization and accentuation gave rise to the Grammatical Masorah.\nThe most important of the Masoretic notes are those that detail the Qere and Ketiv that are located in the \"Masorah parva\" in the outside margins of BHS. Given that the Masoretes would not alter the sacred consonantal text, the Kethiv-Qere notes were a way of \"correcting\" or commenting on the text for any number of reasons (grammatical, theological, aesthetic, etc.) deemed important by the copyist.\nFixing of the text.\nThe earliest tasks of the Masoretes included a standard division of the text into books, sections, paragraphs, verses, and clauses; fixing of the orthography, pronunciation, and cantillation; introduction or final adoption of the square characters with the five final letters; some textual changes to guard against blasphemy (though these changes may pre-date the Masoretes \u2013 see \"Tikkune Soferim\" below); enumeration of letters, words, verses, etc., and the substitution of some words for others in public reading.\nSince no additions were allowed to be made to the official text of the Bible, the early Masoretes adopted other methods: e.g., they marked the various divisions by spacing, and gave indications of halakic and haggadic teachings by full or defective spelling, abnormal forms of letters, dots, and other signs. Marginal notes were permitted only in private copies, and the first mention of such notes is found in the case of R. Me\u00efr (c.\u00a0100\u2013150\u00a0CE).\nScribal emendations \u2013 \"Tikkune Soferim\".\nEarly rabbinic sources, from around 200\u00a0CE, mention several passages of Scripture in which the conclusion is inevitable that the ancient reading must have differed from that of the present text. The explanation of this phenomenon is given in the expression \"Scripture has used euphemistic language\" (), i.e. to avoid anthropomorphism and anthropopathism.\nRabbi Simon ben Pazzi (3rd\u00a0century) calls these readings \"emendations of the Scribes\" (\"tikkune Soferim\"; Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlix. 7), assuming that the Scribes actually made the changes. This view was adopted by the later Midrash and by the majority of Masoretes. In Masoretic works these changes are ascribed to Ezra; to Ezra and Nehemiah; to Ezra and the Soferim; or to Ezra, Nehemiah, Zechariah, Haggai, and Baruch. All these ascriptions mean one and the same thing: that the changes were assumed to have been made by the Men of the Great Assembly.\nThe term \"tikkun Soferim\" () has been understood by different scholars in various ways. Some regard it as a correction of biblical language authorized by the Soferim for homiletical purposes. Others take it to mean a mental change made by the original writers or redactors of Scripture; i.e. the latter shrank from putting in writing a thought which some of the readers might expect them to express.\nThe assumed emendations are of four general types:\nMikra and ittur.\nAmong the earliest technical terms used in connection with activities of the Scribes are the \"mikra Soferim\" and \"ittur Soferim\". In the geonic schools, the first term was taken to signify certain vowel-changes which were made in words in pause or after the article; the second, the cancellation in a few passages of the \"vav\" conjunctive, where it had been wrongly read by some. The objection to such an explanation is that the first changes would fall under the general head of fixation of pronunciation, and the second under the head of \"Qere\" and \"Ketiv\" (i.e. \"What is read\" and \"What is written\"). Various explanations have, therefore, been offered by ancient as well as modern scholars without, however, succeeding in furnishing a completely satisfactory solution.\nSuspended letters and dotted words.\nThere are four words having one of their letters suspended above the line. One of them, , is due to an alteration of the original \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 out of reverence for Moses; rather than say that Moses's grandson became an idolatrous priest, a suspended letter nun\u00a0(\u00a0\u05e0\u00a0) was inserted to turn Mosheh into Menasheh (Manasseh). The origin of the other three is doubtful. According to some, they are due to mistaken majuscular letters; according to others, they are later insertions of originally omitted weak consonants.\nIn fifteen passages within the Bible, some words are stigmatized; i.e., dots appear above the letters. The significance of the dots is disputed. Some hold them to be marks of erasure; others believe them to indicate that in some collated manuscripts the stigmatized words were missing, hence that the reading is doubtful; still others contend that they are merely a mnemonic device to indicate homiletic explanations which the ancients had connected with those words; finally, some maintain that the dots were designed to guard against the omission by copyists of text-elements which, at first glance or after comparison with parallel passages, seemed to be superfluous. Instead of dots some manuscripts exhibit strokes, vertical or else horizontal. The first two explanations are unacceptable for the reason that such faulty readings would belong to Qere and Ketiv, which, in case of doubt, the majority of manuscripts would decide. The last two theories have equal probability.\nInverted letters.\nIn nine passages of the Masoretic Text are found signs usually called inverted nuns, because they resemble the Hebrew letter nun\u00a0(\u00a0\u05e0\u00a0) written in some inverted fashion. The exact shape varies between different manuscripts and printed editions. In many manuscripts, a reversed nun is found referred to as a \"nun hafucha\" by the masoretes. In some earlier printed editions, they are shown as the standard nun upside down or rotated, because the printer did not want to bother to design a character to be used only nine times. The recent scholarly editions of the Masoretic Text show the reversed nun as described by the masoretes. In some manuscripts, however, other symbols are occasionally found instead. These are sometimes referred to in rabbinical literature as \"simaniyot\" (markers).\nThe primary set of inverted nuns is found surrounding the text of Numbers 10:35\u201336. The Mishna notes that this text is 85\u00a0letters long and dotted. This demarcation of this text leads to the later use of the inverted nun markings. Saul Lieberman demonstrated that similar markings can be found in ancient Greek texts where they are also used to denote 'short texts'. During the Medieval period, the inverted nuns were actually inserted into the text of the early Rabbinic Bibles published by Bomberg in the early 16th\u00a0century. The talmud records that the markings surrounding Numbers 10:35-36 were thought to denote that this 85\u00a0letter text was not in its proper place.\nBar Kappara considered the Torah known to us as composed of seven volumes in the Gemara \"The seven pillars with which Wisdom built her house (Prov. 9:1) are the seven Books of Moses\". Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus and Deuteronomy as we know them but Numbers was really three separate volumes: Numbers 1:1\u201310:35 followed by Numbers 10:35\u201336 and the third text from there to the end of Numbers.\nThe 85\u00a0letter text is also said to be denoted because it is the model for the fewest letters which constitute a 'text' which one would be required to save from fire due to its holiness.\nHistory of the Masorah.\nThe history of the Masorah may be divided into three periods: (1)\u00a0creative period, from its beginning to the introduction of vowel-signs; (2)\u00a0reproductive period, from the introduction of vowel-signs to the printing of the Masorah (1525); (3)\u00a0critical period, from 1525 to the present time.\nThe materials for the history of the first period are scattered remarks in Talmudic and Midrashic literature, in the post-Talmudical treatises \"Masseket Sefer Torah\" and \"Masseket Soferim\", and in a Masoretic chain of tradition found in ben\u00a0Asher's \"Di\u1e33du\u1e33e ha-\u1e6ce'amim,\" \u00a7\u00a069 and elsewhere.\nCritical study.\nJacob ben Hayyim ibn Adonijah, having collated a vast number of manuscripts, systematized his material and arranged the Masorah in the second Bomberg edition of the Bible (Venice, 1524\u20131525). Besides introducing the Masorah into the margin, he compiled at the close of his Bible a concordance of the Masoretic glosses for which he could not find room in a marginal form, and added an elaborate introduction \u2013 the first treatise on the Masorah ever produced. Due to its wide distribution, and in spite of its many errors, this work is frequently considered as the \"textus receptus\" of the Masorah. It was also used for the English translation of the Old Testament for the King James Version (though not always followed).\nNext to Ibn Adoniyah, the critical study of the Masorah has been most advanced by Elia Levita, who published his famous \"Massoret ha-Massoret\" in 1538. The \"Tiberias\" of the elder Johannes Buxtorf (1620) made Levita's researches more accessible to a Christian audience. The eighth introduction to Walton's Polyglot Bible is largely a reworking of the \"Tiberias\". Levita compiled likewise a vast Masoretic concordance, \"Sefer ha-Zikronot\", which still lies in the National Library at Paris unpublished. The study is indebted also to R. Me\u00efr b. Todros ha-Levi (RaMaH), who, as early as the 13th century, wrote his \"Sefer Massoret Seyag la-Torah\" (correct ed. Florence, 1750); to Menahem Lonzano, who composed a treatise on the Masorah of the Pentateuch entitled \"Or Torah\"; and in particular to Jedidiah Norzi, whose \"Min\u1e25at Shai\" contains valuable Masoretic notes based on a careful study of manuscripts.\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls have shed new light on the history of the Masoretic Text. Many texts found there, especially those from Masada, are quite similar to the Masoretic Text, suggesting that an ancestor of the Masoretic Text was indeed extant as early as the 2nd\u00a0century\u00a0BCE. However, other texts, including many of those from Qumran, differ substantially, indicating that the Masoretic Text was but one of a diverse set of biblical writings.\nIn a recent finding, a scroll fragment was found to be identical to the Masoretic Text. The approximately 1,700-year-old En-Gedi Scroll was found in 1970 but had not had its contents reconstructed until 2016. Researchers were able to recover 35 complete and partial lines of text from the Book of Leviticus and the text they deciphered is completely identical with the consonantal framework of the Masoretic Text. The En-Gedi scroll is the first biblical scroll to have been discovered in the holy ark of an ancient synagogue, where it would have been stored for prayers, and not in desert caves like the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nSome important editions.\nThere have been very many published editions of the Masoretic Text, some of the most important being:\nThe second Rabbinic Bible served as the base for all future editions. This was the source text used by the translators of the King James Version in 1611, the New King James Version in 1982, and the New Cambridge Paragraph Bible in 2005.\nThis was practically a reprint of the Athias-Leusden edition of 1667; but at the end it has variants taken from a number of printed editions. It has been much prized because of its excellent and clear type; but no manuscripts were used in its preparation. Nearly all 18th and 19th\u00a0century Hebrew Bibles were almost exact reprints of this edition.\nAs well as the van der Hooght text, this included the Samaritan Pentateuch and a huge collection of variants from manuscripts and early printed editions; while this collection has many errors, it is still of some value. The collection of variants was corrected and extended by Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi (1784\u20131788), but his publications gave only the variants without a complete text.\nThis edition (called \"Me'or Enayim\") included the Five Books of Moses, Haftarot, and Megillot. It had many differences from earlier editions in vowels, notes and lay-out, based on a comparison with old manuscripts and a correction of misprints based on analysis of grammatical principles. There were extensive textual notes justifying all these alterations. Heidenheim also divided each weekly Sabbath reading into seven sections (seven people should be called up each Sabbath), as there had been considerable variation in practice about where to make the divisions, and his divisions are now accepted by nearly all Ashkenazi communities. Samson Raphael Hirsch used this text (omitting the textual notes) in his own commentary, and it became the standard text in Germany. It was frequently reprinted there, again without the textual notes, up to World War II, and the edition of Jack Mazin (London, 1950) is an exact copy.\nThe 1852 edition was yet another copy of van der Hooght. The 1866 edition, however, was carefully checked against old manuscripts and early printed editions, and has a very legible typeface. It is probably the most widely reproduced text of the Hebrew Bible in history, with many dozens of authorised reprints and many more pirated and unacknowledged ones.\nIncomplete publication: Exodus to Deuteronomy never appeared.\nThe first edition was very close to the second Bomberg edition, but with variants added from a number of manuscripts and all of the earliest printed editions, collated with far more care than the work of Kennicott; he did all the work himself. The second edition diverged slightly more from Bomberg, and collated more manuscripts; he did most of the work himself, but failing health forced him to rely partly on his wife and other assistants.\nVirtually identical to the second Bomberg edition, but with variants from Hebrew sources and early translations in the footnotes\nThird edition based on the Leningrad Codex, 1937; later reprints listed some variant readings from the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nBased on Ginsburg 2nd edition, but revised based on the Aleppo Codex, Leningrad Codex, and other early manuscripts.\nSnaith based it on Sephardi manuscripts such as British Museum Or. 2626-2628, and said that he had not relied on \"Letteris\". However, it has been shown that he must have prepared his copy by amending a copy of \"Letteris\", because while there are many differences, it has many of the same typographical errors as \"Letteris\". Snaith's printer even went so far as to break printed vowels to match some accidentally broken characters in \"Letteris\". Snaith combined the accent system of \"Letteris\" with the system found in Sephardi manuscripts, thereby creating accentuation patterns found nowhere else in any manuscript or printed edition.\nStarted by Moshe Goshen-Gottstein, this follows the text of the Aleppo Codex where extant and otherwise the Leningrad Codex. It includes a wide variety of variants from the Dead Sea Scrolls, Septuagint, early Rabbinic literature and selected early medieval manuscripts. So far, only Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel have been published.\nThe text was derived by comparing a number of printed Bibles, and following the majority when there were discrepancies. It was criticised by Moshe Goshen-Gottstein: \"the publisher of the Koren Bible \u2013 who laid no claim to expertise in masoretic issues ... sought the help of three scholars, all of whom suffered from the same lack of Masoretic expertise ... Basically, the Koren edition is hardly an edition like that of Dotan, but another rehash of the material prepared by ben\u00a0Hayim.\"\nRevision of \"Biblia Hebraica\" (third edition), 1977. The second edition of \"Stuttgartensia\" (published 1983) was the source text for the Old Testament portion of the English Standard Version, published in 2001.\nBased on the Aleppo Codex, 1977\u20131982\nThis is a revised version of Breuer, and is the official version used in inaugurating the President of Israel.\nRevision of \"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\"; fascicles published as of 2024 are: Genesis, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Judges, the Twelve Minor Prophets, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Ezra and Nehemiah.\nExplanatory footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the brother of Anastas Mikoyan, who would later become a high level Soviet statesman. He completed his basic education and took a job as a machine-tool operator in Rostov, then worked in the \"Dynamo\" factory in Moscow before being conscripted into the military. After military service he joined the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy, where he created his first plane, graduating in 1936. He worked with Polikarpov before being named head of a new aircraft design bureau in Moscow in December 1939. Together with Mikhail Gurevich, Mikoyan formed the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau, producing a series of fighter aircraft. In March 1942, the bureau was renamed OKB MiG (\"Osoboye Konstruktorskoye Byuro\"), ANPK MiG (\"Aviatsionnyy nauchno-proizvodstvennyy kompleks\") and OKO MiG. The MiG-1 proved to be a poor start, the MiG-3 went into production but only occasionally could it fight in its intended high-level interceptor role. The further MiG-5, MiG-7 and MiG-8 \"Utka\" did not progress beyond research prototypes.\nJet aircraft designs.\nEarly post-war designs were based on domestic works as well as captured German jet fighters and information provided by Britain or the US. By 1946, Soviet designers were still having trouble in perfecting the German-designed, axial-flow BMW 109-003 jet engine \u2014 blueprints for the 109-003 turbojet had been seized by Soviet forces from the Basdorf-Z\u00fchlsdorf plant near Berlin and from the Central Works near Nordhausen. Production of the 003 was set up at the \"Red October\" GAZ 466 (\"Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod\", or Gorky Automobile Plant) in Leningrad, where the 003 jet engine was mass-produced from 1947 under the designation RD-20 (\"reaktivnyy dvigatel\", or \"jet engine\"). New Soviet airframe designs from their design bureaus, and near-sonic wing designs were threatening to outstrip development of the jet engines needed to power them. Soviet aviation minister Mikhail Khrunichev and aircraft designer Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev suggested to Joseph Stalin that the USSR buy advanced jet engines from the British. Stalin is said to have replied: \"What fool will sell us his secrets?\" However, he gave his assent to the proposal, and Artem Mikoyan, engine designer Klimov, and other officials traveled to the United Kingdom to request the engines. To Stalin's amazement, the British Labour government and its pro-Soviet minister of trade, Sir Stafford Cripps were willing to provide technical information and a licence to manufacture the Rolls-Royce Nene centrifugal-flow jet engine. This engine was reverse-engineered and produced in modified form as the Soviet Klimov VK-1 jet engine, later incorporated into the MiG-15 (Rolls-Royce later attempted to claim \u00a3207 million in licence fees, without success).\nIn the interim, on 15 April 1947, the Council of Ministers issued a decree #493-192, ordering the Mikoyan OKB to build two prototypes for a new jet fighter. As the decree called for first flights as soon as December of that same year, the designers at OKB-155 fell back on an earlier troublesome design, the MiG-9 of 1946. The MiG-9 used a pair of the RD-20 Soviet copies of the BMW 003 for its power, which proved to be unreliable, with the airframe's straight-winged design suffering from control problems.\nThe prototype-only Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270 of the immediate post-war era was a rocket-powered, \"straight-winged\" point-defense fighter design based on captured examples of, and documentation for the never-produced German Messerschmitt Me 263, which had some influence on future MiG jet fighter designs. Thanks to the MiG OKB designing the very first airworthy swept-wing Soviet aircraft design of any type in 1945, the strictly experimental Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-8 \"Utka\" canard pusher monoplane, the swept-wing research from it and captured German research documents allowed the Soviets to eventually develop the prototype design for the single-jet MiG-15 fighter, the I-310. With the Klimov VK-1 version of the British Nene jet engine, this design became the mass-produced MiG-15, which first flew on 31 December 1948, some fifteen months after the first prototype of its American swept-winged counterpart, the XP-86 Sabre first flew. Despite its mixed origins, this aircraft had excellent performance and formed the basis for a number of future fighters. The MiG-15 was originally intended to intercept American bombers such as the B-29 Superfortress, and was even evaluated in mock air-to-air combat trials with interned ex-U.S. B-29 bombers as well as the later Soviet B-29 copy, the Tupolev Tu-4. A variety of MiG-15 variants were built, but the most common was the MiG-15UTI (NATO 'Midget') two-seat trainer. Over 18,000 MiG-15s were eventually manufactured, then came the MiG-17, and MiG-19.\nThe MiG-15s were the jets used during the Korean War by Communist forces, and \"MiG Alley\" was the name given by U.S. Air Force pilots to the northwestern portion of North Korea, where the Yalu River empties into the Yellow Sea. During the Korean War, it was the site of numerous dogfights between U.S. fighter jets and those of the Communist forces, particularly the Soviet Union. The F-86 Sabre and the Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighters were the aircraft used throughout most of the conflict, with the area's nickname derived from the latter. Because it was the site of the first large-scale jet-vs-jet air battles, MiG Alley is considered the birthplace of jet fighter combat.\nLater work.\nFrom 1952, Mikoyan also designed missile systems to particularly suit his aircraft, such as the famous MiG-21. He continued to produce high performance fighters through the 1950s and 1960s.\nHe was twice awarded the highest civilian honour, the Hero of Socialist Labor and was a deputy in six Supreme Soviets.\nAfter Gurevich's death, the name of the design bureau was changed from \"Mikoyan-Gurevich\" to simply \"Mikoyan\". However, the designator remained \"MiG\". Many more designs came from the design bureau such as the MiG-23, MiG-29 and MiG-35 and variations.\nAfter suffering from a stroke that occurred in 1969, Mikoyan died the following year and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\nHonours and awards.\nSome of his awards and honours include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prior to the Roman period, most of these regions were officially unified only once under the Kingdom of Macedon from 338 to 323\u00a0BC. In Western history, the era of classical antiquity was immediately followed by the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine period.\nThree centuries after the decline of Mycenaean Greece during the Bronze Age collapse, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century\u00a0BC, ushering in the Archaic period and the colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the age of Classical Greece, from the Greco-Persian Wars to the death of Alexander the Great in 323\u00a0BC, and which included the Golden Age of Athens and the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. The unification of Greece by Macedon under Philip II and subsequent conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great spread Hellenistic civilization across the Middle East. The Hellenistic period is considered to have ended in 30\u00a0BC, when the last Hellenistic kingdom, Ptolemaic Egypt, was annexed by the Roman Republic.\nClassical Greek culture, especially philosophy, had a powerful influence on ancient Rome, which carried a version of it throughout the Mediterranean and much of Europe. For this reason, Classical Greece is generally considered the cradle of Western civilization, the seminal culture from which the modern West derives many of its founding archetypes and ideas in politics, philosophy, science, and art.\nChronology.\nClassical antiquity in the Mediterranean region is commonly considered to have begun in the 8th century\u00a0BC (around the time of the earliest recorded poetry of Homer) and ended in the 6th century\u00a0AD.\nClassical antiquity in Greece was preceded by the Greek Dark Ages (c.\u20091200\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009800 BC), archaeologically characterised by the protogeometric and geometric styles of designs on pottery. Following the Dark Ages was the Archaic period, beginning around the 8th century\u00a0BC, which saw early developments in Greek culture and society leading to the Classical period from the Persian invasion of Greece in 480\u00a0BC until the death of Alexander the Great in 323\u00a0BC. The Classical period is characterized by a \"classical\" style, i.e. one which was considered exemplary by later observers, most famously in the Parthenon of Athens. Politically, the Classical period was dominated by Athens and the Delian League during the 5th century, but displaced by Spartan hegemony during the early 4th century\u00a0BC, before power shifted to Thebes and the Boeotian League and finally to the League of Corinth led by Macedon. This period was shaped by the Greco-Persian Wars, the Peloponnesian War, and the Rise of Macedon.\nFollowing the Classical period was the Hellenistic period (323\u2013146\u00a0BC), during which Greek culture and power expanded into the Near East from the death of Alexander until the Roman conquest. Roman Greece is usually counted from the Roman victory over the Corinthians at the Battle of Corinth in 146\u00a0BC to the establishment of Byzantium by Constantine as the capital of the Roman Empire in 330\u00a0AD. Finally, Late Antiquity refers to the period of Christianization during the later 4th to early 6th centuries\u00a0AD, consummated by the closure of the Academy of Athens by Justinian I in 529.\nHistoriography.\nThe historical period of ancient Greece is unique in world history as the first period attested directly in comprehensive, narrative historiography, while earlier ancient history or protohistory is known from much more fragmentary documents such as annals, king lists, and pragmatic epigraphy.\nHerodotus is widely known as the \"father of history\": his \"Histories\" are eponymous of the entire field. Written between the 450s and 420s\u00a0BC, Herodotus' work reaches about a century into the past, discussing 6th-century\u00a0BC historical figures such as Darius I of Persia, Cambyses II and Psamtik III, and alluding to some 8th-century\u00a0BC persons such as Candaules. The accuracy of Herodotus' works is debated.\nHerodotus was succeeded by authors such as Thucydides, Xenophon, Demosthenes, Plato and Aristotle. Most were either Athenian or pro-Athenian, which is why far more is known about the history and politics of Athens than of many other cities.\nTheir scope is further limited by a focus on political, military and diplomatic history, ignoring economic and social history.\nHistory.\nArchaic period.\nThe archaic period, lasting approximately from 800 to 500\u00a0BC, saw the culmination of political and social developments which had begun in the Greek Dark Age, with the \"polis\" (city-state) becoming the most important unit of political organisation in Greece. The absence of powerful states in Greece after the collapse of Mycenaean power, and the geography of Greece, where many settlements were separated from their neighbours by mountainous terrain, encouraged the development of small independent city-states. Several Greek states saw tyrants rise to power in this period, most famously at Corinth from 657\u00a0BC. The period also saw the founding of Greek colonies around the Mediterranean, with Euboean settlements at Al-Mina in the east as early as 800\u00a0BC, and Ischia in the west by 775. Increasing contact with non-Greek peoples in this period, especially in the Near East, inspired developments in art and architecture, the adoption of coinage, and the development of the Greek alphabet.\nAthens developed its democratic system over the course of the archaic period. Already in the 7th century, the right of all citizen men to attend the assembly appears to have been established. After a failed coup led by Cylon of Athens around 636\u00a0BC, Draco was appointed to establish a code of laws in 621. This failed to reduce the political tension between the poor and the elites, and in 594 Solon was given the authority to enact another set of reforms, which attempted to balance the power of the rich and the poor. In the middle of the 6th century, Pisistratus established himself as a tyrant, and after his death in 527 his son Hippias inherited his position; by the end of the 6th century he had been overthrown, and Cleisthenes carried out further democratising reforms.\nIn Sparta, a political system with two kings, a council of elders, and five ephors developed over the course of the 8th and 7th centuries. According to Spartan tradition, this constitution was established by the legendary lawgiver Lycurgus. Over the course of the First Messenian War and Second Messenian War, Sparta subjugated the neighbouring region of Messenia, enserfing the population.\nIn the 6th century, Greek city-states began to develop formal relationships with one another, where previously individual rulers had relied on personal relationships with the elites of other cities. Towards the end of the Archaic period, Sparta began to build a series of alliances, the Peloponnesian League, with cities including Corinth, Elis, and Megara, isolating Messenia and reinforcing Sparta's position against Argos, the other major power in the Peloponnese. Other alliances in the 6th century included those between Elis and Heraea in the Peloponnese; and between the Greek colony Sybaris in southern Italy, its allies, and the Serdaioi.\nClassical Greece.\nIn 499\u00a0BC, the Ionian city states under Persian rule rebelled against their Persian-supported tyrant rulers. Supported by troops sent from Athens and Eretria, they advanced as far as Sardis and burnt the city before being driven back by a Persian counterattack. The revolt continued until 494, when the rebelling Ionians were defeated. Darius did not forget that Athens had assisted the Ionian revolt, and in 490 he assembled an armada to retaliate. Though heavily outnumbered, the Athenians\u2014supported by their Plataean allies\u2014defeated the Persian hordes at the Battle of Marathon, and the Persian fleet turned tail.\nTen years later, a second invasion was launched by Darius' son Xerxes. The city-states of northern and central Greece submitted to the Persian forces without resistance, but a coalition of 31 Greek city states, including Athens and Sparta, determined to resist the Persian invaders. At the same time, Greek Sicily was invaded by a Carthaginian force. In 480\u00a0BC, the first major battle of the invasion was fought at Thermopylae, where a small rearguard of Greeks, led by three hundred Spartans, held a crucial pass guarding the heart of Greece for several days; at the same time Gelon, tyrant of Syracuse, defeated the Carthaginian invasion at the Battle of Himera.\nThe Persians were decisively defeated at sea by a primarily Athenian naval force at the Battle of Salamis, and on land in 479\u00a0BC at the Battle of Plataea. The alliance against Persia continued, initially led by the Spartan Pausanias but from 477 by Athens, and by 460 Persia had been driven out of the Aegean. During this long campaign, the Delian League gradually transformed from a defensive alliance of Greek states into an Athenian empire, as Athens' growing naval power intimidated the other league states. Athens ended its campaigns against Persia in 450, after a disastrous defeat in Egypt in 454, and the death of Cimon in action against the Persians on Cyprus in 450.\nAs the Athenian fight against the Persian empire waned, conflict grew between Athens and Sparta. Suspicious of the increasing Athenian power funded by the Delian League, Sparta offered aid to reluctant members of the League to rebel against Athenian domination. These tensions were exacerbated in 462\u00a0BC when Athens sent a force to aid Sparta in overcoming a helot revolt, but this aid was rejected by the Spartans. In the 450s, Athens took control of Boeotia, and won victories over Aegina and Corinth. However, Athens failed to win a decisive victory, and in 447 lost Boeotia again. Athens and Sparta signed the Thirty Years' Peace in the winter of 446/445, ending the conflict.\nDespite the treaty, Athenian relations with Sparta declined again in the 430s, and in 431 BC the Peloponnesian War began. The first phase of the war saw a series of fruitless annual invasions of Attica by Sparta, while Athens successfully fought the Corinthian empire in northwest Greece and defended its own empire, despite a plague which killed the leading Athenian statesman Pericles. The war turned after Athenian victories led by Cleon at Pylos and Sphakteria, and Sparta sued for peace, but the Athenians rejected the proposal. The Athenian failure to regain control of Boeotia at Delium and Brasidas' successes in northern Greece in 424 improved Sparta's position after Sphakteria. After the deaths of Cleon and Brasidas, the strongest proponents of war on each side, a peace treaty was negotiated in 421 by the Athenian general Nicias.\nThe peace did not last, however. In 418\u00a0BC allied forces of Athens and Argos were defeated by Sparta at Mantinea. In 415 Athens launched an ambitious naval expedition to dominate Sicily; the expedition ended in disaster at the harbor of Syracuse, with almost the entire army killed, and the ships destroyed. Soon after the Athenian defeat in Syracuse, Athens' Ionian allies began to rebel against the Delian league, while Persia began to once again involve itself in Greek affairs on the Spartan side. Initially the Athenian position continued relatively strong, with important victories at Cyzicus in 410 and Arginusae in 406. However, in 405 the Spartan Lysander defeated Athens in the Battle of Aegospotami, and began to blockade Athens' harbour; driven by hunger, Athens sued for peace, agreeing to surrender their fleet and join the Spartan-led Peloponnesian League. Following the Athenian surrender, Sparta installed an oligarchic regime, the Thirty Tyrants, in Athens, one of a number of Spartan-backed oligarchies which rose to power after the Peloponnesian war. Spartan predominance did not last: after only a year, the Thirty had been overthrown.\nThe first half of the 4th century saw the major Greek states attempt to dominate the mainland; none were successful, and their resulting weakness led to a power vacuum which was eventually filled by Macedon under Philip II and then Alexander the Great. In the immediate aftermath of the Peloponnesian war, Sparta attempted to extend their own power, leading Argos, Athens, Corinth, and Thebes to join against them. Aiming to prevent any single Greek state gaining the dominance that would allow it to challenge Persia, the Persian king initially joined the alliance against Sparta, before imposing the Peace of Antalcidas (\"King's Peace\") which restored Persia's control over the Anatolian Greeks.\nBy 371\u00a0BC, Thebes was in the ascendancy, defeating Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I, and invading Laconia. Further Theban successes against Sparta in 369 led to Messenia gaining independence; Sparta never recovered from the loss of Messenia's fertile land and the helot workforce it provided. The rising power of Thebes led Sparta and Athens to join forces; in 362 they were defeated by Thebes at the Battle of Mantinea. In the aftermath of Mantinea, none of the major Greek states were able to dominate. Though Thebes had won the battle, their general Epaminondas was killed, and they spent the following decades embroiled in wars with their neighbours; Athens, meanwhile, saw its second naval alliance, formed in 377, collapse in the mid-350s.\nThe power vacuum in Greece after the Battle of Mantinea was filled by Macedon, under Philip II, starting from the battle of Crocus field. In 338\u00a0BC, he defeated a Greek alliance at the Battle of Chaeronea, and subsequently formed the League of Corinth. Philip planned to lead the League to invade Persia, but was murdered in 336\u00a0BC. His son Alexander the Great was left to fulfil his father's ambitions. After campaigns against Macedon's western and northern enemies, and those Greek states that had broken from the League of Corinth following the death of Philip, Alexander began his campaign against Persia in 334\u00a0BC. He conquered Persia, defeating Darius III at the Battle of Issus in 333\u00a0BC, and after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331\u00a0BC proclaimed himself king of Asia. From 329 BC he led expeditions to Bactria and then India; further plans to invade Arabia and North Africa were halted by his death in 323\u00a0BC.\nHellenistic Greece.\nThe period from the death of Alexander the Great in 323\u00a0BC until the death of Cleopatra, the last Macedonian ruler of Egypt, is known as the Hellenistic period. In the early part of this period, a new form of kingship developed based on Macedonian and Near Eastern traditions. The first Hellenistic kings were previously Alexander's generals, and took power in the period following his death, though they were not part of existing royal lineages and lacked historic claims to the territories they controlled. The most important of these rulers in the decades after Alexander's death were Antigonus I and his son Demetrius in Macedonia and the rest of Greece, Ptolemy in Egypt, and Seleucus I in Syria and the former Persian empire; smaller Hellenistic kingdoms included Epirus under the reign of Pyrrhus, the Attalids in Anatolia and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom.\nIn the early part of the Hellenistic period, the exact borders of the Hellenistic kingdoms were not settled. Antigonus attempted to expand his territory by attacking the other successor kingdoms until they joined against him, and he was killed at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. His son Demetrius spent many years in Seleucid captivity, and his son, Antigonus II, only reclaimed the Macedonian throne around 276. Meanwhile, the Seleucid kingdom gave up territory in the east to the Indian king Chandragupta Maurya in exchange for war elephants, and later lost large parts of Persia to the Parthian Empire. By the mid-3rd century, the kingdoms of Alexander's successors was mostly stable, though there continued to be disputes over border areas.\nThe great capitals of Hellenistic culture were Alexandria in the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Antioch in the Seleucid Empire.\nThe conquests of Alexander had numerous consequences for the Greek city-states. It greatly widened the horizons of the Greeks and led to a steady emigration of the young and ambitious to the new Greek empires in the east. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch and the many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander's wake, as far away as present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom survived until the end of the 1st century\u00a0BC.\nSome city-states within Greece formed themselves into two major leagues; the Achaean League (including Corinth and Argos) and the Aetolian League. For much of the period until the Roman conquest, these leagues were at war, often participating in the conflicts between the Diadochi's successor states to Alexander's empire.\nThe Antigonid Kingdom became involved in a war with the Roman Republic in the late 3rd century. Although the First Macedonian War was inconclusive, the Romans, in typical fashion, continued to fight Macedon until it was completely absorbed into the Roman Republic (by 149\u00a0BC). In the east, the unwieldy Seleucid Empire gradually disintegrated, although a rump survived until\u00a064 BC, whilst the Ptolemaic Kingdom continued in Egypt until 30\u00a0BC when it too was conquered by the Romans. The Aetolian league grew wary of Roman involvement in Greece, and sided with the Seleucids in the Roman\u2013Seleucid War; when the Romans were victorious, the league was effectively absorbed into the Republic. Although the Achaean league outlasted both the Aetolian league and Macedon, it was also soon defeated and absorbed by the Romans in 146\u00a0BC, bringing Greek independence to an end.\nRoman Greece.\nThe Greek peninsula came under Roman rule during the 146\u00a0BC conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. Macedonia became a Roman province while southern Greece came under the surveillance of Macedonia's prefect; however, some Greek \"poleis\" managed to maintain a partial independence and avoid taxation. The Aegean Islands were added to this territory in 133\u00a0BC. Athens and other Greek cities revolted in 88\u00a0BC, and the peninsula was crushed by the Roman general Sulla. The Roman civil wars devastated the land even further, until Augustus organized the peninsula as the province of Achaea in 27\u00a0BC.\nGreece was a key eastern province of the Roman Empire, as the Roman culture had long been in fact Greco-Roman. The Greek language served as a \"lingua franca\" in the East and in Italy, and many Greek intellectuals such as Galen would perform most of their work in Rome.\nGeography.\nRegions.\nThe territory of Greece is mountainous, and as a result, ancient Greece consisted of many smaller regions, each with its own dialect, cultural peculiarities, and identity. Regionalism and regional conflicts were prominent features of ancient Greece. Cities tended to be located in valleys between mountains, or on coastal plains, and dominated a certain area around them.\nIn the south lay the Peloponnese, consisting of the regions of Laconia (southeast), Messenia (southwest), Elis (west), Achaia (north), Korinthia (northeast), Argolis (east), and Arcadia (center). These names survive to the present day as regional units of modern Greece, though with somewhat different boundaries. Mainland Greece to the north, nowadays known as Central Greece, consisted of Aetolia and Acarnania in the west, Locris, Doris, and Phocis in the center, while in the east lay Boeotia, Attica, and Megaris. Northeast lay Thessaly, while Epirus lay to the northwest. Epirus stretched from the Ambracian Gulf in the south to the Ceraunian Mountains and the Aoos river in the north, and consisted of Chaonia (north), Molossia (center), and Thesprotia (south). In the northeast corner was Macedonia, originally consisting Lower Macedonia and its regions, such as Emathia (Macedonia), Pieria, and Bottiaea, and later Almopia, Amphaxitis. The original capital of Macedon was Aigai and then moved to Pella in the 4th century BC. Around the time of Alexander I of Macedon, the Argead kings of Macedon started to expand into Eordaia and the rest of Upper Macedonia, lands inhabited by independent Upper Macedonian tribes like the Lyncestae, Orestae and the Elimiotae and to the east, beyond the Axius river, into Mygdonia and regions settled by Thracian tribes. To the north of Macedonia lay various non-Greek peoples such as the Paeonians due north, the Thracians to the northeast, and the Illyrians, with whom the Macedonians were frequently in conflict, to the northwest. Chalcidice was settled early on by southern Greek colonists and was considered part of the Greek world, while from the late 2nd millennium BC substantial Greek settlement also occurred on the eastern shores of the Aegean, in Anatolia.\nColonies.\nDuring the Archaic period, the Greek population grew beyond the capacity of the limited arable land of Greece proper, resulting in the large-scale establishment of colonies elsewhere: according to one estimate, the population of the widening area of Greek settlement increased roughly ten-fold from 800 to 400\u00a0BC, from 800,000 to as many as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7+1\u20442\u201310\u00a0million. This was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements. These Greek colonies were not, as Roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right.\nGreeks settled outside of Greece in two distinct ways. The first was in permanent settlements founded by Greeks, which formed as independent poleis. The second form was in what historians refer to as \"emporia\"; trading posts which were occupied by both Greeks and non-Greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods. Examples of this latter type of settlement are found at Al Mina in the east and Pithekoussai in the west. From around 750 to 500\u00a0BC, Greeks settled colonies in all directions. To the east, the Aegean coast of Asia Minor was colonized first, followed by Cyprus and the coasts of Thrace, the Sea of Marmara and south coast of the Black Sea.\nEventually, Greek colonization reached as far northeast as present-day Ukraine and Russia (Taganrog). To the west the coasts of Illyria, Southern Italy (called \"Magna Graecia\") were settled, followed by Southern France, Corsica, and even eastern Spain. Greek colonies were also founded in Egypt and Libya. Modern Syracuse, Naples, Marseille and Istanbul had their beginnings as the Greek colonies Syracusae (), Neapolis (), Massalia () and Byzantion (). These colonies played an important role in the spread of Greek influence throughout Europe and also aided in the establishment of long-distance trading networks between the Greek city-states, boosting the economy of ancient Greece.\nPolitics and society.\nPolitical structure.\nAncient Greece consisted of several hundred relatively independent city-states (\"poleis\"). This was a situation unlike that in most other contemporary societies, which were either tribal or kingdoms ruling over relatively large territories. Undoubtedly, the geography of Greece\u2014divided and sub-divided by hills, mountains, and rivers\u2014contributed to the fragmentary nature of ancient Greece. On the one hand, the ancient Greeks had no doubt that they were \"one people\"; they had the same religion, same basic culture, and same language. Furthermore, the Greeks were very aware of their tribal origins; Herodotus was able to extensively categorise the city-states by tribe. Yet, although these higher-level relationships existed, they seem to have rarely had a major role in Greek politics. The independence of the \"poleis\" was fiercely defended; unification was something rarely contemplated by the ancient Greeks. Even when, during the second Persian invasion of Greece, a group of city-states allied themselves to defend Greece, the vast majority of \"poleis\" remained neutral, and after the Persian defeat, the allies quickly returned to infighting.\nThus, the major peculiarities of the ancient Greek political system were its fragmented nature (and that this does not particularly seem to have tribal origin), and the particular focus on urban centers within otherwise tiny states. The peculiarities of the Greek system are further evidenced by the colonies that they set up throughout the Mediterranean, which, though they might count a certain Greek \"polis\" as their 'mother' (and remain sympathetic to her), were completely independent of the founding city.\nInevitably smaller \"poleis\" might be dominated by larger neighbors, but conquest or direct rule by another city-state appears to have been quite rare. Instead the \"poleis\" grouped themselves into leagues, membership of which was in a constant state of flux. Later in the Classical period, the leagues would become fewer and larger, be dominated by one city (particularly Athens, Sparta and Thebes); and often \"poleis\" would be compelled to join under threat of war (or as part of a peace treaty). Even after Philip II of Macedon conquered the heartlands of ancient Greece, he did not attempt to annex the territory or unify it into a new province, but compelled most of the \"poleis\" to join his own Corinthian League.\nGovernment and law.\nInitially many Greek city-states seem to have been petty kingdoms; there was often a city official carrying some residual, ceremonial functions of the king (\"basileus\"), e.g., the \"archon basileus\" in Athens. However, by the Archaic period and the first historical consciousness, most had already become aristocratic oligarchies. It is unclear exactly how this change occurred. For instance, in Athens, the kingship had been reduced to a hereditary, lifelong chief magistracy (\"archon\") by ; by 753\u00a0BC this had become a decennial, elected archonship, and finally an annually elected archonship by 683\u00a0BC. Through each stage, more power would have been transferred to the aristocracy as a whole, and away from a single individual.\nInevitably, the domination of politics and concomitant aggregation of wealth by small groups of families was apt to cause social unrest in many \"poleis\". In many cities a tyrant (not in the modern sense of repressive autocracies), would at some point seize control and govern according to their own will; often a populist agenda would help sustain them in power. In a system wracked with class conflict, government by a 'strongman' was often the best solution.\nAthens fell under a tyranny in the second half of the 6th century\u00a0BC. When this tyranny was ended, the Athenians founded the world's first democracy as a radical solution to prevent the aristocracy regaining power. A citizens' assembly (the \"Ecclesia\"), for the discussion of city policy, had existed since the reforms of Draco in 621\u00a0BC; all citizens were permitted to attend after the reforms of Solon (early 6th century), but the poorest citizens could not address the assembly or run for office. With the establishment of the democracy, the assembly became the \"de jure\" mechanism of government; all citizens had equal privileges in the assembly. However, non-citizens, such as metics (foreigners living in Athens) or slaves, had no political rights at all.\nAfter the rise of democracy in Athens, other city-states founded democracies. However, many retained more traditional forms of government. As so often in other matters, Sparta was a notable exception to the rest of Greece, ruled through the whole period by not one, but two hereditary monarchs. This was a form of diarchy. The Kings of Sparta belonged to the Agiads and the Eurypontids, descendants respectively of Eurysthenes and Procles. Both dynasties' founders were believed to be twin sons of Aristodemus, a Heraclid ruler. However, the powers of these kings were held in check by both a council of elders (the \"Gerousia\") and magistrates specifically appointed to watch over the kings (the \"Ephors\").\nSocial structure.\nOnly free, land-owning, native-born men could be citizens entitled to the full protection of the law in a city-state. In most city-states, unlike the situation in Rome, social prominence did not allow special rights. Sometimes families controlled public religious functions, but this ordinarily did not give any extra power in the government. In Athens, the population was divided into four social classes based on wealth. People could change classes if they made more money. In Sparta, all male citizens were called \"homoioi\", meaning \"peers\". However, Spartan kings, who served as the city-state's dual military and religious leaders, came from two families.\nWomen in Ancient Greece appear to have primarily performed domestic tasks, managed households, and borne and reared children.\nSlavery.\nSlaves had no power or status. Slaves had the right to have a family and own property, subject to their master's goodwill and permission, but they had no political rights. By 600\u00a0BC, chattel slavery had spread in Greece. By the 5th century\u00a0BC, slaves made up one-third of the total population in some city-states. Between 40 and 80% of the population of Classical Athens were slaves. Slaves outside of Sparta almost never revolted because they were made up of too many nationalities and were too scattered to organize. However, unlike later Western culture, the ancient Greeks did not think in terms of race.\nMost families owned slaves as household servants and laborers, and even poor families might have owned a few slaves. Owners were not allowed to beat or kill their slaves. Owners often promised to free slaves in the future to encourage slaves to work hard. Unlike in Rome, freedmen did not become citizens. Instead, they were mixed into the population of \"metics\", which included people from foreign countries or other city-states who were officially allowed to live in the state.\nCity-states legally owned slaves. These public slaves had a larger measure of independence than slaves owned by families, living on their own and performing specialized tasks. In Athens, public slaves were trained to look out for counterfeit coinage, while temple slaves acted as servants of the temple's deity and Scythian slaves were employed in Athens as a police force corralling citizens to political functions.\nSparta had a special type of slaves called \"helots\". Helots were Messenians enslaved en masse during the Messenian Wars by the state and assigned to families where they were forced to stay. Helots raised food and did household chores so that women could concentrate on raising strong children while men could devote their time to training as hoplites. Their masters treated them harshly, and helots revolted against their masters several times. In 370/369\u00a0BC, as a result of Epaminondas' liberation of Messenia from Spartan rule, the helot system there came to an end and the helots won their freedom. However, it persisted in Laconia until the 2nd century\u00a0BC.\nEducation.\nFor most of Greek history, education was private, except in Sparta. During the Hellenistic period, some city-states established public schools. Only wealthy families could afford a teacher. Boys learned how to read, write and quote literature. They also learned to sing and play one musical instrument and were trained as athletes for military service. They studied not for a job but to become an effective citizen. Girls also learned to read, write and do simple arithmetic so they could manage the household. They almost never received education after childhood.\nBoys went to school at the age of seven, or went to the barracks, if they lived in Sparta. The three types of teachings were: grammatistes for arithmetic, kitharistes for music and dancing, and Paedotribae for sports.\nBoys from wealthy families attending the private school lessons were taken care of by a \"paidagogos\", a household slave selected for this task who accompanied the boy during the day. Classes were held in teachers' private houses and included reading, writing, mathematics, singing, and playing the lyre and flute. When the boy became 12 years old the schooling started to include sports such as wrestling, running, and throwing discus and javelin. In Athens, some older youths attended academy for the finer disciplines such as culture, sciences, music, and the arts. The schooling ended at age 18, followed by military training in the army usually for one or two years.\nSome of Athens' greatest such schools included the Lyceum (the so-called Peripatetic school founded by Aristotle of Stageira) and the Platonic Academy (founded by Plato of Athens). The education system of the wealthy ancient Greeks is also called Paideia.\nEconomy.\nAt its economic height in the 5th and 4th centuries\u00a0BC, the free citizenry of Classical Greece represented perhaps the most prosperous society in the ancient world, some economic historians considering Greece one of the most advanced pre-industrial economies. In terms of wheat, wages reached an estimated daily for an unskilled worker in urban Athens, 2\u20133 times the of an unskilled rural labourer in Roman Egypt, though Greek farm incomes too were on average lower than those available to urban workers.\nWhile slave conditions varied widely, the institution served to sustain the incomes of the free citizenry: an estimate of economic development drawn from the latter (or derived from urban incomes alone) is therefore likely to overstate the true overall level despite widespread evidence for high living standards.\nWarfare.\nAt least in the Archaic period, the fragmentary nature of ancient Greece, with many competing city-states, increased the frequency of conflict but conversely limited the scale of warfare. Unable to maintain professional armies, the city-states relied on their own citizens to fight. This inevitably reduced the potential duration of campaigns, as citizens would need to return to their own professions (especially in the case of, for example, farmers). Campaigns would therefore often be restricted to summer. When battles occurred, they were usually set piece and intended to be decisive. Casualties were slight compared to later battles, rarely amounting to more than five percent of the losing side, but the slain often included the most prominent citizens and generals who led from the front.\nThe scale and scope of warfare in ancient Greece changed dramatically as a result of the Greco-Persian Wars. To fight the enormous armies of the Achaemenid Empire was effectively beyond the capabilities of a single city-state. The eventual triumph of the Greeks was achieved by alliances of city-states (the exact composition changing over time), allowing the pooling of resources and division of labor. Although alliances between city-states occurred before this time, nothing on this scale had been seen before. The rise of Athens and Sparta as pre-eminent powers during this conflict led directly to the Peloponnesian War, which saw further development of the nature of warfare, strategy and tactics. Fought between leagues of cities dominated by Athens and Sparta, the increased manpower and financial resources increased the scale and allowed the diversification of warfare. Set-piece battles during the Peloponnesian war proved indecisive and instead there was increased reliance on attritionary strategies, naval battles and blockades and sieges. These changes greatly increased the number of casualties and the disruption of Greek society.\nAthens owned one of the largest war fleets in ancient Greece. It had over 200 triremes each powered by 170 oarsmen who were seated in 3 rows on each side of the ship. The city could afford such a large fleet\u2014it had over 34,000 oarsmen\u2014because it owned a lot of silver mines that were worked by slaves.\nAccording to Josiah Ober, Greek city-states faced approximately a one-in-three chance of destruction during the archaic and classical period.\nCulture.\nPhilosophy.\nAncient Greek philosophy focused on the role of reason and inquiry. In many ways, it had an important influence on modern philosophy, as well as modern science. Clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, to medieval Muslim philosophers and Islamic scientists, to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment, to the secular sciences of the modern day.\nNeither reason nor inquiry began with the ancient Greeks. Defining the difference between the Greek quest for knowledge and the quests of the elder civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians, has long been a topic of study by theorists of civilization.\nThe first known philosophers of Greece were the pre-Socratics, who attempted to provide naturalistic, non-mythical descriptions of the world. They were followed by Socrates, one of the first philosophers based in Athens during its golden age whose ideas, despite being known by second-hand accounts instead of writings of his own, laid the basis of Western philosophy. Socrates' disciple Plato, who wrote \"The Republic\" and established a radical difference between ideas and the concrete world, and Plato's disciple Aristotle, who wrote extensively about nature and ethics, are also immensely influential in Western philosophy to this day. The later Hellenistic philosophy, also originating in Greece, is defined by names such as Antisthenes (cynicism), Zeno of Citium (stoicism) and Plotinus (Neoplatonism).\nLiterature and theatre.\nThe earliest Greek literature was poetry and was composed for performance rather than private consumption. The earliest Greek poet known is Homer, although he was certainly part of an existing tradition of oral poetry. Homer's poetry, though it was developed around the same time that the Greeks developed writing, would have been composed orally; the first poet to certainly compose their work in writing was Archilochus, a lyric poet from the mid-7th century\u00a0BC. Tragedy developed around the end of the archaic period, taking elements from across the pre-existing genres of late archaic poetry. Towards the beginning of the classical period, comedy began to develop\u2014the earliest date associated with the genre is 486\u00a0BC, when a competition for comedy became an official event at the City Dionysia in Athens, though the first preserved ancient comedy is Aristophanes' \"Acharnians\", produced in 425.\nLike poetry, Greek prose had its origins in the archaic period, and the earliest writers of Greek philosophy, history, and medical literature all date to the 6th century\u00a0BC. Prose first emerged as the writing style adopted by the presocratic philosophers Anaximander and Anaximenes\u2014though Thales of Miletus, considered the first Greek philosopher, apparently wrote nothing. Prose as a genre reached maturity in the classical era, and the major Greek prose genres\u2014philosophy, history, rhetoric, and dialogue\u2014developed in this period.\nThe Hellenistic period saw the literary centre of the Greek world move from Athens, where it had been in the classical period, to Alexandria. At the same time, other Hellenistic kings such as the Antigonids and the Attalids were patrons of scholarship and literature, turning Pella and Pergamon respectively into cultural centres. It was thanks to this cultural patronage by Hellenistic kings, and especially the Museum at Alexandria, that so much ancient Greek literature has survived. The Library of Alexandria, part of the Museum, had the previously unenvisaged aim of collecting together copies of all known authors in Greek. Almost all of the surviving non-technical Hellenistic literature is poetry, and Hellenistic poetry tended to be highly intellectual, blending different genres and traditions, and avoiding linear narratives. The Hellenistic period also saw a shift in the ways literature was consumed\u2014while in the archaic and classical periods literature had typically been experienced in public performance, in the Hellenistic period it was more commonly read privately. At the same time, Hellenistic poets began to write for private, rather than public, consumption.\nWith Octavian's victory at Actium in 31\u00a0BC, Rome began to become a major centre of Greek literature, as important Greek authors such as Strabo and Dionysius of Halicarnassus came to Rome. The period of greatest innovation in Greek literature under Rome was the \"long second century\" from approximately 80\u00a0AD to around 230\u00a0AD. This innovation was especially marked in prose, with the development of the novel and a revival of prominence for display oratory both dating to this period.\nMusic and dance.\nIn Ancient Greek society, music was ever-present and considered a fundamental component of civilisation. It was an important part of public religious worship, private ceremonies such as weddings and funerals, and household entertainment. Men sang and played music at the symposium; both men and women sang at work; and children's games involved song and dance.\nAncient Greek music was primarily vocal, sung either by a solo singer or a chorus, and usually accompanied by an instrument; purely instrumental music was less common. The Greeks used stringed instruments, including lyres, harps, and lutes; and wind instruments, of which the most important was the , a reed instrument. Percussion instruments played a relatively unimportant role supporting stringed and wind instruments, and were used in certain religious cults.\nScience and technology.\nAncient Greek mathematics contributed many important developments to mathematics, including the basic rules of geometry, the idea of formal mathematical proof, and discoveries in number theory, mathematical analysis, applied mathematics, and approached close to establishing integral calculus. The discoveries of several Greek mathematicians, including Pythagoras, Euclid, and Archimedes, are still used in mathematical teaching today.\nThe Greeks developed astronomy, which they treated as a branch of mathematics, to a highly sophisticated level. The first geometrical, three-dimensional models to explain the apparent motion of the planets were developed in the 4th century\u00a0BC by Eudoxus of Cnidus and Callippus of Cyzicus. Their younger contemporary Heraclides Ponticus proposed that the Earth rotates around its axis. In the 3rd century\u00a0BC, Aristarchus of Samos was the first to suggest a heliocentric system. Archimedes in his treatise The Sand Reckoner revives Aristarchus' hypothesis that \"the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, while the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle\". Otherwise, only fragmentary descriptions of Aristarchus' idea survive. Eratosthenes, using the angles of shadows created at widely separated regions, estimated the circumference of the Earth with great accuracy. In the 2nd century\u00a0BC Hipparchus of Nicea made a number of contributions, including the first measurement of precession and the compilation of the first star catalog in which he proposed the modern system of apparent magnitudes.\nThe Antikythera mechanism, a device for calculating the movements of planets, dates from about 80\u00a0BC and was the first ancestor of the astronomical computer. It was discovered in an ancient shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete. The device became famous for its use of a differential gear, previously believed to have been invented in the 16th century, and the miniaturization and complexity of its parts, comparable to a clock made in the 18th century. The original mechanism is displayed in the Bronze collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, accompanied by a replica.\nThe ancient Greeks also made important discoveries in the medical field. Hippocrates was a physician of the Classical period, and is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine. He is referred to as the \"father of medicine\" in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic school of medicine. This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields that it had traditionally been associated with (notably theurgy and philosophy), thus making medicine a profession.\nArt and architecture.\nThe art of ancient Greece has exercised an enormous influence on the culture of many countries from ancient times to the present day, particularly in the areas of sculpture and architecture. In the West, the art of the Roman Empire was largely derived from Greek models. In the East, Alexander the Great's conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and Indian cultures, resulting in Greco-Buddhist art, with ramifications as far as Japan. Following the Renaissance in Europe, the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Well into the 19th century, the classical tradition derived from Greece dominated the art of the Western world.\nReligion.\nReligion was a central part of ancient Greek life. Though the Greeks of different cities and tribes worshipped similar gods, religious practices were not uniform and the gods were thought of differently in different places. The Greeks were polytheistic, worshipping many gods, but as early as the 6th century\u00a0BC a pantheon of twelve Olympians began to develop. Greek religion was influenced by the practices of the Greeks' near eastern neighbours at least as early as the archaic period, and by the Hellenistic period this influence was seen in both directions.\nThe most important religious act in ancient Greece was animal sacrifice, most commonly of sheep and goats. Sacrifice was accompanied by public prayer, and prayer and hymns were themselves a major part of ancient Greek religious life.\nLegacy.\nThe civilization of ancient Greece has been immensely influential on language, politics, educational systems, philosophy, science, and the arts. It became the \"Leitkultur\" of the Roman Empire to the point of marginalizing native Italic traditions. As Horace put it,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; (\"Epistulae\" 2.1.156f.)Captive Greece took captive her uncivilised conqueror and instilled her arts in rustic Latium.\nVia the Roman Empire, Greek culture came to be foundational to Western culture in general.\nThe Byzantine Empire inherited Classical Greek-Hellenistic culture directly, without Latin intermediation, and the preservation of Classical Greek learning in medieval Byzantine tradition further exerted a strong influence on the Slavs and later on the Islamic Golden Age and the Western European Renaissance. A modern revival of Classical Greek learning took place in the Neoclassicism movement in 18th- and 19th-century Europe and the Americas.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The result is a high-performance parallel computing cluster from inexpensive personal computer hardware.\nOrigin.\nBeowulf originally referred to a specific computer built in 1994 by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker at NASA. They named it after the Old English epic poem, \"\".\nSystems.\nNo particular piece of software defines a cluster as a Beowulf. Typically only free and open source software is used, both to save cost and to allow customization. Most Beowulf clusters run a Unix-like operating system, such as BSD, Linux, or Solaris. Commonly used parallel processing libraries include Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM). Both of these permit the programmer to divide a task among a group of networked computers, and collect the results of processing. Examples of MPI software include Open MPI or MPICH. There are additional MPI implementations available.\nBeowulf systems operate worldwide, chiefly in support of scientific computing. Since 2017, every system on the Top500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers has used Beowulf software methods and a Linux operating system. At this level, however, most are by no means just assemblages of commodity hardware; custom design work is often required for the nodes (often blade servers), the networking, and the cooling systems.\nDevelopment.\nA description of the Beowulf cluster, from the original \"how-to\", which was published by Jacek Radajewski and Douglas Eadline under the Linux Documentation Project in 1998:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBeowulf is a multi-computer architecture which can be used for parallel computations. It is a system which usually consists of one server node, and one or more client nodes connected via Ethernet or some other network. It is a system built using commodity hardware components, like any PC capable of running a Unix-like operating system, with standard Ethernet adapters, and switches. It does not contain any custom hardware components and is trivially reproducible. Beowulf also uses commodity software like the FreeBSD, Linux or Solaris operating system, Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) and Message Passing Interface (MPI). The server node controls the whole cluster and serves files to the client nodes. It is also the cluster's console and gateway to the outside world. Large Beowulf machines might have more than one server node, and possibly other nodes dedicated to particular tasks, for example consoles or monitoring stations. In most cases, client nodes in a Beowulf system are dumb, the dumber the better. Nodes are configured and controlled by the server node, and do only what they are told to do. In a disk-less client configuration, a client node doesn't even know its IP address or name until the server tells it.\nOne of the main differences between Beowulf and a Cluster of Workstations (COW) is that Beowulf behaves more like a single machine rather than many workstations. In most cases client nodes do not have keyboards or monitors, and are accessed only via remote login or possibly serial terminal. Beowulf nodes can be thought of as a CPU + memory package which can be plugged into the cluster, just like a CPU or memory module can be plugged into a motherboard.\nBeowulf is not a special software package, new network topology, or the latest kernel hack. Beowulf is a technology of clustering computers to form a parallel, virtual supercomputer. Although there are many software packages such as kernel modifications, PVM and MPI libraries, and configuration tools which make the Beowulf architecture faster, easier to configure, and much more usable, one can build a Beowulf class machine using a standard Linux distribution without any additional software. If you have two networked computers which share at least the codice_1 file system via NFS, and trust each other to execute remote shells (rsh), then it could be argued that you have a simple, two node Beowulf machine.\nOperating systems.\nAs of 2014[ [update]] a number of Linux distributions, and at least one BSD, are designed for building Beowulf clusters. These include:\nThe following are no longer maintained:\nA cluster can be set up by using Knoppix bootable CDs in combination with OpenMosix. The computers will automatically link together, without need for complex configurations, to form a Beowulf cluster using all CPUs and RAM in the cluster. A Beowulf cluster is scalable to a nearly unlimited number of computers, limited only by the overhead of the network.\nProvisioning of operating systems and other software for a Beowulf Cluster can be automated using software, such as Open Source Cluster Application Resources. OSCAR installs on top of a standard installation of a supported Linux distribution on a cluster's head node.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The group is known for its proselytism of Jews and promotes the belief that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of God. It was founded in 1970 by Moishe Rosen as Hineni Ministries before being incorporated under its current name in 1973.\nThere are no Jewish religious authorities that consider Jews for Jesus to be a Jewish organization, mainly because the founder is an ordained Baptist minister. Rabbinical authorities point out that there is only one mention of the Old Testament (the Tanakh to Jews) in its \"Statement of Faith\". Additionally, the Supreme Court of Israel determined that Messianic Jews are not actually Jews as belief in Jesus as the Messiah is not a Jewish value. Instead, most Jews view Jesus either as a good Jewish teacher or as a false prophet, but most certainly a failed messiah claimant.\nHistory.\nJews for Jesus was founded by Moishe Rosen, a Jewish convert to Christianity who later went on to become a Baptist minister of the Hebrew Christian movement and a former member of the American Board of Missions to the Jews (ABMJ). The organization was formed in 1970 under the name \"Hineni Ministries\" as a subsidiary group of the ABMJ. In 1973, Rosen left ABMJ and incorporated his ministry as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization under the name \"Jews for Jesus\". Originally, \"Jews for Jesus\" was one of the organization's several slogans, but after the media began to call the group \"Jews for Jesus\", the organization adopted the name.\nRosen and members began conducting community outreach on streets and college campuses of San Francisco, California. In the following years, branches were established in New York, Chicago, and Boston. In 1978, the Jews for Jesus headquarters relocated to its current location in San Francisco. In 1981, the organization expanded internationally. According to the organization, as of 2021 it maintains offices in 13 countries and 15 cities around the world.\nRosen remained Executive Director until 1996, when he stepped down to work full-time as a staff missionary. He was replaced by David Brickner, who held the position until May 2024. https:// is the current Executive Director and CEO of Jews for Jesus.\nBeliefs.\nJews for Jesus claims to syncretize Jewish heritage and Christian faith into spiritual harmony. They believe faith in Jesus is a viable expression of Jewish life.\nThe organization summarizes its beliefs in a statement of faith:\nOperations.\nJews for Jesus is a registered 501(c)(3) organization that employs approximately 250 staff worldwide. Its headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, and operates offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Toronto, Sydney, Johannesburg, London, Berlin, Paris, Budapest, Tel Aviv, Kyiv, Odesa, Moscow, and Jerusalem.\nOnce well-known for their distribution of hand-drawn religious tracts, today Jews for Jesus conducts community engagement through other means. Examples of their outreach methods include Jewish holiday events, Bible studies, service projects, internet evangelism, and multi-purpose spaces such as the Moishe Rosen Center in Tel Aviv and the Upside Down Cafe in Los Angeles.\nFunding and organization.\nThey are a charter member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability and of MissioNexus. Donations are tax deductible. An independent auditing firm, Eckhoff Accountancy, conducts the organization's annual audit. According to the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, the group's total revenue in FY 2021 was US$37,431,707 and its total expenses was $25,888,924. Expense breakdown was $20,744,089 for programs, $2,039,434 for administration, and $3,105,401 for fundraising.\nJews for Jesus is governed by international boards of directors in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Israel, and Europe. The CEO is advised by an executive leadership team consisting of seven members.\nPublic perception.\nJewish.\nJews for Jesus has a contentious relationship with the Jewish community, and their methods have generated controversy. All Jewish authorities, as well as the governing bodies of the State of Israel, hold the view that Messianic Judaism, the religious movement with which Jews for Jesus is affiliated, is not a sect of Judaism but a form of Evangelical Christianity. Additionally, Gentiles who convert to Messianic Judaism are not recognized as Jewish by any Jewish movement. However, Jews for Jesus says they \"cannot support any efforts by Gentile believers to convert to any type of Judaism.\"\nBelief in Jesus as deity, Son of God, or even a non-divine Christ/Messiah or prophet (as in Islam), is held as incompatible with Judaism by most Jewish religious movements. However, there has been some debate of that point by Jewish scholars. Daniel Boyarin, a Jewish historian of religion and professor of Talmudic culture at UC Berkeley, writes in one of his books: Most (if not all) of the ideas and practices of the Jesus movement of the first century and the beginning of the second century\u2014and even later\u2014can be safely understood as part of the ideas and practices that we understand to be \"Judaism.\"... The ideas of Trinity and incarnation, or certainly the germs of those ideas, were already present among Jewish believers well before Jesus came on the scene to incarnate in himself, as it were, those theological notions and take up his messianic calling.Dan Cohn-Sherbok, a rabbi of Reform Judaism and professor of Jewish Theology at the University of Wales, implies that Messianic Judaism should be embraced in the Jewish community:...the non-Orthodox rejection of Messianic Jews is more difficult to comprehend given the multidimensional character of contemporary Jewish life ... There is simply no consensus among non-Orthodox Jews concerning the central tenets of the faith, nor is there any agreement about Jewish observance. Instead, the various branches of non-Orthodox Judaism embrace a totally heterogeneous range of viewpoints ... in my view Messianic Judaism constitutes an innovative, exciting, and extremely interesting development on the Jewish scene.In a 2013 Pew Forum study, 60% of American Jews said that belief in Jesus as the Messiah was not \"compatible with being Jewish\", while 34% found it compatible and 4% did not know. A 2017 survey that included Messianic Jews \"found that 21 percent of Jewish millennials believe Jesus was 'God in human form who lived among people in the 1st century.'\" An additional question on faith in the survey found that 14% of participants identified with Christianity, and 10% believed in a hybrid of Christian and Jewish beliefs.\nIn 1993 the Task Force on Missionaries and Cults of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York (JCRCNY) issued a statement which has been endorsed by the four major Jewish denominations: Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism, and Reconstructionist Judaism, as well as national Jewish organizations. Based on this statement, the Spiritual Deception Prevention Project at the JCRCNY stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe director of counter-missionary group Torah Atlanta, Rabbi Efraim Davidson, stated: \"Jews for Jesus use aggressive proselytizing to target disenfranchised or unaffiliated Jews, Russian immigrants and college students,\" and that \"their techniques are manipulative, deceptive and anti-Semitic.\"\nChristian.\nSome Western Christians object to evangelizing Jews because they see Jewish religious practice as valid in and of itself. Some Liberal Protestant denominations have issued statements criticizing evangelism of Jews including the United Church of Christ and the Presbyterian Church USA, which said in 1988 that Jews have their own covenant with God. The Board of Governors of the Long Island Council of Churches opposes proselytizing, and voiced their sentiments in a statement that \"noted with alarm\" the \"subterfuge and dishonesty\" inherent in the \"mixing [of] religious symbols in ways which distort their essential meaning,\" and named Jews for Jesus as one of the three groups about whom such behavior was alleged.\nLeighton Ford, former vice president of the Billy Graham Evangelical Association and current president of Leighton Ford Ministries, supports the work of Jews for Jesus:The first followers of Jesus were all Jews \u2013 women and men so touched and changed by him that they had to tell their friends and neighbors ... Like their first century counterparts, the people I know in Jews for Jesus have good news they share lovingly and boldly!In 2003, the sponsorship of Jews for Jesus by All Souls Church, Langham Place, a conservative evangelical church in London, including a launch event on Rosh Hashanah to start a UK mission targeting the Jewish community, led to the Interfaith Alliance UK, a coalition of Jewish, Christian and Islamic religious leaders, issuing a letter of protest to the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nOther.\nThe InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington includes Muslims, Jews, and Christian groups. The Conference states that they \"support the right of all religions to share their message in the spirit of good will\"; however, Rev. Clark Lobenstine has condemned the \"proselytizing efforts\" of \"Jews for Jesus and other messianic Jewish groups.\" His wording matched the Conference's 1987 \"Statement on Proselytism\", which makes claims against \"groups that have adopted the label of Hebrew Christianity, Messianic Judaism, or Jews for Jesus\", so it is unclear which claims are directed at Jews for Jesus in particular.\n\"America's Religions. An Educator's Guide to Beliefs and Practices\" contains \"[a] note about Jews for Jesus, Messianic Jews, Hebrew Christians, and similar groups: Jews in these groups who have converted to Christianity but continue to observe various Jewish practices are no longer considered part of the Jewish community in the usual sense\".\nSeveral other organizations oppose the identification of Jews for Jesus as a Jewish group.\nControversies.\n1987 \u2013 Freedom of speech.\nIn \"Board of Airport Commissioners of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.\" the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Jews for Jesus in a free speech case against the Los Angeles International Airport.\n1998 and 2005\u20132006 \u2013 Online name.\nJews for Jesus has been involved in litigation regarding Internet use of its name. In 1998 they sued Steven Brodsky for cybersquatting\u2014registering the domain name jewsforjesus.org for a site criticizing the organization. The domain now belongs to Jews for Jesus and is used for their main site.\nIn 2005 Jews for Jesus sued Google for allowing a Blogspot user to put up a site at the third-level subdomain \"jewsforjesus.blogspot.com\". In September 2006 \"Christianity Today\" reported: \"Jews for Jesus settled out of court with a critical blogger identified as 'Whistle Blower' on jewsforjesus.blogspot.com. The evangelistic ministry assumed control of the site.\"\n2006 \u2013 misuse of Jackie Mason name.\nIn 2006 comedian and actor Jackie Mason filed a lawsuit against Jews for Jesus, alleging that the organization unlawfully distributed a pamphlet that used his name and likeness in a way that suggested he was a member of the group. Jackie Mason was Jewish, but not associated with Jews for Jesus. Jews for Jesus issued a detailed response to the allegation on their website.\nA judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied a preliminary injunction against Jews for Jesus over the pamphlet, finding the distribution of the pamphlet to be protected by the First Amendment, and also stated that the pamphlet did not suggest that Mason was a Christian.\nIn December 2006, Mason dropped the lawsuit against Jews for Jesus after they issued a letter of apology to him. The group's executive director, David Brickner, stated in the letter to Mason that he wanted \"to convey my sincere apologies for any distress that you felt over our tract.\" Brickner continued that he believed its publication was protected by the Constitution, but the group was willing in the interest of peace and love for Israel to retire the pamphlet. Mason replied in front of the federal court in Manhattan where he accepted the apology, \"There's no such thing as a Jew for Jesus. It's like saying a black man is for the KKK. You can't be a table and a chair. You're either a Jew or a Gentile.\"\n\"That Jew Died for You\" video.\nIn 2014, Jews for Jesus published a three-minute YouTube video called \"That Jew Died for You\", to coincide with Passover, Holy Week and Holocaust Remembrance Day on 28 April. A long-haired Jesus dragging a large wooden cross appears in the film until an Auschwitz concentration camp guard sends him to the gas chambers and says \"just another Jew\" in German. Jews for Jesus said that the objective of the film was for Jesus to be identified with the victims rather than the perpetrators of the Holocaust and that \"the Holocaust has been used \u2013 perhaps more than any other event or topic \u2013 to prevent Jewish people from considering the good news of Jesus.\" Jay Michaelson, writing in \"The Jewish Daily Forward\", described it as \"the most tasteless YouTube video ever\" and wrote: \"Not to state the obvious, but it desecrates the memory of six million Jews to use their suffering as a way to convert Jews to Christianity.\" Fox News Channel and History refused to play an advertisement for the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and the steppe of Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan. Lands typically referred to as \"prairie\" (a French loan word) tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the lower and mid-latitude of the area referred to as the Interior Plains of Canada, the United States, and Mexico. It includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, hillier land to the east. From west to east, generally the drier expanse of shortgrass prairie gives way to mixed grass prairie and ultimately the richer and wetter soils of the tallgrass prairie.\nIn the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states, from north to south, of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas in the west, and to the east, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana. The Palouse of Washington and the Central Valley of California are also prairies. The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Prairies may contain various lush flora and fauna, often contain rich soil maintained by biodiversity, with a temperate climate and a varied view.\nEtymology.\nAccording to Theodore Roosevelt:{ \"Prairie\" () is the French word for \"meadow\", formed ultimately from the Latin root word \"pratum\" (which has the same meaning).\nFormation.\nThe formation of the Canadian Prairies started with the uplift of the Rocky Mountains near Alberta. The mountains created a rain shadow which resulted in lower precipitation rates downwind.\nThe parent material of most prairie soil was distributed during the last glacial advance that began about 110,000 years ago. The glaciers expanding southward scraped the landscape, picking up geologic material and leveling the terrain. As the glaciers retreated about 10,000 years ago, they deposited this material in the form of till. Wind-based loess deposits also form an important parent material for prairie soils.\nTallgrass prairie evolved over tens of thousands of years with the disturbances of grazing and fire. Native ungulates such as bison, elk, and white-tailed deer roamed the expansive, diverse grasslands before European colonization of the Americas. For 10,000-20,000 years, native people used fire annually as a tool to assist in hunting, transportation, and safety. Evidence of ignition sources of fire in the tall grass prairie are overwhelmingly human as opposed to lightning. Humans, and grazing animals, were active participants in the process of prairie formation and the establishment of the diversity of graminoid and forbs species. Fire has the effect on prairies of removing trees, clearing dead plant matter, and changing the availability of certain nutrients in the soil from the ash produced. Fire kills the vascular tissue of trees, but not prairie species, as up to 75% (depending on the species) of the total plant biomass is below the soil surface and will re-grow from its deep (upwards of 20 feet) roots. Without disturbance, trees will encroach on a grassland and cast shade, which suppresses the understory. Prairie and widely spaced oak trees evolved to coexist in the oak savanna ecosystem.\nEcology.\nPrairie ecosystems in the United States and Canada are divided into the easternmost tallgrass prairie, the westernmost shortgrass prairie, and the central mixed-grass prairie. \nTallgrass prairies receive over 30 inches of rainfall per year, whereas shortgrass prairies are much more arid, receiving only 12 inches or so, and mixed-grass prairies receive intermediate rainfall. Wet, mesic, and dry prairie ecosystems can also form more locally due to soil and terrain characteristics. Wet prairies may form in low-lying areas with poor drainage; dry prairie can be found on uplands or slopes. Dry prairie is the dominant habitat type in the Southern Canadian agricultural and climatic region which is known as Palliser's Triangle. It was once thought to be completely unarable, but is now one of the most important agricultural regions in Canada thanks to advances in irrigation technology. \nBiodiversity.\nThe dominant plant life in prairies consists of grasses, which may include 40 to 60 different grass species. In addition to grasses, prairies can include over 300 species of flowering plants. The Konza Tallgrass Prairie in Kansas hosts 250 species of native plants and provides habitat for 208 birds, 27 mammals, 25 reptiles, and over 3,000 insects.\nSome of the dominant grasses of prairies are Indian grass, big bluestem, side-oats grama, Canada wildrye, and switchgrass.\nPrairies are considered to be fire-dependent ecosystems. Regular controlled burning by Native Americans, practices developed through observation of non-anthropogenic fire and its effects, maintained the biodiversity of the prairie, clearing away dead vegetation and preventing trees from shading out the diverse grasses and herbaceous plants. Prairies also depend on the presence of large grazing animals, particularly bison.\nBison are important to the prairie ecosystem because they shape and alter the environment by grazing, trampling areas with their hooves, wallowing, and depositing manure. Bison eat more grass than flowering plants, increasing the diversity of plants in the prairie. Cattle are thought to prefer to eat flowering plants over grasses, but it is not known if that is because of inherent differences in the species or because farmed cattle tend to be confined in smaller areas. Bison dung is a vital source of nutrients for prairie soil, spreads seeds, and supports over 1,000 insect species, including specialist dung beetles which cannot subsist on the feces of any other animal.\nDegradation.\nIn spite of long recurrent droughts and occasional torrential rains, the grasslands of the Great Plains were not subject to great soil erosion. The root systems of native prairie grasses firmly held the soil in place to prevent run-off of soil. When the plant died, the fungi and bacteria returned its nutrients to the soil. These deep roots also helped native prairie plants reach water in even the driest conditions. Native grasses suffer much less damage from dry conditions than many farm crops currently grown. When the eastern tallgrass prairies were plowed and turned into agricultural lands, the prairie grasses with their strong root systems were destroyed. In combination with severe droughts that resulted in the Dust Bowl, a major ecological disaster in which winds picked up the dry, unprotected prairie soil and formed it into \"black blizzards\" of airborne dirt that blackened the skies for days at a time across 19 states and forced 400,000 people to abandon the Great Plains ecoregion. The Dust Bowl was a major reason for the Great Depression.\nHuman use.\nBison hunting.\nNomadic hunting has been the main human activity on the prairies for the majority of the archaeological record. This once included many now-extinct species of megafauna.\nAfter the other extinctions, the main hunted animal on the prairies was the plains bison. Using loud noises and waving large signals, Native peoples would drive bison into fenced pens called buffalo pounds to be killed with bows and arrows or spears, or drive them off a cliff (called a buffalo jump), to kill or injure the bison \"en masse\". The introduction of the horse and the gun greatly expanded the killing power of the plains Natives. That was followed by the policy of indiscriminate killing by European Americans and Canadians for both commercial reasons and to weaken the independence of plains Natives, and caused a dramatic drop in bison numbers from millions to a few hundred in a century's time, and almost caused their extinction.\nFarming and ranching.\nThe very dense soil plagued the first European settlers who were using wooden plows, which were more suitable for loose forest soil. On the prairie, the plows bounced around, and the soil stuck to them. This problem was solved in 1837 by an Illinois blacksmith named John Deere who developed a steel moldboard plow that was stronger and cut the roots, making the fertile soils ready for farming. Former grasslands are now among the most productive agricultural lands on Earth.\nThe tallgrass prairie has been converted into one of the most intensive crop producing areas in North America. Less than one tenth of one percent (&lt;0.09%) of the original landcover of the tallgrass prairie biome remains. Much of what persists is in cemetery prairies, railroad rights-of-way, or rocky/sandy/hilly places unsuitable for agriculture. States formerly with landcover in native tallgrass prairie including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Missouri have become valued for their highly productive soils and are included in the Corn Belt. As an example of this land use intensity, Illinois and Iowa rank 49th and 50th, out of 50 US states, in total uncultivated land remaining.\nDrier shortgrass prairies were once used mostly for open-range ranching. With the development of barbed wire in the 1870s and improved irrigation techniques, this region has mostly been converted to cropland and small fenced pastures. In southern Canada, Palliser's Triangle has been changed into one of the most important sources of wheat in the world as a result of improved methods of watering wheat fields (along with the rest of the Southern prairie provinces which also grow wheat, canola and many other grains). Despite those advances in farming technology, the area is still very prone to extended periods of drought, which can be disastrous for the industry if it is significantly prolonged.\nBiofuels.\nResearch by David Tilman, ecologist at the University of Minnesota, suggests \"Biofuels made from high-diversity mixtures of prairie plants can reduce global warming by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Even when grown on infertile soils, they can provide a substantial portion of global energy needs, and leave fertile land for food production.\" Unlike corn and soybeans, which are both directly and indirectly major food crops, including livestock feed, prairie grasses are not used for human consumption. Prairie grasses can be grown in infertile soil, eliminating the cost of adding nutrients to the soil. Tilman and his colleagues estimate that prairie grass biofuels would yield 51 percent more energy per acre than ethanol from corn grown on fertile land. Some plants commonly used are lupine, big bluestem (turkey foot), blazing star, switchgrass, and prairie clover.\nPreservation.\nBecause rich and thick topsoil made the land well suited for agricultural use, only 1% of tallgrass prairie remains in the U.S. today. Shortgrass prairie is more abundant.\nSignificant preserved areas of prairie include:\nVirgin prairies.\n\"Virgin prairie\" refers to prairie land which has never been plowed. Small virgin prairies exist in the American Midwestern states and in Canada. Restored prairie refers to a prairie that has been reseeded after plowing or other disturbance.\nPrairie garden.\nA \"prairie garden\" is a garden consisting primarily of plants from a prairie.\nPhysiography.\nThe originally treeless prairies of the upper Mississippi basin began in Indiana and extended westward and north-westward until they merged with the drier region known as the Great Plains. An eastward extension of the same area, originally tree-covered, extended to central Ohio. Thus, the prairies generally lie between the Ohio and Missouri rivers on the south and the Great Lakes on the north. The prairies are a contribution of the glacial period. They consist of glacial drift deposited unconformably on an underlying rock surface of moderate or small relief. Here, the rocks are an extension of the same stratified Palaeozoic formations already described as occurring in the Appalachian region and around the Great Lakes. They are usually fine-textured limestones and shales lying horizontal. The moderate or small relief they were given by mature preglacial erosion is now buried under the drift.\nThe most significant area of the prairies, from Indiana to North Dakota, consists of till plains, that is, sheets of unstratified drift. The plains are 30, 50 or even 100\u00a0ft (up to 30\u00a0m) thick covering the underlying rock surface for thousands of square miles except where postglacial stream erosion has locally laid it bare. The plains have an extraordinarily even surface. The till is presumably made in part of preglacial soils, but it is largely composed of rock waste mechanically transported by the creeping ice sheets. Although the crystalline rocks from Canada and some of the more resistant stratified rocks south of the Great Lakes occur as boulders and stones, a great part of the till has been crushed and ground to a clayey texture. The till plains, although sweeping in broad swells of slowly changing altitude, often appear level to the eye with a view stretching to the horizon. Here and there, faint depressions occur, occupied by marshy sloughs or floored with a rich black soil of postglacial origin. Thus, by sub-glacial aggradation, the prairies have been leveled up to a smooth surface, in contrast to the higher and non-glaciated hilly country just to the south.\nThe great ice sheets formed terminal moraines around their border at various stages. However, the morainic belts are of slight relief in comparison to the great area of the ice. They rise gently from the till plains to 50, 100 or more feet. They may be one, two or three miles (5\u00a0km) wide and their hilly surface, dotted over with boulders, contains many small lakes in basins or hollows, instead of streams in valleys. The morainic belts are arranged in groups of concentric loops, convex southward, because the ice sheets advanced in lobes along the lowlands of the Great Lakes. Neighboring morainic loops join each other in re-entrants (north-pointing cusps), where two adjacent glacial lobes came together and formed their moraines in largest volume. The moraines are of too small relief to be shown on any maps except of the largest scale. Small as they are, they are the chief relief of the prairie states, and, in association with the nearly imperceptible slopes of the till plains, they determine the course of many streams and rivers, which as a whole are consequent upon the surface form of the glacial deposits.\nThe complexity of the glacial period and its subdivision into several glacial epochs, separated by interglacial epochs of considerable length (certainly longer than the postglacial epoch) has a structural consequence in the superposition of successive till sheets, alternating with non-glacial deposits. It also has a physiographic consequence in the very different amount of normal postglacial erosion suffered by the different parts of the glacial deposits. The southernmost drift sheets, as in southern Iowa and northern Missouri, have lost their initially plain surface and are now maturely dissected into gracefully rolling forms. Here, the valleys of even the small streams are well opened and graded, and marshes and lakes are rare. These sheets are of early Pleistocene origin. Nearer the Great Lakes, the till sheets are trenched only by the narrow valleys of the large streams. Marshy sloughs still occupy the faint depressions in the till plains and the associated moraines have abundant small lakes in their undrained hollows. These drift sheets are of late Pleistocene origin.\nWhen the ice sheets extended to the land sloping southward to the Ohio River, Mississippi River and Missouri River, the drift-laden streams flowed freely away from the ice border. As the streams escaped from their subglacial channels, they spread into broader channels and deposited some of their load, and thus aggraded their courses. Local sheets or aprons of gravel and sand are spread more or less abundantly along the outer side of the morainic belts. Long trains of gravel and sands clog the valleys that lead southward from the glaciated to the non-glaciated area. Later, when the ice retreated further and the unloaded streams returned to their earlier degrading habit, they more or less completely scoured out the valley deposits, the remains of which are now seen in terraces on either side of the present flood plains.\nWhen the ice of the last glacial epoch had retreated so far that its front border lay on a northward slope, belonging to the drainage area of the Great Lakes, bodies of water accumulated in front of the ice margin, forming glacio-marginal lakes. The lakes were small at first, and each had its own outlet at the lowest depression of land to the south. As the ice melted further back, neighboring lakes became confluent at the level of the lowest outlet of the group. The outflowing streams grew in the same proportion and eroded a broad channel across the height of land and far down stream, while the lake waters built sand reefs or carved shore cliffs along their margin, and laid down sheets of clay on their floors. All of these features are easily recognized in the prairie region. The present site of Chicago was determined by an Indian portage or carry across the low divide between Lake Michigan and the headwaters of the Illinois River. This divide lies on the floor of the former outlet channel of the glacial Lake Michigan. Corresponding outlets are known for Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior. A very large sheet of water, named Lake Agassiz, once overspread a broad till plain in northern Minnesota and North Dakota. The outlet of this glacial lake, called river Warren, eroded a large channel in which the Minnesota River evident today. The Red River of the North flows northward through a plain formerly covered by Lake Agassiz.\nCertain extraordinary features were produced when the retreat of the ice sheet had progressed so far as to open an eastward outlet for the marginal lakes. This outlet occurred along the depression between the northward slope of the Appalachian plateau in west-central New York and the southward slope of the melting ice sheet. When this eastward outlet came to be lower than the south-westward outlet across the height of land to the Ohio or Mississippi river, the discharge of the marginal lakes was changed from the Mississippi system to the Hudson system. Many well-defined channels, cutting across the north-sloping spurs of the plateau in the neighborhood of Syracuse, New York mark the temporary paths of the ice-bordered outlet river. Successive channels are found at lower and lower levels on the plateau slope, indicating the successive courses taken by the lake outlet as the ice melted further and further back. On some of the channels, deep gorges were eroded heading in temporary cataracts which exceeded Niagara in height but not in breadth. The pools excavated by the plunging waters at the head of the gorges are now occupied by little lakes. The most significant stage in this series of changes occurred when the glacio-marginal lake waters were lowered so that the long escarpment of Niagara limestone was laid bare in western New York. The previously confluent waters were then divided into two lakes. The higher one, Lake Erie, supplied the outflowing Niagara River, which poured its waters down the escarpment to the lower, Lake Ontario. That gave rise to Niagara Falls. Lake Ontario's outlet for a time ran down the Mohawk Valley to the Hudson River. At the higher elevation, it was known as Lake Iroquois. When ice melted from the northeastern end of the lake, it dropped to a lower level, and drained through the St. Lawrence area creating a lower base level for the Niagara River and increasing its erosive capacity.\nIn certain districts, the subglacial till was not spread out in a smooth plain, but accumulated in elliptical mounds, 100\u2013200 feet. high and long with axes parallel to the direction of the ice motion as indicated by striae on the underlying rock floor. These hills are known by the Irish name, drumlins, used for similar hills in north-western Ireland. The most remarkable groups of drumlins occur in western New York, where their number is estimated at over 6,000, and in southern Wisconsin, where it is placed at 5,000. They completely dominate the topography of their districts.\nA curious deposit of an impalpably fine and unstratified silt, known by the German name bess (or loess), lies on the older drift sheets near the larger river courses of the upper Mississippi basin. It attains a thickness of or more near the rivers and gradually fades away at a distance of ten or more miles (16 or more km) on either side. It contains land shells, and hence cannot be attributed to marine or lacustrine submergence. The best explanation is that, during certain phases of the glacial period, it was carried as dust by the winds from the flood plains of aggrading rivers, and slowly deposited on the neighboring grass-covered plains. The glacial and eolian origin of this sediment is evidenced by the angularity of its grains (a bank of it will stand without slumping for years), whereas, if it had been transported significantly by water, the grains would have been rounded and polished. Loess is parent material for an extremely fertile, but droughty soil.\nSouthwestern Wisconsin and parts of the adjacent states of Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota are known as the driftless zone, because, although bordered by drift sheets and moraines, it is free from glacial deposits. It must therefore have been a sort of oasis, when the ice sheets from the north advanced past it on the east and west, and joined around its southern border. The reason for this exemption from glaciation is the converse of that for the southward convexity of the morainic loops. While they mark the paths of greatest glacial advance along lowland troughs (lake basins), the driftless zone is a district protected from ice invasion by reason of the obstruction which the highlands of northern Wisconsin and Michigan (part of the Superior upland) offered to glacial advance.\nThe course of the upper Mississippi River is largely consequent upon glacial deposits. Its sources are in the morainic lakes in northern Minnesota. The drift deposits thereabouts are so heavy that the present divides between the drainage basins of Hudson Bay, Lake Superior, and the Gulf of Mexico evidently stand in no very definite relation to the preglacial divides. The course of the Mississippi through Minnesota is largely guided by the form of the drift cover. Several rapids and the Saint Anthony Falls (determining the site of Minneapolis) are signs of immaturity, resulting from superposition through the drift on the under rock. Further south, as far as the entrance of the Ohio River, the Mississippi follows a rock-walled valley deep, with a flood-plain wide. This valley seems to represent the path of an enlarged early-glacial Mississippi, when much precipitation that is today discharged to Hudson Bay and the Gulf of St. Lawrence was delivered to the Gulf of Mexico, for the curves of the present river are of distinctly smaller radii than the curves of the valley. Lake Pepin ( below St. Paul), a picturesque expansion of the river across its flood-plain, is due to the aggradation of the valley floor where the Chippewa River, coming from the northeast, brought an overload of fluvio-glacial drift. Hence, even the father of waters, like so many other rivers in the Northern states, owes many of its features more or less directly to glacial action.\nThe fertility of the prairies is a natural consequence of their origin. During the mechanical transportation of the till, no vegetation was present to remove the minerals essential to plant growth, as is the case in the soils of normally weathered and dissected peneplains. The soil is similar to the Appalachian piedmont which though not exhausted by the primeval forest cover, are by no means so rich as the till sheets of the prairies. Moreover, whatever the rocky understructure, the till soil has been averaged by a thorough mechanical mixture of rock grindings. Hence, the prairies are continuously fertile for scores of miles together. The true prairies were once covered with a rich growth of natural grass and annual flowering plants, but today, they are covered with farms.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n* Shortgrass prairie\n* Mixed grass prairie\n* Tallgrass prairie\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66554", "revid": "8565473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66554", "title": "Dietary fiber", "text": "Portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely digested\nDietary fiber, fibre, or roughage is the portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely broken down by human digestive enzymes. Dietary fibers are diverse in chemical composition and can be grouped generally by their solubility, viscosity and fermentability which affect how fibers are processed in the body. Dietary fiber has two main subtypes: soluble fiber and insoluble fiber which are components of plant-based foods such as legumes, whole grains, cereals, vegetables, fruits, and nuts or seeds. A diet high in regular fiber consumption is generally associated with supporting health and lowering the risk of several diseases. Dietary fiber consists of non-starch polysaccharides and other plant components such as cellulose, resistant starch, resistant dextrins, inulins, lignins, chitins, pectins, beta-glucans, and oligosaccharides.\nFood sources of dietary fiber have traditionally been divided according to whether they provide soluble or insoluble fiber. Plant foods contain both types of fiber in varying amounts according to the fiber characteristics of viscosity and fermentability. Advantages of consuming fiber depend upon which type is consumed. Bulking fibers \u2013 such as cellulose and hemicellulose (including psyllium) \u2013 absorb and hold water, promoting bowel movement regularity. Viscous fibers \u2013 such as beta-glucan and psyllium \u2013 thicken the fecal mass. Fermentable fibers \u2013 such as resistant starch, xanthan gum, and inulin \u2013 feed the bacteria and microbiota of the large intestine and are metabolized to yield short-chain fatty acids, which have diverse roles in gastrointestinal health.\nSoluble fiber (\"fermentable fiber\" or \"prebiotic fiber\") \u2013 which dissolves in water \u2013 is generally fermented in the colon into gases and physiologically active by-products such as short-chain fatty acids produced in the colon by gut bacteria. Examples are beta-glucans (in oats, barley, and mushrooms) and raw guar gum. Psyllium \u2013 soluble, viscous, and non-fermented fiber \u2013 is a bulking fiber that retains water as it moves through the digestive system, easing defecation. Soluble fiber is generally viscous and delays gastric emptying which in humans can result in an extended feeling of fullness. Inulin (in chicory root), wheat dextrin, oligosaccharides, and resistant starches (in legumes and bananas) are soluble non-viscous fibers. Regular intake of soluble fibers such as beta-glucans from oats or barley has been established to lower blood levels of LDL cholesterol. Soluble fiber supplements also significantly lower LDL cholesterol.\nInsoluble fiber \u2013 which does not dissolve in water \u2013 is inert to digestive enzymes in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Examples are wheat bran, cellulose, and lignin. Coarsely ground insoluble fiber triggers the secretion of mucus in the large intestine providing bulking. However, finely ground insoluble fiber does not have this effect and instead can cause a constipation. Some forms of insoluble fiber, such as resistant starches, can be fermented in the colon.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefinition.\nDietary fiber is defined to be plant components that are not broken down by human digestive enzymes. In the late 20th century, only lignin and some polysaccharides were known to satisfy this definition, but in the early 21st century, resistant starch and oligosaccharides were included as dietary fiber components. The most accepted definition of dietary fiber is \"all polysaccharides and lignin, which are not digested by the endogenous secretion of the human digestive tract\". Currently, most animal nutritionists are using either a physiological definition, \"the dietary components resistant to degradation by mammalian enzymes\", or a chemical definition, \"the sum of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and lignin\".\nTypes and sources.\nContents in food.\nDietary fiber is found in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. The amounts of fiber contained in common foods are listed in the following table:\nDietary fiber is found in plants, typically eaten whole, raw or cooked, although fiber can be added to make dietary supplements and fiber-rich processed foods. Grain bran products have the highest fiber contents, such as crude corn bran (79 g per 100 g) and crude wheat bran (43 g per 100 g), which are ingredients for manufactured foods. Medical authorities, such as the Mayo Clinic, recommend adding fiber-rich products to the Standard American Diet because fiber intake is lower on such a diet that's rich in processed and artificially sweetened foods with minimal intake of vegetables and legumes.\nPlant sources.\nSome plants contain significant amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber. For example, plums and prunes have a thick skin covering a juicy pulp. The skin is a source of insoluble fiber, whereas soluble fiber is in the pulp. Grapes also contain a fair amount of fiber.\nSoluble fiber.\nFound in varying quantities in all plant foods, including:\nInsoluble fiber.\nSources include:\nSupplements.\nThese are a few example forms of fiber that have been sold as supplements or food additives. These may be marketed to consumers for nutritional purposes, treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders, and for such possible health benefits as lowering cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of colon cancer, and losing weight.\nSoluble fiber.\nSoluble fiber supplements may be beneficial for alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, such as diarrhea or constipation and abdominal discomfort. Prebiotic soluble fiber products, like those containing inulin or oligosaccharides, may contribute to relief from inflammatory bowel disease, as in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and \"Clostridioides difficile\", due in part to the short-chain fatty acids produced with subsequent anti-inflammatory actions upon the bowel. Fiber supplements may be effective in an overall dietary plan for managing irritable bowel syndrome by modification of food choices.\nInsoluble fiber.\nOne insoluble fiber, resistant starch from high-amylose corn, has been used as a supplement and may contribute to improving insulin sensitivity and glycemic management as well as promoting regularity and possibly relief of diarrhea. One preliminary finding indicates that resistant corn starch may reduce symptoms of ulcerative colitis.\nInulins.\nChemically defined as oligosaccharides and occurring naturally in most plants, inulins have nutritional value as carbohydrates, or more specifically as fructans, a polymer of the natural plant sugar, fructose. Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant sources such as chicory roots or Jerusalem artichokes for use in prepared foods. Subtly sweet, it can be used to replace sugar, fat, and flour, is often used to improve the flow and mixing qualities of powdered nutritional supplements, and has potential health value as a prebiotic fermentable fiber.\nAs a prebiotic fermentable fiber, inulin is metabolized by gut flora to yield short-chain fatty acids (see below), which increase absorption of calcium, magnesium, and iron.\nThe primary disadvantage of inulin is its fermentation within the intestinal tract, possibly causing flatulence and digestive distress at doses higher than 15 grams/day in most people. Individuals with digestive diseases have benefited from removing fructose and inulin from their diet. While clinical studies have shown changes in the microbiota at lower levels of inulin intake, higher intake amounts may be needed to achieve effects on body weight.\nVegetable gums.\nVegetable gum fiber supplements are relatively new to the market. Often sold as a powder, vegetable gum fibers dissolve easily with no aftertaste. In preliminary clinical trials, they have proven effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Examples of vegetable gum fibers are guar gum and gum arabic.\nActivity in the gut.\nMany molecules that are considered to be \"dietary fiber\" are so because humans lack the necessary enzymes to split the glycosidic bond and they reach the large intestine. Many foods contain varying types of dietary fibers, all of which contribute to health in different ways.\nDietary fibers make three primary contributions: bulking, viscosity and fermentation. Different fibers have different effects, suggesting that a variety of dietary fibers contribute to overall health. Some fibers contribute through one primary mechanism. For instance, cellulose and wheat bran provide excellent bulking effects, but are minimally fermented. Alternatively, many dietary fibers can contribute to health through more than one of these mechanisms. For instance, psyllium provides bulking as well as viscosity.\nBulking fibers can be soluble (e.g. psyllium) or insoluble (e.g. cellulose and hemicellulose). They absorb water and can significantly increase stool weight and regularity. Most bulking fibers are not fermented or are minimally fermented throughout the intestinal tract.\nViscous fibers thicken the contents of the intestinal tract and may attenuate the absorption of sugar, reduce sugar response after eating, and reduce lipid absorption (notably shown with cholesterol absorption). Their use in food formulations is often limited to low levels, due to their viscosity and thickening effects. Some viscous fibers may also be partially or fully fermented within the intestinal tract (guar gum, beta-glucan, glucomannan and pectins), but some viscous fibers are minimally or not fermented (modified cellulose such as methylcellulose and psyllium).\nFermentable fibers are consumed by the microbiota within the large intestines, mildly increasing fecal bulk and producing short-chain fatty acids as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities. Resistant starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharide and galactooligosaccharide are dietary fibers which are fully fermented. These include insoluble as well as soluble fibers. This fermentation influences the expression of many genes within the large intestine, which affect digestive function and lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as the immune system, inflammation and more.\nFiber fermentation produces gas (majorly carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane) and short-chain fatty acids. Isolated or purified fermentable fibers are more rapidly fermented in the fore-gut and may result in undesirable gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, indigestion and flatulence).\nDietary fibers can change the nature of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract and can change how other nutrients and chemicals are absorbed through bulking and viscosity. Some types of soluble fibers bind to bile acids in the small intestine, making them less likely to re-enter the body; this in turn lowers cholesterol levels in the blood from the actions of cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol.\nInsoluble fiber is associated with reduced risk of diabetes, but the mechanism by which this is achieved is unknown. One type of insoluble dietary fiber, resistant starch, may increase insulin sensitivity in healthy people, in type 2 diabetics, and in individuals with insulin resistance, possibly contributing to reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.\nNot yet formally proposed as an essential macronutrient, dietary fiber has importance in the diet, with regulatory authorities in many developed countries recommending increases in fiber intake.\nPhysicochemical properties.\nDietary fiber has distinct physicochemical properties. Most semi-solid foods, fiber and fat are a combination of gel matrices which are hydrated or collapsed with microstructural elements, globules, solutions or encapsulating walls. Fresh fruit and vegetables are cellular materials.\nUpper gastrointestinal tract.\nFollowing a meal, the stomach and upper gastrointestinal contents consist of\nMicelles are colloid-sized clusters of molecules which form in conditions as those above, similar to the critical micelle concentration of detergents.\nIn the upper gastrointestinal tract, these compounds consist of bile acids and di- and monoacyl glycerols which solubilize triacylglycerols and cholesterol.\nTwo mechanisms bring nutrients into contact with the epithelium:\nThe multiple physical phases in the intestinal tract slow the rate of absorption compared to that of the suspension solvent alone.\nAdding viscous polysaccharides to carbohydrate meals can reduce post-prandial blood glucose concentrations. Wheat and maize but not oats modify glucose absorption, the rate being dependent upon the particle size. The reduction in absorption rate with guar gum may be due to the increased resistance by viscous solutions to the convective flows created by intestinal contractions.\nDietary fiber interacts with pancreatic and enteric enzymes and their substrates. Human pancreatic enzyme activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources. Fiber may affect amylase activity and hence the rate of hydrolysis of starch. The more viscous polysaccharides extend the mouth-to-cecum transit time; guar, tragacanth and pectin being slower than wheat bran.\nColon.\nThe colon may be regarded as two organs,\nThe presence of bacteria in the colon produces an 'organ' of intense, mainly reductive, metabolic activity, whereas the liver is oxidative.\nThe substrates utilized by the cecum have either passed along the entire intestine or are biliary excretion products.\nThe effects of dietary fiber in the colon are on\nEnlargement of the cecum is a common finding when some dietary fibers are fed and this is now believed to be normal physiological adjustment. Such an increase may be due to a number of factors, prolonged cecal residence of the fiber, increased bacterial mass, or increased bacterial end-products.\nSome non-absorbed carbohydrates, e.g. pectin, gum arabic, oligosaccharides and resistant starch, are fermented to short-chain fatty acids (chiefly acetic, propionic and n-butyric), and carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Almost all of these short-chain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon. This means that fecal short-chain fatty acid estimations do not reflect cecal and colonic fermentation, only the efficiency of absorption, the ability of the fiber residue to sequestrate short-chain fatty acids, and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon, which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted.\nThe production of short-chain fatty acids has several possible actions on the gut mucosa. All of the short-chain fatty acids are readily absorbed by the colonic mucosa, but only acetic acid reaches the systemic circulation in appreciable amounts. Butyric acid appears to be used as a fuel by the colonic mucosa as the preferred energy source for colonic cells.\nCholesterol metabolism.\nDietary fiber may act on each phase of ingestion, digestion, absorption and excretion to affect cholesterol metabolism, such as the following:\nOne action of some fibers is to reduce the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum and hence the amount and type of bile acid and fats reaching the colon. A reduction in the reabsorption of bile acid from the ileum has several direct effects.\nThe fibers that are most effective in influencing sterol metabolism (e.g. pectin) are fermented in the colon. It is therefore unlikely that the reduction in body cholesterol is due to adsorption to this fermented fiber in the colon.\nFecal weight.\nFeces consist of a plasticine-like material, made up of water, bacteria, lipids, sterols, mucus and fiber.\nWater is distributed in the colon in three ways:\nFecal weight is dictated by:\nEffects of fiber intake.\nPreliminary research indicates that fiber may affect health by different mechanisms.\nEffects of fiber include:\nFiber does not bind to minerals and vitamins and therefore does not restrict their absorption, but rather evidence exists that fermentable fiber sources improve absorption of minerals, especially calcium.\nResearch.\nAs of 2019, preliminary clinical research on the potential health effects of a regular high-fiber diet included studies on the risk of several cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and type II diabetes.\nHigh-fiber intake is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, colon cancer and lower mortality.\nDietary recommendations.\nEuropean Union.\nAccording to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens, which deals with the establishment of Dietary Reference Values for carbohydrates and dietary fibre, \"based on the available evidence on bowel function, the Panel considers dietary fibre intakes of 25 g per day to be adequate for normal laxation in adults\".\nUnited States.\nCurrent recommendations from the United States National Academy of Medicine (NAM) (formerly Institute of Medicine) of the National Academy of Sciences state that for Adequate Intake, adult men ages 19\u201350 consume 38 grams of dietary fiber per day, men 51 and older 30 grams, women ages 19\u201350 to consume 25 grams per day, women 51 and older 21 grams. These are based on three studies observing that people in the highest quintile of fiber intake consumed a median of 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 Calories and had the lowest risk of coronary heart disease, especially for those who ate more cereal fiber.\nThe U.S. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) reiterates the recommendations of the NAM. A 1995 research team's recommendation for children is that intake should equal age in years plus 5 g/day (e.g., a 4-year-old should consume 9 g/day). The NAM's current recommendation for children is 19 g/day for age 1\u20133 years and 25 g/day for age 4\u20138 years. No guidelines have yet been established for the elderly or very ill. Patients with current constipation, vomiting, and abdominal pain should see a physician. Certain bulking agents are not commonly recommended with the prescription of opioids because the slow transit time mixed with larger stools may lead to severe constipation, pain, or obstruction.\nOn average, North Americans consume less than 50% of the dietary fiber levels recommended for good health. In the preferred food choices of today's youth, this value may be as low as 20%, a factor considered by experts as contributing to the obesity levels seen in many developed countries. Recognizing the growing scientific evidence for physiological benefits of increased fiber intake, regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have given approvals to food products making health claims for fiber. The FDA classifies which ingredients qualify as being \"fiber\", and requires for product labeling that a physiological benefit is gained by adding the fiber ingredient. As of 2008, the FDA approved health claims for qualified fiber products to display labeling that regular consumption may reduce blood cholesterol levels \u2013 which can lower the risk of coronary heart disease \u2013 and also reduce the risk of some types of cancer.\nViscous fiber sources gaining FDA approval are:\nOther examples of bulking fiber sources used in functional foods and supplements include cellulose, guar gum and xanthan gum. Other examples of fermentable fiber sources (from plant foods or biotechnology) used in functional foods and supplements include resistant starch, inulin, fructans, fructooligo saccharides, oligo- or polysaccharides, and resistant dextrins, which may be partially or fully fermented.\nConsistent intake of fermentable fiber may reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Insufficient fiber in the diet can lead to constipation.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn 2018, the British Nutrition Foundation issued a statement to define dietary fiber more concisely and list the potential health benefits established to date, while increasing its recommended daily minimum intake to 30 grams for healthy adults.\nThe use of certain analytical methods to quantify dietary fiber by nature of its indigestion ability results in many other indigestible components being isolated along with the carbohydrate components of dietary fiber. These components include resistant starches and oligosaccharides along with other substances that exist within the plant cell structure and contribute to the material that passes through the digestive tract. Such components are likely to have physiological effects.\nDiets naturally high in fiber can be considered to bring about several main physiological consequences:\nFiber is defined by its physiological impact, with many heterogenous types of fibers. Some fibers may primarily impact one of these benefits (i.e., cellulose increases fecal bulking and prevents constipation), but many fibers impact more than one of these benefits (i.e., resistant starch increases bulking, increases colonic fermentation, positively modulates colonic microflora and increases satiety and insulin sensitivity). The beneficial effects of high fiber diets are the summation of the effects of the different types of fiber present in the diet and also other components of such diets.\nDefining fiber physiologically allows recognition of indigestible carbohydrates with structures and physiological properties similar to those of naturally occurring dietary fibers.\nFermentation.\nThe Cereals &amp; Grains Association has defined soluble fiber this way:\n\"the edible parts of plants or similar carbohydrates resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine.\"\nIn this definition, \"edible parts of plants\" indicates that some parts of a plant that are eaten\u2014skin, pulp, seeds, stems, leaves, roots\u2014contain fiber. Both insoluble and soluble sources are in those plant components. \"Carbohydrates\" refers to complex carbohydrates, such as long-chained sugars also called starch, oligosaccharides, or polysaccharides, which are sources of soluble fermentable fiber. \"Resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine\" refers to compounds that are not digested by gastric acid and digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine, preventing the digesting animal from utilizing the compounds for energy. A food resistant to this process is undigested, as insoluble and soluble fibers are. They pass to the large intestine only affected by their absorption of water (insoluble fiber) or dissolution in water (soluble fiber). \"Complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine\" describes the digestive processes of the large intestine, which comprises a segment called the colon within which additional nutrient absorption occurs through the process of fermentation. Fermentation occurs through the action of colonic bacteria on the food mass, producing gases and short-chain fatty acids. These short-chain fatty acids have been shown to have significant health properties. They include butyric, acetic (ethanoic), propionic, and valeric acids.\nAs an example of fermentation, shorter-chain carbohydrates (a type of fiber found in legumes) cannot be digested, but are changed via fermentation in the colon into short-chain fatty acids and gases (which are typically expelled as flatulence).\nAccording to a 2002 journal article,\nfiber compounds with partial or low fermentability include:\nfiber compounds with high fermentability include:\nShort-chain fatty acids.\nWhen fermentable fiber is fermented, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced. SCFAs are involved in numerous physiological processes promoting health, including:\nSCFAs that are absorbed by the colonic mucosa pass through the colonic wall into the portal circulation (supplying the liver), and the liver transports them into the general circulatory system.\nOverall, SCFAs affect major regulatory systems, such as blood glucose and lipid levels, the colonic environment, and intestinal immune functions.\nThe major SCFAs in humans are butyrate, propionate, and acetate, where butyrate is the major energy source for colonocytes, propionate is destined for uptake by the liver, and acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral tissues.\nFDA-approved health claims.\nThe FDA allows manufacturers of foods containing 1.7 g per serving of psyllium husk soluble fiber or 0.75 g of oat or barley soluble fiber as beta-glucans to claim that regular consumption may reduce the risk of heart disease.\nThe FDA statement template for making this claim is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEligible sources of soluble fiber providing beta-glucan include:\nThe allowed label may state that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain of the above foods \"may\" or \"might\" reduce the risk of heart disease.\nAs discussed in FDA regulation 21 CFR 101.81, the daily dietary intake levels of soluble fiber from sources listed above associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease are:\nSoluble fiber from consuming grains is included in other allowed health claims for lowering risk of some types of cancer and heart disease by consuming fruit and vegetables (21 CFR 101.76, 101.77, and 101.78).\nIn December 2016, the FDA approved a qualified health claim that consuming resistant starch from high-amylose corn may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes due to its effect of increasing insulin sensitivity. The allowed claim specified: \"High-amylose maize resistant starch may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence for this claim.\" In 2018, the FDA released further guidance on the labeling of isolated or synthetic dietary fiber to clarify how different types of dietary fiber should be classified.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66555", "revid": "47653411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66555", "title": "Political status of Taiwan", "text": "Dispute over sovereignty and independence of Taiwan\nThe political status of Taiwan is a longstanding geopolitical subject focusing on the sovereignty of the island of Taiwan and its associated islands. The issue has been in dispute since the alleged retrocession of Taiwan from the Empire of Japan to the Republic of China (ROC) in 1945, and the ROC government\u2019s retreat from mainland China to Taiwan as the result of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. The Taiwan Area since then has become the major territorial base of the ROC. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-led People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), despite never having control of it, claims Taiwan as an inalienable province. The PRC's claim is based on the theory of state succession, who deems itself as the regime that replaced the pre-1949 ROC, and denies the existing sovereignty of the ROC in Taiwan under its one China principle.\nThe ROC governed mainland China from 1912 until 1949, when it lost control of the mainland due to its defeat in the Chinese Civil War by the CCP, who established the PRC that same year, while the effective jurisdiction of the ROC has been limited to Taiwan and its associated islands. Prior to this, Japan\u2019s surrender in 1945 ended its colonial rule over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which were subsequently placed under the administration of the ROC as agreed by the major Allies of World War II. However, post-war agreements did not clearly define sovereignty over these islands due to the ongoing rivalry between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP. The division led to the emergence of two rival governments on opposite sides of the Taiwan Strait, each claiming to be the sole legitimate authority over both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. The PRC and historically the ROC both officially adhere to the principle of \"one China,\" but fundamentally disagree on who is entitled to represent it. This has resulted in what is known as the \"Two Chinas\" scenario, reflecting the unresolved dispute over which government is the legitimate representative of China.\nThe 1991 constitutional amendments and the 1992 Cross-Strait Relations Act marked a pivotal shift, as the ROC ceased actively claiming governance over the mainland, stopped treating the CCP as a rebellious group, and started treating it in practice, as the authority effectively governing mainland China from ROC\u2019s perspective, though the ROC constitution still technically includes the mainland as ROC territory. Within Taiwan, there emerged a major political contention between eventual Chinese unification with a pan-Chinese identity contrasted with formal independence promoting a Taiwanese identity, though moderates supporting the status quo have gained broad appeal in the 21st century. From 2000 to 2008 and since 2016, Democratic Progressive Party-led governments of Taiwan have been more autonomist in orientation and do not regard their governments as seeking to represent China, and affirms its position that Taiwan is already a sovereign country in its own right under the name \"Republic of China\" and not subordinate to the PRC. The PRC has refused to rule out using military force to achieve unification, but it also proposes the \"one country, two systems\" as a model for a peaceful unification, which has been rejected by successive Taiwanese governments.\nThe international status of Taiwan is complex, but largely agreed upon. Since 1949, multiple countries have faced a choice between the PRC and the ROC with regard to establishing formal diplomatic relations and shaping their respective \"One China\" policy. Initially excluded from the United Nations in favor of the ROC, the PRC has gained formal recognition as the only legitimate government of China in 1971, when UN General assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) was passed. Today, the ROC has formal diplomatic relations with only twelve nations but maintains unofficial bilateral ties with other countries through its representative offices, and membership in international organizations as a non-state entity. According to a Lowy Institute tally in January 2025, about 74 percent (142) of the UN member states explicitly endorse the PRC's position that Taiwan as part of China however 23 of those states do not endorse the one-China principle, others merely \"acknowledge\" or \"respect\" rather than \"recognize\" the PRC position. \nBackground.\nPre-WWII.\nTaiwan (excluding Penghu) was first populated by Austronesian people. Chinese people started settling in southern Taiwan by the late 16th century. The island was partially colonized by the Dutch who arrived in 1623. The Dutch colony was ousted by the Kingdom of Tungning, which lasted from 1661 to 1683, and was the first ethnic Han government to rule part of the island of Taiwan. From 1683, the Qing dynasty ruled much of the western plains of the island as a prefecture and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures, Taiwan and Taipeh. In 1887 the island was made into a separate province to speed up development in this region. In the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan and Penghu were ceded by the Qing dynasty to Japan in 1895 under the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The Qing dynasty fell in 1912, leaving warlords to compete for power and influence in China. The country became more unified during the Nanjing decade, and growing calls to push back against Japanese aggression led to the formation of the Second United Front before the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nROC leaders such as Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek had expressed support for Korea's, Vietnam's, and Taiwan's independence from Japan. \nEarly CCP position on Taiwan.\nAcademics Frank S. T. Hsiao and Lawrence R. Sullivan state that the early Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed Taiwanese at that time as a separate \"minzu\", a term that can refer to people, nation, race, or ethnic group. They theorize that being Chinese hinged on belonging to the same culture, but by then Taiwan had already undergone Japanization. In a 1937 interview with Edgar Snow, Mao Zedong stated \"we will extend them (the Koreans) our enthusiastic help in their struggle for independence. The same thing applies for Taiwan.\" The academics state that the CCP's stance might have been intended as a temporary measure to build a coalition against Japan, which had colonized both Korea and Taiwan.\nWWII.\nIn 1943 Chiang's Nationalists argued that after the end of the war, Taiwan should be restored to the ROC. The CCP followed suit and considered Taiwan an integral part of China. Representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom agreed with Chiang at the Cairo Conference in November, resulting in the Cairo Declaration. That pledge was confirmed at the Potsdam Conference in 1945.\nPost-WWII.\nIn 1945 Chinese Nationalists accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces in Taiwan on behalf of the Allied powers, ending 50 years of Japanese rule. Confident about their future prospects, they declared Taiwan a province of China again on 26 October 1945. However the final legal dispensation awaited a peace treaty and formal ratification.\nIn 1949, Mao Zedong's forces defeated Chiang Kai-shek's ROC forces in the Chinese Civil War, thus taking control of mainland China and founding the PRC. Chiang Kai-shek and his KMT government fled to Taiwan, which was still under ROC control (as the CCP did not have a navy at that time). Tensions often soared in the following decades. The PRC shelled offshore islands held by Taiwan in the 1950s, and the ROC for a number of years harbored ambitions of recovering the mainland from the CCP. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the United Nations and most non-Communist nations still recognized the ROC as the sole government of China. Non-Communist nations referred to the CCP-controlled mainland as \"Red China\" during this time.\nIn 1971, the UN General Assembly voted to move the \"China\" United Nations seat from the ROC to the PRC. The United States recognized the KMT government in Taiwan (ROC) as the legitimate representative of all China until 1979. And the ROC itself claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of all China until 1988. As of the present, most nations have switched their official diplomatic recognition of \"China\" to the PRC, though some of these nations have avoided clarifying what territories are meant by \"China\" in order to associate with both the PRC and ROC. These countries use vague terms such as \"respects\", \"acknowledge\", \"understand\", or \"take note of\" in regards to the PRC's claim over Taiwan, rather than officially \"recognizing\" the claim. From 1988 onwards the Government of Taiwan turned to a checkbook diplomacy promising economic support in return of diplomatic recognition. Until 1995, Taiwan was able to establish diplomatic ties with 29 countries. However this policy was stalled by the PRC as it suspended trade with any country that held diplomatic ties with Taiwan.\nHistorical overview.\nEnd of Japanese rule.\nIn 1942, after the United States entered the war against Japan and on the side of China, the Chinese government under the Kuomintang renounced all treaties signed with Japan before that date and made Taiwan's return to China (as with Manchuria, ruled as the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo) one of the wartime objectives. In the Cairo Declaration of 1943, the Allied Powers declared the return of Taiwan (including the Pescadores) to the Republic of China as one of several Allied demands. The Cairo Declaration was never signed or ratified. Both of the US and the UK considered it not legally binding. The ROC, on the other hand, asserts that it is legally binding and lists later treaties and documents that \"reaffirmed\" the Cairo Declaration as legally binding.\nIn 1945, Japan unconditionally surrendered with the signing of the instrument of surrender and ended its rule in Taiwan as the territory was put under the administrative control of the Republic of China government in 1945 by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The Office of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers ordered Japanese forces in China and Taiwan to surrender to Chiang Kai-shek, who would act as a representative of the Allied Powers. On 25 October 1945, Governor-General Rikichi And\u014d handed over the administration of Taiwan and the Penghu islands to the head of the Taiwan Investigation Commission, Chen Yi. On 26 October, the government of the Republic of China declared that Taiwan had become a province of China. The Allied Powers, on the other hand, did not recognize the unilateral declaration of annexation of Taiwan made by the government of the Republic of China.\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of San Francisco Peace Treaty, the Japanese formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952. At the date when the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into force, the political status of Taiwan and Penghu Islands was still uncertain. The Republic of China and Japan signed the Treaty of Taipei on 28 April 1952, and the treaty came into force on 5 August, which is considered by some as giving a legal support to the Republic of China's claim to Taiwan as \"de jure\" territory. The treaty stipulates that all treaties, conventions, and agreements between China and Japan prior to 9 December 1941 were null and void, which according to Hungdah Chiu, abolishes the Treaty of Shimonoseki ceding Taiwan to Japan. The interpretation of Taiwan becoming the Republic of China's '\"de jure\" territory is supported by several Japanese court decisions such as the 1956 \"Japan v. Lai Chin Jung\" case, which stated that Taiwan and the Penghu islands came to belong to the ROC on the date the Treaty of Taipei came into force. Nevertheless, the official position of the Government of Japan is that Japan did not in the Treaty of Taipei express that Taiwan and Penghu belong to the Republic of China, that the Treaty of Taipei could not make any disposition which is in violation of Japan's renouncing Taiwan and Penghu in San Francisco Peace Treaty, and that the status of Taiwan and Penghu remain to be determined by the Allied Powers in the future.\nWriting in the \"American Journal of International Law\", professors Jonathan I. Charney and J. R. V. Prescott argued that \"none of the post\u2013World War II peace treaties explicitly ceded sovereignty over the covered territories to any specific state or government.\" The Cairo Conference from 22\u201326 November 1943 in Cairo, Egypt was held to address the Allied position against Japan during World War II, and to make decisions about postwar Asia. One of the three main clauses of the Cairo Declaration was that \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and The Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China\". According to Taiwan Civil Society quoting the Taiwan Documents Project, the document was merely a statement of intent or non-binding declaration, for possible reference used for those who would draft the post-war peace treaty and that as a press release it was without force of law to transfer sovereignty from Taiwan to the Republic of China. Additional rationale to support this claim is that the Act of Surrender, and SCAP General Order no. 1, authorized the surrender of Japanese forces, not Japanese territories.\nIn 1952, Winston Churchill said that Taiwan was not under Chinese sovereignty and the Chinese Nationalists did not represent the Chinese state, but that Taiwan was entrusted to the Chinese Nationalists as a military occupation. Churchill called the Cairo Declaration outdated in 1955. The legality of the Cairo Declaration was not recognized by the deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom, Anthony Eden, in 1955, who said there was a difference of opinion on which Chinese authority to hand it over to. In 1954, the United States denied that the sovereignty of Taiwan and the Penghu islands had been settled by any treaties, although it acknowledged that the Republic of China effectively controlled Taiwan and Penghu. In the 1960 \"Sheng v. Rogers\" case, it was stated that, in the view of the U.S. State Department, no agreement has purported to transfer the sovereignty of Taiwan to the ROC, though it accepted the exercise of Chinese authority over Taiwan and recognized the Government of the Republic of China as the legal government of China at the time.\nThe position of the US stated in the Department of State Bulletin in 1958 is that any seizure of Taiwan by the PRC \"constitutes an attempt to seize by force territory which does not belong to it\" because the Allied Powers had yet to come to a decision on the status of Taiwan. According to Vincent Wei-Cheng Wang, a minority of scholars and politicians have argued that the international status of Taiwan is still undecided, and that this has been used as an argument against the People's Republic of China's claim over Taiwan. They point to President Truman's statement on the pending status of Taiwan in 1950, the lack of specificity on whom the title of Taiwan was transferred to in the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty, and the absence of explicit provisions on the return of Taiwan to China in the 1952 Treaty of Taipei. However Wang notes that this is a weak argument, citing 2 Lassa Oppenheimer, International Law, under the principle of effective occupation and control, if nothing is stipulated on conquered territory in the peace treaty, the possessor may annex it. Still, the notion that a possessor may annex a conquered territory despite the peace treaty not stipulating so, was a means of territorial transfer recognized by classical international law, and its legality in recent years is either not recognized or disputed. According to Jian-De Shen, a Taiwanese independence activist, applying such a notion on the Republic of China's territorial claim for Taiwan is invalid because the conqueror of World War II is the whole body of the Allied Powers rather than the Republic of China alone. The Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan is supported by some politicians and jurists to this day, such as the Government of the United States and the Japanese diplomatic circle.\nSince 1945: post-World War II status.\n1947: 228 Incident.\nWhen the 228 Incident erupted on 28 February 1947, the U.S. Consulate-General in Taipei prepared a report in early March, calling for an immediate intervention in the name of the U.S. or the United Nations. Based on the argument that the Japanese surrender did not formally transfer sovereignty, Taiwan was still legally part of Japan and occupied by the United States (with administrative authority for the occupation delegated to the Chinese Nationalists), and a direct intervention was appropriate for a territory with such status. This proposed intervention, however, was rejected by the U.S. State Department. In a news report on the aftermath of the \"228 Incident\", some Taiwanese residents were reported to be talking of appealing to the United Nations to put the island under an international mandate since China's possession of Taiwan had not been formalized by any international treaties by that time, and the island was therefore still under belligerent occupation.\nThey later made a demand for a treaty role to be represented at the forthcoming peace conference in Japan, in the hope of requesting a plebiscite to determine the island's political future.\n1950\u20131953: Korean War and U.S. intervention.\nAt the start of 1950, U.S. President Harry S. Truman appeared to accept the idea that sovereignty over Taiwan was already settled when the United States Department of State stated that \"In keeping with these [Cairo and Potsdam] declarations, Formosa was surrendered to Generalissimo Chiang-Kai Shek, and for the past four years, the United States and Other Allied Powers have accepted the exercise of Chinese authority over the Island.\"\nHowever, after the outbreak of the Korean War, Truman decided to \"neutralize\" Taiwan, claiming that it could otherwise trigger another world war. In June 1950, President Truman, who had previously given only passive support to Chiang Kai-shek and was prepared to see Taiwan fall into the hands of the CCP, vowed to stop the spread of communism and sent the U.S. Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent the PRC from attacking Taiwan, but also to prevent the ROC from attacking mainland China. He then declared that \"the determination of the future status of Formosa must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations.\" President Truman later reaffirmed the position \"that all questions affecting Formosa be settled by peaceful means as envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations\" in his special message to Congress in July 1950. The PRC denounced his moves as flagrant interference in the internal affairs of China.\nOn 8 September 1950, President Truman ordered John Foster Dulles, then Foreign Policy Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State, to carry out his decision on \"neutralizing\" Taiwan in drafting the Treaty of Peace with Japan (San Francisco Peace Treaty) of 1951. According to George H. Kerr's memoir \"Formosa Betrayed\", Dulles devised a plan whereby Japan would first merely renounce its sovereignty over Taiwan without a recipient country to allow the sovereignty over Taiwan to be determined together by the United States, the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and the Republic of China on behalf of other nations on the peace treaty. The question of Taiwan would be taken into the United Nations (of which the ROC was still part) if these four parties could not reach an agreement within one year.\n1952: Treaty of Peace with Japan (San Francisco).\nWhen Japan regained sovereignty over itself in 1952 with the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace with Japan (San Francisco Peace Treaty) with 48 nations, Japan renounced all claims and titles over Taiwan and the Pescadores. Some claim that Japanese sovereignty only terminated at that point. Notably absent at the peace conference was the ROC which was expelled from mainland China in December 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War and had retreated to Taiwan. The PRC, which was proclaimed on 1 October 1949, was also not invited. The lack of invitation was probably due to the dispute over which government was the legitimate government of China (which both governments claimed to be); however, Cold War considerations might have played a part as well. Some major governments represented in the San Francisco Conference, such as the UK and Soviet Union, had already established relations with the PRC, while others, such as the U.S. and Japan, still held relations with the ROC.\nThe UK at that time stated for the record that the San Francisco Peace Treaty \"itself does not determine the future of these islands,\" and therefore, the UK, along with Australia and New Zealand, was happy to sign the peace treaty. One of the major reasons that the delegate from the Soviet Union gave for not signing the treaty was that: \"The draft contains only a reference to the renunciation by Japan of its rights to these territories [Taiwan] but intentionally omits any mention of the further fate of these territories.\"\nArticle 25 of this treaty officially stipulated that only the Allied Powers defined in the treaty could benefit from this treaty. China was not listed as one of the Allied Powers; however, article 21 still provided limited benefits from Articles 10 and 14(a)2 for China. Japan's cession of Taiwan is unusual in that no recipient of Taiwan was stated as part of Dulles's plan of \"neutralizing\" Taiwan. The ROC protested its lack of invitation to the San Francisco Peace conference, to no avail.\n1952: Treaty of Taipei.\nSubsequently, the Treaty of Taipei was concluded between the ROC and Japan on 28 April 1952 (effective 5 August), where Japan essentially re-affirmed the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty and formalized the peace between the ROC and Japan. It also nullified all previous treaties made between China and Japan. Article 10 of the treaty specifies:\"For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).\" However, the ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs George Kung-ch'ao Yeh told the Legislative Yuan after signing the treaty that: \"The delicate international situation makes it that they [Taiwan and Penghu] do not belong to us. Under present circumstances, Japan has no right to transfer [Taiwan] to us; nor can we accept such a transfer from Japan even if she so wishes.\" In July 1971, the U.S. State Department's position was, and remains: \"As Taiwan and the Pescadores are not covered by any existing international disposition, sovereignty over the area is an unsettled question subject to future international resolution.\"\nOfficial positions.\nPeople's Republic of China.\nPer its one-China principle, the official position of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is that it is the sole legitimate government representing all of China and that Taiwan an inalienable part of China. The PRC has expressed its preference for peaceful unification under the one country, two systems formula, but refuses to rule out military force. The Chinese constitution states that \"Taiwan is the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China\", while the 2005 Anti-Secession Law authorizes possible military force for unification with Taiwan. \nThe PRC regards Taiwan as having been part of China since an expedition deployed by the Eastern Wu to Yizhou (allegedly claiming to be the present-day Taiwan) in 3rd century instead of the Qing Dynasty\u2019s annexation of Taiwan in 1683. The PRC states that the ROC ceased to be a legitimate government upon the founding of the PRC on 1 October 1949 and that the PRC is the successor of the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China, with the right to rule Taiwan under the succession of states theory. As per the PRC's government and its supporters, believe that any issue involving China's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be decided by all 1.3\u00a0billion Chinese citizens instead of just the 23\u00a0million residents of Taiwan. Furthermore, the PRC interprets the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, which states \"Recognizing that the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations\", as meaning that the PRC is recognized as having the sovereignty of all of China, including Taiwan. Therefore, the PRC believes that it is within its legal rights to extend its jurisdiction over Taiwan by military means.\nIn addition, the position of the PRC is that the ROC does not meet the fourth criterion of the Montevideo Convention, as it is recognized by only \u00a0UN member states and has been denied access to international organizations such as the UN. The PRC points out the fact that the Montevideo Convention was only signed by 19 states at the Seventh International Conference of American States. Thus the authority of the United Nations as well as UN Resolutions, should supersede the Montevideo Convention. However, \"When speaking of statehood, one invariably refers to the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, 60 which, laying down what is now considered a rule of customary international law, states that \"[t]he State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other States.\" Taiwan indeed satisfies all these criteria for statehood.\" Some would argue that Taiwan meets all the requirements of the Montevideo Convention. But to make such an argument, one has to reject China's claim of sovereignty over the territory of the Taiwan island, a claim that has been recognized by most states in the world.\nThe PRC government is unwilling to negotiate with the ROC government under any formulation other than the one China principle, although a more flexible definition of \"one China\" such as found in the 1992 consensus is possible under PRC policy. The PRC government considers the 1992 consensus a temporary measure to set aside sovereignty disputes and enable talks.\nThe PRC government considers perceived violations of the one-China principle or inconsistencies with it, such as supplying the ROC with arms a violation of its rights to territorial integrity. Official PRC media outlets and officials often refer to Taiwan as \"China's Taiwan Province\" or simply \"Taiwan, China\", and pressure international organizations to use the term.\nIn 2021, the China's Taiwan Affairs Office stated that they would not allow pro-Taiwan independence people into China, including Hong Kong and Macau, naming Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang, Legislative Yuan Speaker You Si-kun and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu as people who are \"stubbornly pro-Taiwan independence\".\nRepublic of China (Taiwan).\nThe ROC argues that it maintains all the characteristics of a state and that it was not \"replaced\" or \"succeeded\" by the PRC because it has continued to exist long after the PRC's founding.\nAccording to the Montevideo Convention of 1933, the most cited source for the definition of statehood, a state must possess a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. Some argue that the ROC meets all these criteria. However, to make such an argument, one has to reject the PRC's claim of sovereignty over the territory of the Taiwan island. The PRC requires all other states that establish diplomatic relations with it not to challenge this claim in addition to severing said relations with the ROC. Most states have either officially recognized this claim or carefully worded their agreement ambiguously, such as the United States.\nBoth the original 1912 constitution and the 1923 draft version failed to list Taiwan as a part of the ROC since, at the time, Taiwan was a Japanese territory. It was only in the mid-1930s when both the CCP and KMT realized the future strategic importance of Taiwan that they altered their party positions to make a claim on Taiwan as a part of China. After losing the Civil War against the CCP in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan and continued to maintain that their government represented all of China, i.e. both Taiwan and the mainland.\nThe position of most supporters of Taiwan independence is that the PRC is the government of \"China\" and that Taiwan is not part of China, defining \"China\" as only including Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Regarding the ROC, one ideology within Taiwan's independence regards the ROC as already an independent, sovereign state and seeks to amend the ROC's existing name, constitution, and existing framework to reflect the loss of ROC's mainland territory and transform the ROC into a Taiwan state; while another ideology of Taiwan independence regards the ROC as both a military government that has been administering the Taiwan island as a result of post-war military occupation on behalf of the allies of World War II since 1945, and a Chinese refugee regime currently in exile on Taiwan since 1949, and seeks to eliminate the ROC and establish a new independent Taiwan state.\nThe Democratic Progressive Party states that Taiwan has never been under the jurisdiction of the PRC and that the PRC does not exercise any hold over the 23\u00a0million Taiwanese on the island. On the other hand, the position of most Chinese unification supporters is that the Chinese Civil War is still not over since no peace agreement has ever been signed and that the current status is a state of ceasefire between two belligerents of \"One China\".\nThe position of the Republic of China has been that it is a \"de jure\" sovereign state. \"Republic of China,\" according to the ROC government's definition, extended to both mainland China (Including Hong Kong and Macau) and the island of Taiwan.\nIn 1991, President Lee Teng-hui unofficially claimed that the government would no longer challenge the rule of the CCP in mainland China, although the ROC government under Kuomintang (KMT) rule actively maintained that it was the sole legitimate government of China. The Courts in Taiwan have never accepted President Lee's statement, primarily due to the reason that the (now defunct) National Assembly never officially changed the acclaimed national borders. Notably, the People's Republic of China claims that changing the national borders would be \"a precursor to Taiwan independence\". The task of changing the national borders now requires a constitutional amendment passed by the Legislative Yuan and ratified by a majority of all eligible ROC voters, which the PRC has implied would constitute grounds for military attack.\nOn the other hand, though the constitution of the Republic of China promulgated in 1946 does not state exactly what territory it includes, the draft of the constitution of 1925 did individually list the provinces of the Republic of China and Taiwan was not among them, since Taiwan was arguably \"de jure\" part of Japan as the result of the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895. The constitution also stipulated in Article I.4, that \"the territory of the ROC is the original territory governed by it; unless authorized by the National Assembly, it cannot be altered.\"\nHowever, in 1946, Sun Fo, son of Sun Yat-Sen and the minister of the Executive Yuan of the ROC, reported to the National Assembly that \"there are two types of territory changes: 1. renouncing territory and 2. annexing new territory. The first example would be the independence of Mongolia, and the second example would be the reclamation of Taiwan. Both would be examples of territory changes.\" Japan renounced all rights to Taiwan in the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951 and the Treaty of Taipei of 1952 without an explicit recipient. While the ROC continuously ruled Taiwan after the government was directed to Taiwan by the General Order No. 1 (1945) to receive Japanese surrender, there has never been a meeting of the ROC National Assembly in making a territory change according to the ROC constitution. The explanatory memorandum to the constitution explained the omission of individually listing the provinces as opposed to the earlier drafts was an act of deliberate ambiguity: as the ROC government does not recognize the validity of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, based on Chiang Kai-shek's Denunciation of the treaty in the late 1930s, hence (according to this argument) the sovereignty of Taiwan was never disposed of by China. A ratification by the ROC National Assembly is, therefore, unnecessary.\nThe have mentioned \"Taiwan Province,\" and the now defunct National Assembly passed constitutional amendments that give the people of the \"Free Area of the Republic of China\", comprising the territories under its current jurisdiction, the sole right, until unification, to exercise the sovereignty of the Republic through elections of the President and the entire Legislature as well as through elections to ratify amendments to the ROC constitution. Also, Chapter I, Article 2 of the ROC constitution states that \"The sovereignty of the Republic of China shall reside in the whole body of citizens.\" This suggests that the constitution implicitly admits that the sovereignty of the ROC is limited to the areas that it controls, even if there is no constitutional amendment that explicitly spells out the ROC's borders.\nIn 1999, ROC President Lee Teng-hui proposed a two-state theory (\u5169\u570b\u8ad6) in which both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China would acknowledge that they are two separate countries with a special diplomatic, cultural, and historic relationship. This, however, drew an angry reaction from the PRC who believed that Lee was covertly supporting Taiwan independence.\nPresident Chen Shui-bian (2000\u00a0\u2013 May 2008) fully supported the idea that the \"Republic of China is an independent, sovereign country\" but held the view that the Republic of China is Taiwan and Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China. This is suggested in his Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China. Due to the necessity of avoiding war with the PRC, however, President Chen had refrained from formally declaring Taiwan's independence. Government publications have implied that Taiwan refers to the ROC, and \"China\" refers to the PRC. After becoming chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party in July 2002, Chen appeared to move further than Lee's special two-state theory and in early August 2002, by putting forward the \"one country on each side\" concept, he stated that Taiwan may \"go on its own Taiwanese road\" and that \"it is clear that the two sides of the straits are separate countries.\" These statements essentially eliminate any \"special\" factors in the relations and were strongly criticized by opposition parties in Taiwan. President Chen has repeatedly refused to endorse the One China Principle or the more \"flexible\" 1992 Consensus the PRC demands as a precursor to negotiations with the PRC. During Chen's presidency, there had not been any successful attempts to restart negotiations on a semi-official level.\nIn the 2008 ROC elections, the people delivered KMT's Ma Ying-jeou with an election win as well as a sizable majority in the legislature. President Ma, throughout his election campaign, maintained that he would accept the 1992 consensus and promote better relations with the PRC. In respect of Taiwan's political status, his policy was 1. he would not negotiate with the PRC on the subject of unification during his term; 2. he would never declare Taiwan's independence; and 3. he would not provoke the PRC into attacking Taiwan. He officially accepted the 1992 Consensus in his inauguration speech, which resulted in direct semi-official talks with the PRC, and this later led to the commencement of weekend direct charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan. President Ma also interprets the cross-strait relations as \"special\", \"but not that between two nations\". He later stated that mainland China is part of the territory of the Republic of China, and laws relating to international relations are not applicable to the relations between mainland China and Taiwan, as they are parts of a state.\nIn 2016, Tsai Ing-Wen of the DPP won a landslide victory in the presidential election and was later re-elected for the second term in 2020. She refused to agree that Taiwan is part of China and also rejected the one country, two systems model proposed by the PRC. Instead, she said that \"Republic of China, Taiwan\" already is an independent country and that Beijing must \"face reality\".\nOther countries and international organizations.\nBecause of anti-communist sentiment at the start of the Cold War, the Republic of China was initially recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations. On 9 January 1950, the Israeli government extended recognition to the People's Republic of China. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505, passed on 1 February 1952, considered the CCP to be rebels against the Republic of China.\nHowever, the 1970s saw a switch in diplomatic recognition from the ROC to the PRC. On 25 October 1971, Resolution 2758 was passed by the UN General Assembly, which \"decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\" Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to rejoin the UN, no longer to represent all of China but just the people of the territories it governs, have not made it past committee, largely due to diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC, which claims Resolution 2758 has settled the matter. The resolution was cited by the General Assembly as acknowledging that Taiwan is part of China in 2007, when the \"Taiwan Province of China\" was rejected to join the UN under the name \"Taiwan\". \nThe PRC refuses to maintain diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the ROC, but does not object to nations conducting economic, cultural, and other such exchanges with Taiwan that do not imply diplomatic relations. Therefore, multiple nations that have diplomatic relations with Beijing maintain quasi-diplomatic offices in Taipei. Similarly, the government in Taiwan maintains quasi-diplomatic offices in most nations under various names, most commonly as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office.\nThe United States is one of the main allies of Taiwan and since the Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, the United States has sold arms and provided military training to Taiwan's Republic of China Armed Forces. This situation continues to be a point of contention for the People's Republic of China, which considers US involvement disruptive to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration announced its intention to sell $6.4\u00a0billion worth of military hardware to Taiwan. As a consequence, China threatened the United States with economic sanctions and warned that their cooperation on international and regional issues could suffer. The official position of the United States is that China is expected to \"use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan\" and that Taiwan is to \"exercise prudence in managing all aspects of Cross-Strait relations.\" Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements \"that would unilaterally alter Taiwan's status.\" The United States maintains the American Institute in Taiwan.\nThe United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, India, Pakistan, and Canada have in some form adopted the One China policy, under which the People's Republic of China is theoretically the sole legitimate government of China. However, the United States and Japan \"acknowledge\" rather than \"recognize\" the PRC position that Taiwan is part of China. In the case of the United Kingdom and Canada, bilateral written agreements state that the two respective parties \"take note\" of Beijing's position but do not use the word \"support\". The UK government's position that \"the future of Taiwan be decided peacefully by the peoples of both sides of the Strait\" has been stated several times. Despite the PRC's claim that the United States opposes Taiwanese independence, the United States takes advantage of the subtle difference between \"oppose\" and \"does not support\". In fact, a substantial majority of the statements Washington has made say that it \"does not support Taiwan independence\" instead of saying that it \"opposes\" independence. Thus, the US currently does not take a position on the political outcome, except for one explicit condition that there be a peaceful resolution to the differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The United States bi-partisan position is that it does not \"recognize\" the PRC's claim over Taiwan, and considers Taiwan's status as unsettled.\nThe ROC maintains formal diplomatic relations with \u00a0UN member states, mostly in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Oceania. Additionally, the Holy See also recognizes the ROC, a largely non-Christian/Catholic state, due partly to the Catholic Church's traditional opposition to communism and also to protest what it sees as the PRC's suppression of the Catholic faith in mainland China. However, Vatican diplomats were engaged in talks with PRC politicians at the time of Pope John Paul II's death, with a view towards improving relations between the two countries. When asked, one Vatican diplomat suggested that relations with Taiwan might prove \"expendable\" should PRC be willing to engage in positive diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Under Pope Benedict XVI, the Vatican and PRC have shown greater interest in establishing ties, including the appointment of pro-Vatican bishops and the Pope canceling a planned visit from the 14th Dalai Lama.\nAs of at least 2024, the trend in East Asian governments is not to generally discuss the issue of Taiwan's political status.183 Academics Xinru Ma and David C. Kang write that when East Asian countries do, \"it is often to caution the United States from getting too far ahead of where even the Taiwanese themselves are.\"183\nAs of January 2023, fifty-one countries recognize Taiwan as a part of China: Albania, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Bahamas, Belarus, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Costa Rica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Estonia, France, Georgia, Guinea-Bissau, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lesotho, Lithuania, the Maldives, Moldova, Montenegro, Namibia, Nicaragua, Niger, Niue, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and Vietnam. Other countries have not committed to or have not made public statements indicating a position on the question.\nLegal arguments.\nThe proclamation of Taiwan Retrocession Day on 25 October 1945 by the ROC (when the PRC had not yet been founded) was entirely uncontested. Had another party been sovereign over Taiwan, that party would have had a period of years in which to protest, and its failure to do so represents cession of rights in the manner of prescription. The lack of protest by any non-Chinese government persists to this day, further strengthening this argument.\nEven if the San Francisco Peace Treaty were determinative, it should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Potsdam and Cairo Declarations. Therefore, sovereignty would still have been transferred to China. Applying the principle of \"uti possidetis\" with regard to the Treaty of Taipei would grant Taiwan's sovereignty to the ROC, as it is undisputed that at the coming into force of the treaty, the ROC controlled Taiwan. Taiwan was \"terra derelicta\" and, after 1951, became Chinese territory through appropriation. According to barrister D. P. O'Connell, this theory of acquisition by occupation is more inherently consistent than several other theories on Taiwan's status.\nThe San Francisco Peace Treaty's omission of \"China\" as a participant was not an accident of history, but reflected the status that the Republic of China had failed to maintain its original position as the \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" government of the \"whole China\". By fleeing to Taiwan island in December 1949, the ROC government has then arguably become a government in exile.\nMedia coverage.\nMany political leaders who have maintained some form of the One-China Policy have committed slips of the tongue in referring to Taiwan as a country or as the Republic of China. United States presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush have been known to have referred to Taiwan as a country during their terms of office. Although near the end of his term as U.S. Secretary of State, Colin Powell said that Taiwan is not a state, he referred to Taiwan as the Republic of China twice during a testimony to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 9 March 2001. In the People's Republic of China Premier Zhu Rongji's farewell speech to the National People's Congress, Zhu accidentally referred to Mainland China and Taiwan as two countries. Zhu says in his speech at MIT University on 15 April 1999, \"These raw materials and the components are mainly imported from Japan, [Korea], Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, while the value-added parts in China is very, very insignificant. That is to say, Chinese exports to the United States actually represent a transfer of the exports to the United States by the above-mentioned countries and the regions that I mentioned.\" There are also those from the PRC who informally refer to Taiwan as a country. South Africa delegates once referred to Taiwan as the \"Republic of Taiwan\" during Lee Teng-hui's term as President of the ROC. In 2002, Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, referred to Taiwan as a country. Most recently, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated in a local Chinese newspaper in California in July 2005 that Taiwan is \"a sovereign nation\". The People's Republic of China discovered the statement about three months after it was made.\nIn a controversial speech on 4 February 2006, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso called Taiwan a country with high education levels because of previous Japanese colonial rule over the island. One month later, he told a Japanese parliamentary committee that \"[Taiwan's] democracy is considerably matured and liberal economics is deeply ingrained, so it is a law-abiding country. In various ways, it is a country that shares a sense of values with Japan.\" At the same time, he admitted that \"I know there will be a problem with calling [Taiwan] a country\".\nTaiwan was classified as a province of the People's Republic of China in the Apple Maps application in 2013; searches for \"Taiwan\" were changed automatically to \"China Taiwan province\" in Simplified Chinese, prompting the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to demand a correction from Apple.\nOn 24 October 2021, \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" aired an episode about Taiwan after a petition on Change.org in June invited Oliver to discuss Taiwan's complex political situation and its international significance. In the segment, a brief but comprehensive history of Taiwan is provided with notable points such as occupation by the Dutch, Spanish, Manchu-Qing dynasty, and Japanese; path to becoming a prominent Asian democracy; and the strained relation with modern-day China. Oliver also highlighted Taiwan as the birthplace of bubble tea, apologies made by John Cena after referring to Taiwan as a country, and the hesitation of international organizations like the World Health Organization and the Olympics in properly representing Taiwan. He concluded the episode by emphasizing Taiwanese citizens' point of view and their right to determine the country's own future.\nTo avoid controversy, multiple mainstream American media outlets refer to Taiwan as an island or democracy.\nTaiwanese public opinion.\nPublic opinion in Taiwan regarding relations with the PRC is notoriously difficult to gauge, as poll results tend to be extremely sensitive to how the questions are phrased and what options are given, and there is a tendency by all political parties to spin the results to support their point of view.\nAccording to a November 2005 poll from the Mainland Affairs Council, 37.7% of people living in the ROC favor maintaining the status quo until a decision can be made in the future, 18.4% favors maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 14% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual independence, 12% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual unification, 10.3% favors independence as soon as possible, and 2.1% favors unification as soon as possible. According to the same poll, 78.3% are opposed to the \"One Country, Two Systems\" model, which was used for Hong Kong and Macau, while 10.4% is in favor. However, it is essential to consider current events or newly developing positions when determining public opinion in order to maintain accuracy and efficiency, especially when it comes to conducting foreign policy and determining Taiwan's political status and hopeful eventual independence. For example, \"Large jumps in the proportion of independence supporters after China's missile test in mid-1996 (from 13% in February to 21% in March) and Lee Teng-hui's \"special state-to-state\" speech in mid-1999 (from 15% in March to 28% in August) suggest that the cross-Strait tension influenced the Taiwanese to become more independence-minded\". According to a June 2008 poll from a Taiwanese mainstream media TVBS, 58% of people living in Taiwan favor maintaining the status quo, 19% favors independence, and 8% favors unification. According to the same poll, if status quo is not an option and the ones who were surveyed must choose between \"Independence\" or \"Unification\", 65% are in favor of independence while 19% would opt for unification. The same poll also reveals that, in terms of self-identity, when the respondents are not told that a Taiwanese person can also be a Chinese person, 68% of the respondents identify themselves as \"Taiwanese\" while 18% would call themselves \"Chinese\". However, when the respondents are told that duo identity is an option, 45% of the respondents identify themselves as \"Taiwanese only\", 4% of the respondents call themselves \"Chinese only\" while another 45% of the respondents call themselves \"both Taiwanese as well as Chinese\". Furthermore, when it comes to preference in which national identity to be used in international organizations, 54% of people in the survey indicated that they prefer \"Taiwan\", and only 25% of the people voted for \"Chinese Taipei\".\nAccording to an October 2008 poll from the Mainland Affairs Council, on the question of Taiwan's status, 36.17% of respondents favor maintaining the status quo until a decision can be made in the future, 25.53% favors maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 12.49% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual independence, 4.44% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual unification, 14.80% favors independence as soon as possible, and 1.76% favors unification as soon as possible. In the same poll, on the question of the PRC government's attitude towards the ROC government, 64.85% of the respondents consider the PRC government hostile or very hostile, 24.89% consider the PRC government friendly or very friendly, while 10.27% did not express an opinion. On the question of the PRC government's attitude towards the people in Taiwan, 45.98% of the respondents consider the PRC government hostile or very hostile, 39.6% consider the PRC government friendly or very friendly, while 14.43% did not express an opinion.\nIn May 2009, Taiwan's (Republic of China) Department of the Interior published a survey examining whether people in Taiwan see themselves as Taiwanese, Chinese, or both. 64.6% see themselves as Taiwanese, 11.5% as Chinese, 18.1% as both, and 5.8% were unsure.\nAccording to a December 2009 poll from a Taiwanese mainstream media TVBS, if status quo is not an option and the ones who were surveyed must choose between \"Independence\" or \"Unification\", 68% are in favor of independence while 13% would opt for unification.\nA June 2013 poll conducted by DPP showed that 77.6% consider themselves as Taiwanese. On the independence-unification issue, the survey found that 25.9 percent said they support unification, 59 percent support independence, and 10.3 percent prefer the \"status quo.\" When asked whether Taiwan and China are parts of one country, the party said the survey found 78.4 percent disagree, while 15 percent agreed. As for whether Taiwan and China are two districts in one country, 70.6 percent disagree, while 22.8 percent agree, the survey showed. When asked which among four descriptions\u2014\"one country on each side,\" \"a special state-to-state relationship,\" \"one country, two areas,\" and \"two sides are of one country\"\u2014they find the most acceptable, 54.9 percent said \"one country on each side,\" 25.3 percent chose \"a special state-to-state relationship,\" 9.8 percent said \"one country, two areas\", and 2.5 percent favor \"two sides are of one country,\" the survey showed.\nA June 2023 poll conducted by the National Chengchi University showed 62.8% identified as Taiwanese, 2.5% as Chinese, and 30.5% as both. Regarding independence, 32.1% indicated status quo forever, 28.6% wanted to decide later, 21.4% said status quo moving toward independence, and 5.8% said status quo moving toward unification.\nGeopolitical significance.\nThe Taiwan Strait is a vital maritime trade route, handling trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of trade that pass through the sea between mainland China and Taiwan. The economy of Taiwan is also vital to the stability of the global economy, producing over 90 percent of the most cutting-edge semiconductor chips used in smartphones, data centers, and advanced military equipment. Disruptions to the supply of these technologies could wipe trillions of dollars from global GDP. The United States has considered Taiwan as a vital component of its island-chain strategy to prevent PRC influence from extending into the Indo-Pacific, and potentially threatening Guam, Hawaii and the West Coast of the United States. China, on the other hand, views the strategy as a form of containment that seeks to prevent China's rise to a superpower and accuses the U.S. of using Taiwan to overthrow its political system.\nMilitary operations.\nIntermittent clashes between the two sides occurred throughout the 1950s and 1960s, including the First and Second Taiwan Strait crises.\nThird Taiwan Strait crisis.\nIn 1996, the PRC began conducting military exercises near Taiwan, and launched several ballistic missiles over the island. The saber-rattling was done in response to the possible re-election of then President Lee Teng-hui. The United States, under President Clinton, sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region, reportedly sailing them into the Taiwan Strait. The PRC, unable to track the ships' movements, and probably unwilling to escalate the conflict, quickly backed down. The event had little impact on the outcome of the election, since none of Lee's contestants were strong enough to defeat him, but it is widely believed that the PRC's aggressive acts, far from intimidating the Taiwanese population, gave Lee a boost that pushed his share of votes over 50 percent.\nThis was an aggressively serious escalation in response to the Taiwan Strait and the ongoing conflict between China and Taiwan. This hostile reaction by mainland China is the result of China implementing Putnam's Two-level game theory. This theory suggests that the chief negotiator of a state must balance and abide by both international and domestic interests, and in some cases must focus more on domestic interests. In the case of China, \"a serious escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait and raised the specter of war\u2014one that could conceivably draw in the United States. This turn of events is either the result of pressure by hawkish, hardline soldiers on moderate, mild-mannered statesmen for a tougher, more aggressive response to Taiwan, or a strong consensus among both civilian and military leaders in the Politburo.\"\nPRC's conditions on a future military intervention.\nNotwithstanding, the PRC government has issued triggers for an immediate war with Taiwan, most notably via its controversial Anti-Secession Law of 2005. These conditions are:\nIt has been interpreted that these criteria encompass the scenario of Taiwan developing nuclear weapons (\"see main article\" Taiwan and weapons of mass destruction also Timeline of the Republic of China's nuclear program).\nThe third condition has especially caused a stir in Taiwan as the term \"indefinitely\" is open to interpretation. It has also been viewed by some as meaning that preserving the ambiguous status quo is not acceptable to the PRC, although the PRC stated on a number of occasions that there is no explicit timetable for unification.\nConcern over a formal declaration of \"de jure\" Taiwan independence is a strong impetus for the military buildup between Taiwan and mainland China. The former US Bush administration publicly declared that given the status quo, it would not aid Taiwan if it were to declare independence unilaterally.\nAccording to the US Department of Defense report \"Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2011\", the conditions that mainland China has warned that may cause the use of force have varied. They have included \"a formal declaration of Taiwan independence; undefined moves \"toward independence\"; foreign intervention in Taiwan's internal affairs; indefinite delays in the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue on unification; Taiwan's acquisition of nuclear weapons; and, internal unrest on Taiwan. Article 8 of the March 2005 \"Anti-Secession Law\" states Beijing would resort to \"non-peaceful means\" if \"secessionist forces ... cause the fact of Taiwan's secession from China,\" if \"major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession\" occur, or if \"possibilities for peaceful reunification\" are exhausted\".\nBalance of power.\nThe possibility of war, the close geographic proximity of ROC-controlled Taiwan and PRC-controlled mainland China, and the resulting flare-ups that occur every few years, conspire to make this one of the most watched focal points in the Pacific. Both sides have chosen to have a strong naval presence. However, naval strategies between both powers greatly shifted in the 1980s and 1990s, while the ROC assumed a more defensive attitude by building and buying frigates and missile destroyers, and the PRC a more aggressive posture by developing long-range cruise missiles and supersonic surface-to-surface missiles.\nAlthough the People's Liberation Army Air Force is considered large, most of its fleet consists of older generation J-7 fighters (localized MiG-21s and Mig-21BIs), raising doubts over the PLAAF's ability to control Taiwan's airspace in the event of a conflict. Since mid-1990s, PRC has been purchasing, and later localizing, SU-27 based fighters. These Russian fighters, as well as their Chinese J11A variants, are currently over 170 in number, and have increased the effectiveness of PLAAF's Beyond Visual Range (BVR) capabilities. The introduction of 60 new-generation J10A fighters is anticipated to increase the PLAAF's firepower. PRC's acquisition of Russian Su30MKKs further enhanced the PLAAF's air-to-ground support ability. In October 2017, Chinese media reported that Chinese stealth aircraft Chengdu J-20 began production, which gave the PLAAF a significant advantage in air superiority over the ROC Air Force. The ROC's air force, on the other hand, relies on Taiwan's fourth generation fighters, consisting of 150 US-built F-16 Fighting Falcons, approximately 60 French-built Mirage 2000-5s, and approximately 130 locally developed IDFs (Indigenous Defense Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct BVR combat missions with BVR missiles, but the level of technology in mainland Chinese fighters is catching up. Also, the United States Defense Intelligence Agency has reported that few of Taiwan's 400 total fighters are operationally capable.\nIn 2003, the ROC purchased four missile destroyers\u2014the former , and expressed a strong interest in the . But with the growth of the PRC navy and air force, some doubt that the ROC could withstand a determined invasion attempt from mainland China in the future. These concerns have led to a view in certain quarters that Taiwanese independence, if it is to be implemented, should be attempted as early as possible, while the ROC still has the capacity to defend itself in an all-out military conflict. Over the past three decades, estimates of how long the ROC can withstand a full-scale invasion from across the Strait without any outside help have decreased from three months to only six days. Given such estimates, the US Navy has continued practicing \"surging\" its carrier groups, giving it the experience necessary to respond quickly to an attack on Taiwan. The US also collects data on the PRC's military deployments, through the use of spy satellites, for example. Early surveillance may effectively identify PRC's massive military movement, which may imply PRC's preparation for a military assault against Taiwan.\nNaturally, war contingencies are not being planned in a vacuum. In 1979, the United States Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, a law generally interpreted as mandating U.S. defense of Taiwan in the event of an attack from the Chinese Mainland (the Act is applied to Taiwan and Penghu, but not to Kinmen or Matsu, which are usually considered to be part of mainland China). The United States maintains the world's largest permanent fleet in the Pacific Region near Taiwan. The Seventh Fleet, operating primarily out of various bases in Japan, is a powerful naval contingent built upon the world's only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier . Although the stated purpose of the fleet is not Taiwanese defense, it can be safely assumed from past actions that it is one of the reasons why the fleet is stationed in those waters. It is written into the strategy of the United States department of defense within this region that, \"First, we are strengthening our military capacity to ensure the United States can successfully deter conflict and coercion and respond decisively when needed. Second, we are working together with our allies and partners from Northeast Asia to the Indian Ocean to build their capacity to address potential challenges in their waters and across the region. Third, we are leveraging military diplomacy to build greater transparency, reduce the risk of miscalculation or conflict, and promote shared maritime rules of the road.\"\nStarting in 2000, Japan renewed its defense obligations with the US and embarked on a rearmament program, partly in response to fears that Taiwan might be invaded. Some analysts believed that the PRC could launch preemptive strikes on military bases in Japan to deter US and Japanese forces from coming to the ROC's aid. Japanese strategic planners also see an independent Taiwan as vital, not only because the ROC controls valuable shipping routes, but also because its capture by PRC would make Japan more vulnerable. During World War II, the US invaded the Philippines, but another viable target to enable direct attacks on Japan would have been Taiwan (then known as Formosa). However, critics of the preemptive strike theory assert that the PRC would be loath to give Japan and the US such an excuse to intervene.\nThe United States Department of Defense in a 2011 report stated that the primary mission of the PRC military is a possible military conflict with Taiwan, including also possible US military assistance. Although the risk of a crisis in the short-term is low, in the absence of new political developments, Taiwan will likely dominate future military modernization and planning. However, also other priorities are becoming increasingly prominent and possible due to increasing military resources. A number of mainland China's most advanced military systems are stationed in areas opposite Taiwan. The rapid military modernization is continually changing the military balance of power towards mainland China.\nA 2008 report by the RAND Corporation analyzing a theoretical 2020 attack by mainland China on Taiwan suggested that the US would likely not be able to defend Taiwan. Cruise missile developments may enable China to partially or completely destroy or make inoperative US aircraft carriers and bases in the Western Pacific. New Chinese radars will likely be able to detect US stealth aircraft and China is acquiring stealthy and more effective aircraft. The reliability of US beyond-visual-range missiles as a mean to achieve air superiority is questionable and largely unproven.\nIn 2021, Admiral Phillip Davidson said in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that China could take military action on Taiwan some time in the next 6 years. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry later responded stating that Davidson was trying to \"hype up China's military threat.\"\nIn the wake of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 2022 visit to Taiwan, China increased its air and naval crossings of the Taiwan Strait median line, an unofficial understanding between the two sides when relations are good. In 2024 China moved civil aviation routes closer to the line, which is expected to further \"squeeze\" the airspace controlled by Taiwan within 12 nautical miles of its coast.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Broccoli is classified in the Italica cultivar group of the species \"Brassica oleracea\". Broccoli has large flower heads, or florets, usually dark green, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick stalk, which is usually light green. Leaves surround the mass of flower heads. Broccoli resembles cauliflower, a different but closely related cultivar group of the same \"Brassica\" species.\nIt can be eaten either raw or cooked. Broccoli is a particularly rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K. Contents of its characteristic sulfur-containing glucosinolate compounds, isothiocyanates and sulforaphane, are diminished by boiling but are better preserved by steaming, microwaving or stir-frying.\nRapini, sometimes called \"broccoli rabe\", is a distinct species from broccoli, forming similar but smaller heads, and is actually a type of turnip (\"Brassica rapa\").\nTaxonomy.\n\"Brassica oleracea\" var. \"italica\" was described in 1794 by Joseph Jakob von Plenck in \"Icones Plantarum Medicinalium\" 6:29, t. 534. Like all the other \"brassicas\", broccoli was developed from the wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. oleracea), also called colewort or field cabbage.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"broccoli\", first used in the 17th century, comes from the Italian plural of \"\", which means \"the flowering crest of a cabbage\", and is the diminutive form of \"brocco\", meaning \"small nail\" or \"sprout\".\nHistory.\nBroccoli resulted from the breeding of landrace \"Brassica\" crops in the northern Mediterranean starting in about the sixth century BCE. Broccoli has its origins in primitive cultivars grown in the Roman Empire and was most likely improved via artificial selection in the southern Italian Peninsula or in Sicily. Broccoli was spread to northern Europe by the 18th century and brought to North America in the 19th century by Italian immigrants. After the Second World War, the breeding of the United States and Japanese F1 hybrids increased yields, quality, growth speed, and regional adaptation, which produced the cultivars commonly grown since then: 'Premium Crop', 'Packman', and 'Marathon'.\nDescription.\nBroccoli is an annual cruciferous plant which can grow up to tall.\nBroccoli inflorescence grows at the end of a central, edible stem and is dark green. Violet, yellow, or even white heads have been created, but these varieties are rare. The flowers are yellow with four petals.\nThe growth season for broccoli is 14\u201315 weeks. Broccoli is collected by hand immediately after the head is fully formed yet the flowers are still in their bud stage. The plant develops numerous small \"heads\" from the lateral shoots which can be harvested later.\nVarieties.\nThere are three commonly grown types of broccoli. The most familiar is \"Calabrese broccoli\", often referred to simply as \"broccoli\", named after Calabria in Italy. It has large green heads and thick stalks. It is a cool-season annual crop. \"Sprouting broccoli\" (white or purple) has a larger number of heads with many thin stalks. \"Purple cauliflower\" or \"violet cauliflower\" is a type of broccoli grown in Europe and North America. It has a head shaped like cauliflower but consists of many tiny flower buds. Sometimes, but not always, it has a purple cast to the tips of the flower buds. Purple cauliflower may also be white, red, green, or other colors.\n\"Benefort\u00e9\" is a variety of broccoli containing 2\u20133 times more glucoraphanin and produced by crossing broccoli with a wild Brassica variety, \"Brassica oleracea\" var \"villosa\".\nOther cultivar groups of \"Brassica oleracea\".\nOther cultivar groups of \"Brassica oleracea\" include cabbage (Capitata Group), cauliflower and Romanesco broccoli (Botrytis Group), kale (Acephala Group), collard (Viridis Group), kohlrabi (Gongylodes Group), Brussels sprouts (Gemmifera Group), and kai-lan (Alboglabra Group). As these groups are the same species, they readily hybridize: for example, broccolini or \"Tenderstem broccoli\" is a cross between broccoli and kai-lan. Broccoli cultivars form the genetic basis of the \"tropical cauliflowers\" commonly grown in South and Southeastern Asia, although they produce a more cauliflower-like head in warmer conditions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nCultivation.\nThe majority of broccoli cultivars are cool-weather crops that do poorly in hot summer weather. Broccoli grows best when exposed to an average daily temperature between . When the cluster of flowers, also referred to as a \"head\" of broccoli, appears in the center of the plant, the cluster is generally green. Garden pruners or shears are used to cut the head about from the tip. Broccoli should be harvested before the flowers on the head bloom bright yellow. Broccoli cannot be harvested using machines, but rather is hand-harvested.\nProduction.\nIn 2023, global production of broccoli (combined for production reports with cauliflowers) was 26.5 million tonnes, with China and India together accounting for 65% of the world total (table). Secondary producers, each having about one million tonnes or less annually, were the United States, Mexico, and Spain.\nIn the United States, broccoli is grown year-round in California \u2013 which produced 92% of the crop nationally \u2013 with 95% of the total crop produced for fresh sales in 2018.\nNutrition.\nRaw broccoli is 89% water, 7% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). A reference amount of raw broccoli provides of food energy and is a rich source (20% or higher of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (99% DV) and vitamin K (85% DV) (table). Raw broccoli also contains moderate amounts (10\u201319% DV) of several B vitamins and the dietary mineral potassium, whereas other micronutrients are low in content (less than 10% DV). Broccoli contains the dietary carotenoid, beta-carotene.\nCooking.\nBoiling substantially reduces the levels of broccoli glucosinolates, while other cooking methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir-frying, have no significant effect on glucosinolate levels.\nTaste.\nThe perceived bitterness of cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, results from glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products, particularly isothiocyanates and other sulfur-containing compounds. Preliminary research indicates that genetic inheritance through the gene TAS2R38 may be responsible in part for bitter taste perception in broccoli.\nPests.\nThe larvae of \"Pieris rapae\", also known as the \"small white\" butterfly, are a common pest in broccoli and were mostly introduced accidentally to North America, Australia, and New Zealand.\nAdditional pests common to broccoli production include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66560", "revid": "50504901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66560", "title": "Bracken", "text": "Genus of ferns\nBracken (Pteridium) is a genus of large, cosmopolitan, coarse ferns in the family Dennstaedtiaceae. Ferns (Pteridophyta) are vascular plants that undergo alternation of generations, having both large plants (sporophytes) that produce spores and small plants (gametophytes) that produce sex cells (eggs and sperm) in its life cycle. Brackens are noted for their large, highly divided leaves. They are found on all continents except Antarctica, though their typical habitat is moorland. The genus probably has the widest distribution of any fern in the world. \nThe word \"bracken\" is of Old Norse origin, related to Swedish \"br\u00e4ken\" and Danish \"bregne\", both meaning fern. In the past, the genus was commonly treated as having only one species, \"Pteridium aquilinum\", but the recent trend is to subdivide it into about ten species.\nLike other ferns, brackens do not have seeds or fruit, but reproduce by spores. The immature fronds, known as \"fiddleheads\", are sometimes eaten, although some are thought to be carcinogenic.\nDescription.\nBracken is one of the oldest ferns, with fossil records from the Eocene period 55 million years old having been found. The plant sends up large, triangular fronds from a wide-creeping underground rootstock, and may form dense thickets. This rootstock may travel a metre or more underground between fronds. The fronds may grow up to long or longer with support, but typically are in the range of high. In cold environments, bracken is deciduous and, as it requires well-drained soil, is generally found growing on the sides of hills.\nFern spores are contained in structures found on the underside of the leaf called sori. The sori of bracken are located in a line next to the leaf-edge and are distinctly different from that in most other ferns, where the sori are circular and occur towards the center of the leaf.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Pteridium aquilinum\" (bracken or common bracken) is the most common species with a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring in temperate and subtropical regions throughout much of the world. It is a prolific and abundant plant in the moorlands of Ireland, where it is limited to altitudes of below 600 metres. It does not like poorly drained marshes or fen. It has been observed growing in soils from pH 2.8 to 8.6. Exposure to cold or high pH inhibits its growth. It causes such a problem in invading pasturelands that at one time the British government had an eradication programme. Special filters have even been used on some British water supplies to filter out the bracken spores.\nBracken is a characteristic moorland plant in Ireland which over the last decades has increasingly out-competed characteristic ground-cover plants such as moor grasses, cowberry, bilberry, and heathers, and now covers a considerable part of upland moorland.\nOnce valued and gathered for use in animal bedding, tanning, soap and glass making, and as a fertiliser, bracken is now seen as a pernicious, invasive, and opportunistic plant, taking over from the plants traditionally associated with open moorland and reducing easy access by humans. It is toxic to cattle, dogs, sheep, pigs, and horses, and is also linked to cancers in humans. It can harbour high levels of sheep ticks, which can pass on Lyme disease. Grazing provided some control by stock trampling, but this has almost ceased since the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak reduced commercial livestock production. Global climatic changes have also suited bracken well and contributed to its rapid increase in land coverage.\nBracken is a well-adapted pioneer plant which can colonise land quickly, with the potential to extend its area by as much as 1%\u20133% per year. This ability to expand rapidly at the expense of other plants and wildlife can cause major problems for land users and managers. It colonises ground with an open vegetation structure, but is slow to colonise healthy, well managed heather stands.\nBracken presents a threat to biodiversity. Many plant species occur only on upland moorland, tied to unique features in the habitat. The loss and degradation of such areas due to the dominance of bracken has caused many species to become rare and isolated.\nThe Bracken is known to form large fern prairies (sometimes known as fern savannahs or the Fernland). Some of these are natural but others can be formed via fires created by Humans. Brackens are also key parts of other types of savannah such as Pine savannah and Pineyards. \nEcology.\nEvolutionarily, bracken may be considered one of the most successful ferns. It is considered highly invasive, and can survive in acid soils.\nFungal associations.\nWoodland fungi such as \"Mycena epipterygia\" can be found growing under the bracken canopy. Both \"Camarographium stephensii\" and \"Typhula quisquiliaris\" grow primarily from dead bracken stems.\nOther plant associations.\nBracken is known to produce and release allelopathic chemicals, which is an important factor in its ability to dominate other vegetation, particularly in regrowth after fire. Its chemical emissions, shady canopy, and thick litter inhibit other plant species from establishing themselves \u2013 with the occasional exception of plants which support rare butterflies. Herb and tree seedling growth may be inhibited even after bracken is removed, apparently because active plant toxins remain in the soil.\nBracken substitutes the characteristics of a woodland canopy, and is important for giving shade to European plants such as common bluebell and wood anemone where the woodland does not exist. These plants are intolerant to stock trampling. Dead bracken provides a warm microclimate for development of the immature stages. Climbing corydalis, wild gladiolus, and chickweed wintergreen also seem to benefit from the conditions found under bracken stands.\nThe high humidity in the stands helps mosses survive underneath, including \"Campylopus flexuosus\", \"Hypnum cupressiforme\", \"Polytrichum commune\", \"Pseudoscelopodium purum\" and \"Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus\".\nUses.\nFood.\nBracken fiddleheads have been eaten by many cultures throughout history, either fresh, cooked, or pickled. \"Pteridium aquilinum\" is especially common in East Asian cuisine.\nIn Korea, bracken (sometimes referred to as 'fernbrake' in Korean recipes) is known as \"gosari\" (), and is a typical ingredient in \"bibimbap\", a popular mixed rice dish. Stir-fried bracken (\"gosari namul\") is also a common side dish (\"banchan\") in Korea.\nIn Japan, bracken is known as (), and is steamed, boiled, or cooked in soups. \"Warabimochi\" bracken jelly, named after its resemblance to \"mochi\" rice cakes, is a popular traditional dessert, although commercial variants are often made with cheaper potato starch instead. The fiddleheads are also preserved in salt, sake, or miso.\nIn China, bracken is known as \"juecai\" (), and is eaten like vegetables or preserved by drying. Also called \"fernbrake\", it is used as a vegetable in soups and stews.\nBracken rhizomes can be ground into flour to make bread. In the Canary Islands, the rhizome was historically used to make a porridge called \"gofio\". Both fronds and rhizomes have been used to produce beer in Siberia, and among indigenous peoples of North America.\nBracken leaves are used in the Mediterranean region to filter sheep's milk, and to store freshly made ricotta cheese.\n\"P. esculentum\" rhizomes were traditionally used by the M\u0101ori people of New Zealand as a staple food, and are known as \"aruhe\". They were eaten by exploring or hunting groups away from permanent settlements. The plant was widely distributed across New Zealand as a result of prehistoric deforestation, and planting on rich soils, which produced the best rhizomes. The rhizomes were dried, and could be heated and softened with a pounder (\"patu aruhe\"), after which the starch could be sucked from the fibers. \"Patu aruhe\" were important ritual items, and several distinct styles were developed.\nSource of potash.\nGreen bracken ferns average 25% potash and can contain as much as 55%. It has advantages over other sources of plant ash, such as hardwood, due to its high potash yield as a percentage of both dry and fresh mass, abundance, growth rate, and ease of harvesting. Bracken has been recognized as a source of potash since at least the 10th\u00a0century AD, with numerous references in European texts, typically in relation to its use for soap and glass making. The turn to mined sources of potash in the industrial age ended significant use of bracken as a source of potash, contributing to its status as a troublesome weed.\nOthers.\nBracken has traditionally been used for animal bedding, which later breaks down into a rich mulch that could be used as fertilizer. It is still used this way in Wales. It is also used as a winter mulch, which has been shown to reduce the loss of potassium and nitrogen in the soil, and to lower soil pH.\nToxicity.\nBracken contains the carcinogenic compound ptaquiloside, which causes damage to DNA, thus leading to cancers of the digestive tract. High stomach cancer rates are found in Japan and North Wales, where bracken is often eaten, but it is unclear whether bracken plays a role. Consumption of ptaquiloside-contaminated milk is thought to contribute to human gastric cancer in the Andean states of Venezuela. The spores have also been implicated as carcinogens.\nHowever, ptaquiloside is water-soluble and destroyed in heat (by cooking) and alkaline conditions (by soaking). Korean and Japanese cooks have traditionally soaked the shoots in water and ash to detoxify the plant before eating. Ptaquiloside also degenerates at room temperature, and denatures almost completely at boiling temperature. Despite this, moderation of consumption is still recommended to reduce chances of cancer formation. The British Royal Horticultural Society recommends against consumption of bracken altogether, by both humans and livestock.\nPtaquiloside has been shown to leach from wild bracken plants into the water supply, which has been implicated in high rates of stomach and oesophageal cancers in areas with high bracken growth, such as Wales and South America.\nUncooked bracken also contains the enzyme thiaminase, which breaks down thiamine (vitamin B1). Excessive consumption of bracken can lead to vitamin B1 deficiency (beriberi), especially in animals with simple stomachs. Ruminants are less vulnerable because they synthesize thiamine.\nIn animals.\nPtaquiloside from bracken has been shown to be carcinogenic in some animals. Animals may ingest the plant when other sources of food are unavailable, such as during droughts or after snowfalls.\nIn cattle, bracken poisoning can occur in acute and chronic forms, acute poisoning being the most common. Milk from cows that have eaten bracken may also contain ptaquiloside, which is especially concentrated in buttermilk. In pigs and horses, bracken poisoning induces vitamin B1 deficiency.\nIn insects.\nHydrogen cyanide is released by the young fronds of bracken when eaten by mammals or insects. Two major insect moulting hormones, alpha ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone, are found in bracken. These cause uncontrollable, repeated moulting in insects ingesting the fronds, leading to rapid death. Bracken is currently under investigation as a possible source of new insecticides.\nArchaeology.\nMany sites have archaeological remains dating from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages through to the Industrial Revolution. The root systems of established bracken stands degrade archaeological sites by disrupting the strata and other physical evidence. These rhizomes may travel a metre or more underground between fronds and form 90% of the plant, with only the remainder being visible.\nControl.\nSome small level of scattered cover can provide beneficial habitats for some wildlife, at least in the UK (as given above). However, on balance, removing bracken encourages primary habitats to re-establish, which are of greater importance for wildlife. Control is a complex question with complex answers, which need to form part of a wider approach. Management can be difficult and expensive; plans may need to be about cost-effective, practical limitation and control rather than give an expectation for eradication.\nAll methods need follow-up over time, starting with the advancing areas first. Given the decades elapsed to arrive at the current levels of coverage on many sites, slowing or reversing the process will be also of necessity long-term, with consistency and persistence from all parties being key.\nVarious techniques are recommended by Natural England and the RSPB to control bracken either individually or in combination https://.\nNatural England recommends that only Asulam can be sprayed aerially, Glyphosate requires spot treatment, e.g. using a weedwiper or knapsack spray. The toxicity of Asulam is low and has been generally highly cost-effective but its use is now restricted by the EU after 2012, at least until specific registered uses can be defined.\nSelective sprays like Starane, Access, Metsulfuron 600WG, etc. work well but only if sprayed in late autumn so the rhizomes store food for winter and hence absorb the poison.\nOn archaeological sites, chemical control is usually required as mechanical methods may cause damage.\nAny bracken control programme must be completed, or bracken will re-establish.\nA Bracken Control Group was established in 2012 to provide best-practice guidance for all bracken control techniques. The Group has also been responsible for submitting an application for an Emergency Authorisation to secure the continued availability of Asulam for bracken control, following the decision not to register the product under new regulations in the EU. Registration has been re-applied for but this will not be available until 2017 at the earliest. Until re-registration is approved the Group will aim to keep Asulam available under the emergency provisions. http://\nIn culture.\nBracken is commonly referred to by local populations in the north of England as 'Moorland Scrub'.\nThe creature 'Bracken' from the 2023 video game Lethal Company is named after the plant.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She reappeared as a voice of Russian poetry during World War II. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1965 and 1966.\nAkhmatova's work ranges from short lyric poems to intricately structured cycles, such as \"Requiem\" (1935\u201340), her tragic masterpiece about the Stalinist terror. Her style, characterised by its economy and emotional restraint, was strikingly original and distinctive to her contemporaries. The strong and clear leading female voice struck a new chord in Russian poetry. Her writing can be said to fall into two periods \u2013 the early work (1912\u201325) and her later work (from around 1936 until her death), divided by a decade of reduced literary output. Her work was condemned and censored by Stalinist authorities, and she is notable for choosing not to emigrate and remaining in the Soviet Union, acting as witness to the events around her. Her perennial themes include meditations on time and memory, and the difficulties of living and writing in the shadow of Stalinism.\nPrimary sources of information about Akhmatova's life are relatively scant, as war, revolution and the Soviet regime caused much of the written record to be destroyed. For long periods she was in official disfavour and many of those who were close to her died in the aftermath of the revolution. Akhmatova's first husband, Nikolai Gumilev, was executed by the Cheka, and her son Lev Gumilev and her common-law husband Nikolay Punin spent many years in the Gulag, where Punin died.\nEarly life and family.\nAkhmatova was born at Bolshoy Fontan, a resort suburb of the Black Sea port of Odessa in present-day Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. Her father, Andrey Gorenko, was a descendant of a Ukrainian Cossack noble family, a naval engineer, later a civil servant in the rank of collegiate assessor, and her mother, Inna Erazmovna Stogova, was from a Russian \"pomeshchik\" (landowner) family with close ties to Kiev. She wrote:\nNo one in my large family wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt of my grandfather Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection during the time of Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more distinguished family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses \u2013 Praskovia Yegorovna \u2013 married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died when my mother was nine years old, and I was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though my fingers are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.\nHer family moved north to Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, when she was eleven months old. The family lived in a house on the corner of Shirokaya Street and Bezymyanny Lane (the building is no longer there today), spending summers from age 7 to 13 in a dacha near Sevastopol. She studied at the Mariinskaya High School, moving to Kiev (1906\u201310) and finished her schooling there, after her parents separated in 1905. She went on to study law at Kiev University, leaving a year later to study literature in Saint Petersburg.\nAkhmatova started writing poetry at the age of 11, and was published in her late teens, inspired by the poets Nikolay Nekrasov, Jean Racine, Alexander Pushkin, Yevgeny Baratynsky and the Symbolists; however, none of her juvenilia survive. Her sister Inna also wrote poetry though she did not pursue the practice and married shortly after high school. Akhmatova's father did not want to see any verses printed under his \"respectable\" name, so she chose to adopt her grandmother's distinctly Tatar surname 'Akhmatova' as a pen name.\nShe met a young poet, Nikolai Gumilev, on Christmas Eve 1903. Gumilev encouraged her to write and pursued her intensely, making numerous marriage proposals starting in 1905. At 17 years old, in his journal \"Sirius\", she published her first poem which could be translated as \"On his hand you may see many glittering rings\" (1907), signing it \"Anna G.\" She soon became known in Saint Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, \"He has loved me for three years now, and I believe that it is my fate to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, but it seems to me that I do.\" She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova's family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.\nIn late 1910, she came together with poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky to form the Guild of Poets. It promoted the idea of craft as the key to poetry rather than inspiration or mystery, taking themes of the concrete rather than the more ephemeral world of the Symbolists. Over time, they developed the influential Acmeist anti-symbolist school, concurrent with the growth of Imagism in Europe and America. From the first year of their marriage, Gumilev began to chafe against its constraints. She wrote that he had \"lost his passion\" for her, and by the end of that year he left on a six-month trip to Africa.\nShe had \"her first taste of fame\", becoming renowned, not so much for her beauty, but for her intense magnetism and allure, attracting the fascinated attention of a great many men, including the great and the good. She returned to visit Modigliani in Paris, where he created at least 20 paintings of her, including several nudes.\nShe later began an affair with the celebrated Acmeist poet Osip Mandelstam, whose wife, Nadezhda, declared later, in her autobiography that she came to forgive Akhmatova for it in time. Akhmatova's son, Lev, was born in 1912, and would become a renowned Neo-Eurasianist historian.\nSilver Age.\nIn 1912, the Guild of Poets published Akhmatova's book of verse \"Evening\" (\"Vecher\") \u2013 the first of five in nine years. The small edition of 500 copies quickly sold out and she received around a dozen positive notices in the literary press. She exercised a strong selectivity for the pieces \u2013 including only 35 of the 200 poems she had written by the end of 1911. (She noted that \"Song of the Last Meeting\", dated 29 September 1911, was her 200th poem.) The book secured her reputation as a new and striking young writer, the poems \"Grey-eyed king\", \"In the Forest\", \"Over the Water\", and \"I don't need my legs anymore\" making her famous. She later wrote, \"These na\u00efve poems by a frivolous girl for some reason were reprinted thirteen times [...] And they came out in several translations. The girl herself (as far as I recall) did not foresee such a fate for them and used to hide the issues of the journals in which they were first published under the sofa cushions\".\nAkhmatova's second collection, \"The Rosary\" (or \"Beads\" \u2013 \"Chetki\") appeared in March 1914 and firmly established her as one of the most popular and sought after poets of the day. Thousands of women composed poems \"in honour of Akhmatova\", mimicking her style and prompting Akhmatova to exclaim: \"I taught our women how to speak, but don't know how to make them silent\". Her aristocratic manners and artistic integrity won her the titles \"Queen of the Neva\" and \"Soul of the Silver Age\", as the period came to be known in the history of Russian poetry. In \"Poem Without a Hero\", the longest and one of the best known of her works, written many decades later, she would recall this as a blessed time of her life.\nAkhmatova became close friends with Boris Pasternak (who, though married, proposed to her many times) and rumours began to circulate that she was having an affair with influential lyrical poet Alexander Blok. In July 1914, Akhmatova wrote \"Frightening times are approaching / Soon fresh graves will cover the land\"; on 1 August, Germany declared war on Russia, marking the start of \"the dark storm\" of world war, civil war, revolution and totalitarian repression for Russia. The Silver Age came to a close.\nAkhmatova had a relationship with the mosaic artist and poet Boris Anrep; many of her poems in the period are about him, and he in turn created mosaics in which she is featured. She selected poems for her third collection, \"Belaya Staya\" (\"White Flock\"), in 1917, a volume which poet and critic Joseph Brodsky later described as writing of personal lyricism tinged with the \"note of controlled terror\". She later came to be memorialised by his description of her as \"the keening muse\". Essayist John Bayley describes her writing at this time as \"grim, spare and laconic\".\nIn February 1917, the revolution started in Saint Petersburg (then named Petrograd); soldiers fired on marching protestors, and others mutinied. They looked to a past in which the future was \"rotting\". In a city without electricity or sewage service, with little water or food, they faced starvation and sickness. Akhmatova's friends died around her and others left in droves for safer havens in Europe and America, including Anrep, who escaped to England. She had the option to leave, and considered it for a time, but chose to stay and was proud of her decision to remain:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;You are a traitor, and for a green island, \nHave betrayed, yes, betrayed your native \nLand, \nAbandoned all our songs and sacred \nIcons, \nAnd the pine tree over a quiet lake.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAkhmatova wrote of her own temptation to leave:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;A voice came to me. It called out comfortingly. \nIt said, \"Come here, \nLeave your deaf and sinful land, \nLeave Russia forever, \nI will wash the blood from your hands, \nRoot out the black shame from your heart, \n[...] calmly and indifferently, \nI covered my ears with my hands, \nSo that my sorrowing spirit \nWould not be stained by those shameful words.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAt the height of Akhmatova's fame, in 1918, she divorced her husband and that same year, though many of her friends considered it a mistake, Akhmatova married prominent Assyriologist and poet Vladimir Shilejko. She later said, \"I felt so filthy. I thought it would be like a cleansing, like going to a convent, knowing you are going to lose your freedom.\" She began affairs with theatre director Mikhail Zimmerman and composer Arthur Louri\u00e9, who set many of her poems to music.\n1920s and 1930s.\nIn 1921, Akhmatova's former husband Nikolay Gumilev was prosecuted for his alleged role in a monarchist anti-Bolshevik conspiracy and in August was executed via shooting by the Cheka along with 61 others. According to the historian Donald Rayfield, the murder of Gumilev was part of the state response to the Kronstadt rebellion. The Cheka blamed the rebellion on Petrograd's intellectuals, prompting the senior Cheka officer Yakov Agranov to forcibly extract the names of 'conspirators' from an imprisoned professor, guaranteeing them amnesty from execution. Agranov's guarantee proved to be meaningless. He sentenced dozens of the named persons to death, including Gumilev. Maxim Gorky and others appealed for leniency, but by the time Lenin agreed to several pardons, the condemned had been shot. Within a few days of his death, Akhmatova wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Terror fingers all things in the dark,\nLeads moonlight to the axe.\nThere's an ominous knock behind the wall:\nA ghost, a thief or a rat...&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe executions had a powerful effect on the Russian intelligentsia, destroying the Acmeist poetry group, and placing a stigma on Akhmatova and her son by Gumilev, Lev. Lev's later arrest during the purges and terrors of the 1930s was based on being his father's son. From a new Marxist perspective, Akhmatova's poetry was deemed to represent an introspective \"bourgeois aesthetic\", reflecting only trivial \"female\" preoccupations, not in keeping with these new revolutionary politics of the time. She was roundly attacked by the state and by former supporters and friends and seen to be an anachronism. During what she termed \"The Vegetarian Years\", Akhmatova's work was unofficially banned by a party resolution of 1925, and she found it hard to publish, though she did not stop writing poetry. She made acclaimed translations of works by Victor Hugo, Rabindranath Tagore, and Giacomo Leopardi and pursued academic work on Pushkin and Dostoyevsky. She worked as a critic and essayist, though many Soviet and foreign critics and readers concluded that she had died.\nShe had little food and almost no money; her son was denied access to study at academic institutions because of his parents' alleged anti-state activities. The nationwide repression and purges decimated her Saint Petersburg circle of friends, artists and intellectuals. Her close friend and fellow poet Mandelstam was deported and then sentenced to a Gulag labour camp, where he would die. Akhmatova narrowly escaped arrest, though her son Lev was imprisoned on numerous occasions by the Stalinist regime, accused of counterrevolutionary activity. She would often queue for hours to deliver him food packages and plead on his behalf. She describes standing outside a stone prison:\nOne day somebody in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there): 'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over what had once been her face.\nAkhmatova wrote that by 1935 every time she went to see someone off at the train station as they went into exile, she would find herself greeting friends at every step, as so many of Saint Petersburg's intellectual and cultural figures would be leaving on the same train. Of the members of her poetry circles, Mayakovsky and Yesenin committed suicide, and Marina Tsvetaeva would follow them in 1941 after returning from exile.\nAkhmatova was a common-law wife to Nikolai Punin, an art scholar and lifelong friend, whom she stayed with until 1935. He also was repeatedly taken into custody, dying in the Gulag in 1953. Her tragic cycle \"Requiem\" documents her personal experience of this time; as she writes, \"one hundred million voices shout\" through her \"tortured mouth\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Seventeen months I've pleaded\nfor you to come home.\nFlung myself at the hangman's feet.\nMy terror, oh my son.\nAnd I can't understand.\nNow all's eternal confusion.\nWho's beast, and who's man? \nHow long till execution?&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\n1939\u20131960.\nIn 1939, Stalin approved the publication of one volume of poetry, \"From Six Books\"; however, the collection was withdrawn and pulped after only a few months. In 1993, it was revealed that the authorities had bugged her flat and kept her under constant surveillance, keeping detailed files on her from this time, accruing some 900 pages of \"denunciations, reports of phone taps, quotations from writings, confessions of those close to her\". Although officially stifled, Akhmatova's work continued to circulate in secret. Akhmatova's close friend, chronicler Lydia Chukovskaya described how writers working to keep poetic messages alive used various strategies. A small, trusted circle would, for example, memorise each other's works and circulate them only by oral means. She tells how Akhmatova would write out her poem for a visitor on a scrap of paper to be read in a moment, then burnt in her stove. The poems were carefully disseminated in this way, but it is likely that many compiled in this manner were lost. \"It was like a ritual,\" Chukovskaya wrote, \"Hands, matches, an ashtray. A ritual beautiful and bitter.\"\nDuring World War II, Akhmatova witnessed the 900-day Siege of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). In 1940, Akhmatova started her \"Poem without a Hero\". She finished a first draft in Tashkent, but she worked on the poem for twenty years and considered it to be the major work of her life, dedicating it to \"the memory of its first audience \u2013 my friends and fellow citizens who perished in Leningrad during the siege\". She was evacuated to Chistopol in spring of 1942 and then to greener, safer Tashkent in Uzbekistan, along with other artists, such as Shostakovich. During her time away she became seriously ill with typhus (she had suffered from severe bronchitis and tuberculosis as a young woman). On returning to Leningrad in May 1944, she writes of how disturbed she was to find \"a terrible ghost that pretended to be my city\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nIf a gag should blind my tortured mouth, \nthrough which a hundred million people shout,\nthen let them pray for me, as I do pray \nfor them\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nFrom \"Requiem\" (1940).Trans. Kunitz and Hayward\nShe regularly read to soldiers in the military hospitals and on the front line; her later pieces seem to be the voice of those who had struggled and the many she had outlived. She moved away from romantic themes towards a more diverse, complex and philosophical body of work and some of her more patriotic poems found their way to the front pages of \"Pravda\".\nIn 1946 the Central Committee of the Communist Party, acting on the orders from Stalin, started an official campaign against the \"bourgeois\", individualistic works by Akhmatova and satirist Mikhail Zoshchenko. She was condemned for a visit by the Russian-born British liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin in 1945, and Andrei Zhdanov publicly labelled her \"half harlot, half nun\", her work \"the poetry of an overwrought, upper-class lady\", her work the product of \"eroticism, mysticism, and political indifference\". He banned her poems from publication in the journals \"Zvezda\" and \"Leningrad\", accusing her of poisoning the minds of Soviet youth. Her surveillance was increased, and she was expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers.\nBerlin described his visit to her flat: \"It was very barely furnished\u2014virtually everything in it had, I gathered, been taken away\u2014looted or sold\u2014during the siege ... A stately, grey-haired lady, a white shawl draped about her shoulders, slowly rose to greet us. Anna Akhmatova was immensely dignified, with unhurried gestures, a noble head, beautiful, somewhat severe features, and an expression of immense sadness.\"\nAkhmatova's son Lev was arrested again at the end of 1949 and sentenced to 10 years in a Siberian prison camp. She spent much of the next years trying to secure his release; to this end, and for the first time, she published overtly propagandist poetry, \"In Praise of Peace\", in the magazine \"Ogoniok\", openly supporting Stalin and his regime. Lev remained in the camps until 1956, well after Stalin's death, his final release potentially aided by his mother's concerted efforts. Bayley suggests that her period of pro-Stalinist work may also have saved her own life; notably, however, Akhmatova never acknowledged these pieces in her official corpus. Akhmatova's stature among Soviet poets was slowly conceded by party officials, her name no longer cited in only scathing contexts and she was readmitted to the Union of Writers in 1951, being fully recognised again following Stalin's death in 1953. With the press still heavily controlled and censored under Nikita Khrushchev, a translation by Akhmatova was praised in a public review in 1955, and her own poems began to re-appear in 1956. That same year Lev was released from the camps, embittered, believing that his mother cared more about her poetry than for him and that she had not worked hard for his release. Akhmatova's status was confirmed by 1958, with the publication of \"Stikhotvoreniya\" \"(Poems)\" and then \"Stikhotvoreniya 1909\u20131960\" \"(Poems: 1909\u20131960)\" in 1961. \"Beg vremeni\" (\"The flight of time\"), collected works 1909\u20131965, published 1965, was the most complete volume of her works in her lifetime, though the long, damning poem \"Requiem\", condemning the Stalinist purges, was conspicuously absent. Isaiah Berlin predicted at the time that it could never be published in the Soviet Union.\nLast years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nA land not mine, still\nforever memorable, \nthe waters of its ocean\nchill and fresh.\nSand on the bottom whiter than chalk,\nand the air drunk, like wine,\nlate sun lays bare\nthe rosy limbs of the pinetrees.\nSunset in the ethereal waves:\nI cannot tell if the day\nis ending, or the world, or if\nthe secret of secrets is inside me again.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n \"A land not mine\", 1964\nDuring the last years of Akhmatova's life, she continued to live with the Punin family in Leningrad, still translating, researching Pushkin, and writing her own poetry. Though still censored, she was concerned to re-construct work that had been destroyed or suppressed during the purges or which had posed a threat to the life of her son in the camps, such as the lost, semi-autobiographical play \"En\u00fbma Elish\". She worked on her official memoirs, planned novels, and worked on her epic \"Poem without a Hero\", 20 years in the writing.\nAkhmatova was widely honoured in the USSR and the West. In 1962, she was visited by Robert Frost; Isaiah Berlin tried to visit her again, but she refused him, worried that her son might be re-arrested due to family association with the ideologically suspect western philosopher. She inspired and advised a large circle of key young Soviet writers. Her dacha in Komarovo was frequented by such poets as Yevgeny Rein and Joseph Brodsky, whom she mentored. Brodsky, arrested in 1963 and interned for social parasitism, would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature (1987) and become Poet Laureate (1991) as an exile in the US.\nAs one of the last remaining major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as \"Requiem\", Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforced this image herself. She was becoming a representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s than she had ever been before the revolution; this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.\nAkhmatova was able to meet some of her pre-revolutionary acquaintances in 1965, when she was allowed to travel to Sicily and England, in order to receive the Taormina prize and an honorary doctoral degree from Oxford University, accompanied by her lifelong friend and secretary Lydia Chukovskaya. Akhmatova's \"Requiem\" in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within USSR until 1987. Her long poem \"The Way of All the Earth\" or \"Woman of Kitezh\" (\"Kitezhanka\") was published in complete form in 1965.\nIn November 1965, soon after her Oxford visit, Akhmatova suffered a heart attack and was hospitalised. She was moved to a sanatorium in Moscow in the spring of 1966 and died of heart failure on 5 March, at the age of 76. Thousands attended the two memorial ceremonies, held in Moscow and in Leningrad. After being displayed in an open coffin, she was interred at Komarovo Cemetery in Saint Petersburg.\nIsaiah Berlin described the impact of her life, as he saw it:\nThe widespread worship of her memory in Soviet Union today, both as an artist and as an unsurrendering human being, has, so far as I know, no parallel. The legend of her life and unyielding passive resistance to what she regarded as unworthy of her country and herself, transformed her into a figure [...] not merely in Russian literature, but in Russian history in [the twentieth] century.\nIn 1988, to celebrate what would have been Akhmatova's 100th birthday, Harvard University held an international conference on her life and work. Today her work may be explored at the Anna Akhmatova Literary and Memorial Museum in Saint Petersburg.\nWork and themes.\nAkhmatova joined the Acmeist group of poets in 1910 with poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky, working in response to the Symbolist school, concurrent with the growth of Imagism in Europe and America. It promoted the use of craft and rigorous poetic form over mysticism or spiritual in-roads to composition, favouring the concrete over the ephemeral. Akhmatova modeled its principles of writing with clarity, simplicity, and disciplined form. Her first collections \"Evening\" (1912) and \"Rosary\" (1914) received wide critical acclaim and made her famous from the start of her career. They contained brief, psychologically taut pieces, acclaimed for their classical diction, telling details, and the skilful use of colour. \"Evening\" and her next four books were mostly lyric miniatures on the theme of love, shot through with sadness.\nHer early poems usually picture a man and a woman involved in the most poignant, ambiguous moment of their relationship, much imitated and later parodied by Nabokov and others. Critic Roberta Reeder notes that the early poems always attracted large numbers of admirers: \"For Akhmatova was able to capture and convey the vast range of evolving emotions experienced in a love affair, from the first thrill of meeting, to a deepening love contending with hatred, and eventually to violent destructive passion or total indifference. But [...] her poetry marks a radical break with the erudite, ornate style and the mystical representation of love so typical of poets like Alexander Blok and Andrey Bely. Her lyrics are composed of short fragments of simple speech that do not form a logical coherent pattern. Instead, they reflect the way we actually think, the links between the images are emotional, and simple everyday objects are charged with psychological associations. Like Alexander Pushkin, who was her model in many ways, Akhmatova was intent on conveying worlds of meaning through precise details.\"\nAkhmatova often complained that the critics \"walled her in\" to their perception of her work in the early years of romantic passion, despite major changes of theme in the later years of the Terror. This was mainly due to the secret nature of her work after the public and critical effusion over her first volumes. The risks during the purges were very great. Many of her close friends and family were exiled, imprisoned or shot; her son was under constant threat of arrest, and she was often under close surveillance. Following artistic repression and public condemnation by the state in the 1920s, many within literary and public circles, at home and abroad, thought she had died. Her readership generally did not know her later opus, the railing passion of \"Requiem\" or \"Poem without a Hero\" and her other scathing works, which were shared only with a very trusted few or circulated in secret by word of mouth (samizdat).\nBetween 1935 and 1940 Akhmatova composed, worked and reworked the long poem \"Requiem\" in secret, a lyrical cycle of lamentation and witness, depicting the suffering of the common people under Soviet terror. She carried it with her as she worked and lived in towns and cities across the Soviet Union. It was conspicuously absent from her collected works, given its explicit condemnation of the purges. The work in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963; the whole work not published within USSR until 1987. It consists of ten numbered poems that examine a series of emotional states, exploring suffering, despair, devotion, rather than a clear narrative. Biblical themes such as Christ's crucifixion and the devastation of Mary, Mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, reflect the ravaging of Russia, particularly witnessing the harrowing of women in the 1930s. It represented, to some degree, a rejection of her own earlier romantic work as she took on the public role as chronicler of the Terror. This is a role she holds to this day.\nHer essays on Pushkin and \"Poem Without a Hero\", her longest work, were only published after her death. This long poem, composed between 1940 and 1965, is often critically regarded as her best work and also one of the finest poems of the twentieth century. It gives a deep and detailed analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909\u201397) in 1945. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Other computers had some of these features, but ENIAC was the first to have them all. It was Turing-complete and able to solve \"a large class of numerical problems\" through reprogramming.\nENIAC was designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory (which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory). However, its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.\nENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for practical purposes on December 10, 1945.\nENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania on February 15, 1946, having cost $487,000 (), and called a \"Giant Brain\" by the press. It had a speed on the order of one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines.\nENIAC was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946. It was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland in 1947, where it was in continuous operation until 1955.\nDevelopment and design.\nENIAC's design and construction was financed by the United States Army Ordnance Corps, Research and Development Command, led by Major General Gladeon M. Barnes. The total cost was about $487,000, . The conception of ENIAC began in June 1941, when Friden calculators and differential analyzers were used by the United States Army Ordnance Department to compute firing tables for artillery, which was done by graduate students under John Mauchly's supervision. Mauchly began to wonder if electronics could be applied to mathematics for faster calculations. He partnered with research associate J. Presper Eckert, as Mauchly wasn't an electronics expert, to draft an electronic computer that could work at an excellent pace. Later, in August 1942, Mauchly proposed an all-electronic calculating machine that could help the U.S. Army calculate complex ballistics tables. The U.S. Army Ordnance accepted their plan, giving the University of Pennsylvania a six-months research contract for $61,700. The construction contract was signed on June 5, 1943; work on the computer began in secret at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering the following month, under the code name \"Project PX\", with John Grist Brainerd as principal investigator. Herman H. Goldstine persuaded the Army to fund the project, which put him in charge to oversee it for them. Assembly of the computer began in June 1944. Later, in September of that year, Eckert and Mauchly completed their conception of the computer. Construction was complete in May 1945, and testing began at the Moore School. Later, in November of that year, the duo, along with John Brainerd and Herman Goldstine, issued the first confidentially published report on the computer, which describes how it functioned and the methods by which it was programmed.\nENIAC was designed by Ursinus College physics professor John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert of the University of Pennsylvania. The team of design engineers assisting the development included Robert F. Shaw (function tables), Jeffrey Chuan Chu (divider/square-rooter), Thomas Kite Sharpless (master programmer), Frank Mural (master programmer), Arthur Burks (multiplier), Harry Huskey (reader/printer) and Jack Davis (accumulators). Significant development was undertaken by the female mathematicians who handled the bulk of the ENIAC programming: Jean Jennings, Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman, Betty Snyder, Frances Bilas, and Kay McNulty. In 1946, the researchers resigned from the University of Pennsylvania and formed the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation.\nENIAC was a large, modular computer, composed of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these modules were accumulators that could not only add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose buses (or \"trays\", as they were called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to \"branch\"; it could trigger different operations, depending on the sign of a computed result.\nComponents.\nBy the end of its operation in 1956, ENIAC contained 18,000 vacuum tubes, 7,200 crystal diodes, 6,000 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than , was roughly tall, deep, and long, occupied and consumed 150\u00a0kW of electricity. Input was possible from an IBM card reader and an IBM card punch was used for output. These cards could be used to produce printed output offline using an IBM accounting machine, such as the IBM 405. While ENIAC had no system to store memory in its inception, these punch cards could be used for external memory storage. In 1953, a 100-word magnetic-core memory built by the Burroughs Corporation was added to ENIAC.\nENIAC used ten-position ring counters to store digits; each digit required 36 vacuum tubes, 10 of which were the dual triodes making up the flip-flops of the ring counter. Arithmetic was performed by \"counting\" pulses with the ring counters and generating carry pulses if the counter \"wrapped around\", the idea being to electronically emulate the operation of the digit wheels of a mechanical adding machine.\nENIAC had 20 ten-digit signed accumulators, which used ten's complement representation and could perform 5,000 simple addition or subtraction operations between any of them and a source (e.g., another accumulator or a constant transmitter) per second. It was possible to connect several accumulators to run simultaneously, so the peak speed of operation was potentially much higher, due to parallel operation.\nIt was possible to wire the carry of one accumulator into another accumulator to perform arithmetic with double the precision, but the accumulator carry circuit timing prevented the wiring of three or more for even higher precision. ENIAC used four of the accumulators (controlled by a special multiplier unit) to perform up to 385 multiplication operations per second; five of the accumulators were controlled by a special divider/square-rooter unit to perform up to 40 division operations per second or three square root operations per second.\nThe other nine units in ENIAC were the initiating unit (started and stopped the machine), the cycling unit (used for synchronizing the other units), the master programmer (controlled loop sequencing), the reader (controlled an IBM punch-card reader), the printer (controlled an IBM card punch), the constant transmitter, and three function tables.\nOperation times.\nThe references by Rojas and Hashagen (or Wilkes) give more details about the times for operations, which differ somewhat from those stated above.\nThe basic machine cycle was 200 microseconds (20 cycles of the 100\u00a0kHz clock in the cycling unit), or 5,000 cycles per second for operations on the 10-digit numbers. In one of these cycles, ENIAC could write a number to a register, read a number from a register, or add/subtract two numbers.\nA multiplication of a 10-digit number by a \"d\"-digit number (for \"d\" up to 10) took \"d\"+4 cycles, so the multiplication of a 10-digit number by 10-digit number took 14 cycles, or 2,800 microseconds\u2014a rate of 357 per second. If one of the numbers had fewer than 10 digits, the operation was faster.\nDivision and square roots took 13(\"d\"+1) cycles, where \"d\" is the number of digits in the result (quotient or square root). So a division or square root took up to 143 cycles, or 28,600 microseconds\u2014a rate of 35 per second. (Wilkes 1956:20 states that a division with a 10-digit quotient required 6 milliseconds.) If the result had fewer than ten digits, it was obtained faster.\nENIAC was able to process about 500 FLOPS, compared to modern supercomputers' petascale and exascale computing power.\nReliability.\nENIAC used common octal-base radio tubes of the day; the decimal accumulators were made of 6SN7 flip-flops, while 6L7s, 6SJ7s, 6SA7s and 6AC7s were used in logic functions. Numerous 6L6s and 6V6s served as line drivers to drive pulses through cables between rack assemblies.\nSeveral tubes burned out almost every day, leaving ENIAC nonfunctional about half the time. Special high-reliability tubes were not available until 1948. Most of these failures, however, occurred during the warm-up and cool-down periods, when the tube heaters and cathodes were under the most thermal stress. Engineers reduced ENIAC's tube failures to the more acceptable rate of one tube every two days. According to an interview in 1989 with Eckert, \"We had a tube fail about every two days and we could locate the problem within 15 minutes.\"\nIn 1954, the longest continuous period of operation without a failure was 116 hours\u2014close to five days.\nProgramming.\nENIAC could be programmed to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the stored-program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which originally had programs set up into the machine by a combination of plugboard wiring and three portable function tables (containing 1,200 ten-way switches each). The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due to the complexity of mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the process of getting the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step. A programming tutorial for the modulo function using an ENIAC simulator gives an impression of what a program on the ENIAC looked like.\nENIAC's six primary programmers, Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman, not only determined how to input ENIAC programs, but also developed an understanding of ENIAC's inner workings. The programmers were often able to narrow bugs down to an individual failed tube which could be pointed to for replacement by a technician.\nProgrammers.\nDuring World War II, while the U.S. Army needed to compute ballistics trajectories, many women were interviewed for this task. At least 200 women were hired by the Moore School of Engineering to work as \"computers\" and six of them were chosen to be the programmers of ENIAC. Betty Holberton, Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman, Betty Jean Jennings, and Fran Bilas programmed the ENIAC to perform calculations for ballistics trajectories electronically for the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. While men having the same education and experience were designated \"professionals\", these women were designated \"subprofessionals\", though they had professional degrees in mathematics and were highly trained mathematicians.\nThese women were not \"refrigerator ladies\", i.e., models posing in front of the machine for press photography, as then computer scientist undergrad Kathryn Kleiman discovered in her own research as opposed to what she was told by a historian in computing. However, some of the women did not receive recognition for their work on the ENIAC in their entire lifetimes. After the war ended, the women continued to work on the ENIAC. Their expertise made their positions difficult to replace with returning soldiers. Later in the 1990s, Kleiman learned that most of the ENIAC programmers were not invited to the ENIAC's 50th anniversary event. So she made it her mission to track them down and record their oral histories. \"They were shocked to be discovered,\" Kleiman says. \"They were thrilled to be recognized, but had mixed impressions about how they felt about being ignored for so long.\" Kleiman released a book on the six female ENIAC programmers in 2022.\nThese early programmers were drawn from a group of about two hundred women employed as computers at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. The job of computers was to produce the numeric result of mathematical formulas needed for a scientific study, or an engineering project. They usually did so with a mechanical calculator. The women studied the machine's logic, physical structure, operation, and circuitry in order to not only understand the mathematics of computing, but also the machine itself. This was one of the few technical job categories available to women at that time. Betty Holberton (n\u00e9e Snyder) continued on to help write the first generative programming system (SORT/MERGE) and help design the first commercial electronic computers, the UNIVAC and the BINAC, alongside Jean Jennings. McNulty developed the use of subroutines in order to help increase ENIAC's computational capability.\nHerman Goldstine selected the programmers, whom he called operators, from the computers who had been calculating ballistics tables with mechanical desk calculators and a differential analyzer prior to and during the development of ENIAC. Under Herman and Adele Goldstine's direction, the computers studied ENIAC's blueprints and physical structure to determine how to manipulate its switches and cables, as programming languages did not yet exist. Though contemporaries considered programming a clerical task and did not publicly recognize the programmers' effect on the successful operation and announcement of ENIAC, McNulty, Jennings, Snyder, Wescoff, Bilas, and Lichterman have since been recognized for their contributions to computing. Three of the current (2020) Army supercomputers, \"Jean\", \"Kay\", and \"Betty,\" are named after Jean Bartik (Betty Jennings), Kay McNulty, and Betty Snyder respectively.\nThe \"programmer\" and \"operator\" job titles were not originally considered professions suitable for women. The labor shortage created by World War II helped enable the entry of women into the field. However, the field was not viewed as prestigious, and bringing in women was viewed as a way to free men up for more skilled labor. Essentially, women were seen as meeting a need in a temporary crisis. For example, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics said in 1942, \"It is felt that enough greater return is obtained by freeing the engineers from calculating detail to overcome any increased expenses in the computers' salaries. The engineers admit themselves that the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they would. This is due in large measure to the feeling among the engineers that their college and industrial experience is being wasted and thwarted by mere repetitive calculation.\"\nFollowing the initial six programmers, an expanded team of a hundred scientists was recruited to continue work on the ENIAC. Among these were several women, including Gloria Ruth Gordon. Adele Goldstine wrote the original technical description of the ENIAC.\nProgramming languages.\nSeveral language systems were developed to describe programs for the ENIAC, including:\nRole in the hydrogen bomb.\nAlthough the Ballistic Research Laboratory was the sponsor of ENIAC, one year into this three-year project John von Neumann, a mathematician working on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos National Laboratory, became aware of the ENIAC. In December 1945, the ENIAC was used to calculate thermonuclear reactions using equations. The data was used to support research on building a hydrogen bomb.\nRole in development of the Monte Carlo methods.\nRelated to ENIAC's role in the hydrogen bomb was its role in the Monte Carlo method becoming popular. Scientists involved in the original nuclear bomb development used massive groups of people doing huge numbers of calculations (\"computers\" in the terminology of the time) to investigate the distance that neutrons would likely travel through various materials. John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam realized the speed of ENIAC would allow these calculations to be done much more quickly. The success of this project showed the value of Monte Carlo methods in science.\nLater developments.\nA press conference was held on February 1, 1946, and the completed machine was announced to the public the evening of February 14, 1946, featuring demonstrations of its capabilities. Elizabeth Snyder and Betty Jean Jennings were responsible for developing the demonstration trajectory program, although Herman and Adele Goldstine took credit for it. The machine was formally dedicated the next day at the University of Pennsylvania. None of the women involved in programming the machine or creating the demonstration were invited to the formal dedication nor to the celebratory dinner held afterwards.\nThe original contract amount was $61,700; the final cost was almost $500,000 (approximately ). It was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946. ENIAC was shut down on November 9, 1946, for a refurbishment and a memory upgrade, and was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland in 1947. There, on July 29, 1947, it was turned on and was in continuous operation until 11:45\u00a0p.m. on October 2, 1955, when it was retired in favor of the more efficient EDVAC and ORDVAC computers.\nRole in the development of the EDVAC.\nA few months after ENIAC's unveiling in the summer of 1946, as part of \"an extraordinary effort to jump-start research in the field\", the Pentagon invited \"the top people in electronics and mathematics from the United States and Great Britain\" to a series of forty-eight lectures given in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; all together called \"The Theory and Techniques for Design of Digital Computers\"\u2014more often named the Moore School Lectures. Half of these lectures were given by the inventors of ENIAC.\nENIAC was a one-of-a-kind design and was never repeated. The freeze on design in 1943 meant that it lacked some innovations that soon became well-developed, notably the ability to store a program. Eckert and Mauchly started work on a new design, to be later called the EDVAC, which would be both simpler and more powerful. In particular, in 1944 Eckert wrote his description of a memory unit (the mercury delay line) which would hold both the data and the program. John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School on the EDVAC, sat in on the Moore School meetings at which the stored program concept was elaborated. Von Neumann wrote up an incomplete set of notes (\"First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC\") which were intended to be used as an internal memorandum\u2014describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings. ENIAC administrator and security officer Herman Goldstine distributed copies of this \"First Draft\" to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in the construction of a new generation of electronic computing machines, including Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) at Cambridge University, England and SEAC at the U.S. Bureau of Standards.\nImprovements.\nA number of improvements were made to ENIAC after 1947, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the function tables as program ROM, after which programming was done by setting the switches. The idea has been worked out in several variants by Richard Clippinger and his group, on the one hand, and the Goldstines, on the other, and it was included in the ENIAC patent. Clippinger consulted with von Neumann on what instruction set to implement. Clippinger had thought of a three-address architecture while von Neumann proposed a one-address architecture because it was simpler to implement. Three digits of one accumulator (#6) were used as the program counter, another accumulator (#15) was used as the main accumulator, a third accumulator (#8) was used as the address pointer for reading data from the function tables, and most of the other accumulators (1\u20135, 7, 9\u201314, 17\u201319) were used for data memory.\nIn March 1948 the converter unit was installed, which made possible programming through the reader from standard IBM cards. The \"first production run\" of the new coding techniques on the Monte Carlo problem followed in April. After ENIAC's move to Aberdeen, a register panel for memory was also constructed, but it did not work. A small master control unit to turn the machine on and off was also added.\nThe programming of the stored program for ENIAC was done by Betty Jennings, Clippinger, Adele Goldstine and others. It was first demonstrated as a stored-program computer in April 1948, running a program by Adele Goldstine for John von Neumann. This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC by a factor of 6 and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time to hours instead of days, it was considered well worth the loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any real-world problem was completely I/O bound, even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the speed reduction imposed by this modification.\nEarly in 1952, a high-speed shifter was added, which improved the speed for shifting by a factor of five. In July 1953, a 100-word expansion core memory was added to the system, using binary-coded decimal, excess-3 number representation. To support this expansion memory, ENIAC was equipped with a new Function Table selector, a memory address selector, pulse-shaping circuits, and three new orders were added to the programming mechanism.\nComparison with other early computers.\nMechanical computing machines have been around since Archimedes' time (see: Antikythera mechanism), but the 1930s and 1940s are considered the beginning of the modern computer era.\nENIAC was, like the IBM Harvard Mark I and the German Z3, able to run an arbitrary sequence of mathematical operations, but did not read them from a tape. Like the British Colossus, it was programmed by plugboard and switches. ENIAC combined full, Turing-complete programmability with electronic speed. The Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (ABC), ENIAC, and Colossus all used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes). ENIAC's registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3, the ABC and Colossus.\nLike the Colossus, ENIAC required rewiring to reprogram until April 1948. In June 1948, the Manchester Baby ran its first program and earned the distinction of first electronic stored-program computer. Though the idea of a stored-program computer with combined memory for program and data was conceived during the development of ENIAC, it was not initially implemented in ENIAC because World War II priorities required the machine to be completed quickly, and ENIAC's 20 storage locations would be too small to hold data and programs.\nPublic knowledge.\nThe Z3 and Colossus were developed independently of each other, and of the ABC and ENIAC during World War II. Work on the ABC at Iowa State University was stopped in 1942 after John Atanasoff was called to Washington, D.C., to do physics research for the U.S. Navy, and it was subsequently dismantled. The Z3 was destroyed by the Allied bombing raids of Berlin in 1943. As the ten Colossus machines were part of the UK's war effort their existence remained secret until the late 1970s, although knowledge of their capabilities remained among their UK staff and invited Americans. ENIAC, by contrast, was put through its paces for the press in 1946, \"and captured the world's imagination\". Older histories of computing may therefore not be comprehensive in their coverage and analysis of this period. All but two of the Colossus machines were dismantled in 1945; the remaining two were used to decrypt Soviet messages by GCHQ until the 1960s. The public demonstration for ENIAC was developed by Snyder and Jennings who created a demo that would calculate the trajectory of a missile in 15 seconds, a task that would have taken several weeks for a human computer.\nPatent.\nFor a variety of reasons\u00a0\u2013 including Mauchly's June 1941 examination of the Atanasoff\u2013Berry computer (ABC), prototyped in 1939 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry\u00a0\u2013 https:// for ENIAC, applied for in 1947 and granted in 1964, was voided by the 1973 decision of the landmark federal court case \"Honeywell, Inc. v. Sperry Rand Corp.\". The decision included: that the ENIAC inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from Atanasoff; gave legal recognition to Atanasoff as the inventor of the first electronic digital computer; and put the invention of the electronic digital computer in the public domain.\nMain parts.\nThe main parts were 40 panels and three portable function tables (named A, B, and C). The layout of the panels was (clockwise, starting with the left wall):\nAn IBM card reader was attached to Constant Transmitter panel 3 and an IBM card punch was attached to Printer Panel 2. The Portable Function Tables could be connected to Function Table 1, 2, and 3.\nParts on display.\nPieces of ENIAC are held by the following institutions:\nRecognition.\nENIAC was named an IEEE Milestone in 1987.\nIn 1996, in honor of the ENIAC's 50th anniversary, The University of Pennsylvania sponsored a project named \"ENIAC-on-a-Chip\", where a very small silicon computer chip measuring 7.44\u00a0mm by 5.29\u00a0mm was built with the same functionality as ENIAC. Although this 20\u00a0MHz chip was many times faster than ENIAC, it had but a fraction of the speed of its contemporary microprocessors in the late 1990s.\nIn 1997, the six women who did most of the programming of ENIAC were inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame. The role of the ENIAC programmers is treated in a 2010 documentary film titled \"\" by LeAnn Erickson. A 2014 documentary short, \"The Computers\" by Kate McMahon, tells of the story of the six programmers; this was the result of 20 years' research by Kathryn Kleiman and her team as part of the ENIAC Programmers Project. In 2022 Grand Central Publishing released \"Proving Ground\" by Kathy Kleiman, a hardcover biography about the six ENIAC programmers and their efforts to translate block diagrams and electronic schematics of the ENIAC, then under construction, into programs that would be loaded into and run on ENIAC once it was available for use.\nIn 2011, in honor of the 65th anniversary of the ENIAC's unveiling, the city of Philadelphia declared February 15 as ENIAC Day.\nThe ENIAC celebrated its 70th anniversary on February 15, 2016.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "66575", "revid": "38556235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66575", "title": "Nutrient", "text": "Substance that an organism uses to live\nA nutrient is a substance used by an organism to survive, grow and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to animals, plants, fungi and protists. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for metabolic purposes or excreted by cells to create non-cellular structures such as hair, scales, feathers, or exoskeletons. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted into smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy such as for carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and fermentation products (ethanol or vinegar) leading to end-products of water and carbon dioxide. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the amino acids that are combined to create proteins, a subset of fatty acids, vitamins and certain minerals. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. Fungi live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.\nDifferent types of organisms have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is essential to humans and some animal species but most other animals and many plants are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be organic or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as iron, selenium, and zinc, while organic nutrients include, protein, fats, sugars and vitamins.\nA classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into macronutrients and micronutrients. Consumed in relatively large amounts (grams or ounces), macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water) are primarily used to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts (milligrams or micrograms); they have subtle biochemical and physiological roles in cellular processes, like vascular functions or nerve conduction. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes such as the United States Dietary Reference Intake, are based on the amount required to prevent deficiency and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and upper limits of intake. In many countries, regulations require that food product labels display information about the amount of any macronutrients and micronutrients present in the food in significant quantities. Nutrients in larger quantities than the body needs may have harmful effects. Edible plants also contain thousands of compounds generally called phytochemicals which have unknown effects on disease or health including a diverse class with non-nutrient status called polyphenols which remain poorly understood as of 2024.\nTypes.\nMacronutrients.\nMacronutrients are defined in several ways.\nMacronutrients provide energy:\nMicronutrients.\nMicronutrients are essential dietary elements required in varying quantities throughout life to serve metabolic and physiological functions.\nEssentiality.\nEssential nutrients.\nAn essential nutrient is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body\u00a0\u2013 either at all or in sufficient quantities\u00a0\u2013 and thus must be obtained from a dietary source. Apart from water, which is universally required for the maintenance of homeostasis in mammals, essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular metabolic processes and for the maintenance and function of tissues and organs. The nutrients considered essential for humans comprise nine amino acids, two fatty acids, thirteen vitamins, fifteen minerals and choline. In addition, there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states.\nAmino acids.\nAn essential amino acid is an amino acid that is required by an organism but cannot be synthesized \"de novo\" by it, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. Out of the twenty standard protein-producing amino acids, nine cannot be endogenously synthesized by humans: phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, and histidine.\nFatty acids.\nEssential fatty acids (EFAs) are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them. Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid).\nVitamins and vitamers.\nVitamins occur in a variety of related forms known as vitamers. The vitamers of a given vitamin perform the functions of that vitamin and prevent symptoms of deficiency of that vitamin. Vitamins are those essential organic molecules that are not classified as amino acids or fatty acids. They commonly function as enzymatic cofactors, metabolic regulators or antioxidants. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. vitamin E includes tocopherols and tocotrienols): vitamins A, C, D, E, K, thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.\nMinerals.\nMinerals are the exogenous chemical elements indispensable for life. Although the four elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (CHON) are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. Sulfur is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.\nThe essential nutrient trace elements for humans, listed in order of recommended dietary allowance (expressed as a mass), are potassium, chloride, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, and selenium. Additionally, cobalt is a component of vitamin B12 which is essential. There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as boron and silicon.\nCholine.\nCholine is an essential nutrient. The cholines are a family of water-soluble quaternary ammonium compounds. Choline is the parent compound of the cholines class, consisting of ethanolamine having three methyl substituents attached to the amino function. Healthy humans fed artificially composed diets that are deficient in choline develop fatty liver, liver damage, and muscle damage. Choline was not initially classified as essential because the human body can produce choline in small amounts through phosphatidylcholine metabolism.\nConditionally essential.\nConditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include premature birth, limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states. Inositol, taurine, arginine, glutamine and nucleotides are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.\nNon-essential.\nNon-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health. Dietary fiber is not absorbed in the human digestive tract. Soluble fiber is metabolized to butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids by bacteria residing in the large intestine. Soluble fiber is marketed as serving a prebiotic function with claims for promoting \"healthy\" intestinal bacteria.\nNon-nutrients.\nEthanol (C2H5OH) is not an essential nutrient, but it does supply approximately of food energy per gram. For spirits (vodka, gin, rum, etc.) a standard serving in the United States is , which at 40%ethanol (80proof) would be 14 grams and . At 50%alcohol, 17.5\u00a0g and . Wine and beer contain a similar amount of ethanol in servings of , respectively, but these beverages also contribute to food energy intake from components other than ethanol. A serving of wine contains . A serving of beer contains . \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on NHANES 2013\u20132014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8grams of alcohol per day and men consume on average 15.5 grams per day. Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol contributions to daily food energy intake are , respectively. Alcoholic beverages are considered empty calorie foods because, while providing energy, they contribute no essential nutrients.\nBy definition, phytochemicals include all nutritional and non-nutritional components of edible plants. Included as nutritional constituents are provitamin A carotenoids, whereas those without nutrient status are diverse polyphenols, flavonoids, resveratrol, and lignans that are present in numerous plant foods. Some phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human diseases and health. However, the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly defined properties \"in vivo\" is that they must first be defined with a Dietary Reference Intake level to enable accurate food labeling, a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to provide antioxidant benefits.\nDeficiencies and toxicity.\n\"See Vitamin, Mineral (nutrient), Protein (nutrient)\"\nAn inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to several causes, including an inadequacy in nutrient intake, called a dietary deficiency, or any of several conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism. Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater-than-normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion. Nutrient toxicity occurs when excess consumption of a nutrient does harm to an organism.\nIn the United States and Canada, recommended dietary intake levels of essential nutrients are based on the minimum level that \"will maintain a defined level of nutriture in an individual\", a definition somewhat different from that used by the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of a \"basal requirement to indicate the level of intake needed to prevent pathologically relevant and clinically detectable signs of a dietary inadequacy\".\nIn setting human nutrient guidelines, government organizations do not necessarily agree on amounts needed to avoid deficiency or maximum amounts to avoid the risk of toxicity. For example, for vitamin C, recommended intakes range from 40\u00a0mg/day in India to 155\u00a0mg/day for the European Union. The table below shows U.S. Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals, PRIs for the European Union (same concept as RDAs), followed by what three government organizations deem to be the safe upper intake. RDAs are set higher than EARs to cover people with higher-than-average needs. Adequate Intakes (AIs) are set when there is insufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs. Countries establish tolerable upper intake levels, also referred to as upper limits (ULs), based on amounts that cause adverse effects. Governments are slow to revise information of this nature. For the U.S. values, except calcium and vitamin D, all data date from 1997 to 2004.\nEAR U.S. Estimated Average Requirements.\nRDA U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances; higher for adults than children and may be even higher for pregnant or lactating women.\nAI U.S. Adequate Intake; AIs are established when there is insufficient information to set EARs and RDAs.\nPRI Population Reference Intake is the European Union equivalent of RDA; it is higher for adults than for children and maybe even higher for pregnant or lactating women. For Thiamin and Niacin, the PRIs are expressed as amounts per megajoule (239 kilocalories) of food energy consumed.\nUpper Limit Tolerable upper intake levels.\nND ULs have not been determined.\nNE EARs, PRIs, or AIs have not yet been established or will not be (EU does not consider chromium an essential nutrient).\nPlant.\nPlants absorb carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen from air and soil as carbon dioxide and water. Other nutrients are absorbed from soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants). Counting these, there are 17 important nutrients for plants: these are macronutrients; nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), oxygen(O) and hydrogen (H), and the micronutrients; iron (Fe), boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo) and nickel (Ni). In addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, these six are the elemental macronutrients for all organisms.\nThey are sourced from inorganic matter (for example, carbon dioxide, water, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates, and diatomic molecules of nitrogen and, especially, oxygen) and organic compounds such as acids, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This contrasts with the temperate or polar regions of Earth, where the Sun can never be directly overhead. Because of Earth's axial tilt, the width of the tropics (in latitude) is twice the tilt. The tropics are also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone (see geographical zone).\nDue to the sun's high angle throughout the year, the tropics receive the most solar energy over the course of the year, and consequently have the highest temperatures on the planet. Even when not directly overhead, the sun is still close to overhead throughout the year, therefore the tropics also have the lowest seasonal variation on the planet; \"winter\" and \"summer\" lose their temperature contrast. Instead, seasons are more commonly divided by precipitation variations than by temperature variations or daylight hours.\nThe tropics maintain wide diversity of local climates, such as rain forests, monsoons, savannahs, deserts, and high altitude snow-capped mountains. The word \"tropical\" can specifically refer to certain kinds of weather, rather than to the geographic region; these usages ought not be confused.\nThe Earth's axial tilt is currently around 23.4\u00b0, and therefore so are the latitudes of the tropical circles, marking the boundary of the tropics: specifically, \u00b1\u00b0\u2032\u2033\u00a0(or\u00a0\u00b0). The northern one is called the Tropic of Cancer, and the southern is the Tropic of Capricorn. As the Earth's axial tilt changes, so too do the tropical and polar circles.\nThe tropics constitute 39.8% of Earth's surface area and contain 36% of Earth's landmass. As of 2014[ [update]], the region was home also to 40% of the world's population, and this figure was then projected to reach 50% by 2050. Because of global warming, the weather conditions of the tropics are expanding with areas in the subtropics, having more extreme weather events such as heatwaves and more intense storms. These changes in weather conditions may make certain parts of the tropics uninhabitable.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"tropic\" comes via Latin from Ancient Greek (), meaning \"to turn\" or \"change direction\".\nAstronomical definition.\nThe tropics are defined as the region between the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere at \u00b0\u2032\u2033\u00a0(or\u00a0\u00b0) N and the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere at \u00b0\u2032\u2033\u00a0(or\u00a0\u00b0) S; these latitudes correspond to the axial tilt of the Earth.\nThe Tropic of Cancer is the Northernmost latitude from which the Sun can ever be seen directly overhead, and the Tropic of Capricorn is the Southernmost. This means that the tropical zone includes everywhere on Earth which is a subsolar point at least once during the solar year. Thus the maximum latitudes of the tropics have equal distances from the equator on either side. Likewise, they approximate the angle of the Earth's axial tilt. This angle is not perfectly fixed, mainly due to the influence of the moon, but the limits of the tropics are a geographic convention, and their variance from the true latitudes is very small.\nSeasons and climate.\nMany tropical areas have both a dry and a wet season. The wet season, rainy season or green season is the time of year, ranging from one or more months when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. Areas with wet seasons are disseminated across portions of the tropics and subtropics, some even in temperate regions. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, for tropical climates, a wet-season month is defined as one or more months where average precipitation is or more. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons see a break in rainfall during mid-season when the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon trough moves poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season; Typical vegetation in these areas ranges from moist seasonal tropical forests to savannahs.When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, precipitation falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves and vegetation grows significantly due to the wet season supplementing flora, leading to crop yields late in the season. Floods and rains cause rivers to overflow their banks, and some animals to retreat to higher ground. Soil nutrients are washed away and erosion increases. The incidence of malaria increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.\nHowever, regions within the tropics may well not have a tropical climate. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, much of the area within the geographical tropics is classed not as \"tropical\" but as \"dry\" (arid or semi-arid), including the Sahara Desert, the Atacama Desert and Australian Outback. Also, there are alpine tundra and snow-capped peaks, including Mauna Kea, Mount Kilimanjaro, Puncak Jaya and the Andes as far south as the northernmost parts of Chile and Peru.\nClimate change.\nThe climate is changing in the tropics, as it is in the rest of the world. The effects of steadily rising concentrations of greenhouse gases on the climate may be less obvious to tropical residents, however, because they are overlain by considerable natural variability. Much of this variability is driven by the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The Tropics has warmed by 0.7\u20130.8\u00a0\u00b0C over the last century\u2014only slightly less than the global average\u2014but a strong El Ni\u00f1o made 1998 the warmest year in most areas, with no significant warming since. Climate models predict a further 1\u20132\u00a0\u00b0C warming by 2050 and 1\u20134\u00a0\u00b0C by 2100.\nEcosystems.\nTropical plants and animals are those species native to the tropics. Tropical ecosystems may consist of tropical rainforests, seasonal tropical forests, dry (often deciduous) forests, spiny forests, deserts, savannahs, grasslands and other habitat types. There are often wide areas of biodiversity, and species endemism present, particularly in rainforests and seasonal forests. Some examples of important biodiversity and high-endemism ecosystems are El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico, Costa Rican and Nicaraguan rainforests, Amazon rainforest territories of several South American countries, Madagascar dry deciduous forests, the Waterberg Biosphere of South Africa, and eastern Madagascar rainforests. Often the soils of tropical forests are low in nutrient content, making them quite vulnerable to slash-and-burn deforestation techniques, which are sometimes an element of shifting cultivation agricultural systems.\nIn biogeography, the tropics are divided into Paleotropics (Africa, Asia and Australia) and Neotropics (Caribbean, Central America, and South America). Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Pantropic. The system of biogeographic realms differs somewhat; the Neotropical realm includes both the Neotropics and temperate South America, and the Paleotropics correspond to the Afrotropical, Indomalayan, Oceanian, and tropical Australasian realms.\nFlora.\nFlora are plants found in a specific region at a specific time. Some well-known plants that are exclusively found in, originate from, or are often associated with the tropics include:\nTropicality.\nTropicality refers to the image of the tropics that people from outside the tropics have of the region, ranging from critical to verging on fetishism. Tropicality gained renewed interest in geographical discourse when French geographer Pierre Gourou published \"Les pays tropicaux\" (\"The Tropical World\" in English), in the late 1940s.\nTropicality encompassed two major images. One, is that the tropics represent a 'Garden of Eden', a heaven on Earth, a land of rich biodiversity or a tropical paradise. The alternative is that the tropics consist of wild, unconquerable nature. The latter view was often discussed in old Western literature more so than the first. Evidence suggests over time that the view of the tropics as such in popular literature has been supplanted by more well-rounded and sophisticated interpretations.\nWestern scholars tried to theorise why tropical areas were relatively more inhospitable to human civilisations than colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. A popular explanation focused on the differences in climate. Tropical jungles and rainforests have much more humid and hotter weather than colder and drier temperaments of the Northern Hemisphere, giving to a more diverse biosphere. This theme led some scholars to suggest that humid hot climates correlate to human populations lacking control over nature e.g. 'the wild Amazonian rainforests'.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was Israel's first and, to date, only female head of government. \nBorn into a Jewish family in Kiev (within present-day Ukraine), Russian Empire, Meir immigrated with her family to the United States in 1906. She graduated from the Milwaukee State Normal School and found work as a teacher. While in Milwaukee, she embraced the Labor Zionist movement. In 1921, Meir and her husband immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, settling in Merhavia, later becoming the kibbutz's representative to the Histadrut. In 1934, she was elevated to the executive committee of the trade union. Meir held several key roles in the Jewish Agency during and after World War II. She was a signatory of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, in 1948. Meir was elected to the Knesset, in 1949, and served as Labor Minister until 1956, when she was appointed Foreign Minister by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. She retired from the ministry in 1966 due to ill health.\nIn 1969, Meir assumed the role of prime minister following the death of Levi Eshkol. Early in her tenure, she made multiple diplomatic visits to western leaders to promote her vision of peace in the region. The outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 caught Israel off guard and inflicted severe early losses on the army. The resulting public anger damaged Meir's reputation and led to an inquiry into the failings. Her Alignment coalition was denied a majority in the subsequent legislative election; she resigned the following year and was succeeded as prime minister by Yitzhak Rabin. Meir died in 1978 of lymphoma and was buried on Mount Herzl.\nA controversial figure in Israel, Meir has been lionized as a founder of the state and described as the \"Iron Lady\" of Israeli politics, but also widely blamed for the country being caught by surprise during the war of 1973. In addition, her dismissive statements towards the Palestinians have been described as the most famous example of Israeli denial of Palestinian identity. Most historians believe Meir was more successful as Minister of Labour and Housing than as Premier.\nEarly life.\nMeir was born Golda Mabovitch on 3 May 1898 into a Jewish family in downtown Kiev in present-day Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. Her parents were Blume Neiditch (died 1951) and Moshe Yitzhak Mabovitch (died 1944), a carpenter. Meir wrote in her autobiography that her earliest memories were of Moshe boarding up the front door in response to rumours of an imminent pogrom. She was named after Blume's paternal grandmother, Golde. She had two sisters, Sheyna (born 1889) and Tzipke (later known as Clara; born 1902), as well as five other siblings who died in infancy.\nMoshe left Russia to find work in New York City, United States, in 1903. In his absence, the rest of the family moved to Pinsk, a city in present-day Belarus, to join Blume's family. In 1905, Moshe moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in search of higher-paying work and found employment in the workshops of the local railroad yard. The following year, he had saved up enough money to bring his family to the United States. Meir, along with Blume, Sheyna, and Tzipke, landed in Quebec and traveled to Milwaukee by train.\nBlume ran a grocery store on Milwaukee's north side. By the age of eight, Meir was often put in charge of watching the store when Blume went to buy supplies. Meir attended the Fourth Street Grade School, which is now known by the Golda Meir School, from 1906 to 1912. A leader early on, she and a close friend, Regina Hamburger, organized the American Young Sisters Society, a fundraiser to pay for her classmates' textbooks in 1908. As part of the organization's activities, Meir rented a hall and scheduled a public meeting for the event. She graduated as valedictorian of her class despite frequent tardiness due to having to work in Blume's store.\nIn 1912, Meir began studying at North Division High School and worked part-time. Her employers included Schuster's department store and the Milwaukee Public Library. Blume wanted Meir to leave school and marry, but the latter declined.\nThe following year, Meir took a train to live with her married sister, Sheyna Korngold, in Denver, Colorado. She attended North High School there. The Korngolds held intellectual evenings at their home, where she was exposed to debates on Zionism, literature, women's suffrage, trade unionism, and more. In her autobiography, Meir wrote: \"To the extent that my own future convictions were shaped and given form\u00a0 ... those talk-filled nights in Denver played a considerable role.\" Around 1913, she began dating Morris Meyerson, a sign painter and socialist.\nReturn to Milwaukee, Zionist activism, and teaching.\nIn 1914, after disagreements with her sister, Golda left North High School, moved out of her sister's home, and found work. After reconciling with her parents, she returned to Milwaukee and resumed studies at North Division High, graduating in 1915. While there, she became an active member of Young Poale Zion, which later became Habonim, the Labor Zionist youth movement. She spoke at public meetings and embraced Socialist Zionism.\nShe attended the teachers college Milwaukee State Normal School (now University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee) in 1916, and likely part of 1917. In 1917, she took a position at a Yiddish-speaking \"Folks Schule\" in Milwaukee. There, she further embraced Labor Zionism.\nOn 9 July 1917, Golda became a naturalized US citizen, as her father had naturalized, and at that time children of naturalized citizens under the age of 21 received citizenship by descent.\nOn 24 December 1917, Meir and Meyerson married. However, Meir's precondition for marriage was to settle in Palestine. She had intended to make \"aliyah\" (immigration to Israel) straight away, but her plans were disrupted when all transatlantic passenger services were canceled due to the entry of the United States into the First World War. She then threw her energies into Poale Zion activities. A short time after their wedding, she embarked on a fund-raising campaign for Poale Zion that took her across the United States.\nImmigration to Mandatory Palestine.\nIn 1921, after the conclusion of the war, the couple moved to Palestine, then part of the British Mandate, along with Meir's sister Sheyna, Sheyna's daughter, and Meir's childhood friend Regina. They sailed on the SS \"Pocahontas\", from New York to Naples, then from there to Tel Aviv by train. Meir's parents subsequently moved to Palestine in 1926.\nThey were eventually accepted into kibbutz Merhavia in the Jezreel Valley after an initial rejected application. Her duties included picking almonds, planting trees, working in the chicken coops, and running the kitchen. Recognizing her leadership abilities, the kibbutz chose her as its representative to the Histadrut, the General Federation of Labour.\nIn 1924, the couple left the kibbutz and lived briefly in Tel Aviv before settling in Jerusalem. There, they had two children: a son Menachem in 1924, and a daughter Sarah in 1926. Meir returned to Merhavia for a brief period in 1925.\nEarly political career.\nIn 1928, Meir was elected secretary of \"Moetzet HaPoalot\" (Working Women's Council). She spent two years (1932\u201334) in the United States as an emissary for the organization and to get expert medical treatment for her daughter's kidney illness.\nIn 1934, when Meir returned from the United States, she joined the Executive Committee of the Histadrut and moved up the ranks to become the head of its Political Department. This appointment was important training for her future role in Israeli leadership.\nIn July 1938, Meir was the Jewish observer from Palestine at the \u00c9vian Conference, called by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States to discuss the question of Jewish refugees' fleeing Nazi persecution. Delegates from the 32 invited countries repeatedly expressed their sorrow for the plight of the European Jews, but refused to admit the refugees. The only exception was the Dominican Republic, which pledged to accept 100,000 refugees on generous terms. Meir was disappointed at the outcome and she remarked to the press, \"There is only one thing I hope to see before I die and that is that my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore.\"\nThroughout World War II, Meir served several key roles in the Jewish Agency, which functioned as the arm of the Zionist Organization in British Palestine.\nIn June 1946, Meir became acting head of the Political Department of the Jewish Agency after the British arrested Moshe Sharett and other leaders of the Yishuv as part of Operation Agatha. This was a critical moment in her career: she became the principal negotiator between the Jews in Palestine and the British Mandatory authorities. After his release, Sharett went to the United States to attend talks on the UN Partition Plan, leaving Meir to head the Political Department until the establishment of the state in 1948.\nIn 1947, she traveled to Cyprus to meet Jewish detainees of the Cyprus internment camps, who had been interned by the British after being caught trying to illegally enter Palestine, and persuade them to give priority to families with children to fill the small quota of detainees allowed into Palestine. She was largely successful in this task.\nRole in the Palestine War and the establishment of Israel.\nOn 17 November 1947, shortly before the outbreak of the 1947-1949 Palestine war, Meir met with King Abdullah I of Jordan. Abdullah I was seen as the only Arab leader willing to ally with a future Israeli state, as he also opposed the Mufti of Jerusalem and was rivals with other Arab countries. The meeting was cordial and confirmed that Abdullah was uninterested in invading and quietly willing to cooperate in the future.\nFirst phase of the war.\nFor most of the war, Meir reluctantly played what she felt was a minor role in Israel's activities. An article published by the Golda Meir institute said \"she felt she was being pushed aside to a secondary arena\".\nHowever, she played a critical role in fundraising. In January 1948, the Jewish Agency needed to raise funds for the continuing war and the coming Israeli state. The treasurer of the Jewish Agency was convinced that they would not be able to raise more than $7 to $8 million from the American Jewish community. Meir raised over $30 million. Key to her success was an emotional speech she first delivered in Chicago on 22 January. She toured dozens of cities in the United States and returned to Israel on 18 March.\nThe funds were critical to the success of the war effort and the establishment of Israel; by comparison, the opposing Arab Higher Committee's annual budget was around $2.25 million, similar to Haganah's annual budget before the war. Ben-Gurion wrote that Meir's role as the \"Jewish woman who got the money which made the state possible\" would go down in history.\nHowever, upon returning home, she suffered a political setback. The Jewish Agency and National Council Executives excluded her from the 13-member cabinet of the provisional government of Israel, and included her instead in the 37-member People's Council. Ben-Gurion protested this, saying \"It is inconceivable that there shall be no adequate woman\u2026it is a moral and political necessity, for the Yishuv, the Jewish world and the Arab world.\" At one point, he even considered offering her his spot on the cabinet.\nOn 13 April, she was hospitalized in Tel Aviv due to a suspected heart attack. Ben-Gurion and the political department heads urged her to guard her health and come to Jerusalem as soon as she could. They asked her to be \"the mother of this city\", and that her \"words to 100,000 residents will be a source of blessing and encouragement\". However, she felt it was a secondary and temporary role.\nInstead, on 6 May, she visited Haifa after its 22 April occupation by Haganah. Meir called the mass expulsion and flight of Arabs before the 1948 Palestine war \"dreadful\", and likened it to what befell the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. She returned to Tel Aviv, and eventually to Jerusalem two weeks before the end of the mandate.\nOn the 11th of May, alongside Ezra Danin, Meir had a second meeting with Abdullah I. Abdullah had refused to meet her at Naharayim again, citing safety concerns, and told her that if she wanted to meet with him she would need to make her way to Amman. He had also refused to notify the Arab Legion of her arrival, forcing Meir to travel to Amman in secret disguised as an Arab woman.\nThe two met Abdullah in the home of an associate of Danin. According to Meir's account, when asked if Abdullah would break the promise he made to her at Naharayim, he responded by claiming that he had made the promise when he was alone, but now he was \"one of five\", and that he did not have the capability to fulfill the promise alone. Abdullah asked Meir to let him integrate Jordan into Palestine, with Jews being granted representation in the Jordanian parliament, but Meir refused.\nBy the end of the meeting, the two failed to reach an agreement and Abdullah told Meir that he would be forced to invade due to pressure from the Arab League. Meir expressed that she would be open to meeting him again after Israel had won the war.\nSecond phase of the war and appointment to Minister Plenipotentiary.\nOn 14 May 1948, Meir became one of 24 signatories (including two women) of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. She later recalled, \"After I signed, I cried. When I studied American history as a schoolgirl and I read about those who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence, I couldn't imagine these were real people doing something real. And there I was sitting down and signing a declaration of establishment.\"\nA day after independence, the second phase of the war began. Meir also suddenly lost her job and administrative responsibilities, as the Political Department became the provisional Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and her leadership role in Jerusalem was taken over by Dov Yosef.\nOn 18 May, she embarked on a second and even more successful fundraising tour in which she raised around $50 million. In total, her fundraising efforts raised around $90 million, around a third of the cost of the war ($275 million). During preparations for this trip, she was issued the first Israeli passport. Over the ten weeks that she was gone, Israel was battered by the war and changed drastically. \nOn 25 June, while still in the United States, Meir was appointed by Sharett, then the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the minister plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union, which recently recognized Israel.\nMeir was displeased by the offer. In spite of being born in Russia, she spoke no Russian and feared being lonely in Moscow. She said \"At last we have a state. I want to be there. I don't want to go thousands of miles away. Why do I always have to go away?\"\nHer return to Israel was delayed due to a car crash in which she tore a ligament and fractured a bone. Soviet officials refused to believe she was in hospital and wanted an Israeli envoy as soon as possible. Thus she ignored doctor's orders to rest and returned to Israel on 29 July. Years later, her leg would frequently pain her.\nGovernment career before premiership.\nMinister Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union (1948\u20131949).\nMeir served as minister plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union from 2 September 1948 to 10 March 1949.\nShe was reportedly impatient with diplomatic niceties and using interpreters. She did not drink or ballroom dance and had little interest in gossip and fashion. According to her interpreter, when asked by a Russian ambassador how she traveled to Moscow, she responded \"tell His Excellency the Ambassador that we arrived riding on donkeys\". \nThis was an important and difficult role. Good relations with the Soviet Union impacted Israel's ability to secure arms from Eastern European countries. In turn, Joseph Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov saw its relationship with Israel as a means of furthering the Soviet position in the Middle East. However, Soviet\u2013Israeli relations were complicated by Soviet policies against religious institutions and nationalist movements, made manifest in actions to shut down Jewish religious institutions as well as the ban on Hebrew language study and the prohibition of promoting emigration to Israel.\nJust 20 days after her term began, antisemitic crackdowns began in response to an article by Soviet Jewish writer Ilya Ehrenburg. Meir and the other Israeli representatives responded by making a point of visiting Russian Jewish businesses, synagogues, and performances.\nOn 3 October, during Rosh Hashanah celebrations at the Moscow Choral Synagogue, she was mobbed by thousands of Russian Jews chanting in Russian \"Nasha Golda\", meaning \"Our Golda\". In her autobiography she said \"I felt as though I had been caught up in a torrent of love so strong that it had literally taken my breath away and slowed down my heart.\" This event was commemorated by the Israeli 10,000-shekel banknote issued in November 1984. It bore a portrait of Meir on one side and the image of the crowd greeting her in Moscow on the other.\nTo her close friends, she admitted she had little to do in Moscow and felt isolated from Israeli politics. Despite being a socialist that was born in Ukraine, her Jewish side caused friction with the Soviets that made progress difficult. By the end of her term, she felt she had accomplished little. She reportedly felt guilty for not achieving more for the Russian Jews, as she would have been in their situation if her father had not moved to the United States. \nShe planned to run for the first Knesset elections on 25 January 1949. The month before the elections, she returned to Israel and campaigned for Mapai. Mapai won 35% of the votes and formed a coalition, and Ben-Gurion invited her into the cabinet. She was sworn in on 8 March, and continued to serve in the Knesset until 1974.\nLabor Minister (1949\u20131956).\nBen-Gurion initially offered Meir the position of \"deputy prime minister\", which she rejected. She found the title and responsibilities vague, and disliked the idea of needing to coordinate with so many government departments.\nInstead, she took the role of Labor Minister, which she held from 10 March 1949 to 19 June 1956. Meir enjoyed this role much more than her previous, calling it her \"seven beautiful years\". In particular, she enjoyed the ability to act quickly and with little friction from others. She was also one of the most powerful Israeli politicians at the time. \nThe main source of friction in the role was funding, especially to deal with the millions of immigrants arriving in the new state. In October 1950, Meir announced in Washington a three-year-plan for Israel's development and stated a price tag of $15 billion over the next 15 years. The Israeli government managed to secure a loan from the United States government and American Jews that secured 40% of the budget. The newly created Israel Bonds only provided a small amount, although years later they would contribute billions to the Israeli economy.\nMeir assisted in building over a hundred ma'abarot (), temporary immigrant camps with crude tin-roofed huts and tents for housing. She drew criticism from many new immigrants and contemporary politicians due to this, but responded by pointing to her limited budget and the time needed to construct proper housing. In 1953, she assisted in an effort to eliminate the ma'abarot. By 1956, two-thirds were eliminated, and 120,000 families moved to permanent housing. \nMeir considered herself highly productive during this period. She carried out welfare state policies, orchestrated the integration of immigrants into Israel's workforce, and introduced major housing and road construction projects. From 1949 to 1956, 200,000 apartments and 30,000 houses were built, large industrial and agricultural developments were initiated, and new hospitals, schools, and roads were built. Despite the complaints of her colleagues in the Finance Ministry, Meir worked to establish social security, maternity benefits, work-related accident insurance, benefits to widows and orphans, and even burial costs. \nIn 1954, she sided with Ben-Gurion against Pinhas Lavon in the Lavon Affair. \nIn the summer of 1955, Meir reluctantly ran for the position of mayor of Tel Aviv on request of her party. At the time, mayors were elected by the city council and not directly. She lost by the two votes of the religious bloc who withheld their support on the grounds that she was a woman. While angered by the sexism she encountered, she was happy to rejoin her colleagues in the cabinet.\nOn 3 August 1955, she was again hospitalized after complaining of chest pains, and was diagnosed with arrhythmia.\nForeign minister (1956\u20131966).\nIn October 1955, Ben-Gurion appointed Meir as foreign minister, replacing Sharett. The occasional disagreements between Ben-Gurion and Sharett had escalated to snubbing in meetings and refusals to speak face-to-face. Meir, while less experienced in foreign affairs than Sharett, had a consistently loyal and friendly relationship with Ben-Gurion. While Meir eventually came to enjoy her new job, she disliked the lingering pro-Sharett colleagues in her department.\nMeir served as foreign minister from 18 June 1956 to 12 January 1966. Her first months as Foreign Minister coincided with the 1956 Suez Crisis, in which Israel, Britain, and France invaded Egypt to regain Western control over the Suez Canal, remove the President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser, and secure freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran for Israel. Meir planned and coordinated with the French government and military prior to the start of the invasion. During United Nations debates about the crisis, Meir took charge of the Israeli delegation. After the fighting started, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Nations forced the three invaders to withdraw.\nAs foreign minister, Meir promoted ties with the newly established states in Africa in an effort to gain allies in the international community. She also believed that Israel had experience in nation-building that could be a model for the Africans. In her autobiography, she wrote:Like them, we had shaken off foreign rule; like them, we had to learn for ourselves how to reclaim the land, how to increase the yields of our crops, how to irrigate, how to raise poultry, how to live together, and how to defend ourselves. Israel could be a role model because it had been forced to find solutions to the kinds of problems that large, wealthy, powerful states had never encountered.She also devoted much effort to convincing the United States to sell Israel weaponry. One success in this area came in 1962, when the White House quietly agreed to sell Hawk missiles to Israel. Israel's relationship with the Soviet Union remained frosty during her tenure.\nOn 29 October 1957, Meir's foot was slightly injured when a Mills bomb was thrown into the debating chamber of the Knesset. David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Carmel were more seriously injured. The attack was carried out by 25-year-old Moshe Dwek. Born in Aleppo, his motives were attributed to a dispute with the Jewish Agency, but he was described as being \"mentally unbalanced\".\nIn 1958, shortly after the death of Pope Pius XII, Meir praised the late pope for assisting the Jewish people. The pontiff's legacy as a wartime pope has continued to be controversial into the 21st century.\nThe same year, during the wave of Jewish migration from Poland to Israel, Meir sought to prevent disabled and sick Polish Jews from immigrating to Israel. In a letter sent to Israel's ambassador in Warsaw, Katriel Katz, she wrote:\nA proposal was raised in the coordination committee to inform the Polish government that we want to institute selection in aliyah, because we cannot continue accepting sick and handicapped people. Please give your opinion as to whether this can be explained to the Poles without hurting immigration.\"\nIn late 1965, 67-year-old Meir was diagnosed with lymphoma. In January 1966, she retired from her role as Foreign Minister, citing exhaustion and ill health, although she continued to serve in the Knesset and as secretary-general of Mapai.\nDuring the 1960s, Meir lived in a flat on the upper level of a house that was once known as Villa Harun al-Rashid. The house was built in 1926 by Hanna Bisharat and later rented to British officers. The house was later given to Zionist militias, due to the prominent view from the roof. According to Hanna Bisharat's grandson George Bisharat, Meir had the tiles on the house's front sandblasted \"to obliterate the 'Villa Harun ar-Rashid' and thereby conceal the fact that she was living in an Arab home.\"\nPremiership (1969\u20131974).\nPrime Minister Levi Eshkol died suddenly on 26 February 1969, leading to the appointment of Yigal Allon as interim prime minister and an election to replace him. Before the vote, most suspected that Meir would be elected. On 7 March 1969, the party's central committee voted Meir as the new party leader. Now age 71, Meir had mixed feelings due to her health concerns, but eventually agreed, saying that she would honor the party's decision just as she had honored all of the party's past decisions.\nMeir served as prime minister from 17 March 1969 to 3 June 1974. She maintained the national unity government formed in 1967 after the Six-Day War, in which Mapai merged with two other parties (Rafi and Ahdut HaAvoda) to form the Israeli Labor Party. \nSix months after taking office, Meir led the reconfigured Alignment, comprising Labor and Mapam, into the 1969 general election. The Alignment managed what is still the best showing for a single party or faction in Israeli history, winning 56 seats. This is the only time that a party or faction has approached winning an outright majority in an election. The national unity government was retained.\nIn 1969 and the early 1970s, Meir met with many world leaders to promote her peace settlement idea, including Richard Nixon (1969), Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu (1972) and Pope Paul\u00a0VI (1973). In 1973, she hosted the chancellor of West Germany, Willy Brandt, in Israel.\nIn August 1970, Meir accepted a U.S. peace initiative that called for an end to the War of Attrition and an Israeli pledge to withdraw to \"secure and recognized boundaries\" in the framework of a comprehensive peace settlement. The Gahal party quit the national unity government in protest, but Meir continued to lead the remaining coalition.\nOn February 28, 1973, during a visit in Washington, D.C., Meir agreed with Henry Kissinger's peace proposal based on \"security versus sovereignty\": Israel would accept Egyptian sovereignty over all Sinai, while Egypt would accept Israeli presence in some of Sinai's strategic positions.\n\"There was no such thing as Palestinians\".\nIn June 1969, on the second anniversary of the Six-Day War, Meir stated in an interview that \"there was no such thing as Palestinians\", a comment later described by Al Jazeera as \"one of her defining \u2013 and most damning \u2013 legacies.\" This phrase is considered to be the most famous example of Israeli denial of Palestinian identity.\nThe interview entitled \"Who can blame Israel\" was published in \"The Sunday Times\" on June 15, 1969, and included the following exchange:\nMunich Olympics (1972).\nIn the wake of the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics, Meir appealed to the world to \"save our citizens and condemn the unspeakable criminal acts committed\". Outraged at the perceived lack of global action, she ordered the Mossad to hunt down and assassinate suspected leaders and operatives of Black September and the PFLP.\nDispute with Austria (1973).\nDuring the 1970s, about 200,000 Soviet Jewish emigrants were allowed to leave the Soviet Union for Israel by way of Austria. When seven of these emigrants were taken hostage at the Austria\u2013Czechoslovakia border by Palestinian militants in September 1973, the Chancellor of Austria, Bruno Kreisky, closed the Jewish Agency's transit facility in Sch\u00f6nau, Austria. A few days later in Vienna, Meir tried to convince Kreisky to reopen the facility by appealing to his own Jewish origin, and described his position as \"succumbing to terrorist blackmail\". Kreisky did not change his position, so Meir returned to Israel, infuriated. A few months later, Austria opened a new transition camp.\nYom Kippur War (1973).\nA common criticism of Meir is that she could have avoided the Yom Kippur War in 1973. For months preceding the attack, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made repeated overtures for peace in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai, but these gestures were rebuffed by Meir, who had offered previously to discuss ceding \"most of the Sinai\", but was not willing to restore the pre-1967 borders, and Egypt had no interest in peace talks under Meir's conditions. As the nation's leader during this short war, her main goal was deciding on the timing of preliminary operations, and providing the IDF with the necessary time and munitions to pull off a victory. \nIn the days leading up to the Yom Kippur War, Israeli intelligence could not conclusively determine that an attack was imminent. However, on 5 October 1973, Meir received information that Syrian forces were massing on the Golan Heights. She was alarmed by the reports, and believed that the situation was similar to what preceded the Six-Day War. However, her advisers counseled her not to worry, saying they would have adequate notice before any war broke out. This made sense at the time; after the Six Day War, most in the Israeli intelligence community considered the Arabs unprepared to launch another attack. Consequently, although the Knesset passed a resolution granting her power to demand a full-scale call-up of the military (instead of the typical cabinet decision), Meir did not mobilize Israel's forces early. Soon, though, the threat of war became very clear. Six hours before the outbreak of hostilities, Meir met with Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan and General David Elazar. While Dayan continued to argue that war was unlikely and favored calling up the air force and only two divisions, Elazar advocated full-scale army mobilization and the launch of a full-scale preemptive strike on Syrian forces.\nOn October 6, Meir approved full-scale mobilizing but rejected a preemptive strike, citing concerns that Israel might be perceived as initiating hostilities, which would hurt Israel's access to crucial foreign aid and military support, in particular from the United States, in the resulting conflict. She made it a priority to inform Washington of her decision. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger later confirmed Meir's assessment by stating that if Israel had launched a preemptive strike, Israel would not have received the backing of the United States.\nResignation (1974).\nFollowing the Yom Kippur War, Meir's government was plagued by infighting and questions over Israel's lack of preparation for the war. The Agranat Commission appointed to investigate the war cleared Meir of \"direct responsibility\". It said about her actions on Yom Kippur morning:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHer party won the elections in December 1973, but the coalition lost seats and was unable to form a majority. Meir resigned as prime minister on 11 April 1974, and gave up her Knesset seat on 7 June 1974. She never held office again. She believed that was the \"will of the people\" and that she had served enough time as premier. She believed the government needed to form a coalition. She said, \"Five years are sufficient\u00a0 ... It is beyond my strength to continue carrying this burden.\" Yitzhak Rabin succeeded her on June 3, 1974.\nAfter premiership and death (1974\u20131978).\nIn 1975, Meir published her autobiography, \"My Life\", which became a \"New York Times\" Best Seller.\nOn 21 November 1977, Meir spoke at the Knesset on behalf of the Labor Party to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat during his historic trip as the first Arab leader to visit Israeli-controlled territory. She said his visit was important for the sake of the next generations' avoiding war, praised Sadat for his courage and vision, and expressed the hope that while many differences remained to be resolved, that vision would be achieved in a spirit of mutual understanding.\nOn 8 December 1978, Meir died of lymphatic cancer (lymphoma) in Jerusalem at the age of 80. She was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.\nPersonal life.\nMeir's husband Morris Meyerson (also \"Myerson\") was born on 17 December 1893 in Chicago, Illinois. They married on December 24, 1917, and remained married until his death in Jerusalem on 25 May 1951. She never remarried. Despite never divorcing, the couple grew apart over the course of the marriage. When Meir took her children with her to the United States in the 1930s, Morris stayed behind in Jerusalem. \nMeir had two children. Her son, Menachem, was born in Jerusalem in 1924 and died on 14 December 2014 in Tel Aviv. He was a professional cellist who studied at the Israel Conservatory and Manhattan School of Music. Her daughter Sarah was born on 17 May 1926 and died on 30 January 2010 in Revivim. \nShe had two sisters, Sheyna (1889\u20131972) and Tzipke (1902\u20131981), as well as five other siblings who died in childhood.\nMorris, Sheyna Korngold and her husband Shamai were buried on Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery in Givatayim.\nIn 1956, after becoming Foreign Minister, she changed her surname from \"Meyerson\" to \"Meir\", meaning \"illuminate\", as her predecessor Moshe Sharett had all members of the foreign service take a Hebrew surname.\nShe was a heavy smoker and coffee drinker, and did not exercise often, which may have contributed to her recurring heart problems.\nOf her Jewish identity, Meir said in the 1975 edition of her autobiography \"My Life\" that:It is not only a matter, I believe, of religious observance and practice. To me, being Jewish means and has always meant being proud to be part of a people that has maintained its distinct identity for more than 2,000 years, with all the pain and torment that has been inflicted upon it.\nShe strongly identified with Judaism culturally, but was an atheist in religious belief. She is famously reported to have stated: \"I believe in the Jewish people, and the Jewish people believe in God.\" In her later years she widened her religious attitude, especially concerning the State of Israel: \"This country exists as the fulfillment of a promise made by God himself. It would be ridiculous to ask it to account for its legitimacy.\"\nAwards and recognition.\nIn 1974, Meir was awarded the honor of World Mother by American Mothers.\nIn 1974 Meir was awarded the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service by Princeton University's American Whig\u2013Cliosophic Society.\nIn 1975, Meir was awarded the Israel Prize for her special contribution to society and the State of Israel.\nIn 1985, Meir was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.\nLegacy.\nBiographer Meron Medzini argues that a perspective of forty years makes possible an appreciation of her deep nationalism and Zionism. Historians find her main legacy includes effective leadership of the Labor Movement, and building good relationships with Third World nations. Medzini states, \"Apart from laying the foundations for Israel\u2019s presence in Africa, she was never taken with the routine and often dull diplomatic work in the Foreign Ministry and abhorred its outer manifestations of ceremonies and rites.\" Most historians agree she was a success as Secretary of Labor and Housing, but a failure as prime minister.\nA controversial figure in Israel, she has been lionized as a founder of the state and described as the \"Iron Lady\" of Israeli politics, but also widely blamed for the country being caught by surprise during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. She was also criticized for her dismissive statements towards the Palestinians.\nPortrayals in film and theater.\nMeir's story has been the subject of many fictionalized portrayals. In 1977, Anne Bancroft played Meir in William Gibson's Broadway play \"Golda\". The Australian actress Judy Davis played a young Meir in the television film \"A Woman Called Golda\" (1982), opposite Leonard Nimoy. Ingrid Bergman played the older Meir in the same film. Actress Colleen Dewhurst portrayed Meir in the 1986 TV movie \"Sword of Gideon\".\nIn 2003, American Jewish actress Tovah Feldshuh portrayed her on Broadway in \"Golda's Balcony\", Gibson's second play about Meir's life. The play was controversial for implying that Meir considered using nuclear weapons during the Yom Kippur War. Valerie Harper portrayed Meir in the touring company production and in the film version of \"Golda's Balcony\". In 2005, actress Lynn Cohen portrayed Meir in Steven Spielberg's film \"Munich\".\nTovah Feldshuh assumed the role of Meir again in the 2006 English-language French movie \"O Jerusalem\". She was played by the Polish actress Beata Fudalej in the 2009 dramatic film \"The Hope\" directed by M\u00e1rta M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros.\nEnglish actor Helen Mirren portrayed Meir in the 2023 biopic film \"Golda\", directed by Guy Nattiv and produced by Michael Kuhn. The film centres on the Yom Kippur War.\nAs of April 2021, a TV miniseries \"Lioness\" starring Shira Haas is also currently being produced and will be directed by Barbra Streisand.\nCultural references.\nIn Israel, the term \"Golda's shoes\" (\"na'alei Golda\") has become a reference to the sturdy orthopedic shoes that Golda favored. These shoes were also supplied to women soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces from its foundation to 1987.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66584", "revid": "29566584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66584", "title": "Northamptonshire", "text": "County of England\nNorthamptonshire ( ; abbreviated Northants.) is a ceremonial county in the East Midlands of England. It is bordered by Leicestershire, Rutland and Lincolnshire to the north; Cambridgeshire to the east; Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire to the south; Oxfordshire to the south west; and Warwickshire to the west. Northampton is the largest settlement.\nThe county has an area of and had an estimated population of 813,682 in 2024. Northampton is located in the centre of the county, and its other principal towns include Corby and Kettering in the north-east and Wellingborough in the centre. The east and south-west are rural. For local government purposes Northamptonshire comprises two unitary authority areas, North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire. The county historically included Peterborough and its surrounding area, called the Soke.\nThe county is characterised by low, undulating hills, particularly to the west. They are the source of several rivers, including the Avon and Welland, which form much of the northern border; the Cherwell; and the Great Ouse. The River Nene is the principal river within the county, having its source in the southwest and flowing northeast past Northampton and Wellingborough. The highest point is Arbury Hill southwest of Daventry, at .\nThere are Iron Age and Roman remains in the county, and in the seventh century it was settled by the Angles and Saxons, becoming part of Mercia. The county likely has its origin in the Danelaw as the area controlled from Northampton, which was one of the Five Boroughs. In the later Middle Ages and Early Modern Period the county was relatively settled, although Northampton was the location of engagements, including the 1264 Battle of Northampton during the Second Barons' War, the 1460 Battle of Northampton during the Wars of the Roses, and the decisive Battle of Naseby which destroyed the main Royalist army during the First English Civil War. During the Industrial Revolution Northamptonshire became known for its footwear, and the contemporary county has a number of small industrial centres which specialise in engineering and food processing.\nHistory.\nMuch of Northamptonshire's countryside appears to have remained somewhat intractable as regards early human occupation, resulting in an apparently sparse population and relatively few finds from the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. In about 500 BC the Iron Age was introduced into the area by a continental people in the form of the Hallstatt culture, and over the next century a series of hill-forts were constructed at Arbury Banks (Arbury Camp), Rainsborough camp, Borough Hill, Castle Dykes, Guilsborough, Irthlingborough, and most notably of all, Hunsbury Hill. There are two more possible hill-forts at Arbury Hill (Badby) and Thenford.\nIn the 1st century BC, most of what later became Northamptonshire became part of the territory of the Catuvellauni, a Belgic tribe, the Northamptonshire area forming their most northerly possession. The Catuvellauni were conquered by the Romans in 43 AD.\nThe Roman road of Watling Street passed through the county, and an important Roman settlement, Lactodurum, stood on the site of modern-day Towcester. There were other Roman settlements at Northampton, Kettering and along the Nene Valley near Raunds. A large fort was built at Longthorpe.\nAfter the Romans left, the area eventually became part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, and Northampton functioned as an administrative centre. The Mercians converted to Christianity in 654 AD with the death of the pagan king Penda. From about 889 the area was conquered by the Danes (as at one point almost all of England was, except for Athelney marsh in Somerset) and became part of the Danelaw \u2013 with Watling Street serving as the boundary \u2013 until being recaptured by the English under the Wessex king Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, in 917. Northamptonshire was conquered again in 940, this time by the Vikings of York, who devastated the area, only for the county to be retaken by the English in 942.\nThe county was first recorded in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (1011), as \"Hamtunscire\": the \"scire\" (shire) of \"Hamtun\" (the homestead). The \"North\" was added to distinguish Northampton from the other important \"Hamtun\" further south: Southampton \u2013 though the origins of the two names are in fact different.\nRockingham Castle was built for William the Conqueror and was used as a Royal fortress until Elizabethan times. In 1460, during the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of Northampton took place and King Henry VI was captured. The now-ruined Fotheringhay Castle was used to imprison Mary, Queen of Scots, before her execution.\nDuring the English Civil War, Northamptonshire strongly supported the Parliamentarian cause, and the Royalist forces suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Naseby in 1645 in the north of the county. King Charles I was imprisoned at Holdenby House in 1647.\nGeorge Washington, the first President of the United States of America, was born into the Washington family who had migrated to America from Northamptonshire in 1656. George Washington's ancestor, Lawrence Washington, was Mayor of Northampton on several occasions and it was he who bought Sulgrave Manor from Henry VIII in 1539. It was George Washington's great-grandfather, John Washington, who emigrated in 1656 from Northamptonshire to Virginia. Before Washington's ancestors moved to Sulgrave, they lived in Warton, Lancashire.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, parts of Northamptonshire and the surrounding area became industrialised. The local specialisation was shoemaking and the leather industry and became one of Britain's major centres for these crafts by the 19th century. In the north of the county a large ironstone quarrying industry developed from 1850.\nIn 1823 Northamptonshire was said to \"[enjoy] a very pure and wholesome air\" because of its dryness and distance from the sea. Its livestock were celebrated: \"Horned cattle, and other animals, are fed to extraordinary sizes: and many horses of the large black breed are reared.\"\nNine years later, the county was described as \"a county enjoying the reputation of being one of the healthiest and pleasantest parts of England\" although the towns were \"of small importance\" with the exceptions of Peterborough and Northampton. In summer, the county hosted \"a great number of wealthy families... country seats and villas are to be seen at every step.\" Northamptonshire is still referred to as the county of \"spires and squires\" because of the numbers of stately homes and ancient churches.\nPrior to 1901 the ancient hundreds were disused. Northamptonshire was administered as four major divisions: Northern, Eastern, Mid, and Southern. During the 1930s, the town of Corby was established as a major centre of the steel industry. \nCorby was designated a new town in 1950 and Northampton followed in 1968. As of 2005[ [update]] the government is encouraging development in the South Midlands area, including Northamptonshire.\nPeterborough.\nThe city and Soke of Peterborough were part of the historic county of Northamptonshire; from the time that formal county boundaries were established by the Normans in the 11th century, to 1965. The Church of England Diocese of Peterborough that covers Northamptonshire is still centred at Peterborough Cathedral. The city of Peterborough had its own courts of quarter sessions and, from 1889, the Soke had its own county council, Soke of Peterborough County Council, making it an autonomous district of Northamptonshire.\nIn 1965, the Soke of Peterborough was abolished by the Local Government Boundary Commission; the city of Peterborough and the surrounding villages that were previously part of the Soke, were transferred to the newly created county of Huntingdon and Peterborough.\nThe new county of Huntingdon and Peterborough was short lived; it was abolished in 1974. Upon its abolishment, the city of Peterborough and the other settlements that were once part of the former Soke, were transferred to the county of Cambridgeshire, instead of being transferred back to Northamptonshire. Additionally, the former historical county of Huntingdonshire, which had been abolished along with the Soke of Peterborough in 1965 to create the County of Huntingdon and Peterborough, was not reinstated as a Shire county in its own right in 1974. Instead, Huntingdonshire was transferred to and became a district of Cambridgeshire.\nSince 1965, Northamptonshire has been one of the small number of English counties that does not contain a city.\nLittle Bowden.\nIn 1879, a local government district was created covering the three parishes of Market Harborough and Great Bowden and Little Bowden. When elected county councils were established in 1889, local government districts were placed entirely in one county, and thus the parish of Little Bowden, a neighbourhood of Market Harborough, was transferred from Northamptonshire to Leicestershire.\nStamford.\nUntil 1832 and 1835, Stamford Baron St Martin which forms the southern part of the town of Stamford in Lincolnshire was part of Northamptonshire as St Martin's Without. It was later incorporated into the then Municipal Borough of Stamford under the then Parts of Kesteven.\nGeography.\nNorthamptonshire is a landlocked county in the southern part of the East Midlands, sometimes known as the South Midlands. The county contains the watershed between the River Severn and The Wash, and several important rivers have their sources in the north-west of the county, including the River Nene, which flows north-eastwards to The Wash, and the Warwickshire Avon, which flows south-west to the Severn. In 1830, it was boasted that \"not a single brook, however insignificant, flows into it from any other district\". In the west of the county, the hills most commonly referred to as the Northamptonshire Uplands can be found, in this area, the highest point in the county, Arbury Hill, at , can be found, just to the south of Daventry. The boundary with Lincolnshire is England's shortest ceremonial county boundary, at . \nThere are several towns in the county, Northampton being the largest and most populous. \nAs of 2010 there were 16 settlements in Northamptonshire with a town charter:\nClimate.\nLike the rest of the British Isles, Northamptonshire has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The table below shows the average weather for Northamptonshire from the Moulton weather station.\nGovernance.\nLocal government.\nBetween 1974 and 2021 Northamptonshire, like most English counties, had a two-tier structure of local government. The county had an elected county council based in Northampton. Seven district and borough councils covered 15 towns and hundreds of villages:\nNorthampton itself is the most populous civil parish in England, and (prior to 2021) was the most populous urban district in England not to be administered as a unitary authority (even though several smaller districts are unitary). During the 1990s local government reform, Northampton Borough Council petitioned strongly for unitary status, which led to fractured relations with the County Council.\nThe Soke of Peterborough is within the historic county of Northamptonshire, although it had had a separate county council since 1889 and separate courts of quarter sessions before then. The city of Peterborough has been a unitary authority since 1998, but it forms part of Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes.\nDe facto bankruptcy of the county council.\nIn early 2018, Northamptonshire County Council was declared technically insolvent and would be able to provide only the bare essential services. According to The Guardian the problems were caused by \"a reckless half-decade in which it refused to raise council tax to pay for the soaring costs of social care\" and \"partly due to past failings, the council is now having to make some drastic decisions to reduce services to a core offer.\" Some observers, such as Simon Edwards of the County Councils Network, added another perspective on the cause of the financial crisis, the United Kingdom government austerity programme: \"It is clear that, partly due to past failings, the council is now having to make some drastic decisions to reduce services to a core offer. However, we can't ignore that some of the underlying causes of the challenges facing Northamptonshire, such as dramatic reductions to council budgets and severe demand for services, mean county authorities across the country face funding pressures of \u00a33.2bn over the next two years.\"\nStructural changes.\nIn early 2018, following the events above, Government-appointed commissioners took over control of the council's affairs. Consequently, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government commissioned an independent report which, in March 2018, proposed structural changes to local government in Northamptonshire. These changes, implemented on 1 April 2021, saw the existing county council and district councils abolished and two new unitary authorities created in their place. One unitary authority, West Northamptonshire, consists of the former districts of Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire; the other, North Northamptonshire, consists of the former East Northamptonshire district and the former boroughs of Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough.\nNational representation.\nNorthamptonshire returns seven Members of Parliament (MPs). As of 2024[ [update]], five are currently from the Labour Party and two from the Conservative Party. Several of the constituencies have been marginal in the past, including the Northampton seats, Wellingborough, Kettering, and Corby, which were all Labour seats before 2005. In the 2016 EU referendum, all of the Northamptonshire districts voted to Leave, most by a significant margin.\nFrom 1993 until 2005, Northamptonshire County Council, for which each of the 73 electoral divisions in the county elected a single councillor, had been held by the Labour Party; it had been under no overall control since 1981. The councils of the rural districts \u2013 Daventry, East Northamptonshire, and South Northamptonshire \u2013 were strongly Conservative, whereas the political composition of the urban districts was more mixed. At the 2003 local elections, Labour lost control of Kettering, Northampton, and Wellingborough, retaining only Corby. Elections for the entire County Council were held every four years \u2013 the last were held on 4 May 2017. The County Council used a leader and cabinet executive system and abolished its area committees in April 2006.\nEconomy.\nHistorically, Northamptonshire's main industry was manufacturing of boots and shoes. Many of the manufacturers closed down in the Thatcher era which in turn left many county people unemployed. Although R Griggs and Co Ltd, the manufacturer of Dr. Martens, still has its UK base in Wollaston near Wellingborough, the shoe industry has deeply declined as manufacturing has moved away from England. There were over 2,000 shoemakers in the region in the mid-19th century, today the number is over 30 left. Large employers include the breakfast cereal manufacturers Weetabix, in Burton Latimer, the Carlsberg brewery in Northampton, Avon Products, Nationwide Building Society, Siemens, Barclaycard, Saxby Bros Ltd and Golden Wonder. In the west of the county is the Daventry International Railfreight Terminal; which is a major rail freight terminal located on the West Coast Main Line near Rugby. Wellingborough also has a smaller railfreight depot on Finedon Road, called Nelisons sidings.\nThis is a chart of trend of the regional gross value added of Northamptonshire at current basic prices in millions of British Pounds Sterling (correct on 21 December 2005):\nThe region of Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and the South Midlands has been described as \"Motorsport Valley... a global hub\" for the motor sport industry. The Mercedes-AMG and Aston Martin Formula One teams have their bases at Brackley and Silverstone respectively, while Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines and, formerly, Cosworth, are also in the county at Brixworth and Northampton respectively.\nInternational motor racing takes place at Silverstone Circuit and, formerly, Rockingham Motor Speedway; Santa Pod Raceway is just over the border in Bedfordshire but has a Northamptonshire postcode. A study commissioned by Northamptonshire Enterprise Ltd (NEL) reported that Northamptonshire's motorsport sites attract more than 2.1\u00a0million visitors per year who spend a total of more than \u00a3131\u00a0million within the county.\nMilton Keynes and South Midlands Growth area.\nNorthamptonshire forms part of the Milton Keynes and South Midlands Growth area which also includes Milton Keynes, Aylesbury Vale and Bedfordshire. This area has been identified as an area which is due to have tens of thousands additional homes built between 2010 and 2020. In North Northamptonshire (Boroughs of Corby, Kettering, Wellingborough and East Northants), over 52,000 homes are planned or newly built and 47,000 new jobs are also planned. In West Northamptonshire (boroughs of Northampton, Daventry and South Northants), over 48,000 homes are planned or newly built and 37,000 new jobs are planned. To oversee the planned developments, two urban regeneration companies have been created: North Northants Development Company (NNDC) and the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation. The NNDC launched a controversial campaign called \"North Londonshire\" to attract people from London to the county. There is also a county-wide tourism campaign with the slogan \"Northamptonshire, Let yourself grow\".\nEducation.\nSchools.\nNorthamptonshire County Council previously operated a comprehensive system of state-funded secondary schools. From May 2021 compulsory education in the county is administered by North Northamptonshire Council and West Northamptonshire Council. The county is home to private schools Oundle, Quinton House School, Wellingborough School, Spratton Hall School, Northampton High School.\nThe county's music and performing arts trust provides peripatetic music teaching to schools. It also supports 15 local Saturday morning music and performing arts centres around the county and provides a range of county-level music groups.\nColleges.\nThere are seven colleges across the county, with the Tresham College of Further and Higher Education having four campuses in three towns: Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough. Tresham, which was taken over by Bedford College in 2017 due to failed Ofsted inspections, provides further education and offers vocational courses and re-sit GCSEs. It also offers Higher Education options in conjunction with several universities. Other colleges in the county are: Fletton House, Knuston Hall, Moulton College, Northampton College, Northampton New College and The East Northamptonshire College.\nUniversity.\nNorthamptonshire has one university, the University of Northampton. It has two campuses apart and 10,000 students. It offers courses for needs and interests from foundation and undergraduate level to postgraduate, professional and doctoral qualifications. Subjects include traditional arts, humanities and sciences subjects, as well as entrepreneurship, product design and advertising.\nHealthcare.\nHospitals.\nThe main acute National Health Service hospitals in Northamptonshire are Northampton General Hospital, which also operates Danetre Hospital in Daventry, and Kettering General Hospital. In the south-west of the county, the towns of Brackley, Towcester and surrounding villages are serviced by the Horton General Hospital in Banbury in neighbouring Oxfordshire for acute medical needs. A similar arrangement is in place for the town of Oundle and nearby villages, served by Peterborough City Hospital.\nIn February 2011 a new satellite out-patient centre opened at Nene Park, Irthlingborough to provide over 40,000 appointments a year, as well as a minor injury unit to serve Eastern Northamptonshire. This was opened to relieve pressure off Kettering General Hospital, and has also replaced the dated Rushden Memorial Clinic which provided at the time about 8,000 appointments a year, when open.\nWater contamination.\nIn June 2008, Anglian Water found traces of \"Cryptosporidium\" in water supplies of Northamptonshire. The local reservoir at Pitsford was investigated and a European rabbit which had strayed into it, causing the problem, was found. About 250,000 residents were affected; by 14 July 2008, 13 cases of cryptosporidiosis attributed to water in Northampton had been reported. Following the end of the investigation, Anglian Water lifted its boil notice for all affected areas on 4 July 2008. Anglian Water revealed that it would pay up to \u00a330 per household as compensation for customers hit by the water crisis.\nTransport.\nThe gap in the hills at Watford Gap meant that many south-east to north-west routes passed through Northamptonshire. Watling Street, a Roman Road which is now part of the A5, passes through here, as did canals, railways and major roads in later years.\nRoads.\nMajor national roads, including the M1 motorway (London to Leeds) and the A14 (Rugby to Felixstowe), provide Northamptonshire with transport links both north\u2013south and east\u2013west. The A43 joins the M1 to the M40 motorway, passing through the south of the county to the junction west of Brackley, and the A45 links Northampton with Wellingborough and Peterborough.\nThe county road network (excluding trunk roads and motorways), managed by West Northamptonshire Council and North Northamptonshire Council, includes the A45 west of the M1 motorway, the A43 between Northampton and the county boundary near Stamford, the A361 between Kilsby and Banbury (Oxon) and all B, C and unclassified roads. Since 2009, these highways have been managed on behalf of the county council by MGWSP, a joint venture between May Gurney and WSP.\nRivers and canals.\nTwo major canals \u2013 the Oxford and the Grand Union \u2013 join in the county at Braunston. Notable features include a flight of 17 locks on the Grand Union at Rothersthorpe, the canal museum at Stoke Bruerne and a tunnel at Blisworth which, at , is the third-longest navigable canal tunnel on the UK canal network.\nA branch of the Grand Union Canal connects to the River Nene in Northampton and has been upgraded to a 'wide canal' in places and is known as the \"Nene Navigation\". It is famous for its guillotine locks.\nRailways.\nTwo trunk railway routes, the Midland Main Line and the West Coast Main Line, cross the county. At its peak, Northamptonshire had 75 railway stations. It now has only six, at: Northampton and Long Buckby on the West Coast Main Line; Kettering, Wellingborough and Corby on the Midland Main Line; along with King's Sutton, only a few yards from the boundary with Oxfordshire on the Chiltern Main Line.\nBefore nationalisation of the railways in 1948 and the creation of British Railways, three of the \"Big Four\" railway companies operated in Northamptonshire: the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, London and North Eastern Railway and Great Western Railway. Only the Southern Railway was not represented. As of 2023, it is served by Chiltern Railways, East Midlands Railway, Avanti West Coast and West Midlands Trains.\nCorby was described as the largest town in Britain without a railway station. The railway running through the town from Kettering to Oakham in Rutland was previously used only by freight traffic and occasional diverted passenger trains that did not stop at the station. The line through Corby was once part of a main line to Nottingham through Melton Mowbray, but the stretch between Melton and Nottingham was closed in 1968. In the 1980s, an experimental passenger shuttle service ran between Corby and Kettering but was withdrawn a few years later. On 23 February 2009, a new railway station opened, providing direct hourly access to London St Pancras. Following the opening of Corby Station, Rushden then became the largest town in the United Kingdom without a direct railway station. As of 2023, Corby is served by two regular EMR services per hour to London St Pancras International, branded as the Luton Airport Express and EMR Connect.\nRailway services in Northamptonshire were reduced by the Beeching cuts in the 1960s. Closure of the line connecting Northampton to Peterborough by way of Wellingborough, Thrapston, and Oundle left eastern Northamptonshire devoid of railways. Part of this route was reopened in 1977 as the Nene Valley Railway. A section of one of the closed lines, the Northampton to Market Harborough line, is now the Northampton &amp; Lamport heritage railway, while the route as a whole forms a part of the National Cycle Network, as the Brampton Valley Way.\nAs early as 1897, Northamptonshire would have had its own Channel Tunnel rail link with the creation of the Great Central Railway, which was intended to connect to a tunnel under the English Channel. Although the complete project never came to fruition, the rail link through Northamptonshire was constructed, and had stations at Charwelton, Woodford Halse, Helmdon and Brackley. It became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 (and of British Railways in 1948) before its closure in 1966.\nIn June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) recommended opening a new station on the former Irchester railway station site for Rushden, Higham Ferrers and Irchester, called Rushden Parkway.\nThe Rushden Historical Transport Society, operators of the Rushden, Higham and Wellingborough Railway, would like to see the railway fully reopen between Wellingborough and Higham Ferrers.\nThe route of the planned High Speed 2 railway line (between London and Birmingham) will go through the southern part of the county but without any stations.\nBuses.\nMost buses are operated by Stagecoach Midlands. Some town area routes have been named the Corby Star, Connect Kettering, Connect Wellingborough and Daventry Dart; the last three of these routes have route designations that include a letter (such as A, D1, W1, W2). Stagecoach's X4 route provides interurban links across the county, running between Northampton, Wellingborough, Kettering, Corby, Oundle and Peterborough. Uno and Centrebus also run services within the county,\nAirports.\nSywell Aerodrome, on the edge of Sywell village, has three grass runways and one concrete all-weather runway. It is, however, only 1000 metres long and therefore cannot be served by passenger jets.\nNorthamptonshire is served predominantly by London Luton Airport in neighbouring Bedfordshire, which can be directly accessed by train every 30 minutes from Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough. London Stansted Airport in neighbouring Essex is around 40 miles away and can be accessed by car but does not feature a direct rail connection from anywhere in the county.\nFurther afield, Northamptonshire is also within reach of Birmingham Airport and East Midlands Airport, both of which are around 45 miles away and can be accessed by direct trains from various stations within the county.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nThe two main newspapers in the county are the \"Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph\" and the \"Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo\".\nTelevision.\nMost of Northamptonshire is served by BBC East and ITV Anglia which both are based in Norwich. A small part of the north of the county is covered by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central while a small part of southwest of the county primarily Brackley and the surrounding villages is covered by BBC South and ITV Meridian.\nRadio.\nBBC Radio Northampton, broadcasts on two FM frequencies: 104.2\u00a0MHz for the south and west of the county (including Northampton and surrounding area) and 103.6\u00a0MHz for the north of the county (including Kettering, Wellingborough and Corby). BBC Radio Northampton is situated on Abington Street, Northampton. These services are broadcast from the Moulton Park &amp; Geddington transmitters. Some southern parts of the county (including Brackley) is served by BBC Radio Oxford broadcasting on 95.2\u00a0MHz.\nThere are three commercial radio stations in the county. The former \"Kettering and Corby Broadcasting Company (KCBC)\" station was called Connect Radio (97.2 and 107.4\u00a0MHz FM), following a merger with the Wellingborough-based station of the same name. It is now part of Smooth East Midlands. While both Heart East (96.6\u00a0MHz FM) and AM station Gold (1557\u00a0kHz) air very little local content as they form part of a national network. National digital radio is also available in Northamptonshire.\nCorby is served by its own dedicated station, Corby Radio (96.3 FM), based in the town and focused on local content.\nSport.\nRugby union.\nRugby Union is the most popular spectator sport in Northamptonshire, and it remains a major amateur sport with over 20 local clubs competing in the East Midlands RFU league system. \nNorthampton Saints.\nThe county's most popular sports team by attendance, Northampton Saints, compete in the Gallagher Premiership and European Rugby Champions Cup, and are based at the 15,249 capacity Franklin's Gardens. \nDuring the 2023/24 Season, Northampton Saints finished the Premiership season top of the table, securing them a Home Semi-Final against the reigning Gallagher Premiership Champions Saracens, with Saints winning and becoming Finalists for the first time since winning the league in 2014. Saints played Bath Rugby at Twickenham Stadium in the Final on 8 June 2024. Northampton Saints won the Match beating Bath Rugby 25\u201321 and becoming the Gallagher Premiership Champions for the second time. Over 35,000 fans of the 82,000 capacity crowd traveled from Northamptonshire to watch the final in London.\nTo date, Saints have won seven major titles. They were European Champions in 2000, and English Champions in 2014 and 2024. They have also won the secondary European Rugby Challenge Cup twice, in 2009 and 2014, the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 2010, and the inaugural Premiership Rugby Cup in 2019. \nFinally, the Saints have won the Second Division title three times; in 1990, 1996 and 2008.\nTheir biggest rivals are Leicester Tigers. The East Midlands Derby is one of the fiercest rivalries in English rugby union.\nAssociation football.\nNorthamptonshire has twenty four football clubs operating in the top ten levels of the English football league system. The sport in the area is administered by the Northamptonshire Football Association, which is affiliated with the United Counties League, the Northamptonshire Combination Football League, the Northampton Town Football League, as well as the Peterborough and District Football League in neighbouring Cambridgeshire. The only two clubs in Northamptonshire to have competed in The Football League are Northampton Town and the defunct Rushden &amp; Diamonds.\nNorthampton Town F.C..\nThe only fully-professional English football league club in the county is Northampton Town, which attracts between 4,000 and 6,000 fans on an average game day and has been part of the Football League since 1920. Their home ground is Sixfields Stadium which opened in 1994. The first match there took place on 15 October against Barnet Football Club. The stadium can hold up to 7,500 people, with provisions for disabled fans.\nOther clubs.\nThe county also a number of semi-professional sides that compete in levels 6 to 8 of the football pyramid. These are Kettering Town, Brackley Town, AFC Rushden &amp; Diamonds, and Corby Town F.C. Nineteen teams compete in the United Counties League (UCL), a league operating at levels 9 and 10 of the English League system, and which encompasses all of Northamptonshire and parts of neighbouring counties.\nCricket.\nNorthamptonshire County Cricket Club is in Division Two of the County Championship; the team (also known as The Steelbacks) play their home games at the County Cricket Ground, Northampton. They finished as runners-up in the Championship on four occasions in the period before it split into two divisions.\nIn 2013 the club won the Friends Life t20, beating Surrey in the final. Appearing in their third final in four years, the Steelbacks beat Durham by four wickets at Edgbaston in 2016 to lift the Natwest t20 Blast trophy for the second time. The club also won the NatWest Trophy on two occasions, and the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup once.\nMotor sport.\nSilverstone is a major motor racing circuit, most notably used for the British Grand Prix. There is also a dedicated radio station for the circuit which broadcasts on 87.7 FM or 1602 MW when events are taking place. However, part of the circuit is across the border in Buckinghamshire. Rockingham Speedway, located near Corby, was one of the largest motor sport venues in the United Kingdom with 52,000 seats until it was closed permanently in 2018 to make way for a logistics hub for the automotive industry, hosting its last race in November of that year. It was a US-style elliptical racing circuit (the largest of its kind outside of the United States), and is used extensively for all kinds of motor racing events. The Santa Pod drag racing circuit, venue for the FIA European Drag Racing Championships, is just across the border in Bedfordshire but has a NN postcode.\nTwo Formula One teams are based in Northamptonshire, with Mercedes at Brackley and Aston Martin in Silverstone. Aston Martin also have a secondary facility in Brackley, while Mercedes build engines for themselves, Aston Martin, McLaren and Williams at Brixworth. Cosworth, the high-performance engineering company, is based in Northampton.\nSwimming and diving.\nThere are seven competitive swimming clubs in the county: Northampton Swimming Club, Wellingborough Amateur Swimming Club, Rushden Swimming Club, Kettering Amateur Swimming Club, Corby Amateur Swimming Club, Daventry Dolphins Swimming Club, and Nene Valley Swimming Club.

The pool is home to the Northamptonshire Amateur Association's County Championships as well as some of the Youth Midland Championships.\nNorthamptonshire is home to 2016 paralympian Ellie Robinson. She was talent-spotted in July 2012 and developed at Northampton Swimming Club, and was selected to compete for Great Britain at the 2016 IPC Swimming European Championships. She won there three bronze medals, and one silver medal.\nCulture.\nJane Austen set her 1814 novel \"Mansfield Park\" mostly in Northamptonshire.\nMelrose Plant, a prominent secondary protagonist in the Richard Jury series of mystery novels by Martha Grimes, resides in Northamptonshire, and much of the action in the books takes place there.\n\"Kinky Boots\", the 2005 British-American film and subsequent stage musical adaptation, was based on the true story of a traditional Northamptonshire shoe factory which, to stay afloat, entered the market for fetish footwear.\nRock and pop bands originating in the area have included Bauhaus, Temples, The Departure, New Cassettes, Raging Speedhorn, The Fierce and the Dead and Defenestration. Richard Coles, an English musician, partnered in the 1980s with Jimmy Somerville to create the band The Communards. They achieved three top ten hits and made the No. 1 in 1986 with a version of the song \"Don't Leave Me This Way\". In 2012, The University of Northampton awarded Coles an honorary doctorate. From 2011 to 2022 he was the vicar of Finedon in Northamptonshire.\nNorthampton is the birthplace of composer Malcolm Arnold (born 21 October 1921) and of actor Marc Warren (born 20 March 1967).\nIn recent years, Northamptonshire has become notable for producing regional social media influencers and creatives who have gained national prominence, especially via TikTok, Instagram and YouTube platforms\u2014among them fashion and lifestyle content creators from Northamptonshire towns who attract sizable online followings and contribute to contemporary UK influencer culture.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Burning Spear is a Rastafarian and one of the most influential and long-standing roots artists to emerge from the 1970s.\nEarly life.\nWinston Rodney was born in Saint Ann's Bay, Saint Ann, Jamaica. He is married to Sonia Rodney. As a young man he listened to the R&amp;B, soul and jazz music transmitted by the US radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica. Curtis Mayfield is cited by Rodney as a major US musical influence along with James Brown. Rodney was deeply influenced as a young man by the views of the political activist Marcus Garvey, especially with regard to the exploration of the themes of Pan-Africanism and self-determination. In 1969, Bob Marley, who was also from Saint Ann, advised Rodney to approach Coxsone Dodd's Studio One label after Rodney sought his advice during a casual conversation.\nCareer.\nBurning Spear was originally Rodney's group, named after a military award given by Jomo Kenyatta, the first President of an independent Kenya, and included bass singer Rupert Willington. The duo auditioned for Dodd in 1969 which led to the release of their debut single \"Door Peep\" (the session also included Cedric Brooks on saxophone). They were then joined by tenor Delroy Hinds. The trio recorded several more singles for Dodd, and two albums, before they moved on to work with Jack Ruby in 1975. Their first recording with Ruby, \"Marcus Garvey\", was intended as an exclusive track for Ruby's Ocho Rios\u2013based Hi-Power sound system, but was released as a single, giving them an immediate hit, and was followed by \"Slavery Days\". These recordings featured the backing band The Black Disciples, which included Earl \"Chinna\" Smith, Valentine Chin, Robbie Shakespeare and Leroy Wallace. The group worked with Ruby on their third album, \"Marcus Garvey\" (1975), which was immediately successful and led to a deal with Island Records to give the album a wider release. Island remixed and altered the speed of some of the tracks, much to the annoyance of fans and the group, leading Rodney to set up his own Burning Music label for future releases where he would have full control, although further releases followed on Island including \"Garvey's Ghost\", a dub version of the Marcus Garvey album, and \"Man in the Hills\". In late 1976, Rodney split from both Ruby and group members Willington and Hinds, and from that point on used the name Burning Spear for himself alone. \"Dry and Heavy\" followed in 1977, self-produced but still on Island, and with a sizeable following by now in the United Kingdom, he performed in London that year with members of Aswad acting as his backing band for a sold-out show at the Rainbow Theatre, which was recorded and released as the album \"Live!\". Aswad also provided backing on his next studio album, \"Social Living\" (1978), which also featured Sly Dunbar and Rico Rodriguez. A dub version of the album, \"Living Dub\" (1979), was mixed by Sylvan Morris. His profile was raised further by an appearance in the film \"Rockers\", performing \"Jah no Dead\".\nIn 1980, Rodney left Island Records and set up the Burning Music Production Company, which he signed to EMI, debuting on the label with \"Hail H.I.M.\", recorded at Marley's Tuff Gong studio and co-produced by Aston Barrett. A Sylvan Morris dub version followed in the form of \"Living Dub Volume Two\". In 1982, Rodney signed with Heartbeat Records with a series of well-received albums following, including the 1985 Grammy-nominated \"Resistance\". He returned to Island in the early 1990s, releasing two albums before rejoining Heartbeat. This arrangement in which Burning Music Productions delivered completed albums of music to EMI, Island and Heartbeat Records for worldwide distribution lasted for many years. When Heartbeat ceased releasing new material, Burning Music took matters into their own hands and began to release music solely through their own imprint. Albums released by Heartbeat through an agreement with Burning Music include: \"The World Should Know\" (1993), \"Rasta Business\" (1995), and \"Appointment with His Majesty\" (1997).\nBurning Spear spent decades touring extensively, and several live albums have been issued including \"Burning Spear Live\", \"Live in Paris\", \"Live in South Africa\", \"Live in Vermont\", \"Peace and Love Live\", \"Live at Montreux Jazz Festival\" and \"(A)live 1997\". Touring the world time and time again, the band's live sound matured and grew more sophisticated. While remaining firmly rooted in reggae, accents of free jazz, funk and psychedelic music were increasingly in evidence.\nHis 1999 album, \"Calling Rastafari\" brought his first Grammy Award in 2000, a feat which he repeated with \"Jah Is Real\" in 2009. In 2000 Home to My Roots Tour he performed in Cape Town, South Africa, alongside another reggae musician Joseph Hill with Culture. In 2002 he and his wife, Sonia Rodney who has produced a number of his albums, restarted Burning Music Records, giving him a greater degree of artistic control. Since the mid-1990s, he has been based in Queens in New York City. Burning Spear was awarded the Order of Distinction in the rank of Officer on 15 October 2007. Since establishing their own label, Winston and Sonia Rodney have released nearly 40 singles, CDs, DVDs and vinyl albums on the Burning Music imprint. Many of these albums have been deluxe editions of albums previously available on other labels and often include bonus tracks and DVD footage.\nIn 2016 Rodney announced his retirement, but in 2022 it was announced that he would perform at the Rototom Sunsplash festival in Spain, and on the 'Welcome to Jamrock' cruise in December.\nRodney announced three shows in California in July 2022: San Francisco on 22 July, San Diego on 23 July and Los Angeles on 24 July. He also announced a show at the Levitt Pavilion, Denver, Colorado on 30 July 2022. These shows were followed by dates at Forum Birmingham on 13 August and the O2 Academy, Brixton, London on 14 August. On 14 August 2023 he performed a show in the live music venue in Tel Aviv, Israel and on 15 August 2023 in Megiddo, Israel where he appeared together with Ehud Banai.\nAwards.\nBurning Spear has won two Grammy Awards for Best Reggae Album; one at the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000 for \"Calling Rastafari\", and one for 2009's \"Jah Is Real\". He has been nominated for a total of 12 Grammy Awards.\nNominations for Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "66592", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66592", "title": "Pierre Boulez", "text": "French composer and conductor (1925\u20132016)\nPierre Louis Joseph Boulez (; 26 March 1925\u00a0\u2013 5 January 2016) was a French composer, conductor and writer, and the founder of several musical institutions. He was one of the dominant figures of post-war contemporary classical music.\nBorn in Montbrison, in the Loire department of France, the son of an engineer, Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen, and privately with Andr\u00e9e Vaurabourg and Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as music director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. He was a leading figure in avant-garde music, playing an important role in the development of integral serialism in the 1950s, controlled chance music in the 1960s and the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time from the 1970s onwards. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of work was relatively small, but it included pieces considered landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as \"Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre\", \"Pli selon pli\" and \"R\u00e9pons\". His uncompromising commitment to modernism and the trenchant, polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist.\nBoulez was also one of the most prominent conductors of his generation. In a career lasting more than sixty years, he was music director of the New York Philharmonic, chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra. He made frequent appearances with many other orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic and the Berlin Philharmonic. He was known for his performances of the music of the first half of the twentieth century\u2014including Debussy and Ravel, Stravinsky and Bart\u00f3k, and the Second Viennese School\u2014as well as that of his contemporaries, such as Ligeti, Berio and Carter. His work in the opera house included the production of Wagner's \"Ring\" cycle for the centenary of the Bayreuth Festival, and the world premiere of the three-act version of Berg's opera \"Lulu\". His recorded legacy is extensive. \nHe also founded several musical institutions. In Paris he set up the Domaine musical in the 1950s to promote new music; in the 1970s he established the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique (IRCAM), to foster research and innovation in music, and the Ensemble intercontemporain, a chamber orchestra specialising in contemporary music. Later he co-founded the Cit\u00e9 de la musique, a concert hall, museum and library dedicated to music in the Parc de la Villette in Paris and, in Switzerland, the Lucerne Festival Academy, an international orchestra of young musicians, with which he gave first performances of many new works.\nBiography.\n1925\u20131943: Childhood and school days.\nPierre Boulez was born on 26 March 1925, in Montbrison, a small town in the Loire department of east-central France, to L\u00e9on and Marcelle (\"n\u00e9e\" Calabre) Boulez. He was the third of four children: an older sister, Jeanne (1922\u20132018) and younger brother, Roger (b. 1936) were preceded by another child called Pierre (b. 1920), who died after a few months. L\u00e9on (1891\u20131969), an engineer and technical director of a steel factory, is described by biographers as an authoritarian figure with a strong sense of fairness, and Marcelle (1897\u20131985) as an outgoing, good-humoured woman, who deferred to her husband's strict Catholic beliefs, while not necessarily sharing them. The family prospered, moving in 1929 from the apartment above a pharmacy, where Boulez was born, to a comfortable detached house, where he spent most of his childhood.\nFrom the age of seven Boulez went to school at the Institut Victor de Laprade, a Catholic seminary where the thirteen-hour school day was filled with study and prayer. By the age of eighteen he had repudiated Catholicism; later in life he described himself as an agnostic.\nAs a child, Boulez took piano lessons, played chamber music with local amateurs and sang in the school choir. After completing the first part of his baccalaureate a year early, he spent the academic year of 1940\u201341 at the Pensionnat St. Louis, a boarding school in nearby Saint-\u00c9tienne. The following year he took classes in advanced mathematics at the Cours Sogno in Lyon (a school established by the Lazaristes) with a view to gaining admission to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris. His father hoped this would lead to a career in engineering. Wartime conditions in Lyon were already harsh; they became harsher still when the Vichy government fell, the Germans took over and the city became a centre of the resistance.\nIn Lyon, Boulez first heard an orchestra, saw his first operas (Mussorgsky's \"Boris Godunov\" and Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\") and met the soprano Ninon Vallin, who asked him to play for her. Impressed by his ability, she persuaded his father to allow him to apply to the Conservatoire de Lyon. He was rejected but was determined to pursue a career in music. The following year, with his sister's support in the face of opposition from his father, he studied piano and harmony privately with Lionel de Pachmann (son of the pianist Vladimir de Pachmann). \"Our parents were strong, but finally we were stronger than they\", Boulez later said. In the event, when he moved to Paris in the autumn of 1943, hoping to enroll at the Conservatoire de Paris, his father accompanied him, helped him to find a room (in the 7th arrondissement) and subsidised him until he could earn a living.\n1943\u20131946: Musical education.\nIn October 1943, Boulez auditioned unsuccessfully for the advanced piano class at the Conservatoire, but he was admitted in January 1944 to the preparatory harmony class of Georges Dandelot. He made rapid progress, and by May 1944 Dandelot was describing him as \"the best of the class\".\nAround the same time he was introduced to Andr\u00e9e Vaurabourg, wife of the composer Arthur Honegger. Between April 1944 and May 1946 he studied counterpoint privately with her. In June 1944 he approached Olivier Messiaen and asked to study harmony with him. Messiaen invited him to attend the private seminars he gave to selected students; in January 1945, Boulez joined Messiaen's advanced harmony class at the Conservatoire.\nBoulez moved to two small attic rooms on Rue Beautreillis in the Marais district of Paris, where he lived for the next thirteen years. In February 1945 he attended a private performance of Schoenberg's Wind Quintet, conducted by Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz, the composer and follower of Schoenberg. The strict use of twelve-tone technique in the Quintet was a revelation to Boulez, who organised a group of fellow students to take private lessons with Leibowitz. It was here that he also discovered the music of Webern. He eventually found Leibowitz's approach too doctrinaire and broke angrily with him in 1946 when Leibowitz tried to criticise one of his early works.\nIn June 1945, Boulez was one of four Conservatoire students awarded \"premier prix\". He was described in the examiner's report as \"the most gifted\u2014a composer\". Although registered at the Conservatoire for the academic year 1945\u201346, he soon boycotted Simone Pl\u00e9-Caussade's counterpoint and fugue class, infuriated by what he described as her \"lack of imagination\", and organised a petition that Messiaen be given a full professorship in composition. Over the winter of 1945\u201346 Boulez immersed himself in Balinese and Japanese music and African drumming at the Mus\u00e9e Guimet and the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris: \"I almost chose the career of an ethnomusicologist because I was so fascinated by that music. It gives a different feeling of time.\"\n1946\u20131953: Early career in Paris.\nOn 12 February 1946, the pianist Yvette Grimaud gave the first public performances of Boulez's music (\"Douze Notations\" and \"Trois Psalmodies\") at the Concerts du Triptyque. Boulez earned money by giving maths lessons to his landlord's son. He also played the ondes Martenot (an early electronic instrument), improvising accompaniments to radio dramas and occasionally deputising in the pit orchestra of the Folies Berg\u00e8re. In October 1946, the actor and director Jean-Louis Barrault engaged him to play the ondes for a production of \"Hamlet\" for the new company he and his wife, Madeleine Renaud, had formed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Marigny. Boulez was soon appointed music director of the Compagnie Renaud-Barrault, a post he held for nine years. He arranged and conducted incidental music, mostly by composers whose music he disliked (such as Milhaud and Tchaikovsky), but it gave him the chance to work with professional musicians, while leaving time to compose during the day.\nHis involvement with the company also broadened his horizons: in 1947 they toured to Belgium and Switzerland (\"absolutely \"pays de cocagne\", my first discovery of the big world\"); in 1948 they took \"Hamlet\" to the second Edinburgh International Festival; in 1951 they gave a season of plays in London, at the invitation of Laurence Olivier; and between 1950 and 1957 there were three tours to South America and two to North America. Much of the music he wrote for the company was lost after the occupation by students of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on during the civil unrest in May 1968.\nThe period between 1947 and 1950 was one of intense compositional activity for Boulez. New works included the first two piano sonatas and initial versions of two cantatas on poems by Ren\u00e9 Char, \"Le Visage nuptial\" and \"Le Soleil des eaux\". In October 1951, a substantial work for eighteen solo instruments, \"Polyphonie X\", caused a scandal at its premiere at the Donaueschingen Festival, some audience members whistling and hissing during the performance.\nAround this time, Boulez met two composers who were to be important influences: John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. His friendship with Cage began in 1949 when Cage was visiting Paris. Cage introduced Boulez to two publishers (Heugel and Amphion) who agreed to take his recent pieces; Boulez helped to arrange a private performance of Cage's \"Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano\". When Cage returned to New York they began an intense, six-year correspondence about the future of music. Their friendship later cooled as Boulez could not accept Cage's increasing commitment to compositional procedures based on chance; he later broke off contact with him. In 1952 Stockhausen arrived in Paris to study with Messiaen. Although Boulez knew no German and Stockhausen no French, the rapport between them was instant: \"A friend translated [and] we gesticulated wildly\u00a0... We talked about music all the time\u2014in a way I've never talked about it with anyone else.\"\nIn July 1952, Boulez attended the International Summer Course for New Music in Darmstadt for the first time. As well as Stockhausen, Boulez was in contact there with other composers who would become significant figures in contemporary music, including Luciano Berio and Luigi Nono. Boulez quickly became one of the leaders of the post-war modernist movement in the arts. As the music critic Alex Ross observed: \"at all times he seemed absolutely sure of what he was doing. Amid the confusion of postwar life, with so many truths discredited, his certitude was reassuring.\"\n1954\u20131959: Le Domaine musical.\nIn 1954, with the financial backing of Barrault and Renaud, Boulez started a series of concerts at the Petit Marigny theatre, which became known as the Domaine musical. The concerts focused initially on three areas: pre-war classics still unfamiliar in Paris (such as Bart\u00f3k and Webern), works by the new generation (Stockhausen, Nono) and neglected masters from the past (Machaut, Gesualdo)\u2014although the last category fell away in subsequent seasons, in part because of the difficulty of finding musicians with experience of playing early music. Boulez proved an energetic and accomplished administrator and the concerts were an immediate success. They attracted musicians, painters and writers, as well as fashionable society, but they were so expensive that Boulez had to turn to wealthy patrons for support.\nKey events in the Domaine's history included a Webern festival (1955), the European premiere of Stravinsky's \"Agon\" (1957) and first performances of Messiaen's \"Oiseaux exotiques\" (1955) and \"Sept ha\u00efka\u00ef\" (1963). Boulez remained director until 1967, when Gilbert Amy succeeded him.\nOn 18 June 1955, Hans Rosbaud conducted the first performance of Boulez's best-known work, \"Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre\", at the ISCM Festival in Baden-Baden. A nine-movement cycle for alto voice and instrumental ensemble based on poems by Ren\u00e9 Char, it was an immediate, international success. William Glock wrote: \"even at a first hearing, though difficult to take in, it was so utterly new in sound, texture and feeling that it seemed to possess a mythical quality like that of Schoenberg's \"Pierrot lunaire\"\". When Boulez conducted the work in Los Angeles in early 1957, Stravinsky attended the performance; he later described the piece as \"one of the few significant works of the post-war period of exploration\". Boulez dined several times with the Stravinskys and (according to Robert Craft) \"soon captivated the older composer with new musical ideas, and an extraordinary intelligence, quickness and humour\". Relations between the two composers soured the following year over the first Paris performance of Stravinsky's \"Threni\" for the Domaine musical. Poorly planned by Boulez and nervously conducted by Stravinsky, the performance broke down more than once.\nIn January 1958, the \"Improvisations sur Mallarm\u00e9 (I et II)\" were premiered, forming the kernel of a piece which grew over the next four years into a large-scale, five-movement \"portrait of Mallarm\u00e9\", \"Pli selon pli\". It received its premiere in Donaueschingen in October 1962.\nAround this time, Boulez's relations with Stockhausen deteriorated as (according to the biographer Joan Peyser) he saw the younger man supplanting him as the leader of the avant-garde.\n1959\u20131971: International conducting career.\nIn 1959, Boulez left Paris for Baden-Baden, where he had an arrangement with the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra to work as composer-in-residence and to conduct some smaller concerts. He also had access to an electronic studio where he could work on a new piece (\"Po\u00e9sie pour pouvoir\"). He moved into, and eventually bought, a large hillside villa, which was his main home for the rest of his life.\nDuring this period, he turned increasingly to conducting. His first engagement as an orchestral conductor had been in 1956, when he conducted the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra while on tour with Barrault. His breakthrough came in 1959 when he replaced the ailing Hans Rosbaud at short notice in demanding programmes of twentieth-century music at the Aix-en-Provence and Donaueschingen Festivals. This led to debuts with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, Bavarian Radio Symphony and Berlin Philharmonic orchestras. \nIn 1963 Boulez conducted his first opera, Berg's \"Wozzeck\" at the Op\u00e9ra National de Paris, directed by Barrault. The conditions were exceptional, with thirty orchestral rehearsals instead of the usual three or four; the critical response was favourable and after the first performance the musicians rose to applaud him. He conducted \"Wozzeck\" again in April 1966 at the Oper Frankfurt in a new production by Wieland Wagner.\nWieland Wagner had already invited Boulez to conduct Wagner's \"Parsifal\" at the Bayreuth Festival later in the season, and Boulez returned to conduct revivals in 1967, 1968 and 1970. He also conducted performances of Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\" with the Bayreuth company at the Osaka Festival in Japan in 1967, but the lack of adequate rehearsal made it an experience he later said he would rather forget. His conducting of the new production (by V\u00e1clav Ka\u0161l\u00edk) of Debussy's \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" at Covent Garden in 1969 was praised for its combination of \"delicacy and sumptuousness\".\nIn 1965, the Edinburgh International Festival staged the first large-scale retrospective of Boulez as composer and conductor. In 1966, he proposed a reorganisation of French musical life to the minister of culture, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, but Malraux instead appointed the conservative Marcel Landowski as head of music at the Ministry of Culture. Boulez expressed his fury in an article in the \"Nouvel Observateur\", announcing that he was \"going on strike with regard to any aspect of official music in France\".\nIn March 1965, Boulez had made his orchestral debut in the United States with the Cleveland Orchestra. In February 1969 he became its principal guest conductor and, on the death of George Szell in July 1970, assumed the role of music advisor for two years. In the 1968\u201369 season, he also made guest appearances in Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.\nApart from \"Pli selon pli\", Boulez's only substantial new work to emerge in the first half of the 1960s was the final version of Book 2 of his \"Structures\" for two pianos. Midway through the decade, he produced several new works, including \"\u00c9clat\" (1965), a short and brilliant piece for small ensemble, which by 1970 had grown into a substantial half-hour work, \"\u00c9clat/Multiples\".\n1971\u20131977: London and New York.\nBoulez first conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in February 1964, at Worthing, accompanying Vladimir Ashkenazy in a Chopin piano concerto. Boulez recalled: \"It was terrible, I felt like a waiter who keeps dropping the plates.\" His appearances with the orchestra over the next five years included his debuts at the Proms and at Carnegie Hall (1965) and tours to Moscow and Leningrad, Berlin and Prague (1967). In January 1969 William Glock, controller of music at the BBC, announced his appointment as chief conductor. Two months later, Boulez conducted the New York Philharmonic for the first time. His performances so impressed both orchestra and management that he was offered the chief conductorship in succession to Leonard Bernstein. Glock was dismayed and tried to persuade him that accepting the New York position would detract both from his work in London and his ability to compose but Boulez could not resist the opportunity (as Glock put it) \"to reform the music-making of both these world cities\" and in June the New York appointment was confirmed.\nHis tenure in New York lasted between 1971 and 1977 and was not an unqualified success. The dependence on a subscription audience limited his programming. He introduced more key works from the first half of the twentieth century and, with earlier repertoire, sought out less well-known pieces. In his first season, he conducted Liszt's \"The Legend of Saint Elizabeth\" and \"Via Crucis\". Performances of new music were comparatively rare in the subscription series. The players admired his musicianship but regarded him as dry and unemotional compared to Bernstein, although it was widely accepted that he improved the standard of playing. He returned on only three occasions to the orchestra in later years.\nBoulez's time with the BBC Symphony Orchestra was happier. With the resources of the BBC behind him, he could be bolder in his choice of repertoire. There were occasional forays into the classical and romantic repertoire, particularly at the Proms (Beethoven's Missa solemnis in 1972; the Brahms \"German Requiem\" in 1973), but for the most part he worked intensively with the orchestra on the music of the twentieth century. He conducted works by the younger generation of British composers\u2014such as Harrison Birtwistle and Peter Maxwell Davies\u2014but Britten and Tippett were absent from his programmes. His relations with the musicians were generally excellent. He was chief conductor between 1971 and 1975, continuing as chief guest conductor until 1977. Thereafter he returned to the orchestra frequently until his last appearance in an all-Jan\u00e1\u010dek programme at a 2008 Prom.\nIn both cities, Boulez sought out venues where new music could be presented more informally: in New York he began a series of \"Rug Concerts\"\u2014when the seats in Avery Fisher Hall were taken out and the audience sat on the floor\u2014and a contemporary music series called \"Prospective Encounters\" in Greenwich Village; in London he gave concerts at the Roundhouse, a former railway turntable shed which Peter Brook had also used for radical theatre productions. His aim was \"to create a feeling that we are all, audience, players and myself, taking part in an act of exploration\".\nIn 1972, Wolfgang Wagner, who had succeeded his brother Wieland as director of the Bayreuth Festival, invited Boulez to conduct the 1976 centenary production of Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\". The director was Patrice Ch\u00e9reau. Highly controversial in its first year, according to Barry Millington by the end of the run in 1980 \"enthusiasm for the production vastly outweighed disapproval\". It was televised around the world.\nA few new works emerged during this period, of which perhaps the most important is \"Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna\", a large-scale orchestral work, prompted by the death at a relatively young age of Boulez's friend and fellow composer.\n1977\u20131992: IRCAM.\nIn 1970 Boulez was asked by President Pompidou to return to France and set up an institute specialising in musical research and creation at the arts complex\u2014now known as the Centre Georges Pompidou\u2014which was planned for the Beaubourg district of Paris. The Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique (IRCAM) opened in 1977.\nBoulez's model was the Bauhaus, which had been a meeting place for artists and scientists of all disciplines. IRCAM's aims included research into acoustics, instrumental design and the use of computers in music. The original building was constructed underground, partly to isolate it acoustically (an above-ground extension was added later). The institution was criticised for absorbing too much state subsidy, Boulez for wielding too much power. At the same time he founded the Ensemble intercontemporain, a virtuoso ensemble dedicated to contemporary music.\nIn 1979, Boulez conducted the world premiere of the three-act version of Berg's \"Lulu\" at the Paris Opera in Friedrich Cerha's completion of the work, left unfinished at Berg's death. It was directed by Ch\u00e9reau. Otherwise he scaled back his conducting commitments to concentrate on IRCAM. Most of his appearances during this period were with his own Ensemble intercontemporain\u2014including tours to the United States (1986), Australia (1988), the Soviet Union (1990) and Canada (1991)\u2014although he also renewed his links in the 1980s with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.\nBoulez composed significantly more during this period, producing a series of pieces which used the potential, developed at IRCAM, electronically to transform sound in real time. The first of these was \"R\u00e9pons\" (1981\u20131984), a 40-minute work for soloists, ensemble and electronics. He also radically reworked earlier pieces, including \"Notations I-IV\", a transcription and expansion for large orchestra of tiny piano pieces (1945\u20131980), and his cantata on poems by Char, \"Le Visage nuptial\" (1946\u20131989).\nFrom 1976 to 1995, he held the Chair in \"Invention, technique et langage en musique\" at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. In 1988 he made a series of six programmes for French television, \"Boulez XXe si\u00e8cle\", each of which focused on a specific aspect of contemporary music (rhythm, timbre, form etc.)\n1992\u20132006: Return to conducting.\nIn 1992, Boulez gave up the directorship of IRCAM and was succeeded by Laurent Bayle. He was composer in residence at that year's Salzburg Festival. The previous year he began a series of annual residencies with the Cleveland Orchestra and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1995 he was named principal guest conductor in Chicago, a post he held until 2005, when he became conductor emeritus. His 70th birthday in 1995 was marked by a six-month retrospective tour with the London Symphony Orchestra, taking in Paris, Vienna, New York and Tokyo. In 2001 he conducted a major Bart\u00f3k cycle with the Orchestre de Paris.\nThis period also marked a return to the opera house, including two productions with Peter Stein: Debussy's \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" (1992, Welsh National Opera and Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris); and Schoenberg's \"Moses und Aron\" (1995, Dutch National Opera and Salzburg Festival). In 2004 and 2005 he returned to Bayreuth to conduct a controversial new production of \"Parsifal\" directed by Christoph Schlingensief.\nHis two most substantial compositions from this period are \"...explosante-fixe...\" (1993), which had its origins in 1972 as a tribute to Stravinsky and which again used the electronic resources of IRCAM, and \"sur Incises\" (1998), for which he was awarded the 2001 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition.\nBoulez continued to work on institutional organisation. He co-founded the Cit\u00e9 de la musique, which opened in La Villette on the outskirts of Paris in 1995. Consisting of a modular concert hall, museum and mediatheque\u2014with the Conservatoire de Paris on an adjacent site\u2014it became the home to the Ensemble intercontemporain and attracted a diverse audience. In 2004, he co-founded the Lucerne Festival Academy, an orchestral institute for young musicians, dedicated to music of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. For the next ten years he spent the last three weeks of summer working with young composers and conducting concerts with the Academy's orchestra.\n2006\u20132016: Last years.\nBoulez's last major work was \"D\u00e9rive 2\" (2006), a 45-minute piece for eleven instruments. He left several compositional projects unfinished, including the remaining \"Notations\" for orchestra.\nHe remained active as a conductor over the next six years. In 2007 he was re-united with Ch\u00e9reau for a production of Jan\u00e1\u010dek's \"From the House of the Dead\" (Theater an der Wien, Amsterdam and Aix). In April that year, as part of the Festtage in Berlin, Boulez and Daniel Barenboim gave a cycle of the Mahler symphonies with the Staatskapelle Berlin, which they repeated two years later at Carnegie Hall. In late 2007 the Orchestre de Paris and the Ensemble intercontemporain presented a retrospective of Boulez's music and in 2008 the Louvre mounted the exhibition \"Pierre Boulez, \u0152uvre: fragment\".\nHis appearances became more infrequent after an eye operation in 2010 left him with severely impaired sight. Other health problems included a shoulder injury resulting from a fall. In late 2011, when he was already quite frail, he led the combined Ensemble intercontemporain and Lucerne Festival Academy, with the soprano Barbara Hannigan, in a tour of six European cities of his own \"Pli selon pli\". His final appearance as a conductor was in Salzburg on 28 January 2012 with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Mitsuko Uchida in a programme of Schoenberg (\"Begleitungsmusik zu einer Lichtspielscene\" and the Piano Concerto), Mozart (Piano Concerto No.19 in F major K459) and Stravinsky (\"Pulcinella Suite\"). Thereafter he cancelled all conducting engagements.\nIn mid-2012 Boulez was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, probably a form of Parkinson's. Later that year, he worked with the Diotima Quartet, making final revisions to his only string quartet, \"Livre pour quatuor\", begun in 1948. In 2013 he oversaw the release on Deutsche Grammophon of \"Pierre Boulez: Complete Works\", a 13-CD survey of all his authorised compositions. He made his last public appearance on 30 May 2013 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris, discussing Stravinsky with Robert Piencikowski, to mark the centenary of the premiere of \"The Rite of Spring\". \nFrom 2014 he scarcely left his home in Baden-Baden. His health prevented him from taking part in the many celebrations held across the world for his 90th birthday in 2015, which included a multi-media exhibition at the Mus\u00e9e de la Musique in Paris, focusing on the inspiration he had drawn from literature and the visual arts.\nBoulez died at home on 5 January 2016. He was buried on 13 January in Baden-Baden's main cemetery following a private funeral service at the town's Stiftskirche. At a memorial service the next day at the Saint-Sulpice in Paris, eulogists included Barenboim, Renzo Piano, and Laurent Bayle, then president of the Philharmonie de Paris, whose large concert hall had been inaugurated the previous year, thanks in part to Boulez's influence.\nCompositions.\nJuvenilia and student works.\nBoulez's earliest surviving compositions date from his school days in 1942\u201343, mostly songs on texts by Baudelaire, Gautier and Rilke. Gerald Bennett describes the pieces as \"modest, delicate and rather anonymous [employing] a certain number of standard elements of French salon music of the time\u2014whole-tone scales, pentatonic scales and polytonality\".\nAs a student at the Conservatoire Boulez composed a series of pieces influenced first by Honegger and Jolivet (\"Prelude, Toccata and Scherzo\" and \"Nocturne\" for solo piano (1944\u201345)) and then by Messiaen (\"Trois psalmodies\" for piano (1945) and a Quartet for four ondes Martenot (1945\u201346)). The encounter with Schoenberg\u2014through his studies with Leibowitz\u2014was the catalyst for his first piece of serial music, the \"Th\u00e8me et variations\" for piano, left hand (1945). Peter O'Hagan describes it as \"his boldest and most ambitious work to date\".\n\"Douze notations\" and the work in progress.\nBoulez completed \"Douze notations\" in December 1945. It is in these twelve aphoristic pieces for piano, each twelve bars long, that Bennett first detects the influence of Webern. Shortly after the composition of the piano original, Boulez attempted an (unperformed and unpublished) orchestration of eleven of the pieces. Over a decade later he re-used two of them in instrumental interludes in his \"Improvisation I sur Mallarm\u00e9\". Then in the mid-1970s he embarked on a further, more radical transformation of the \"Notations\" into extended works for very large orchestra, a project which occupied him to the end of his life.\n\"Notations\" was only the most extreme example of Boulez's tendency to revisit earlier works: \"as long as my ideas have not exhausted every possibility of proliferation they stay in my mind\". Robert Piencikowski characterises this in part as \"an obsessional concern for perfection\" and observes that with some pieces \"one could speak of successive distinct versions, each one presenting a particular state of the musical material, without the successor invalidating the previous one or vice versa\"\u2014although he notes that Boulez almost invariably vetoed the performance of previous versions.\nFirst published works.\nThe \"Sonatine\" for flute and piano (1946\u20131949) was the first work Boulez allowed to be published. A serial work of great energy, its single-movement form was influenced by Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1. Bennett finds in the piece a tone new to Boulez's writing: \"a sharp, brittle violence juxtaposed against an extreme sensitivity and delicacy\". In the Piano Sonata No. 1 (1946\u201349) the biographer Dominique Jameux highlights the sheer number of different kinds of attack in its two short movements\u2014and the frequent accelerations of tempo in the second movement\u2014which together create a feeling of \"instrumental delirium\".\nThere followed two cantatas based on the poetry of Ren\u00e9 Char. Of \"Le Visage nuptial\" Paul Griffiths observes that \"Char's five poems speak in hard-edged surrealist imagery of an ecstatic sexual passion\", which Boulez reflected in music \"on the borders of fevered hysteria\". In its original version (1946\u201347) the piece was scored for small forces (soprano, contralto, two ondes Martenot, piano and percussion). Forty years later Boulez arrived at the definitive version for soprano, mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra (1985\u20131989). \"Le Soleil des eaux\" (1948) originated in incidental music for a radio drama by Char. It went through three further versions before reaching its final form in 1965 as a piece for soprano, mixed chorus and orchestra. The first movement (\"Complainte du l\u00e9zard amoureux\") is a love song addressed by a lizard to a goldfinch in the heat of a summer day; the second (\"La Sorgue\") is a violent, incantatory protest against the pollution of the river Sorgue.\nThe Second Piano Sonata (1947\u201348) is a half-hour work which requires formidable technical prowess from the performer. Its four movements follow the standard pattern of a classical sonata but in each of them Boulez subverts the traditional model. For Griffiths the violent character of much of the music \"is not just superficial: it is expressive of \u2026 a need to obliterate what had gone before\". Boulez played the work for Aaron Copland, who asked: \"But must we start a revolution all over again?\"\u2014\"Yes, mercilessly\", Boulez replied.\nTotal serialism.\nThat revolution entered its most extreme phase in 1950\u20131952, when Boulez developed a technique in which not only pitch but other musical parameters\u2014duration, dynamics, timbre and attack\u2014were organised according to serial principles, an approach known as total serialism or punctualism. Messiaen had already made an experiment in this direction in his \"Mode de valeurs et d'intensit\u00e9s\" for piano (1949). Boulez's first sketches towards total serialism appeared in parts of \"Livre pour quatuor\" (1948\u201349, revised 2011\u201312), a collection of movements for string quartet from which the players may choose at any one performance, foreshadowing Boulez's later interest in variable form.\nIn the early 1950s Boulez began to apply the technique rigorously, ordering each parameter into sets of twelve and prescribing no repetition until all twelve had sounded. According to the music critic Alex Ross the resulting surfeit of ever-changing musical data has the effect of erasing at any given point previous impressions the listener may have formed: \"the present moment is all there is\", Ross observed. Boulez linked this development to a desire by his generation to create a \"tabula rasa\" after the war.\nHis works in this idiom are \"Polyphonie X\" (1950\u201351; withdrawn) for 18 instruments, the two \"musique concr\u00e8te\" \"\u00e9tudes\" (1951\u201352; withdrawn), and \"Structures, Book I\" for two pianos (1951\u201352). Speaking of \"Structures, Book I\" in 2011 Boulez described it as a piece in which \"the responsibility of the composer is practically absent. Had computers existed at that time I would have put the data through them and made the piece that way. But I did it by hand...It was a demonstration through the absurd.\" Asked whether it should still be listened to as music, Boulez replied: \"I am not terribly eager to listen to it. But for me it was an experiment that was absolutely necessary.\"\n\"Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre\" and \"Pli selon pli\".\n\"Structures, Book I\" was a turning point for Boulez; from here on he loosened the strictness of total serialism into a more supple, gestural music: \"I am trying to rid myself of my thumbprints and taboos\", he wrote to Cage. The most significant result of this new freedom was \"Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre\" (1953\u20131955), described by Griffiths and Bill Hopkins as a \"keystone of twentieth-century music\". Three short poems by Char are the starting-point for three interlocking cycles. Four movements are vocal settings of the poems (one is set twice), the other five are instrumental commentaries. According to Hopkins and Griffiths the music is characterised by abrupt tempo transitions, passages of broadly improvisatory melodic style and exotic instrumental colouring. The piece is scored for contralto soloist with alto flute, xylorimba, vibraphone, percussion, guitar and viola. Boulez said that the choice of these instruments showed the influence of non-European cultures, to which he had always been attracted.\nFor the text of his next major work, \"Pli selon pli\" (1957\u20131989), Boulez turned to the symbolist poetry of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, attracted by its extreme density and radical syntax. At seventy minutes, it is his longest composition. Three \"Improvisations\" on individual sonnets are framed by two orchestral movements, into which fragments of other poems are embedded. Boulez's word-setting, which in the first \"Improvisation\" is straightforwardly syllabic, becomes ever more melismatic, to the point where the words cannot be distinguished. Boulez's stated aim was to make the sonnets \"become\" the music at a deeper, structural level. The piece is scored for soprano and large orchestra, often deployed in chamber groups. Boulez described its sound-world, rich in percussion, as \"not so much frozen as extraordinarily 'vitrified'\". The work had a complex genesis, reaching its definitive form in 1989.\nControlled chance.\nFrom the 1950s Boulez experimented with what he called \"controlled chance\". In his article \"Sonate, que me veux-tu?\", he wrote of \"the investigation of a relative world, a permanent 'discovering' rather like the state of 'permanent revolution'\".\nPeyser observes that Boulez's use of chance is different from John Cage's. In Cage's music the performers are often free to create unforeseen sounds, with the aim of removing the composer's intention from the music; in Boulez's music they choose between possibilities that have been written out by the composer. When applied to the order of sections, this is sometimes described as \"mobile form\", a technique devised by Earle Brown, who was inspired by the mobile sculptures of Alexander Calder, whom Boulez met when he was visiting New York in 1952.\nBoulez employed variants of the technique in several works over the next two decades: in the Third Piano Sonata (1955\u20131957, revised 1963) the pianist chooses different routes through the score and in one movement (\"Trope\") has the option of omitting certain passages altogether; in \"\u00c9clat\" (1965), the conductor triggers the order in which each player joins the ensemble; in \"Domaines\" (1961\u20131968) it is the soloist who dictates the order in which the sections are played by his movement around the stage. In later works, such as \"Cummings ist der Dichter\" (1970, revised 1986)\u2014a chamber cantata for 16 solo voices and small orchestra using a poem by E. E. Cummings\u2014the conductor chooses the order of certain events but there is no freedom for the individual player. In its original version \"Pli selon pli\" also contained elements of choice for the instrumentalists, but much of this was eliminated in later revisions.\nBy contrast \"Figures\u2014Doubles\u2014Prismes\" (1957\u20131968) is a fixed work with no chance element. Piencikowski describes it as \"a great cycle of variations whose components interpenetrate each other instead of remaining isolated in the traditional manner\". It is notable for the unusual layout of the orchestra, in which the various families of instruments (woodwind, brass etc.) are scattered across the stage rather than being grouped together.\nMiddle-period works.\nJonathan Goldman identifies a major aesthetic shift in Boulez's work from the mid-1970s onwards, characterised variously by the presence of thematic writing, a return to vertical harmony and to clarity and legibility of form. Boulez himself said: \"the \"envelope\" is simpler. The contents are not\u00a0... I think in my recent work it is true that the first approach is more direct, and the gesture is more obvious, let's say.\"\nFor Goldman, \"Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna\" (1974\u201375) marks the beginning of this development. Boulez wrote this twenty-five minute work as an epitaph for his friend and colleague, the Italian composer and conductor, who died in 1973 aged 53. The piece is divided into fifteen sections, the orchestra into eight groups. The odd-numbered sections are conducted; in the even-numbered sections the conductor merely sets each group in motion and its progress is regulated by a percussionist beating time. In his dedication Boulez described the work as \"a ritual of disappearance and survival\"; Griffiths refers to the work's \"awesome grandeur\".\n\"Notations I\u2013IV\" (1980) are the first four transformations of piano miniatures from 1945 into pieces for very large orchestra. In his review of the New York premiere, Andrew Porter wrote that the single idea of each original piece \"has, as it were, been passed through a many-faceted bright prism and broken into a thousand linked, lapped, sparkling fragments\", the finale \"a terse modern \"Rite\"\u00a0... which sets the pulses racing\".\n\"D\u00e9rive 1\" (1984), dedicated to William Glock on his retirement from the Bath Festival, is a short quintet in which the piano takes the lead. The material is derived from six chords and, according to Ivan Hewett, the piece \"shuffles and decorates these chords, bursting outwards in spirals and eddies, before returning to its starting point\". At the end the music \"shivers into silence\".\nWorks with electronics.\nBoulez compared the experience of listening to pre-recorded electronic music in the concert hall to a crematorium ceremony. His real interest lay in the instantaneous transformation of instrumental sounds but the technology was not available until the founding of IRCAM in the 1970s. Before then he had produced \"Deux \u00c9tudes\" (1951) for magnetic tape for Pierre Schaeffer's Groupe Recherche de la Radiodiffusion Fran\u00e7aise, as well as a large-scale piece for live orchestra with tape, \"Po\u00e9sie pour pouvoir\" (1958). He was dissatisfied with both pieces and withdrew them.\nThe first piece completed at IRCAM was \"R\u00e9pons\" (1980\u20131984). In this forty-minute work an instrumental group is placed in the middle of the hall, while six soloists surround the audience: two pianos, harp, cimbalom, vibraphone and glockenspiel/xylophone. It is their music which is transformed electronically and projected through the space. Peter Heyworth described the moment when they enter, some ten minutes into the piece: \"it is as though a great window were thrown open, through which a new sound world enters, and with it a new world of the imagination. Even more impressive is the fact that there is no longer a schism between the worlds of natural and electronic sounds, but rather a continuous spectrum.\"\n\"Dialogue de l'ombre double\" (1982\u20131985) for clarinet and electronics grew out of a fragment of \"Domaines\" and was a gift for Luciano Berio on his 60th birthday. Lasting around eighteen minutes, it is a dialogue between a solo clarinet (played live, though sometimes reverberated through an offstage piano) and its double (in passages pre-recorded by the same musician and projected around the hall). Boulez approved transcriptions of the piece for bassoon, saxophone, alto flute and recorder.\nIn the early 1970s he had worked on an extended chamber piece called \"\u2026explosante-fixe\u2026\" for eight solo instruments, electronically transformed by a machine called a halophone, but the technology was primitive and he eventually withdrew it. He re-used some of its material in other works, including a later piece with the same name. This definitive version was composed at IRCAM between 1991 and 1993 for MIDI-flute and two accompanying flutes with ensemble and live electronics. By this time the computer could follow the score and respond to triggers from the players. According to Griffiths, \"the principal flute is caught as if in a hall of mirrors, its line imitated in what the other flutes play, and then in the contributions of the larger ensemble\". Hopkins and Griffiths describe it as \"music characteristically caught between thrill and desperation\".\n\"Anth\u00e8mes II\" for violin and electronics (1997) grew out of a piece for solo violin \"Anth\u00e8mes I\" (1991), which Boulez wrote for the Yehudi Menuhin Violin Competition in Paris and which in turn derived from material in the original \"\u2026explosante-fixe\u2026\" The virtuoso writing for the instrument is captured by the electronic system, transformed in real time and propelled around the space to create what Jonathan Goldman calls a \"hyper-violin\". Although this produces effects of speed and complexity which no violinist could achieve, Boulez restricts the palette of electronic sounds so that their source, the violin, is always recognisable.\nLast works.\nIn later works Boulez relinquished electronics, although Griffiths suggests that in \"sur Incises\" (1996\u20131998) the choice of like but distinct instruments, spread across the platform, enabled Boulez to create effects of harmonic, timbral and spatial echo for which he previously used electronic means. The piece is scored for three pianos, three harps and three percussionists (including steel drums) and grew out of \"Incises\" (1993\u20132001), a short piece written for a piano competition. In an interview in 2013 he described it as his most important work\u2014\"because it is the freest\".\n\"Notation VII\" (1999), marked \"hieratic\" in the score, is the longest of the orchestral \"Notations\". According to Griffiths: \"what was abrupt in 1945 is now languorous; what was crude is now done with a lifetime's experience and expertise; what was simple is fantastically embellished, even submerged.\"\n\"D\u00e9rive 2\" started out in 1988 as a five-minute piece, dedicated to Elliott Carter on his 80th birthday; by 2006 it was a 45-minute work for eleven instruments and Boulez's last major composition. According to Claude Samuel, Boulez wanted to explore rhythmic shifts, tempo changes and superimpositions of different speeds, inspired in part by his contact with the music of Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. Boulez described it as \"a sort of narrative mosaic\".\nUnfinished works.\nBoulez's unfinished works include several that he was actively progressing, and others which he put to one side despite their potential for further development. In the latter category, the archives contain three unpublished movements of the Third Piano Sonata and further sections of \"\u00c9clat/Multiples\" which, if performed, would practically double its length.\nAs for works Boulez was working on in his later years, partial drafts in short score of three further orchestral \"Notations\" were found among his papers after his death, of which the most advanced were \"Notations VI\" (59 pages) and \"V\" (41 pages). According to Alain Galliari, they are highly developed in terms of notes and rhythm, but with no more than a few indications of orchestration, and no tempi, dynamics, articulation or phrasing.\nFrom the mid-1960s, Boulez also spoke of composing an opera. In the 1960s he exchanged ideas with the radical French playwright and novelist Jean Genet about a work whose subject would be treason. In the 1980s he discussed with Patrice Ch\u00e9reau an adaptation of Genet's play \"Les Paravents\" (\"The Screens\"). The German playwright Heiner M\u00fcller was working on a version of Aeschylus's \"Oresteia\" for Boulez when he died in 1995. In a 1996 interview Boulez said that he was thinking of Edward Bond's \"The War Plays\" or \"Lear\", \"but only thinking\". When news emerged in 2010 that, at the age of 85, he was working on an opera based on Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\", few believed such an ambitious undertaking could be realised so late in the day. When Boulez's manuscripts were catalogued after his death, it emerged that not a note of any of these projects had been written.\nConducting.\nApproach to conducting.\nBoulez was one of the leading conductors of the second half of the twentieth century. In a career lasting more than sixty years he directed most of the world's major orchestras. He was entirely self-taught, although he said that he learnt a great deal from attending D\u00e9sormi\u00e8re's and Hans Rosbaud's rehearsals. He also cited George Szell as an influential mentor.\nBoulez gave several reasons for conducting as much as he did. He gave his first concerts for the Domaine musical because its financial resources were limited: \"I told myself that, being much less expensive, I would have a go myself.\" He also said that the best possible training for a composer was \"to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution\"\u2014yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose given his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: \"Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it.\"\nNot everyone agreed about the greatness of that gift. According to writer Hans Keller: \"Boulez cannot phrase\u2014it is as simple as that...the reason being that he ignores the harmonic implications of any structure he is dealing with, to the extent of utterly disregarding harmonic rhythm and hence all characteristic rhythm in tonal music...\" Joan Peyser considered that: \"in general Boulez conducts what he loves magnificently, conducts what he likes very well and, with rare exceptions, gives stiff performances of the classic and romantic repertoire\". The conductor Otto Klemperer described him as \"without doubt the only man of his generation who is an outstanding conductor \"and\" musician\".\nHe worked with many leading soloists and had particularly long-term collaborations with Daniel Barenboim and with the soprano Jessye Norman.\nAccording to Peter Heyworth, Boulez produced a lean, athletic sound which, underpinned by his rhythmic exactitude, could generate an electric sense of excitement. The ability to reveal the structure of a score and to clarify dense orchestral textures were hallmarks of his conducting. He conducted without a baton and, as Heyworth observed: \"there is no trace of theatre\u2014not even the rather theatrical sort of economy that was practised by Richard Strauss\". According to Boulez: \"outward excitement uses up inner excitement\".\nBoulez's ear for sound was legendary: \"there are countless stories of him detecting, for example, faulty intonation from the third oboe in a complex orchestral texture\", Paul Griffiths wrote in \"The New York Times\". Oliver Knussen, himself a well-known composer-conductor, observed that \"his rehearsals are models of clear-headedness and professional courtesy\u2014he effortlessly commands respect\".\nWork in the opera house.\nBoulez also conducted in the opera house. His chosen repertoire was small and included no Italian opera. Apart from Wagner, he conducted only twentieth-century works. Of his work with Wieland Wagner on \"Wozzeck\" and \"Parsifal\", Boulez said: \"I would willingly have hitched, if not my entire fate, then at least a part of it, to someone like him, for [our] discussions about music and productions were thrilling.\" They planned other productions together, including Richard Strauss's \"Salome\" and \"Elektra\", Mussorgsky's \"Boris Godunov\" and Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\". However, by the time rehearsals for their Bayreuth \"Parsifal\" began Wieland was already gravely ill and he died in October 1966.\nWhen the Frankfurt \"Wozzeck\" was revived after Wieland's death, Boulez was deeply disillusioned by the working conditions: \"there was no rehearsal, no care taken over anything. The cynicism of the way an opera house like that was run disgusted me. It still disgusts me.\" He later said that it was this experience which prompted his notorious remarks in an interview the following year in \"Der Spiegel\", in which he claimed that \"no opera worth mentioning had been composed since 1935\", that \"a Beatles record is certainly cleverer (and shorter) than a Henze opera\" and that \"the most elegant\" solution to opera's moribund condition would be \"to blow the opera houses up\".\nIn 1967, Boulez, theatre director Jean Vilar and choreographer Maurice B\u00e9jart were asked to devise a scheme for the reform of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, with a view to Boulez becoming its music director. Their plan was derailed by the political fallout from the 1968 student protests. However Bejart used Boulez's music in his ballet \"Improvisation sur Mallarme III\" in 1973. In the mid-1980s, Boulez became vice president of the planned Op\u00e9ra Bastille in Paris, working with Daniel Barenboim, who was to be its music director. In 1988 Pierre Berg\u00e9 was appointed president of the Bastille opera. He dismissed Barenboim and Boulez withdrew in solidarity.\nBoulez conducted only specific projects\u2014in productions by leading stage directors\u2014when he could be satisfied that conditions were right. Thanks to his years with the Renaud-Barrault company, the theatrical dimension was as important to him as the musical and he always attended staging rehearsals.\nFor the centenary \"Ring\" in Bayreuth, Boulez originally asked Ingmar Bergman then Peter Brook to direct, both of whom refused. Peter Stein initially agreed but withdrew in 1974. Patrice Ch\u00e9reau, who was primarily a theatre director, accepted and went on to create one of the defining opera productions of modern times. According to Allan Kozinn the production \"helped open the floodgates of directorial reinterpretation of opera\" (sometimes known as \"Regietheater\"). Ch\u00e9reau treated the story in part as an allegory of capitalism, drawing on ideas that George Bernard Shaw explored in \"The Perfect Wagnerite\" in 1898, and using imagery from the Industrial Age; he achieved an exceptional degree of naturalism in the singers' performances. Boulez's conducting was no less controversial, emphasising continuity, flexibility and transparency over mythic grandeur and weight. In its first year the production met with hostility from the largely conservative audience, and around thirty orchestral musicians refused to work with Boulez in subsequent seasons. Both production and musical realisation grew in stature over the following four years and after the final performance in 1980 there was a 90-minute ovation.\nRecording.\nBoulez's first recordings date from his time with the Domaine musical in the late 1950s and early 1960s and were made for the French Vega label. They include the first of his five recordings of \"Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre\" (with contralto Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Cahn), as well as pieces to which he did not return in the studio (such as Stravinsky's \"Renard\" and Stockhausen's \"Zeitma\u00dfe\"). In 2015 Universal Music brought these recordings together in a 10-CD set.\nBetween 1966 and 1989 he recorded for Columbia Records (later Sony Classical). Among the first projects were the Paris \"Wozzeck\" (with Walter Berry) and the Covent Garden \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" (with George Shirley and Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m). He made a highly praised recording of \"The Rite of Spring\" with the Cleveland Orchestra and supervised a Webern edition, consisting of all the works with opus numbers. He also produced a wide-ranging survey of the music of Schoenberg with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and recorded the orchestral works of Ravel with the New York Philharmonic and the Cleveland Orchestra. As for Boulez's own music, in 1969 he made the first recording of \"Pli selon pli\" (with Halina \u0141ukomska as soprano soloist) and recordings of \"Rituel\" and \"\u00c9clat/Multiples\". In 2014 Sony Classical issued \"Pierre Boulez\u2014The Complete Columbia Album Collection\" on 67 CDs.\nThree operatic projects from this period were picked up by other labels: the Bayreuth \"Ring\" was released on video and LP by Philips; the Bayreuth \"Parsifal\" and Paris \"Lulu\" were recorded for Deutsche Grammophon. For EMI in 1984 he recorded several pieces on Frank Zappa's album \"The Perfect Stranger\" with the Ensemble intercontemporain.\nIn the 1980s, Boulez also recorded for the Erato label, mostly with the Ensemble intercontemporain, with a greater emphasis on the music of his contemporaries such as Berio, Ligeti and Carter, as well as a survey of some of his own music, including \"Le Visage nuptial\", \"Le Soleil des eaux\" and \"Figures\u2014Doubles\u2014Prismes\". In 2015 Erato issued \"Pierre Boulez\u2014The Complete Erato Recordings\" on 14 CDs. \nFrom 1991 onwards, Boulez recorded under an exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon. It centred on the orchestras of Chicago and Cleveland in the United States and Vienna and Berlin in Europe. He re-recorded much of his core repertoire and oversaw a second Webern edition, including the unpublished works. His own late music featured prominently, including \"R\u00e9pons\", \"...explosante-fixe...\" and \"sur Incises\". The most significant addition to his recorded repertoire was the multi-orchestra cycle of the Mahler symphonies and vocal works with orchestra. An 88-disc set of all Boulez's recordings for Deutsche Grammophon, Philips and Decca was issued in 2022.\nMany hundreds of concerts conducted by Boulez are held in the archives of radio stations and orchestras. In 2005 the Chicago Symphony Orchestra released a 2-CD set of broadcasts by Boulez, focusing on works which he had not recorded commercially, including Jan\u00e1\u010dek's \"Glagolitic Mass\" and Messiaen's \"L'Ascension\".\nWriting and teaching.\nAccording to Jean-Jacques Nattiez, Boulez was one of two twentieth-century composers who wrote most prolifically about music, the other being Schoenberg. It was with a 1952 article with the inflammatory title \"Schoenberg is Dead\", published in the British journal \"The Score\" shortly after the older composer's death, that Boulez first attracted international attention as a writer. This highly polemical piece, in which he attacked Schoenberg for his conservatism, contrasting it with Webern's radicalism, caused widespread controversy.\nJonathan Goldman points out that, over the decades, Boulez's writings addressed very different readerships: in the 1950s the cultured Parisian attendees of the Domaine musical; in the 1960s the specialised avant-garde composers and performers of the Darmstadt and Basel courses; and, between 1976 and 1995, the highly literate but non-specialist audience of the lectures he gave as Professor of the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Much of Boulez's writing was linked to specific occasions, whether a first performance of a new piece, notes for a recording or a eulogy for a lost colleague. Generally he avoided publishing detailed analyses, other than one of \"The Rite of Spring\". As Nattiez points out: \"as a writer Boulez is a communicator of ideas rather than of technical information. This may sometimes prove disappointing to composition students, but it is no doubt a peculiarity of his writing that explains its popularity with non-musicians.\"\nBoulez's writings have appeared in English as \"Stocktakings from an Apprenticeship\", \"Boulez on Music Today\", \"Orientations: Collected Writings\" and \"Pierre Boulez, Music Lessons: The Complete Coll\u00e8ge de France Lectures\". Throughout his career he also expressed himself through long-form interviews, of which perhaps the most substantial are those with Antoine Gol\u00e9a (1958), C\u00e9lestin Deli\u00e8ge (1975) and Jean Vermeil (1989). Two volumes of correspondence have been published: with the composer John Cage (from the period 1949\u201362); and with the anthropologist and ethnomusicologist Andr\u00e9 Schaeffner (from 1954 to 1970).\nBoulez taught at the Darmstadt Summer School most years between 1954 and 1965. He was professor of composition at the Basel Music Academy in Switzerland (1960\u201363) and a visiting lecturer at Harvard University in 1963. He also taught privately in the early part of his career. Students included the composers Richard Rodney Bennett, Jean-Claude \u00c9loy and Heinz Holliger.\nCharacter and personal life.\nAs a young man Boulez was an explosive, often confrontational figure. Jean-Louis Barrault, who knew him in his twenties, caught the contradictions in his personality: \"his powerful aggressiveness was a sign of creative passion, a particular blend of intransigence and humour, the way his moods of affection and insolence succeeded one another, all these had drawn us near to him\". Messiaen said later: \"He was in revolt against everything.\" At one point Boulez turned against Messiaen, describing his \"Trois petites liturgies de la pr\u00e9sence divine\" as \"brothel music\" and saying that the \"Turangal\u00eela-Symphonie\" made him vomit. It was five years before relations were restored.\nIn a 2000 article in \"The New Yorker\", Alex Ross described Boulez as a bully. Boulez did not disagree: \"Certainly I was a bully. I'm not ashamed of it at all. The hostility of the establishment to what you were able to do in the Forties and Fifties was very strong. Sometimes you have to fight against your society.\" One of the most notorious instances of this is Boulez's declaration in 1952 that \"any musician who has not experienced\u200d\u2014\u200cI do not say understood, but truly experienced\u200d\u2014\u200cthe necessity of dodecaphonic music is USELESS. For his whole work is irrelevant to the needs of his epoch.\"\nThose who knew Boulez well often referred to his loyalty, both to individuals and to organisations. When his mentor, the conductor Roger D\u00e9sormi\u00e8re, was paralysed by a stroke in 1952 Boulez sent scripts to French Radio in D\u00e9sormi\u00e8re's name so that the older man could collect the fee. The writer Jean Vermeil, who observed Boulez in the 1990s in the company of Jean Batigne (founder of the Percussions de Strasbourg), discovered \"a Boulez asking about the health of a musician in the Strasbourg orchestra, about another player's children, a Boulez who knew everyone by name and who reacted to each person's news with sadness or with joy\". In later life, he was known for his charm and personal warmth. Of his humour, Gerard McBurney wrote that it \"depended on his twinkling eyes, his perfect timing, his infectious schoolboy giggle, and his reckless compulsion always to say what the other person would not expect\".\nBoulez read widely and identified Proust, Joyce and Kafka as particular influences. He had a lifelong interest in the visual arts. He wrote extensively about the painter Paul Klee and owned works by Joan Mir\u00f3, Francis Bacon, Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl and Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, all of whom he knew personally. He also had close links with three of the leading philosophers of the time: Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes.\nHe was a keen walker and, when he was at home in Baden-Baden, spent the late afternoons and much of the weekends walking in the Black Forest. He owned an old farmhouse in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department of France and built another, modern home on the same land in the late 1970s.\nIn its obituary, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"about his private life he remained tightly guarded\". Boulez acknowledged to Joan Peyser that there was a passionate affair in 1946, described as \"intense and tormented\" and which Peyser suggested was the trigger for the \"wild, courageous works\" of that period. After Boulez's death, his sister Jeanne told the biographer Christian Merlin that the affair was with the actress Mar\u00eda Casares, but Merlin concludes that there is little evidence to support this. Merlin acknowledges the speculation that Boulez was gay. He writes that in 1972 Boulez engaged a young German, Hans Messner, as his personal assistant to look after the practicalities of his life. Messner, who called Boulez 'Monsieur' and whom Boulez sometimes introduced as his valet, lived in the Baden-Baden house until the end of Boulez's life and usually accompanied him when he travelled abroad. Although Merlin observes that in later years it was sometimes difficult to tell whether Messner was looking after Boulez or the other way round, his view is that there is no evidence that they were ever life partners. Towards the end of Boulez's life, Messner blocked Boulez's sister Jeanne from visiting the house. He was with Boulez when he died. \nIn his portrait for \"The New Yorker\", published shortly after Boulez's death under the title \"The Magus\", Alex Ross described Boulez as \"affable, implacable, unknowable\".\nLegacy.\nIn an article published for Boulez's 80th birthday in \"The Guardian\", the composer George Benjamin wrote that \"Boulez has produced a catalogue of wondrously luminous and scintillating works. Within them a rigorous compositional skill is coupled to an imagination of extraordinary aural refinement\". By contrast, John Adams described Boulez as \"a mannerist, a niche composer, a master who worked with a very small hammer\". In a piece in \"The New York Times\" to mark Boulez's 90th birthday, Nico Muhly emphasised what he called the decadent qualities of Boulez's later music: \"You can feel the butter swirling in that pan. And when he conducts it, he teases out these luxurious textures.\"\nIn 1986 Boulez entered into an agreement to place his musical and literary manuscripts with the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. When he died in January 2016, he left no will. In 2017, the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France announced that his estate had made a substantial donation of private papers and possessions not covered by the Sacher contract, including 220 metres of books, 50 metres of archives and correspondence, as well as scores, photographs, recordings and about 100 other objects.\nIn October 2016, the large concert hall of the Philharmonie de Paris, for which Boulez campaigned for many years, was renamed the Grande salle Pierre Boulez. In March 2017, a new concert hall, the Pierre Boulez Saal, designed by Frank Gehry, was opened in Berlin under the auspices of the Barenboim\u2013Said Academy. It is home to a new Boulez Ensemble, made up of members of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, the Berlin Staatskapelle and guest musicians from Berlin and around the world.\nBoulez's music continues to be taken up by interpreters of the next generation. In September 2018 the first edition of the Pierre Boulez Biennial took place in Paris and Berlin, a joint initiative by the Philharmonie de Paris and the Staatskapelle Berlin under Daniel Barenboim, in which performances of Boulez's music are set in the context of works which influenced him. The second Biennial was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, but a modified version went ahead (online in 2020, in person in 2021), with a particular focus on the piano music. The third iteration took place in April/May 2023.\nThe centenary in 2025 of Boulez's birth will be marked by concerts, exhibitions and other events. The Philharmonie de Paris is presenting a series of concerts featuring his music; it began with a programme of \"R\u00e9pons\" and other works, played by the Ensemble intercontemporain, joined by former members, the cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras and the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard. In its 2024/2025 season, the New York Philharmonic will present two concerts\u2014one of which will be a recreation of a Boulez programme from 1974\u2014and an exhibition. On 26 March 2025 (the anniversary date), as part of a 'Total Immersion Day' at the Barbican in London, the BBC Symphony Orchestra performed the complete \"Pli selon pli\", conducted by Martyn Brabbins, interspersed with films and talks with people who worked with Boulez. In May, Esa-Pekka Salonen will conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in programmes which will include performances of \"Rituel\", presented in collaboration with LA Dance Project and choreographer Benjamin Millepied. In August, the Lucerne Summer Festival will feature a rare performance of \"Po\u00e9sie pour pouvoir\" for tape and three orchestras (conducted by David Robertson), as well as \"R\u00e9pons\", \"Figures-Doubles-Prismes\" and other works. Other series and individual concerts will be presented across the year by the Pierre Boulez Saal in Berlin, the Festspielhaus Baden-Baden, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\nHonours and awards.\nState honours awarded to Boulez included Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE); and Knight Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.
