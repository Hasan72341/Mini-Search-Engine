The c.\u2009215 treatises that survive today mainly deal with alchemy and chemistry, magic, and Shi'ite religious philosophy. However, the original scope of the corpus was vast, covering a wide range of topics ranging from cosmology, astronomy and astrology, over medicine, pharmacology, zoology and botany, to metaphysics, logic, and grammar.\nThe works attributed to Jabir, which are tentatively dated to c.\u2009850\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009950, contain the oldest known systematic classification of chemical substances, and the oldest known instructions for deriving an inorganic compound (sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair) by chemical means. His works also contain one of the earliest known versions of the sulfur-mercury theory of metals, a mineralogical theory that would remain dominant until the 18th century.\nA significant part of Jabir's writings deal with a philosophical theory known as \"the science of the balance\" (Arabic: \"\u02bfilm al-m\u012bz\u0101n\"), which was aimed at reducing all phenomena (including material substances and their elements) to a system of measures and quantitative proportions. The Jabirian works also contain some of the earliest preserved Shi'ite imamological doctrines, which Jabir presented as deriving from his purported master, the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq (died 765).\nAs early as the 10th century, the identity and exact corpus of works of Jabir was in dispute in Islamic scholarly circles. The authorship of all these works by a single figure, and even the existence of a historical Jabir, are also doubted by modern scholars. Instead, Jabir ibn Hayyan is generally thought to have been a pseudonym used by an anonymous school of Shi'ite alchemists writing in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.\nSome Arabic Jabirian works (e.g., \"The Great Book of Mercy\", and \"The Book of Seventy\") were translated into Latin under the Latinized name Geber, and in 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, usually referred to as pseudo-Geber, started to produce alchemical and metallurgical writings under this name.\nBiography.\nHistoricity.\nIt is not clear whether Jabir ibn Hayyan ever existed as a historical person. He is purported to have lived in the 8th century, and to have been a disciple of the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq (died 765). However, he is not mentioned in any historical source before c. 900, and the first known author to write about Jabir from a biographical point of view was the Baghdadi bibliographer Ibn al-Nad\u012bm (c. 932\u2013995). In his \"Fihrist\" (\"The Book Catalogue\", written in 987), Ibn al-Nad\u012bm compiled a list of Jabir's works, adding a short notice on the various claims that were then circulating about Jabir. Already in Ibn al-Nad\u012bm's time, there were some people who explicitly asserted that Jabir had never existed, although Ibn al-Nad\u012bm himself disagreed with this claim. Jabir was often ignored by later medieval Islamic biographers and historians, but even early Shi'ite biographers such as A\u1e25mad al-Barq\u012b (died c. 893), Ab\u016b \u02bfAmr al-Kashsh\u012b (first half of the 10th century), A\u1e25mad ibn \u02bfAl\u012b al-Naj\u0101sh\u012b (983\u20131058), and Ab\u016b Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (995\u20131067), who wrote long volumes on the companions of the Shi'ite Imams (including the many companions of Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq), did not mention Jabir at all.\nDating of the Jabirian corpus.\nApart from outright denying his existence, there were also some who, already in Ibn al-Nad\u012bm's time, questioned whether the writings attributed to Jabir were really written by him. The authenticity of these writings was expressly denied by the Baghdadi philosopher Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n al-Sijist\u0101n\u012b (c. 912\u2013985) and his pupil Ab\u016b \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-Taw\u1e25\u012bd\u012b (c. 932\u20131023), though this may have been related to the hostility of both these thinkers to alchemy in general. Modern scholarly analysis has tended to confirm the inauthenticity of the writings attributed to Jabir. Much of the philosophical terminology used in the Jabirian treatises was only coined around the middle of the 9th century, and some of the Greek philosophical texts cited in the Jabirian writings are known to have been translated into Arabic towards the end of the 9th century. Moreover, an important part of the corpus deals with early Shi'ite religious philosophy that is elsewhere only attested in late 9th-century and early 10th-century sources. As a result, the dating of the Jabirian corpus to c. 850\u2013950 has been widely accepted in modern scholarship. However, it has also been noted that many Jabirian treatises show clear signs of having been redacted multiple times, and the writings as we now have them may well have been based on an earlier 8th-century core. Despite the obscurity involved, it is not impossible that some of these writings, in their earliest form, were written by a real Jabir ibn Hayyan. In any case, it is clear that Jabir's name was used as a pseudonym by one or more anonymous Shi'ite alchemists writing in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, who also redacted the corpus as we now know it.\nBiographical clues and legend.\nJabir was generally known by the \"kunya\" Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 (\"Father of M\u016bs\u0101\"), or sometimes Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h (\"Father of \u02bfAbd All\u0101h\"), and by the \"nisba\"s (attributive names) al-\u1e62\u016bf\u012b, al-Azd\u012b, al-K\u016bf\u012b, or al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b. His grandfather's name is mentioned by Ibn al-Nadim as \u02bfAbd All\u0101h. If the attribution of the name al-Azd\u012b to Jabir is authentic, this would point to his affiliation with the Southern-Arabian (Yemenite) tribe of the Azd. However, it is not clear whether Jabir was an Arab belonging to the Azd tribe, or a non-Arab Muslim client (\"mawl\u0101\") of the Azd. If he was a non-Arab Muslim client of the Azd, he is most likely to have been Persian, given his ties with eastern Iran (his \"nisba\" al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b also points to Tus, a city in Khurasan). According to Ibn al-Nad\u012bm, Jabir hailed from Khurasan (eastern Iran), but spent most of his life in Kufa (Iraq), both regions where the Azd tribe was well-settled. Various late reports put his date of death between 806 (190 AH) and 816 (200 AH).\nGiven the lack of independent biographical sources, most of the biographical information about Jabir can be traced back to the Jabirian writings themselves. There are references throughout the Jabirian corpus to the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq (died 765), whom Jabir generally calls \"my master\" (Arabic: \"sayyid\u012b\"), and whom he represents as the original source of all his knowledge. In one work, Jabir is also represented as an associate of the Bactrian vizier family of the Barmakids, whereas Ibn al-Nad\u012bm reports that some claimed Jabir to have been especially devoted to Ja\u02bffar ibn Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-Barmak\u012b (767\u2013803), the Abbasid vizier of \"One Thousand and One Nights\" fame. Jabir's links with the Abbasids were stressed even more by later tradition, which turned him into a favorite of the Abbasid caliph H\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd (c. 763\u2013809, also appearing in \"One Thousand and One Nights\"), for whom Jabir would have composed a treatise on alchemy, and who is supposed to have commanded the translation of Greek works into Arabic on Jabir's instigation.\nGiven Jabir's purported ties with both the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq and the Barmakid family (who served the Abbasids as viziers), or with the Abbasid caliphs themselves, it has sometimes been thought plausible that \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-\u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r (\"Hayyan the Druggist\"), a proto-Shi'ite activist who was fighting for the Abbasid cause in the early 8th century, may have been Jabir's father (Jabir's name \"Ibn Hayyan\" literally means \"The Son of Hayyan\"). Although there is no direct evidence supporting this hypothesis, it fits very well in the historical context, and it allows one to think of Jabir, however obscure, as a historical figure. Because \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-\u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r was supposedly executed not long after 721, the hypothesis even made it possible to estimate Jabir's date of birth at c.\u2009721. However, it has recently been argued that \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-\u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r probably lived at least until c.\u2009744, and that as a client (\"mawl\u0101\") of the Nakha\u02bf tribe he is highly unlikely to have been the father of Jabir (who is supposed to have been a client/member of the Azd).\nThe Jabirian corpus.\nThere are about 600 Arabic works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan that are known by name, approximately 215 of which are still extant today. Though some of these are full-length works (e.g., \"The Great Book on Specific Properties\"), most of them are relatively short treatises and belong to larger collections (\"The One Hundred and Twelve Books\", \"The Five Hundred Books\", etc.) in which they function rather more like chapters. When the individual chapters of some full-length works are counted as separate treatises too, the total length of the corpus may be estimated at 3000 treatises/chapters.\nThe overwhelming majority of Jabirian treatises that are still extant today deal with alchemy or chemistry (though these may also contain religious speculations, and discuss a wide range of other topics ranging from cosmology to grammar). Nevertheless, there are also a few extant treatises which deal with magic, i.e., \"the science of talismans\" (\"\u02bfilm al-\u1e6dilasm\u0101t\", a form of theurgy) and \"the science of specific properties\" (\"\u02bfilm al-khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63\", the science dealing with the hidden powers of mineral, vegetable and animal substances, and with their practical applications in medical and various other pursuits). Other writings dealing with a great variety of subjects were also attributed to Jabir (this includes such subjects as engineering, medicine, pharmacology, zoology, botany, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, astronomy and astrology), but almost all of these are lost today.\nAlchemical writings.\nNote that Paul Kraus, who first catalogued the Jabirian writings and whose numbering is followed here, conceived of his division of Jabir's alchemical writings (Kr. nos. 5\u20131149) as roughly chronological in order.\nWritings on magic (talismans, specific properties).\nAmong the surviving Jabirian treatises, there are also a number of relatively independent treatises dealing with \"the science of talismans\" (\"\u02bfilm al-\u1e6dilasm\u0101t\", a form of theurgy) and with \"the science of specific properties\" (\"\u02bfilm al-khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63\", i.e., the science dealing with the hidden powers of mineral, vegetable and animal substances, and with their practical applications in medical and various other pursuits). These are:\nOther extant writings.\nWritings on a wide variety of other topics were also attributed to Jabir. Most of these are lost (see below), except for:\nLost writings.\nAlthough a significant number of the Jabirian treatises on alchemy and magic do survive, many of them are also lost. Apart from two surviving treatises (see immediately above), Jabir's many writings on other topics are all lost:\nHistorical background.\nGreco-Egyptian, Byzantine and Persian alchemy.\nThe Jabirian writings contain a number of references to Greco-Egyptian alchemists such as pseudo-Democritus (fl. c. 60), Mary the Jewess (fl. c. 0\u2013300), Agathodaemon (fl. c. 300), and Zosimos of Panopolis (fl. c. 300), as well as to legendary figures such as Hermes Trismegistus and Ostanes, and to scriptural figures such as Moses and Jesus (to whom a number of alchemical writings were also ascribed). However, these references may have been meant as an appeal to ancient authority rather than as an acknowledgement of any intellectual borrowing, and in any case Jabirian alchemy was very different from what is found in the extant Greek alchemical treatises: it was much more systematic and coherent, it made much less use of allegory and symbols, and a much more important place was occupied by philosophical speculations and their application to laboratory experiments. Furthermore, whereas Greek alchemical texts had been almost exclusively focused on the use of mineral substances (i.e., on 'inorganic chemistry'), Jabirian alchemy pioneered the use of vegetable and animal substances, and so represented an innovative shift towards 'organic chemistry'.\nNevertheless, there are some important theoretical similarities between Jabirian alchemy and contemporary Byzantine alchemy, and even though the Jabirian authors do not seem to have known Byzantine works that are extant today such as the alchemical works attributed to the Neoplatonic philosophers Olympiodorus (c. 495\u2013570) and Stephanus of Alexandria (fl. c. 580\u2013640), it seems that they were at least partly drawing on a parallel tradition of theoretical and philosophical alchemy. In any case, the writings actually used by the Jabirian authors appear to have mainly consisted of alchemical works falsely attributed to ancient philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Apollonius of Tyana, only some of which are still extant today, and whose philosophical content still needs to be determined.\nOne of the innovations in Jabirian alchemy was the addition of sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) to the category of chemical substances known as 'spirits' (i.e., strongly volatile substances). This included both naturally occurring sal ammoniac and synthetic ammonium chloride as produced from organic substances, and so the addition of sal ammoniac to the list of 'spirits' is likely a product of the new focus on organic chemistry. Since the word for sal ammoniac used in the Jabirian corpus (\"no\u0161\u0101der\") is Iranian in origin, it has been suggested that the direct precursors of Jabirian alchemy may have been active in the Hellenizing and Syriacizing schools of the Sassanid Empire.\nChemical philosophy.\nElements and natures.\nAccording to Aristotelian physics, each element is composed of two qualities: fire is hot and dry, earth is cold and dry, water is cold and moist, and air is hot and moist. In the Jabirian corpus, these qualities came to be called \"natures\" (Arabic: \"\u1e6dab\u0101\u02bei\u02bf\"), and elements are said to be composed of these 'natures', plus an underlying \"substance\" (\"jawhar\"). In metals two of these 'natures' were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was cold and dry on the outside, but hot and moist on the inside, while gold was hot and moist on the outside, but cold and dry on the inside. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the natures of one metal, a different metal would result. Much like doctors used medicines to cure an imbalance of the four humors, Jabir believed metals could be 'cured' by a medicine, the elusive elixir (Arabic: ) that would make this transformation possible. \nThe sulfur\u2013mercury theory of metals.\nThe sulfur\u2013mercury theory of metals, though first attested in pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana's \"The Secret of Creation\" (\"Sirr al-khal\u012bqa\", late 8th or early 9th century, but largely based on older sources), was also adopted by the Jabirian authors. According to the Jabirian version of this theory, metals form in the earth through the mixing of sulfur and mercury. Depending on the quality of the sulfur, different metals are formed, with gold being formed by the most subtle and well-balanced sulfur. This theory, which is ultimately based on ancient meteorological speculations such as those found in Aristotle's \"Meteorology\", formed the basis of all theories of metallic composition until the 18th century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The systems in this family use Acorn's own ARM architecture processors and initially ran the Arthur operating system, with later models introducing RISC OS and, in a separate workstation range, RISC iX. The first Archimedes models were introduced in 1987, and systems in the Archimedes family were sold until the mid-1990s alongside Acorn's newer Risc PC and A7000 models.\nThe first Archimedes models, featuring a 32-bit ARM2 RISC CPU running at 8\u00a0MHz, provided a significant upgrade from Acorn's previous machines and 8-bit home computers in general. Acorn's publicity claimed a performance rating of 4\u00a0MIPS. Later models featured the ARM3 CPU, delivering a substantial performance improvement, and the first ARM system-on-a-chip, the ARM250.\nThe Archimedes preserves a degree of compatibility with Acorn's earlier machines, offering BBC BASIC, support for running 8-bit applications, and display modes compatible with those earlier machines. Following on from Acorn's involvement with the BBC Micro, two of the first models\u2014the A305 and A310\u2014were given BBC branding.\nThe name \"Acorn Archimedes\" is commonly used to describe any of Acorn's contemporary designs based on the same architecture. This architecture can be broadly characterised as involving the ARM CPU and the first generation chipset consisting of MEMC (MEMory Controller), VIDC (VIDeo and sound Controller) and IOC (Input Output Controller).\nHistory.\nHaving introduced the BBC Micro in 1981, Acorn established itself as a major supplier to primary and secondary education in the United Kingdom. However, attempts to replicate this dominance in other sectors, such as home computing with the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, and in other markets, including the United States and West Germany, were less successful.\nAs microprocessor and computing technology advanced in the early 1980s, microcomputer manufacturers had to consider evolving their product lines to offer increased capabilities and performance. Acorn's strategy for business computing and development of more capable machines involved a range of \"second processor\" expansions, including a Z80 second processor running the CP/M operating system, a commitment made by Acorn when securing the BBC Micro contract.\nMeanwhile, established platforms like CP/M running on Z80 processors faced competition from the IBM PC running PC DOS and computers with a variety of operating systems on Intel processors such as the 8088 and 8086. Systems using the Motorola 68000 and other processors running the Unix operating system also became available. Apple launched the Lisa and Macintosh computers, and Digital Research introduced its own GEM graphical user interface software, building on previous work by Xerox.\nAcorn's strategy seemingly evolved to align with Torch Computers\u2014a company that Acorn considered acquiring\u2014which had already combined BBC Micro hardware with second processors (and modems) to produce their Communicator product line and derivatives. In 1984, Acorn introduced the Acorn Business Computer (ABC) range, based on the BBC Micro architecture, offering models with different second processors and capabilities to respond to computing trends at the time. These models received generally favorable reviews from the computing press. However, with Acorn facing financial strain, the company was rescued by Olivetti in 1985, leaving the ABC's future uncertain in the expected restructuring process. Ultimately, only one of the variants\u2014the Acorn Cambridge Workstation\u2014would reach the market, in a somewhat different form than originally planned.\nThe demise of the Acorn Business Computer left Acorn purely with a range of 8-bit microcomputer products, leaving the company vulnerable to competitors introducing 16-bit and 32-bit machines. The increasing dominance of MS-DOS in the business market and advocacy for the use of such software in the education sector left Acorn at risk of potential exclusion from its core market. Meanwhile, competing machines attempted to offer a degree of compatibility with the BBC Micro, enticing schools to upgrade to newer, more powerful non-Acorn machines while retaining access to software developed and purchased for Acorn's \"aging machine\". Acorn's ability to respond convincingly to these competitive threats was evidently constrained: the BBC Model B+ was merely a redesigned BBC Model B (with some heritage in the ABC endeavour) providing some extra memory but costing more than its predecessor, being labelled as a \"stop gap\" by Acorn User's technical editor, expressing frustration at opportunities not taken for cost reduction and at a general lack of technological innovation in that \"Acorn has never shown interest in anything as exciting as the 68000\". Disillusionment was sufficient for some software producers to signal a withdrawal from the Acorn market.\nOther commentators who responded to the B+ suggested that Acorn pursue the second processor strategy more aggressively, leveraging the existing user base of the BBC Micro while those users were still using the machine. In 1986, Acorn introduced the BBC Master series, starting with the Master 128 which re-emphasised second processors in the form of internally fitted \"co-processors\". Although a modest evolution of the existing 6502-based platform, enthusiasm for the series was somewhat greater than that for the B+ models, with dealers and software developers citing the expansion capabilities and improved compatibility over the B+. However, the competitiveness of these co-processors proved to be constrained by hardware limitations, compatibility and pricing, with a Master 512 system featuring a Master 128 and 80186 co-processor comparing unfavourably to complete IBM PC-compatible systems. The planned Master Scientific product was never launched, leaving potential customers with the existing Cambridge Co-Processor expansion as their only available option.\nAttitudes towards Acorn and its technological position changed somewhat in late 1985 as news of its RISC microprocessor development effort emerged, potentially encouraging Olivetti to continue its support for the company at \"a critical stage\" in its refinancing of Acorn. Subsequent commentary suggested the availability of this microprocessor\u2014the Acorn RISC Machine\u2014in future computers as well as in an evaluation board for the BBC Micro, although such a board\u2014the ARM Evaluation System\u2014would only be announced in mid-1986 at a cost of \u00a34500. Having also developed the additional support chips required to make up a complete microcomputer, Acorn was regarded as having leapt ahead of its nearest competitors.\nOn the eve of the announcement of Acorn's 32-bit ARM-based microcomputer products, prototypes designated A1 and A500 were demonstrated on the BBC television programme \"Micro Live\" exhibiting BASIC language performance ten times faster than a newly introduced 80386-based computer from perennial education sector rival Research Machines, with suggestions made that the machines would carry the BBC branding. Revealingly, Acorn's managing director noted, \"Over the past two years we've paid the price of having no 16-bit micro.\"\nModels.\nThe first available models in the family were the A305, A310 and A440, introduced in 1987, followed by the A3000, A410/1, A420/1 and A440/1 in 1989, A540 in 1990, A5000 in 1991, A4 in 1992, with the A3010, A3020 and A4000 being the final models, also introduced in 1992.\nA300 and A400 series.\nPowered by an ARM2 (Acorn RISC Machine) processor, the Acorn Archimedes was variously described as \"the first RISC machine inexpensive enough for home use\", and \"the first commercially-available RISC-based microcomputer\". The first models were released in June 1987, as the 300 and 400 series. The 400 series included four expansion slots and an ST-506 controller for an internal hard drive, whereas the 300 series required the addition of a backplane to gain expansion slot capabilities. A two slot backplane could be added to the 300 series as an official upgrade, with the possibility of 4-slot backplane being available from third parties, but a hard drive expansion card was also required for these machines, occupying one slot.\nBoth series included the Arthur operating system (later replaced by RISC OS as a paid-for upgrade), BBC BASIC programming language, and an emulator for Acorn's earlier BBC Micro, and were mounted in two-part cases with a small central unit, monitor on top, and a separate keyboard and three-button mouse (the middle one used for pop-up context menus of the operating system). All models featured eight-channel 8-bit stereo sound and were capable of displaying 256 colours on screen.\nThree models were initially released with different amounts of memory, the A305, A310 and A440. The 400 series models were replaced in 1989 by the A410/1, the A420/1 and A440/1, these featuring an upgraded MEMC1a and RISC OS. Earlier models which shipped with Arthur could be upgraded to RISC OS 2 by replacing the ROM chip containing the operating system. Because the ROM chips contained the operating system, the computer booted instantly into its GUI system, familiar from the Atari ST.\nDespite the A310 being limited to 1\u00a0MB of RAM officially, several companies made upgrades to 2\u00a0MB and 4\u00a0MB, with the smaller upgrades augmenting the built-in RAM and the larger upgrades replacing it entirely. The 400 series were officially limited to 4\u00a0MB of RAM, but several companies released 8\u00a0MB upgrades that provided an extra MEMC chip plus 4\u00a0MB of RAM to complement an existing 4\u00a0MB of fitted RAM.\nA3000.\nIn early 1989, speculation about new machines in the Archimedes range envisaged a low-cost, cut-down model with 512\u00a0KB of RAM to replace the A305 in a fashion reminiscent of the Master Compact. This speculation evolved to more accurately predict a machine with 1\u00a0MB of RAM aimed at junior or primary schools. Other commentators correctly predicted the provision of an internal disc drive and a single \"special\" podule slot. However, any new, low-cost product providing support for up to 2\u00a0MB of RAM also raised questions about the future of the 300 series, given the limitation of the 300 series to a maximum of 1\u00a0MB at that time.\nConcurrently with these rumoured product development efforts, work had commenced on a successor to the Arthur operating system, initially named Arthur 2 but renamed to RISC OS 2 for launch. In May 1989, a number of new machines were introduced along with RISC OS 2: the 300 series was phased out in favour of the new BBC A3000, and the 400 series were replaced by the improved 400/1 series models. Having been developed in a \"remarkably short timescale of nine months\", the machine was the \"major learning vehicle\" for an integrated CAD system introduced at Acorn employing products from Valid Logic Systems, and it was reported that the A3000 was the first home microcomputer to use surface mount technology in its construction, with the machine being built at Acorn's longstanding manufacturing partner, AB Electronics.\nThe A3000 used an 8\u00a0MHz ARM2 and was supplied with 1 MB of RAM and RISC OS on 512 KB of ROM. Unlike the previous models, the A3000 came in a single-part case similar to the BBC Micro, Amiga 500 and Atari ST computers, with the keyboard and disc drive integrated into a base unit \"slightly smaller than the Master 128\". Despite the machine's desktop footprint, being larger than a simple keyboard, the case was not designed to support a monitor. Acorn offered a monitor stand that attached to the machine, this being bundled with Acorn's Learning Curve package, and PRES announced a monitor plinth and external disc drive case.\nThe new model sported only a single internal expansion slot, which was physically different from that of the earlier models, although electrically similar. An external connector could interface to existing expansion cards, with an external case for such cards being recommended and anticipated at the machine's launch, and one such solution subsequently being provided by PRES's expansion system. Acorn announced a combined user port and MIDI expansion for the internal slot at the machine's launch, priced at \u00a349. To enable the machine's serial port, an upgrade costing \u00a319 was required, and Econet support was also an optional extra.\nAlthough only intended to be upgradeable to 2 MB of RAM, third-party vendors offered upgrades to 4 MB along with expansions offering additional disc drive connections and combinations of user and analogue ports, both of these helping those upgrading from Acorn's 8-bit products, particularly in education, to make use of existing peripherals such as 5.25-inch drives, input devices and data logging equipment. Simtec Electronics even offered a RAM upgrade to 8\u00a0MB for the A3000 alongside other models. In 1996, IFEL announced a memory upgrade for the A3000 utilising a generic 72-pin SIMM module to provide 4\u00a0MB of RAM. Hard drive expansions based on ST506, SCSI and IDE technologies were also offered by a range of vendors.\nWith the \"British Broadcasting Corporation Computer System\" branding, the \"main market\" for the A3000 was schools and education authorities, and the educational price of \u00a3529\u2014not considerably more expensive than the BBC Master\u2014was considered to be competitive and persuasive in getting this particular audience to upgrade to Acorn's 32-bit systems. The retail price of \u00a3649 plus VAT was considered an \"expensive alternative\" to the intended competition\u2014the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST\u2014but many times faster than similarly priced models of those ranges. The Amiga 500, it was noted, cost a \"not-so-bargain\" \u00a3550 once upgraded to 1 MB of RAM.\nThe relative affordability of the A3000 compared to the first Archimedes machines and the release of RISC OS helped to convince educational software producers of the viability of the platform. Shortly after the A3000's launch, one local education authority had already ordered 500 machines, aiming to introduce the A3000 to its primary schools in addition to other levels of education. Such was the success of the model that it alone had 37 percent of the UK schools market in a nine-month period in 1991 and, by the end of that year, was estimated to represent 15 percent of the 500,000 or more computers installed in the country's schools.\nThe appeal of the A3000 to education may also have motivated the return of Microvitec to the Acorn market with the Cub3000 monitor: a re-engineered version of the Cub monitor that was popular amongst institutional users of the original BBC Micro. Having been \"nowhere to be seen\" when the Archimedes was released, Microvitec had sought to introduce its own Cubpack range of IBM PC-compatible personal computers for the education market offering some BBC BASIC compatibility, building on an estimated 80 percent market share for 14-inch colour monitors in the sector, and aspiring to launch an \"interactive video workstation\".\nThe introduction of the A3000 also saw Acorn regaining a presence in mainstream retail channels, through a deal with high street retailer Dixons to sell the computer at \"business centre\" outlets, followed by agreements with the John Lewis and Alders chains. Acorn also sought to secure the interest of games publishers, hosting a conference in August 1989 for representatives of \"the top 30 software houses, including Ocean, Domark, US Gold, Grand Slam and Electronic Arts\".\nMarketing efforts towards home users continued in 1990 with the introduction of The Learning Curve: a bundle of A3000 and application software priced at \u00a3699 plus VAT, requiring a SCART capable television (and appropriate \"active\" cable), or bundled with a colour monitor and Acorn's monitor stand for \u00a3949 plus VAT. The software, having a retail value of around \u00a3200, consisted of the second, RISC OS compliant version of Acorn's First Word Plus, the hypermedia application Genesis, and the PC Emulator software, with an introductory video presented by Fred Harris, formerly of \"Micro Live\". Aiming at the \"pre-Christmas market\" in 1990, another bundle called Jet Set offered a more entertainment-focused collection of software valued at \u00a3200 including Clares' Interdictor flight simulator, Domark's Trivial Pursuit, Superior Golf, and the Euclid 3D modelling package from Ace Computing. The price of this bundle was \u00a3747.50 which also included a television modulator developed by the bundle's distributor, ZCL, designed for use with \"any TV set\" and offering a \"monitor quality\" picture.\nPre-launch speculation for the A3000 had suggested the inclusion of a TV modulator and a possible price of \u00a3399 for a 512\u00a0KB \"Archimedes 205\" machine aimed at the home market. Rumours about the integration of various elements of Acorn's chipset\u2014specifically, MEMC and VIDC\u2014to \"do an Electron\" were regarded as logistically demanding and thus unlikely to reduce cost. Such increased integration and targeting of the home market was later pursued with the introduction of the A3010 in 1992.\nA540.\nThe A540, introduced in late 1990, was an anticipated consequence of Acorn's Unix workstation development, offering the same general specification as Acorn's R260 Unix workstation (running RISC iX) but without built-in Ethernet support and running RISC OS 2 instead of Unix. It was Acorn's first machine to be fitted with the ARM3 processor as standard, supporting up to 16\u00a0MB of RAM, and included higher speed SCSI and provision for connecting genlock devices. The memory access frequency was raised to 12\u00a0MHz in the A540, compared to 8\u00a0MHz in earlier models, thus providing enhanced system performance over earlier models upgraded with ARM3 processors. The hardware design featured memory modules, each providing their own memory controller and 4\u00a0MB of RAM, and a processor module providing the ARM3 and including a slot for a floating point accelerator (FPA) chip, the latter offering the possibility (subsequently unrealised) of processor upgrades. The FPA, replacing Acorn's previous floating point podule, was scheduled to be available in 1991. Much delayed, the FPA finally became available in 1993.\nA5000 and A4 laptop.\nIn late 1991, the A5000 was launched to replace the A440/1 machine in the existing product range. With the existing A400/1 series regarded as \"a little tired\", being largely unchanged from the A400 models introduced four years previously, the A5000 was regarded (by one reviewer, at least) as \"the biggest leap forward for Acorn since the introduction of the Archimedes in 1987\", introducing a combination of the ARM3 processor and RISC OS 3 for the first time in a new Acorn product, being \"the machine the A540 should have been - smaller, neater, with higher capacity drives and all the same speed for about half the cost\". The A5000 initially ran RISC OS 3.0, although after bug fixes most shipped with RISC OS 3.10 or 3.11.\nThe A5000 featured the new 25\u00a0MHz ARM3 processor, 2 or 4\u00a0MB of RAM, either a 40\u00a0MB or an 80\u00a0MB hard drive and a more conventional pizza box-style two-part case. With IBM-compatible PCs offering increasingly better graphical capabilities, they had not merely matched the capabilities of Acorn's machines, but in offering resolutions of 1024 \u00d7 768 in 16 or 256 colours and with 24-bit palettes, they had surpassed them. The A5000 was the first Acorn to adopt a 15-pin VGA connector and (along with the earlier A540) supported the SVGA resolution of 800 \u00d7 600 in 16 colours, although the observation that \"Archimedes machines have simply not kept pace\" arguably remained. Earlier models could also benefit from the video performance of the A5000 via third party upgrades such as the Computer Concepts ColourCard Gold.\nIt was also the first Archimedes to feature a high density capable floppy disc drive as standard. This natively supported various formats including MS-DOS and Atari ST discs with formatted capacities of 720\u00a0KB and 1.44\u00a0MB. The native ADFS floppy format had a slightly larger capacity of 800\u00a0KB for double density or 1.6\u00a0MB for high density. Later A5000s featured a 33\u00a0MHz ARM3, 2 or 4\u00a0MB of RAM, and an 80 or 160\u00a0MB hard drive. Particularly useful in this revised A5000 was the use of a socket for the MEMC1a chip, meaning that memory expansions beyond 4\u00a0MB could more easily replace the single MEMC1a, plugging in a card providing the two MEMC1a devices required to support 8\u00a0MB. Earlier A5000s required desoldering of the fitted MEMC1a to provide such a socket.\nIn 1992, Acorn introduced the A4 laptop computer featuring a slower 24\u00a0MHz version of the ARM3 processor (compared to the 25\u00a0MHz ARM3 in the A5000), supporting a 6\u00a0MHz power-saving mode, and providing between 2.5 and 4 hours of usage on battery power. The machine featured a 9-inch passive matrix LCD screen capable of displaying a maximum resolution of 640 \u00d7 480 pixels in 15 levels of grey, also featuring a monitor port which offered the same display capabilities as an A5000. No colour version was planned. A notable omission from the machine was a built-in pointing device, requiring users to navigate with the cursor keys or attach a conventional Acorn three-button mouse, such as the Logitech mouse bundled with the machine.\nOther expansion ports available on the A4 were serial and parallel ports, a PS/2 connector for an external keyboard, a headphone connector, and support for an Econet expansion (as opposed to an Econet port itself). No other provision for expansion was made beyond the fitting of the Econet card and a hard drive. The A4 effectively fit an A5000 into a portable case, having a motherboard \"roughly half the size of a sheet of A4 paper\", adding extra hardware for power management and driving the LCD, the latter employing an Acorn-designed controller chip using \"time-domain dithering\" to produce the different grey levels. Just as the processor could be slowed down to save power, so the 12\u00a0MHz RAM could be slowed to 3\u00a0MHz, with various subsystems also being switched off as appropriate, and with power saving being activated after \"more than a second or so\" of user inactivity. The A4's case itself was used by Olivetti and Triumph-Adler models, particularly the Triumph-Adler Walkstation which did integrate a built-in pointing device, this being described as an \"all-but-unusable touchpad mouse-controller\" by one reviewer.\nLaunch pricing of the A4 set the entry-level model with 2\u00a0MB of RAM at \u00a31399 plus VAT, with the higher-tier model with 4\u00a0MB of RAM and 60\u00a0MB hard drive at \u00a31699 plus VAT. Education pricing was \u00a31099 and \u00a31399 respectively. Acorn foresaw educational establishments taking to the machine where existing models were needing to be moved around between classrooms or even taken on field trips, although review commentary noted that \"the A4 is too expensive for schools to afford in large numbers\" and that contemporary Apple and IBM PC-compatible models offered strong competition for business users.\nPeripherals for the A4 were eventually produced, with Acorn providing the previously announced Econet card, and with Atomwide providing Ethernet and SCSI adapters utilising the bidirectional parallel port present on the A4 (and also the A5000 and later machines). Atomwide also offered the \"Hi-Point\" trackball peripheral modified to work as an Acorn-compatible mouse which attached to the side of the unit.\nA3010, A3020, A4000.\nIn 1992, several new models were introduced to complement the A3000 and to replace the low-end A400 series models: the A3010, A3020 and A4000. Launched alongside the Acorn Pocket Book, a distinct product based on the Psion Series 3, the machines heralded \"a changed company, with new direction\" and the availability of Acorn products in mainstream high street stores including Dixons, John Lewis and Argos as well as mail order catalogues. Thus, a transition had begun from a range of machines of different vintages that still included the A3000 (at the low end) and the A540 (at the high end) to a range that purely featured more recently designed models including the A5000 as the high-end offering and the A4 portable.\nThese new models utilised the first ARM system-on-a-chip\u2014the ARM250 microprocessor\u2014a single-chip design including the functionality of an ARM2 (or ARM3 without cache), the IOC1, VIDC1a and MEMC1a chips all \"integrated into a single giant chip\" and fabricated using a 1 micron process. The ARM250, running at a higher 12\u00a0MHz clock frequency and used in conjunction with faster 80ns memory chips, compared to the 8\u00a0MHz of the ARM2 and the 125ns memory of the A3000, gave a potential 50% performance increase over such older systems, achieving a reported 7 MIPS.\nSome early units of the A3010 did not actually utilise the ARM250, instead embodying a \"mezzanine\" board carrying the four separate devices comprising the complete chipset, with this board plugged into the motherboard in place of the ARM250. An Acorn representative indicated this solution was pursued to meet retailing deadlines, whereas an ARM representative denied that any \"serious delays\" had occurred in the development of the ARM250, noting the mezzanine board had been useful during the design process; owners did not need to upgrade this board to a genuine ARM250 as it was \"functionally identical\" to the ARM250. One inadvertent advantage that the mezzanine board conferred was the ability to upgrade the ARM2 on the board to an ARM3, this being a popular upgrade for previous ARM2-based models that was incompatible with the ARM250. However, performing such an upgrade involves modifications to both the \"Adelaide\" mezzanine board and the ARM3 upgrade board employed in the refit. For machines fitted with an actual ARM250 processor, the closest alternative to an ARM3 upgrade in terms of performance enhancement was the Simtec \"Turbo RAM\" upgrade which provided 4\u00a0MB of faster RAM and gave a 40 percent improvement in overall system performance.\nThese machines were supplied with RISC OS 3.10 or 3.11. The A30x0 series had a one-piece design, similar to the A3000 but slightly more shallow, while the A4000 looked like a slightly slimmer A5000. The A3010 model was intended to be a home computer, featuring a TV modulator (for use with traditional PAL-standard televisions, SCART televisions already being supported by all of these models) and standard 9-pin joystick ports, while the A3020 targeted the primary and middle school educational markets, featuring an optional built-in 2.5-inch hard drive and a dedicated network interface socket, both capabilities being provided without requiring the machine's \"mini-podule\" expansion slot. Meanwhile, the A4000 was aimed at the secondary education and office markets, offering a separate adjustable keyboard to comply with ergonomics regulations deemed applicable to these users. Technically, the A4000 was almost functionally identical to the A3020, only differing in the supported hard disk size (3.5-inch in the A4000), this due to the machine's different casing. Despite the resemblance to the A5000, the A4000 along with the other models only provided a single \"mini-podule\" expansion slot, just as the A3000 did. All three ARM250-based machines could be upgraded to 4\u00a0MB with plug-in chips: though the A3010 was designed for 2\u00a0MB, third party upgrades overcame this. In 1996, IFEL announced a memory upgrade for the range utilising a generic 72-pin SIMM module to provide 4\u00a0MB of RAM.\nPricing started at just under \u00a3500 including VAT for the Family Solution bundle: an unexpanded A3010 with no monitor (to be used with a television), combined with the EasiWord word processor and one game (initially \"Quest for Gold\"). The existing Learning Curve bundle, updated to incorporate the A3010 upgraded to 2\u00a0MB of RAM in place of the A3000, included an Acorn colour monitor, the PC Emulator and a suite of Genesis hypermedia applications for a price of \u00a3799. The A4000 Home Office bundle combined the A4000 with Acorn colour monitor, Icon Technology's EasiWriter 2 \"professional word processor\" and Iota's Desktop Database application for a price of around \u00a31175. The retail pricing of the A3010 was notable as making it the cheapest of any Archimedes machine sold. With games consoles gaining popularity, Acorn apparently attempted to target the \"games machine plus\" market with the A3010 by appealing to \"the more knowledgeable, sophisticated and educationally concerned parents\", this against a backdrop of established competing products having been heavily discounted: the Amiga 500 having been reduced to \u00a3299, for instance. In 1993, Commodore would subsequently offer the entry-level Amiga 600 at a price of only \u00a3199, although with Commodore \"losing money on a big scale\" while Acorn remained profitable, such discounting was not regarded as a threat to the A3010.\nThe pricing and bundles involving these machines were updated in late 1993, introducing a new Action Pack in place of the Family Solution, featuring the game Zool plus Icon Technology's StartWrite word processor. This bundle effectively reduced the price of the A3010 to \u00a3399 including VAT, reportedly making it \"the cheapest Risc machine yet\". The Learning Curve was revised to feature Acorn's own Advance integrated suite, together with the PC Emulator and DR DOS 6, and the bundle was also made available in conjunction with the A4000. The Home Office bundle was updated with Iota's DataPower replacing Desktop Database, and with Colton Software's PipeDream 4 and Acorn's PC Emulator being added to augment EasiWriter. A variety of demonstration programs and an audio training tape were also provided with the bundles. At the time of these product revisions, the A3020 had become absent from related promotional material, even material aimed at the educational purchaser, although it remained in Acorn's price list presumably for the interest of institutional purchasers.\nAcorn's marketing relationships with high street retailers were somewhat problematic. While outlets such as the John Lewis Partnership proved to be successful marketing partners, electrical retailer Dixons seemingly made relatively little effort to sell Acorn machines despite promising \"greater opportunities\" in 1993 after earlier criticism. In late 1994, Acorn appointed a sole distributor for the A3010 Action Pack and Learning Curve bundles, with the pricing of the former reduced to only \u00a3299. Persisting with the strategy that some purchasers might choose a product positioned between games consoles and traditional PC-compatibles, the distributor, ZCL, aimed to take advantage of the absence of Commodore during the Christmas 1994 season. As the Christmas 1995 season approached, Beebug purchased Acorn's \"entire remaining inventory\", offering the machine for \u00a3135 including VAT together with various \"value-added packs\".\nProduction of the A3020 and A4000 ceased in 1995, with remaining stocks to be sold during 1996, due to their lack of conformance with newly introduced European Union electrical and electronics regulations. This left the A7000 as Acorn's entry-level desktop system, and appropriate pricing adjustments were expected, particularly as faster versions of the A7000 were anticipated (and eventually delivered in the form of the A7000+).\nLater A-series models.\nThe \"A7000\", despite its name being reminiscent of the Archimedes naming conventions, was actually more similar to the Risc PC, the line of RISC OS computers that succeeded the Archimedes in 1994. It lacked, however, the DEBI expansion slots and multi-slice case that characterized the Risc PC (though by removing the CD-ROM drive, a backplane with one slot could be fitted).\nList of models.\nAlso produced, but never sold commercially were:\nSoftware.\nArthur operating system.\nReminiscent of the BBC Micro upon its release, the earliest Archimedes models were delivered with provisional versions of the Arthur operating system, for which upgrades were apparently issued free of charge, thus avoiding the controversy around early ROM upgrades for the BBC Micro. In early 1988, Arthur 1.2 was delivered in an attempt to fix the deficiencies and problems in the earlier versions of the software. However, even after Arthur 1.2 had been released, a reported 100 documented bugs regarded as \"mostly quite obscure\" persisted, with Acorn indicating that a \"new, enhanced version\" of the operating system was under development.\nEarly applications.\nFollowing on from the release of Arthur 1.2, Acorn itself offered a \"basic word processor\", ArcWriter, intended for \"personal correspondence, notices and short articles\" and to demonstrate the window, menu and pointer features of the system, employing built-in printer fonts for rapid printed output. The software was issued free of charge for registered users, although Acorn indicated that it would not produce a \"definitive\" word processor for the platform, in contrast to the BBC Micro where the View word processor had been central to Acorn's office software range. However, Acorn did also announce a port of the 1st Word package, First Word Plus, for the platform. ArcWriter was poorly received, with window repainting issues demonstrated as a particular problem, and with users complaining of \"serious bugs\". Although taking advantage of the Arthur desktop environment and using anti-aliased fonts, complaints were made about \"blurred and smudged\" characters and slow display updates when changing fonts or styles on low-memory machines like the A305. An early competitor, Graphic Writer, was received more favourably but provided its own full-screen user interface. Neither were regarded as competitive with established products on other platforms.\nSeveral software companies immediately promised software for the Archimedes, most notably Computer Concepts, Clares and Minerva, with Advanced Memory Systems, BBC Soft and Logotron being other familiar software publishers. Autodesk, Grafox and GST were newcomers to the Acorn market. However, in early 1988, many software developers were reportedly holding off on releasing software for the Archimedes until the release of a stable operating system, with Acorn offering to lend Arthur 1.2 to developers. Claims had been made of confusion amongst potential purchasers of the machine caused by the lack of available software, with Acorn having pursued a strategy of launching the machine first so that independent software developers might have hardware to work with. In order to make the Archimedes more attractive to certain sectors, Acorn announced a \u00a3250,000 investment in educational software and indicated a commitment to business software development. Alongside First Word Plus, the Logistix spreadsheet-based business planning package was also commissioned by Acorn from Grafox Limited as a port to the platform. Autodesk released AutoSketch for the Archimedes in 1988, having launched the product in March the same year. Priced at \u00a379 plus VAT, it offered the precision drawing functionality familiar from AutoCad but with \"none of the frills\" that made the latter product professionally suitable for various markets at pricing that could exceed \u00a32500. On the Archimedes, AutoSketch was reported to run at about five times the speed of a \"standard PC-compatible machine\".\nAlthough Acorn had restricted itself to supporting the use of its View word processor under BBC emulation on the Archimedes, View Professional\u2014the final iteration of the View suite on Acorn's 8-bit computers\u2014had been advertised as a future product in June 1987 for November availability. View Professional, like the View series, had been developed for Acorn by Mark Colton, and a company\u2014Colton Software\u2014delivered the successor to this product as PipeDream for the Cambridge Computer Z88. In mid-1988, Colton Software announced PipeDream for the Archimedes, priced at \u00a3114, following on from the announcement of a version for MS-DOS, establishing a long history of product development for the platform, leading to PipeDream 4 in 1992, followed by PipeDream's eventual successor, Fireworkz, in 1994.\nMuch early software had consisted of titles converted from the BBC Micro, taking advantage of a degree of compatibility between the different series of machines, with Computer Concepts even going as far as to produce a ROM/RAM hardware expansion for use with the company's existing BBC Micro series products, and Acorn also offering such an expansion alongside a BBC-compatible interfacing expansion. Another element of Acorn's early marketing strategy for the Archimedes was to emphasise the PC Emulator product which was a software-based emulator for IBM PC-compatible systems based on the 8088 processor running \"legal MS-DOS programs\". Alongside this, plans were also made for the launch of a podule (peripheral module) hardware expansion providing its own 80186 processor, a disk controller and connector for a disk drive.\nThe PC Emulator in its initial form shipped with MS-DOS 3.21 and required a system with 4\u00a0MB of RAM to be able to provide the \"full\" 640\u00a0KB of RAM for DOS programs, with early versions of Arthur only providing 384\u00a0KB to DOS on 1\u00a0MB systems, but with Arthur 1.2 aiming to provide the more usable 512\u00a0KB to DOS on such systems. The emulator was described as having \"very few compatibility problems\" and was reported by diagnostic utilities as providing an 80188-based system, but the performance of the emulated system was regarded as slow. Acorn reportedly acknowledged this by indicating the imminent availability of \"an 80186 co-processor\". The podule expansion (or \"co-processor\") was subsequently postponed in early 1988 (and ultimately cancelled), with Acorn indicating that its price of \u00a3300 would have been uncompetitive against complete PC systems costing as little as \u00a3500, and that the hardware capabilities to be offered, such as the provision of CGA graphics, would be likely to become outdated as the industry moved to support EGA and VGA graphical standards.\nCommentators were disappointed with the incoherent user interface provided by the software platform, with \"Logistix looking like a PC, First Word slavishly copying GEM\" and \"101 other 'user interfaces'\" amongst the early offerings. The result was the lack of a \"personality\" for the machine which risked becoming a system that would \"never look as easy or as slick as the Mac\". Alongside the introduction of visual and behavioural consistency between applications, personal computer user environments had also evolved from running a single application at a time, moved beyond \"desk accessories\" (or pop-up programs), normalised the practice of switching between applications, and had begun to provide the ability to run different applications at the same time, with the Macintosh having already done so with its MultiFinder enhancement. Computer Concepts, having begun development of various new applications for the Archimedes, was sufficiently frustrated with Arthur and its lack of \"true multi-tasking\" that it announced a rival operating system, Impulse, intended to host those applications on the machine.\nRISC OS.\nRemedying various criticisms of the early operating environment, Acorn previewed RISC OS (or, more formally, RISC OS 2) in late 1988 and announced availability for April 1989. Internally at Acorn, the realisation had dawned that multitasking had become essential in any mainstream computing environment where \"the user is likely to use lots of small applications at once, rather than one large application alone\", with other graphical environments such as Hewlett Packard's NewWave and IBM's Presentation Manager being considered as the contemporary competition.\nReactions to the upgraded operating system were positive and even enthusiastic, describing RISC OS as giving software developers \"the stable platform they have been waiting for\" and \"a viable alternative to the PC or Mac\", also crediting Acorn for having improved on the original nine-month effort in developing Arthur in the following twelve months leading up to the unveiling of RISC OS. For a modest upgrade cost of \u00a329, users received four ROM chips, three discs including several applications, and documentation.\nNew facilities in RISC OS included co-operative multitasking, a task manager to monitor tasks and memory, versatile file management, \"solid\" window manipulation (\"the whole window moves - not just the outline\"), and adaptive rendering of bitmaps and colours, using dithering where necessary, depending on the nature of the selected screen mode. A common printing framework was introduced, with dot-matrix and PostScript printer drivers supplied, with such drivers available for use by all desktop applications. Amongst the selection of applications and tools included with RISC OS were the Draw graphics editor, featuring vector graphics editing and rudimentary manipulation of text (using the anti-aliased fonts familiar from Arthur) and bitmaps, the Edit text editor, the Paint bitmap editor, and the Maestro music editor.\nWith RISC OS available, Acorn launched new and updated applications to take advantage of the improved desktop environment. One of these, deferred until after the launch of RISC OS, was Acorn Desktop Publisher, a port of Timeworks Publisher, which introduced a significant improvement to the anti-aliased font capabilities through a new outline font manager, offering scalable fonts that were anti-aliased on screen but rendered at the appropriate resolution when printed, even on dot-matrix printers. First Word Plus was also updated to support the new RISC OS desktop environment, albeit retaining its own printer drivers, being positioned as complementing Acorn Desktop Publisher whose emphasis was on page layout as opposed to textual document creation.\nAs part of an effort to grow the company's share of the home market, Acorn introduced a bundle called The Learning Curve, initially featuring the A3000, optional monitor and a set of applications (First Word Plus, the PC Emulator, and Genesis). This bundle was enhanced later in 1990 to attract buyers to the A420/1, adding Acorn Desktop Publisher and some additional Genesis applications. Acorn's document processing applications also began to see broader competition around this time, with Impression from Computer Concepts and Ovation from Beebug also providing competitive solutions for desktop publishing. Also in 1990, PipeDream 3 became the first version of the PipeDream integrated suite, descended from Acorn's View Professional but developed and marketed by Colton Software, to be made available for the RISC OS desktop.\nThe launch of the A5000 in late 1991 brought a new version of RISC OS to the market: RISC OS 3. This delivered a range of enhancements to the operating system including multitasking filer operations (meaning that file copying, moving and deletion no longer took over the computer), support for reading and writing DOS format discs, the provision of various bundled applications (Alarm, Calc, Chars, Configure, Draw, Edit, Help and Paint), commonly used outline fonts, and software modules in ROM (instead of needing to be loaded from accompanying floppy discs into RAM), the removal or raising of limits on windows and tasks, the ability to \"iconise\" windows and pin them to the desktop background (or pinboard), desktop session saving and restoring, screen blanking support, and other printing and networking improvements. Providing the bundled applications and other resources in ROM saved an estimated 150\u00a0KB of workspace, thus being beneficial to users of 1\u00a0MB machines.\nThe bundled RISC OS 3 applications were enhanced from their RISC OS 2 versions in various general ways, such as the introduction of keyboard shortcuts, but also with new, specific features. The printing system was also updated to support multiple printers at once, but in this first version of RISC OS 3 background printing was still not supported. The \"most obviously improved\" application was Draw, acquiring new features including multiple levels of \"undo\" and \"redo\" operations, rotated text (benefiting from an updated outline font manager), graduated fills, shape interpolation (or in-betweening) support, and built-in support for converting text into paths. Edit gained improved formatting and searching support plus transparent BASIC program editing facilities. One somewhat visually obvious improvement delivered in RISC OS 3 was the use of \"3D window borders\" or, more accurately, dedicated bitmaps for window furniture, allowing different desktop styling effects. The appearance of the desktop would eventually shift towards Acorn's \"NewLook\" desktop theme, previewed in late 1993.\nIn late 1992, RISC OS 3 was itself updated, becoming RISC OS 3.1 (as opposed to the initial RISC OS 3.0 provided with the A5000) and being made available for all existing Archimedes machines, although A300 series and the original A400 series machines needed a hardware modification to be able to accept the larger 2\u00a0MB ROMs, employing a special daughterboard. Various bugs in RISC OS 3.0 were fixed and various other improvements made, making it a worthwhile upgrade for A5000 users. Notably, support for background printing was introduced. VAT-inclusive introductory pricing for the upgrade was \u00a319 for RISC OS 3.0 users and \u00a349 for RISC OS 2.0 users, with the upgrade package including ROMs, support discs and manuals. The non-introductory price of the upgrade was stated as being \u00a389.\nThe limitations of RISC OS became steadily more apparent, particularly with the appearance of the Risc PC and the demands made on applications taking advantage of its improved hardware capabilities (although merely highlighting issues that were always present), and when contrasted with the gradually evolving Windows and Macintosh System software, these competitors offering or promising new features and usability improvements over their predecessors. Two fundamental deficiencies perceived with RISC OS were a lack of virtual memory support, this permitting larger volumes of data to be handled by using hard disc storage as \"slow, auxiliary RAM\" (attempted by application-level solutions in certain cases), and the use of cooperative multitasking as opposed to preemptive multitasking to allow multiple applications to run at the same time, with the former relying on applications functioning correctly and considerately, and with the latter putting the system in control of allocating time to applications and thus preventing faulty or inconsiderate applications from hanging or dominating the system. Problems with the storage management and filing systems were also identified. In 1994, the FileCore functionality in RISC OS was still limited to accessing 512\u00a0MB of any hard drive, with this being barely larger than the largest supplied Risc PC hard drive at the time. Filing system limitations were also increasingly archaic: 77 files per directory and 10-character filenames, in contrast to more generous constraints imposed by the then-\"imminent\" Windows 95 and then-current Macintosh System 7 release.\nAlthough an update to the FileCore functionality was delivered in 1995, initially to members of Acorn's enthusiast community, providing support for larger storage partitions (raising the limit to 128\u00a0GB), other improvements, such as those providing support for the use of longer filenames, were still only provided by third parties. With adverse financial results and a restructuring of the company in late 1995, Acorn appeared to be considering a more responsive strategy towards customer demands, potentially offering rebadged PC and Mac products alongside Acorn's existing computers, while cultivating a relationship with IBM whose PowerPC-based server hardware had already been featured in Acorn's SchoolServer product running Windows NT. In the context of such a relationship, the possibility was raised of \"bolting a RISC OS 'personality' on top of a low level IBM-developed operating system\" to address RISC OS's deficiencies and to support virtual memory and long filenames. At this time, IBM was pursuing its Workplace OS strategy which emphasised a common operating system foundation supporting different system personalities.\nPC Emulation.\nIn mid-1991, the PC Emulator was eventually updated to work as a multitasking application on the RISC OS desktop, requiring 2\u00a0MB of RAM to do so, and supporting access to DOS files from the RISC OS desktop filer interface. The emulator itself permitted access to CD-ROM devices and ran MS-DOS 3.3 with a special mouse driver to permit the host machine's mouse to behave like a Microsoft bus mouse. CGA, EGA, MDA and partial VGA graphics support was implemented, and the emulated system could run Windows 3. The product cost \u00a399, with an upgrade costing \u00a329 for users of previous versions. Although technically compatible with 1\u00a0MB systems, and with 2\u00a0MB of RAM considered necessary for multitasking operation, offering facilities to capture the emulated display as a bitmap or as text, 4\u00a0MB was recommended to take advantage of such features, along with a high resolution multiscan monitor and VIDC enhancer to be able to display most of the emulated screen without needing to scroll its contents. An ARM3 processor was considered essential for \"a workable turn of speed\", this giving performance comparable with a 4.77\u00a0MHz 8086 PC-XT system.\nRegarded as a \"programming wonder\", the PC Emulator was nevertheless regarded as being \"too slow for intensive PC use\". Shortly after the introduction of the updated PC Emulator, a hardware PC compatibility solution was announced by Aleph One, offering a 20\u00a0MHz 80386SX processor and VGA display capability, effectively delivering Acorn's envisaged PC podule in updated form. A low-cost alternative to Acorn's PC Emulator called FasterPC became available in 1993, priced at around \u00a320 but with DOS not included (to be provided by the user at an estimated additional cost of \u00a350). The software provided PC emulation outside the desktop environment, with considerable performance benefits claimed relative to Acorn's product. Regarded as being \"considerably faster than the Acorn emulator when displaying graphics\", with a two-times speed improvement observed for various tested programs, the product was considered appropriate for gaming, albeit at lower than VGA resolution. It was also unable to run Windows 3.1: the Aleph One PC expansion cards being the only solutions able to do so at that time.\nBitmap image editing.\nHaving considerably improved graphical capabilities compared to those provided with Acorn's 8-bit machines, a number of art packages were released for the Archimedes to exploit this particular area of opportunity, albeit rather cautiously at first. One of the first available packages, Clares' Artisan, supported image editing at the high resolution of 640 x 256 but only in the 16-colour mode 12, despite the availability of the 256-colour mode 15 as standard. Favourably received as being \"streets ahead\" of art software on the BBC Micro, it was considered as barely the start of any real exploitation of the machine's potential. Typical of software of the era, only months after the launch of the machine, Artisan provided its own graphical interface and, continuing the tradition of BBC Micro software, took over the machine entirely even to the point of editing the machine configuration and restoring it upon exiting. Clares released a successor, Artisan 2, two years later to provide compatibility with RISC OS, replacing special-purpose printer support with use of the system's printer drivers, but not making the software a desktop application. The program's user interface deficiencies were regarded as less forgivable with the availability of a common desktop interface that would have addressed such problems and made the program \"easier to use and a more powerful program as a result\".\nClares also produced a 256-colour package called ProArtisan, also with its own special user interface (despite the impending arrival of RISC OS), costing considerably more than its predecessor (\u00a3170, compared to \u00a340 for Artisan), offering a wider range of tools than Artisan including sprays, washes and path editing (using B\u00e9zier curves) to define areas of the canvas. Although regarded as powerful, the pricing was considered rather high from the perspective of those more familiar with the 8-bit software market, and the user interface was regarded as \"only just bearable\". Competitors to ProArtisan during 1989 included Art Nouveau from Computer Assisted Learning and Atelier from Minerva. Both of these programs, like ProArtisan, ran in full-screen mode outside the desktop, used the 256-colour mode 15, and offered their own interfaces. Atelier, however, was able to multi-task, providing the ability to switch back to the desktop and find applications still running and accessible. Unlike other contemporary art programs, it also took advantage of the system's own anti-aliased fonts. One unusual feature was the ability to wrap areas of the canvas around solid objects. Both programs also offered similar path editing facilities to ProArtisan, with it being noted that Art Nouveau's limitations in this regard might be remedied by using the support already present in RISC OS and provided by the Draw application functionality, as ProArtisan 2 eventually demonstrated.\nIn 1989, RISC OS was provided with the Paint application on one of the accompanying application discs. It featured a multi-document, desktop-based interface with a range of elementary painting and drawing tools, also allowing images to be created in arbitrary sizes for any of the display modes, even permitting editing of images in display modes with different numbers of colours, albeit with limitations in the representation of image colours when the desktop mode had fewer colours available. Along with its companion applications, Paint supported the system's anti-aliased fonts and printer driver framework, and by embracing the system's user interface conventions, images could be exported directly to applications such as Draw by dragging an image's file icon from the save dialogue directly to the target application.\nDespite a trend of gradual adoption of desktop functionality, in 1990, Arcol from ExpLAN offered a single-tasking, full-screen, 256-colour editing experience using the lower resolution 320 x 256 mode 13, supporting only bitmap fonts. Aimed at educational users, its strengths apparently included real-time transformation of canvas areas, rapid zooming, and the absence of limitations on tools when zooming: arguably demonstrating more a limitation of contemporary packages with their own peculiar interfaces. ExpLAN subsequently released Arcol Desktop, although the \"desktop\" label only indicated that the program would multi-task with desktop applications and offer some desktop functionality, particularly for the loading and saving of images: the program still employed a special full-screen user interface, albeit allowing other 256-colour modes to be used, with the 320 x 256 mode of the original being the default. With expectations having evolved with regard to user interfaces and desktop compatibility, this updated product was judged less favourably, with the partitioning of functionality between the desktop and painting interface being \"awkward\" and the behavioural differences \"confusing\", leaving the product looking \"rather dated\" when compared to its modern contemporaries.\nIn early 1991, in the context of remarks that, at that point in time, the Paint application bundled with RISC OS was \"the only true Risc OS art program\" operating in the desktop and not restricting users to specific display modes, Longman Logotron released Revelation, an application running in the desktop environment, providing interoperability with other applications through support for the platform's standard Sprite and Drawfile formats, with vector graphics import being provided by a companion tool, and utilising the system's printing framework. Apart from observations of limited functionality in some areas, one significant limitation reminiscent of earlier products was the inability to change display mode without affecting the picture being edited. This limitation was not convincingly removed in the second version, sold as Revelation 2 around a year later, with colours being redefined when selecting a 16-colour display mode while editing a 256-colour image, preserving the inability to edit 256-colour images in 16-colour modes. A further version update was delivered as the Revelation ImagePro product, being considered \"the best art package that I have used on the Archimedes\" by Acorn User's graphics columnist in late 1992.\nIn response to the evolving competitive situation and market expectations, Clares released ProArtisan 2, a successor to its earlier product, in late 1993 as \"a completely new program\" with some familiar features from the company's earlier products but offering display mode independence, 24-bit colour support (including support for ColourCard and G8/G16 graphics cards), multi-document editing, and desktop compliance. The path editing tools familiar from its predecessor were supported using functionality from Acorn's Draw application, and the image enhancement capabilities had also \"undergone a major revamp\". At a reduced price of \u00a3135, and with use of the RISC OS desktop contributing to overall ease of use, the package was considered by one reviewer as \"the best art package around at the moment for the Archimedes\".\nLate in the Archimedes era, this being prior to the release of the Risc PC, a consensus amongst some reviewers formed in recommending Revelation ImagePro and ProArtisan 2 as the most capable bitmap-based art packages on the platform, with Arcol Desktop and First Paint also being reviewer favourites. With the release of the Risc PC and A7000, offering improved hardware capabilities and built-in support for 24-bit colour, the art package market changed significantly. New packages supplanted older ones as recommendations, some from new entrants within the broader Acorn market (Spacetech's Photodesk, Pineapple Software's Studio24), others coming from established vendors (Clares' ProArt24 and Longman Logotron's The Big Picture), and still others from beyond the Acorn market (Digital Arts' Picture). However, the platform and hardware requirements of such packages were generally beyond Archimedes era machines, demanding 8\u00a0MB of RAM or 24-bit colour display modes (using 2\u00a0MB of dedicated video RAM) in some cases. A notable exception was Studio24 which, having been significantly updated in its second version, was reportedly \"completely compatible\" with the earlier machines.\nVector image editing.\nRISC OS was supplied with the Draw application, offering a range of tools for creating diagrams and pictures using vector graphics primitives, also permitting the incorporation of bitmap images and text into documents, and managing the different elements of documents as a hierarchy of objects. A significant capability provided by the application (and exploited by art packages) was that of B\u00e9zier curve editing, allowing shapes with smooth curves to be created, rendered and printed.\nThe file format used by Draw was documented and extensible, and a range of tools emerged to manipulate Draw files for such purposes as distorting or transforming images or objects within images. Amongst them was the Draw+ (or DrawPlus) application which defined other object types and also added other editing features, such as support for multiple levels or layers in documents. DrawPlus became available in 1991 and was released \"at nominal cost\" via public domain and shareware channels. The author of DrawPlus, Jonathan Marten, subsequently developed an application called Vector, released by an educational software publisher, 4Mation, in early 1992. Described as \"effectively an enhanced Draw\", the program improved on Draw's text handling by allowing editing of imported text, continued DrawPlus's support for layers and object libraries, provided efficient handling of replicated or repeated objects, and introduced masks that acted as \"windows\" onto other objects. Priced at \u00a3100, even for site-wide usage, the software was considered \"ideal... for technical drawing, to graphic design and even limited desktop publishing\". A version of Draw was also developed for Microsoft Windows by Oak Solutions.\nA significant introduction to the Archimedes' software portfolio came with the release of ArtWorks by Computer Concepts in late 1992. Described in one preview as \"perhaps the easiest to use, but most advanced graphic illustration package, on any personal computer today\", ArtWorks provided an object-based editing paradigm reminiscent of Draw, refining the user interface, and augmenting the basic functionality with additional tools. A notable improvement over Draw was the introduction of graduated fills, permitting smooth gradients of colour within shapes, employing dithering to simulate a larger colour palette. The image rendering engine was also a distinguishing feature, offering different levels of rendering detail, with the highest level introducing anti-aliasing for individual lines. Aimed at professional use, and complementing its sibling product, the Impression desktop publishing application, 24-bit colour depths and different colour models were supported. A key selling point of the package was its rendering speed, with it being reported that redraw speeds were up to five times faster in ArtWorks on an ARM3-based machine than those experienced with CorelDRAW running on a 486-based IBM PC-compatible system. ArtWorks would have broader significance as predecessor to the Xara Studio application and subsequent Windows-based products.\nDocument processing and productivity.\nAlthough document processing and productivity or office software applications were addressed by a few packages released in the Arthur era of the Archimedes, bringing titles such as First Word Plus, Logistix, and PipeDream, it was not until the availability of RISC OS that the Archimedes would see the more compelling software developed for the platform being delivered, with Acorn even delaying its own Desktop Publisher to take advantage of this substantial upgrade to the operating system.\nAlongside Acorn Desktop Publisher, Computer Concepts' \"document processor\" Impression and Beebug's Ovation provided a small selection of solutions in the realm of desktop publishing. Acorn pursued the publishing industry with software and hardware system bundles, with Impression typically featuring prominently, even in the era of the Archimedes' successor, the Risc PC. Ovation was eventually succeeded by Ovation Pro in 1996, offering stronger competition to Impression Publisher\u2014itself the professional package in the range that had developed from Impression\u2014and to industry-favoured applications such as QuarkXPress.\nAmongst a variety of word processor applications, one enduring product family for the platform was developed by Icon Technology who had already released a word processor, MacAuthor, for the Apple Macintosh. This existing product was ported to RISC OS and released as EasiWriter in 1991, fully supporting the outline fonts and printing architecture of the host system. Icon followed up to EasiWriter with an enhanced version (\"EasiWriter's big brother\") in 1992, TechWriter, featuring mathematical formula editing. Both products were upgraded to provide mail-merge capabilities\u2014a noted deficiency of the first release of EasiWriter\u2014and both provided convenient table editing, with TechWriter also offering automatic footnote handling, being promoted as \"a complete package for producing academic and technical documents\". Upgraded \"Professional\" editions of EasiWriter and TechWriter were released in 1995, with the latter adding the notable feature of being able to save documents in TeX format.\nGiven the platform's presence in education, various educational word processing and publishing applications were available. Longman Logotron supplied a \"cost-effective introduction to DTP\" in the form of FirstPage, retailing at \u00a349 plus VAT with \"unlimited\" educational site licences costing up to \u00a3190. Targeting machines with only 1\u00a0MB of RAM, various traditional word processing features such as a spelling checker and integrated help were omitted, but as a frame-based document processor it was considered \"excellent value for money\" when compared to the pricing and capabilities of some of its competitors, even appealing to the home market. Similarly, Softease's \"object-based\" document processor, Textease, also had potential appeal beyond the educational market, freeing the user from having to design page layouts using frames, instead permitting them to click and type at the desired position or to drag and drop graphical objects directly into the page, providing a user interface paradigm reminiscent of the Draw application provided with RISC OS. Document layout capabilities were nevertheless available, supporting multiple column layouts, as were the traditional features such as spellchecking and integrated help absent from FirstPage. Pricing was even more competitive at around \u00a330, or \u00a340 with spellchecking support.\nAside from the hybrid word processor and spreadsheet application, PipeDream, being released in versions 3 and 4 for the RISC OS desktop environment, Colton Software released a standalone word processor, Wordz, in 1993, with plans for companion applications and a degree of integration between them. The first of these companion applications was Resultz, and the two applications were combined to make Fireworkz, itself incorporating the editing capabilities of both applications within a single interface, offering the ability to combine textual and spreadsheet data on the same page within documents. Colton subsequently expanded the family in 1995 with the Recordz database product, combining it with the existing Fireworkz functionality to make the Fireworkz Pro product, this bringing it into direct competition with Acorn's Advance and Minerva's Desktop Office suites, but ostensibly offering a much deeper level of integration than those competitors. PipeDream itself was later updated to version 4.5, conforming more closely to the RISC OS look and feel, being initially offered as an upgrade for users of version 4.0.\nAcorn's own interest in developing applications led it to initiate work on the Schema spreadsheet application, only to disengage from application development and to transfer the product to Clares who, with assistance from the originally commissioned developers, brought the product to market. Despite its origins as one component in an application suite that was never delivered as envisaged, a cut-down version of Schema 2 was later incorporated into Acorn's Advance application suite alongside variants of Computer Concepts' Impression Junior and Iota Software's DataPower. Schema 2 itself was enhanced with a \"powerful macro language\" and released in 1994.\nIn the spreadsheet category, Longman Logotron's Eureka, released in 1992, provided robust competition to Schema and PipeDream, seeking to emulate Microsoft Excel in terms of functionality and user interface conventions. The interoperability benefits of the updated product, Eureka 2, were later given as a reason for Acorn to adopt the software internally, acquiring a 300-user site licence and thus allowing its employees to convert \"substantial spreadsheet data which needed converting from Lotus 1-2-3\". Updated again as Eureka 3, with new features remedying \"what was badly missing in the earlier version\", but with the manual regarded as inadequate and with online help still absent from the application, the application was nevertheless regarded as the most powerful of the platform's principal spreadsheet offerings, attempting to be \"the \"Excel\" of the Acorn world\".\nA number of database applications were made available for the Archimedes, with Minerva Software following up from its early applications on the system, DeltaBase and System Delta Plus, with the RISC OS desktop-compliant Multistore in early 1990: a relational database with a graphical \"record card\" interface and report generation functionality. A broadly similar approach, albeit without any claimed \"relational\" capabilities, was offered by Digital Services' Squirrel database manager software, emphasising customisation of the presentation of data and reporting, but also introducing a flowchart-based method of querying, this feature causing one reviewer to regard the product as \"the most innovative database manager on the Archimedes\" with its usability being comparable to FileMaker on the Apple Macintosh.\nAimed at the education market, with a focus more on \"computerised data handling\" than data management, Longman Logotron's PinPoint framed the structuring and retention of data around a questionnaire format, with a form editor offering \"DTP-style facilities\", and with data entry performed interactively via the on-screen questionnaire. Some analysis and graphing capabilities were also provided. A version of PinPoint would eventually be made available for Windows, ostensibly aimed at market research as opposed to education, as its producer attempted to broaden its audience and availability for different platforms.288 Also emphasising a desktop publishing style of presentation was Iota Software's DataPower, employing these facilities to customise record entry to \"make data collection as much like form-filling as possible\" and in the reporting functionality of the software.\nIn 1993, Longman Logotron introduced S-Base, a programmable database offering the possibility of customised database application development. Described as \"a more disciplined, less graphical approach to database design\", the software enforced a degree of discipline around data type and table definition, but it also retained various graphical techniques to design forms for interaction with the database. Building on such foundations, programs could be written in a language called S to handle user interaction, graphical user interface events, and to interact with data in the database. Being compared to the contemporary DOS-based Paradox software, it was regarded as having more of an emphasis on \"database applications\" than actual databases, also being considered as similar to the contemporary RISC OS application, Archway, as a kind of \"application generator\" tool.\nDataPower, S-Base and Squirrel were all subsequently upgraded, S-Base 2 being enhanced with features to simplify the setting up of applications and consequently being regarded as \"without doubt the most powerful database management system available for the Archimedes\" due to its programmable nature, Squirrel 2 gaining relational capabilities and being recommended for its \"amazing flexibility\" and for its searching and sorting functionality, with DataPower being recommended more for \"the majority of users\" for its usability and \"attractive graphs and reports\".\nDespite spreadsheet and database applications offering graphing capabilities, dedicated applications were also available to produce a wider range of graphs and charts. Amongst these were Chartwell from Risc Developments and the Graphbox and Graphbox Professional packages from Minerva Software. Arriving somewhat later than these packages, being released by Clares in January 1994, Plot also sought to cater for mathematical and educational users by offering support for function plotting, this having been largely ignored by the existing packages which tended \"to be based on producing bar and pie charts from tables of figures\".\nFull-motion video.\nWith the introduction of CD-ROM and the broader adoption of multimedia, Acorn announced a full-motion video system called Acorn Replay in early 1992, supporting simultaneous audio and video at up to 25 frames per second in the RISC OS desktop or in \"a low resolution full screen mode\". Unlike certain other full-motion video technologies, Replay offered the ability to read compressed video data from mass storage in real time and to maintain a constant frame rate, all on standard computing hardware without the need for dedicated video decoding hardware. The compression techniques employed by Replay reportedly offered \"compression factors of between 25 and 40\" on the source video data, with the software decompression requiring a computer with 2\u00a0MB of RAM or more.\nGiven a slower access medium such as CD-ROM or floppy disk, video could be played back at up to 12.5 frames per second, with up to 25 frames per second from a hard disk. One 800\u00a0KB floppy disk could reportedly hold 12 seconds of video. In the introductory phase of the technology, support for Replay files was quickly introduced into hypermedia applications such as Genesis and Magpie, with software developers being the primary audience for the creation of content, largely due to the expense of the equipment required to capture and store large volumes of video data. Software developers would engage the services of a suitably equipped company to convert source material to digital form, with the Replay software then used to process the video frame by frame, employing image compression techniques and \"a form of Delta compression\", ultimately producing a movie file.\nAcorn's introduction of Replay prompted comparisons with Apple's QuickTime system which was already broadly available to users of Macintosh systems. Replay's advantages included the efficiency of the solution on existing hardware, with even an entry-level A3000 upgraded to 2\u00a0MB of RAM being able to handle 2\u00a0MB of data per second to achieve the advertised 12.5 frames per second playback. In contrast, a Macintosh system with 2\u00a0MB of RAM was reportedly unable to sustain smooth video playback, although audio playback was unaffected by the dropped video frames, whereas a 4\u00a0MB system could achieve 15 frames per second from a CD-ROM drive, although such a system was more expensive than Acorn's ARM3-based systems that could more readily achieve higher frame rates. QuickTime was also reported as only able to play video smoothly at 1/16th of the size of the screen, also favouring 32,000 colour display modes that were available on Macintosh systems with 68020 or faster processors. One disadvantage of Replay on the Acorn systems was the limitation of playback to 256 colours imposed by the built-in video system.\nEducational software and resources providers saw the potential of Replay to deliver interactive video at a more affordable price than existing Laservision content, although it was noted that, at that time, Laservision still provided \"the best quality, full-screen, moving image to date\". Opportunities were perceived for making compilations of video clips available on CD-ROM for multimedia authoring purposes, although educational developers felt that the true value of the technology would be realised by making video like other forms of information, permitting its use in different contexts and works and thus offering children \"control over the media\". Educators also looked forward to more accessible authoring possibilities, with children being able to record, edit and incorporate their own video into their projects. However, the expense associated with handling video data, with the storage of one minute of video estimated at 60\u00a0MB, combined with the expense of commercial video digitisation, estimated at \u00a3100 per minute of video, meant that such possibilities would remain inaccessible for most users at that time. Indications that this situation would change were present in the QuickTime market, with it already supporting the creation of short movies in conjunction with video digitiser cards and editing tools such as Adobe Premiere.\nSupport for video authoring on the desktop emerged in 1993 with the Replay DIY product from Irlam Instruments: a single-width podule suitable for A540 and A5000 computers with 2\u00a0MB of RAM or more, these being the only models available at the time with the necessary performance. The podule accepted analogue video input from video cameras, recorders and laserdisc players, allowing the video to be previewed in a window on the desktop. While recording, no preview would be shown, and the hardware would digitise the audio and video input, transfer the data to the computer's memory, and this would then be sent straight to a hard disk. At its introduction, the video quality was limited to \"normal Arm2 Replay, that is 256-colour, 160x128 pixels at 12.5 frames per second\", although an upgrade to capture 25 frames per second was anticipated. Uncompressed video occupied around 21\u00a0MB per minute, but processing of such video using the provided Acorn Replay compression software would bring the size of the resulting video down to around 4 or 5\u00a0MB per minute. Compression was, however, relatively slow, since the compression scheme was asymmetric, meaning that decompression was fast enough to facilitate playback in real time, but compression could take \"a few minutes for every few seconds of video\". Nevertheless, the possibilities of video capture were predicted to \"generate and maintain immense interest in the classroom, or even at home\", and the digitiser's low cost (at \u00a3250 plus VAT) together with low-cost editing software such as Uniqueway's Empire (at \u00a350 plus VAT) was regarded as surprising, possibly in light of the high cost of services previously needed to achieve similar results.\nFurther developments in the video authoring domain were brought to the platform by Eidos, who had developed an \"offline non-linear editing system\" around the Archimedes in 1989, involving the digitisation of source video and its storage on hard disks or magneto-optical media for use with editing software. Such software would be used to produce an \"edit schedule list\" based on editing operations performed on the digitised, \"offline\" video, and these editing details would subsequently be applied in an \"online\" editing session involving the source video, this typically residing on \"linear\" media such as tape. To support the more convenient offline editing environment, a highly efficient symmetric compression scheme known as ESCaPE (Eidos Software Compression and Playback Engine) had been devised, offering movie sizes of around 1.5\u00a0MB per minute. To remedy the time-consuming process of using Acorn's Replay compression software with the Replay DIY product, this being a consequence of the \"Moving Lines\" compression scheme emphasised by Replay at that time, Eidos introduced its own compression software for Replay DIY based on ESCaPE and given the same name. Together with the Eidoscope software, based on Eidos' professional Optima software, it was claimed that \"no other computer platform has anything to match in terms of convenience and sheer usability\" and that these developments would \"encourage a lot more Archimedes users to have a go at making movies\". In 1995, Computer Concepts offered a bundle featuring Eidoscope and the company's Eagle M2 \"multimedia card\" which featured audio and video capture, improved audio playback, and MIDI ports. Aimed at non-professional applications, Eidoscope was limited to editing movies up to a resolution of 160 x 128 and did not support time codes.\nDevelopment tools.\nWith the introduction of the Archimedes, Acorn continued the practice established for its earlier machines of offering languages in addition to BASIC, albeit priced somewhat higher than the earlier implementations, these including Pascal, C, Prolog, Fortran and Lisp. Other vendors produced implementations of Forth, such as Silicon Vision's RiscForth, and Logo, such as Logotron Logo. Other Acornsoft languages such as BCPL and COMAL were not ported to the new platform and had to be run under emulation. A Smalltalk-80 implementation was also made available by Smalltalk Express costing \u00a3620, offering the familiar window-based environment, but requiring a 4\u00a0MB machine and a hard drive.\nBASIC.\nAcorn had always emphasised its implementation of BBC BASIC in its earlier machines, and the Archimedes was delivered with an enhanced version, BASIC V, that provided additional control-flow structures such as while loops, case statements, and multi-line if statements. Graphics primitives and operations were also accessible via special-case keywords such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4, and the specification of colours was extended to access the broader colour palette supported by the hardware. Various commands were also added for sprite plotting and manipulation and to enable, confine, disable and read the position and state of the mouse pointer. Assembly language support was included, as it had been in the BASIC provided by Acorn's 8-bit models, with the language updated to describe instructions for the ARM processor instead of the 6502 (or other processor families) familiar from the earlier machines. Access to operating system functionality was provided from BASIC, with some of the demonstration programs provided with the Arthur operating system employing the font and window manager operating system modules, including the rudimentary desktop environment.\nThe arrival of RISC OS brought the possibility of developing desktop, or WIMP, applications in BASIC and other languages. Being available as standard, BASIC was a natural choice for many developers of desktop applications, although \"the complexity of the Wimp\" and the need to defer to operating system functionality described in the \"RISC OS Programmer's Reference Manual\", this consisting of \"a staggering 52 Wimp calls\", required some mitigation by tutorials seeking to guide programmers through the mechanisms and techniques involved. To ease the development of such applications, various products offering toolkits or libraries were announced, one of the earliest being Archway, this providing tools to define different aspects of an application, including window layout design and menu editing, along with BASIC library routines. More ambitious attempts were later made to extend BASIC to access desktop functionality. For instance, HelixBasic added extra keywords to BASIC V whilst also making it possible for traditional BASIC programs, including graphical programs, to run in the window-based environment transparently and concurrently.\nAlthough the performance of the supplied BASIC interpreter had been regarded as competitive, various BASIC compilers were produced for the system, such as Dabs Press' Archimedes Basic Compiler (ABC) and Silicon Vision's RiscBASIC. Both products focused on improving the performance of the input programs, but Silicon Vision subsequently introduced a separate product, WimpGEN, as an accessory for desktop application developers. This product provided window and menu editors that would generate BASIC source code implementing the functionality required to support operation in the desktop environment. Specific application functionality would then be added, and the resulting program could also be compiled using RiscBASIC before being run.\nBBC BASIC on the Archimedes was considered as a vehicle for cross-platform game development by David Braben and other developers before the Archimedes was released, Braben being the author of the three-dimensional Lander game supplied with the machine. Since the BBC Micro had been used as a development host for the Commodore 64 version of Elite and reportedly by Commodore to assist Amiga development \"in the early days\", a similar role was anticipated for the Archimedes in game development, this role also having the potential to expose games developers for established platforms (such as the Amiga, Atari ST, and the Sega and Nintendo consoles) to the Acorn machine. The ability to cross-assemble code in the BASIC assembler for processors other than the ARM was devised, and support from key individuals at Acorn was secured, but the company's management were reluctant to incorporate support for other systems in its product, thus curtailing the effort.\nC.\nDespite the use of BASIC and ARM assembly language by some software houses, notably at Computer Concepts whose developers regarded the ARM processor as having been \"designed to be programmed in Assembler\" and where Impression and ArtWorks were implemented in ARM assembly language using the BASIC assembler, the use of higher-level languages such as C became increasingly desirable for productivity and portability reasons. That Acorn had been in a position to offer its own C compiler was reportedly the consequence of \"a stroke of luck\": this product having been originally developed by Arthur Norman and Alan Mycroft for a mainframe at Cambridge University and subsequently offered to Acorn.\nAcorn's original C compiler and assembler products were superseded by its Desktop C and Desktop Assembler products in mid-1991. These products comprised Acorn's Desktop Development Environment, aiming to reduce the time and effort involved in developing applications and modules along with supporting such activities in the desktop environment itself. Both products provided an enhanced version of Edit known as SrcEdit for source code editing that supported \"throwback\": navigation to locations in source code produced by other tools such as the C compiler. The Desktop Debugging Tool (DDT) was described as \"a rather impressive line by line debugger\" supporting breakpoints and watchpoints and allowing conventional application code (as opposed to modules) to be stepped through by \"actually stopping the desktop\", with control over this activity exercised through desktop-like windows operating separately from the actual desktop. Alongside compiler, assembler and linker tools, a build utility known as Make and supporting Makefiles was provided along with an improved version of the FormEd tool used for application window design. Desktop C cost \u00a3229 plus VAT, and Desktop Assembler cost \u00a3149 plus VAT.\nC++.\nAcorn's C++ strategy was the subject of a degree of criticism. Initially, the company announced the availability of AT&amp;T's CFront to its registered developer community, this translating C++ code for further compilation by Acorn's Desktop C product. Acorn followed up by offering a new product, replacing Desktop C, that integrated CFront 3.0 to support C and C++ compilation, albeit without support for exceptions. Feedback from developers had been negative, however, citing poor-quality code and slow compilation times, with developers apparently wanting \"a true native C++ compiler with good RISC OS environment support\". Despite the adoption of C++ class libraries on other platforms, Acorn chose to provide user interface component functionality using a collection of modules, known as the Toolbox, accessible at the system call level instead.\nApart from a port of the GNU C++ compiler, itself requiring at least 4\u00a0MB of RAM to run, the only significant competition to Acorn's C and C++ products were the Easy C and Easy C++ products from Beebug, with the former being announced in late 1993 as a Risc Developments product costing \u00a349 plus VAT. Priced significantly less than Acorn's compiler, Easy C provided a narrower range of tools, lacking the debugger of Acorn's product in particular, and had also not been validated as conforming to the ANSI language standard, unlike Acorn's compiler. Nevertheless, it did provide the essential compiler, assembler, linker and build tools, aiming to be \"an easy to use C development system aimed at the lower end of the market\". In late 1994, Beebug followed up by announcing Easy C++ in advance of the availability of Acorn's own C++ product. Easy C++ compiled C++ source code directly to ARM object code and supported both templates and exceptions. It was priced at \u00a399 plus VAT or \u00a349 plus VAT as an upgrade from Easy C. The product was seemingly positively received, with the developers having \"achieved the target they set themselves\" by delivering a native C++ compiler, although the lack of updated documentation and the need for further development to improve the product were also identified.\nUltimately, the stated lack of a suitable C++ compiler and accompanying class libraries for the platform led prominent development houses to focus on products for other platforms and to abandon plans to release new software for RISC OS. In 1994, Mark Colton of Colton Software criticised Acorn for not complementing its C compiler with \"C toolbox\" libraries to assist with application development, and regarded Acorn as being \"at a standstill\" relative to broader development tool trends such as the introduction of Visual Basic and the increasing adoption of C++ together with class libraries for application development. Charles Moir of Computer Concepts justified the development of Xara Studio, a graphics application described as effectively \"ArtWorks for the PC\", indicating that only the larger market for Windows software could make the necessary investment in such a sophisticated application worthwhile. Since Windows development could leverage C++ and platform-specific class libraries, Computer Concepts had expected Acorn to deliver comparable tools and resources to make the development of such software possible on the Acorn platform \"to no avail\". Ben Finn of Sibelius Software indicated that Sibelius 7 had been a \"completely new piece of software\" written in C++, in contrast to earlier versions written in assembly language, primarily due to the difficulties of implementing requested features in such a low-level language. The portability of C++ software also permitted Sibelius to be made available for the PC and Mac platforms. However, with Acorn unable to provide a suitably updated C++ development suite, the company was unable to deliver its new product on RISC OS.\nHardware.\nGraphical capabilities.\nThe Archimedes machines (and their equivalents running RISC iX) used the VIDC1a video chip to provide a wide variety of screen resolutions, expanding on those available on the BBC Micro, including the following:\nSince the video controller would not support display modes smaller than 20\u00a0KB, the lowest resolution modes were supported in the operating system by employing modes with twice the horizontal resolution and duplicating horizontally adjacent pixels.\nThe introduction of RISC OS brought support for a number of new display modes including the following:\nThe A540 and A5000 supported additional display modes:\nHigh-resolution monochrome display modes were offered by the A440, A400/1 series and A540:\nApparent confusion about monochrome monitor support upon the launch of the Archimedes models led Acorn to clarify that the A400 series had \"extra circuitry\" offering two additional display modes \"of up to 1280 by 976 in monochrome, and 160 columns by 122 lines of text, but only using a special monitor\", this being connected using two BNC sockets (one for signal and one for sync).\nThe A540 (and corresponding R-series workstations) offered three BNC sockets, adding one for a separate horizontal sync connection for certain monitors. Acorn suggested the 19-inch Taxan Viking and Philips M19P114 monitors, with the former being offered in a bundle with the R140 workstation. The Taxan Viking R140 product bundled the existing Viking product with appropriate cabling and produced a \"rock steady\" 66\u00a0Hz mode 23 display, albeit with mouse pointer corruption at the extreme right of the screen due to \"a bug in the VIDC chip\".\nThe A5000 unlike its predecessor, the A540, did not support high resolution monochrome modes.\nGraphics expansions.\nAn expansion to speed up the VIDC chip in the Archimedes from 24\u00a0MHz to 36\u00a0MHz was announced by Atomwide in 1990, offering higher resolution display modes for machines connected to multisync monitors. Although resolutions up to 1280 x 480 and 1024 x 640 were supported, flicker due to a decreased refresh rate was reported as a problem, with 1152 x 486 appearing to be more comfortable in this regard. The SVGA resolution of 800 x 600 was also supported in up to 16 colours. One side-effect of increasing the frequency of the VIDC was to also increase the frequency of generated sounds, since the VIDC was also responsible for sound generation. VIDC enhancers were supplied by some monitor vendors together with the appropriate cable for Archimedes machines, although fitting the device still required approved service work to be performed. Monitors such as the Taxan 795 Multivision were only usable in multisync modes without the VIDC enhancer whose accompanying software sought to \"redefine all modes\" to be compatible with the display as well as providing new modes.\nOne drawback of VIDC enhancer solutions was the increased memory bandwidth used by the VIDC at its newly elevated frequency, slowing down machines when using higher resolution modes, particularly machines with ARM2 processors and slower memory busses. Consequently, other solutions were adopted to work around the limitations of the built-in display hardware, notably \"graphics enhancers\" such as the PCATS graphics enhancer from The Serial Port, and \"colour cards\" such as Computer Concepts' ColourCard and State Machine's G8 which provided a separate framebuffer, holding a copy of the normal screen memory, for use in generating a video signal independently of the system's main memory. This permitted higher refresh rates (up to 70\u00a0Hz) even for higher resolution modes, although the maximum size of the screen memory imposed by the VIDC (480 KB) also imposed a limit on available resolutions and colour depths, with 800 x 600 being the highest resolution 256 colour mode that could be supported. However, such cards were also able to support more flexible palettes in 256 colour modes than the VIDC, and for lower resolutions, greater colour depths offering over 32,000 colours could be supported. The ColourCard was reported to allow an ARM2 system to use a 1600 x 600 display mode with 16 colours (occupying 480\u00a0KB) with an operating speed of \"160% of the speed of the considerably lower resolution Acorn mode 28\", this being 640 x 480 with 256 colours (occupying 300\u00a0KB).\nState Machine, founded by former hardware designers from Computer Concepts and Watford Electronics, announced a range of colour card peripherals, starting with the G8 and G8+ in late 1992, followed by the G8 Professional, these cards being demonstrated at the BBC Acorn User show in 1992, as was the Computer Concepts ColourCard. One potentially significant difference between the different product ranges was the role of the VIDC, with the ColourCard employing a \"video switch\" that permitted the VIDC to generate an output signal independent of the card for traditional display modes, with the card only generating output for enhanced modes, whereas the State Machine cards were entirely responsible for output and thereby provided emulations of the traditional modes, this leading to a \"letter-box\" effect for some modes in early versions of the State Machine software and also causing compatibility issues with software, particularly games, that accessed VIDC registers directly to configure the display. Subsequent developments from State Machine brought the G16 card, offering application-specific support for 15 and 16 bits per pixel modes.\nAlongside bandwidth constraints, a fundamental limitation to the size of VIDC framebuffers was imposed by the memory controller, limiting the size of framebuffers transferred to the VIDC through DMA to a specific 512\u00a0KB physical memory region. State Machine's ColourBurst card, announced together with its G16 card, employed memory mapping techniques to provide 1\u00a0MB of video RAM instead of the 512\u00a0KB of earlier cards and thus supporting larger screen modes. The ColourBurst was, when reviewed in late 1993, the first 24-bit colour card available for the Archimedes, also supporting various upgrades including the \"video switch\" capability absent from earlier cards, PAL encoding, and other professional capabilities.\nCoincidentally, ARM Limited announced the VIDC20\u2014the successor to the VIDC10 in the Archimedes\u2014at around the same time as the introduction of the Computer Concepts and State Machine product ranges in late 1992. By late 1993, rumours about Acorn's next-generation system (eventually released as the Risc PC), particularly 24-bit colour support, led to suggestions of improved support for higher colour depths in RISC OS, accompanied by the observation in the context of State Machine's ColourBurst card that \"it seems unlikely that another manufacturer will release such a powerful device before the launch of Acorn's new baby\". In late 1993, Computer Concepts announced the ColourCard Gold, developed in conjunction with Acorn to offer 15 bits per pixel support in the desktop environment. Meanwhile, State Machine announced the ClusterCard for 33\u00a0MHz A5000 models, plugging into the memory controller socket and supporting upgrades to 8\u00a0MB of RAM alongside graphics enhancements offering 1\u00a0MB or 2\u00a0MB of video RAM. The ClusterCard, employing the G335 Cluster Module was reported to be the first graphics card for the Archimedes series not requiring the use of the VIDC.\nWith IBM PC compatible systems leaving the Archimedes \"well behind the competition in the display stakes\", the ClusterCard was seen as attempting a solution similar to a local bus architecture on the A5000, with the potential to \"transform the A5000 into a serious graphics machine, with possibly as good a display potential as the next Acorn series equipped with VIDC20s\". The launch of the Risc PC in 1994 demonstrated Acorn's successor to the Archimedes, to which State Machine responded with a product called ColourView, \"an all-new replacement for the original G8 and G16 State Machine graphics cards\", offering 16 bits per pixel desktop-compatible screen modes, with a modular version also available for the ClusterCard without the 1\u00a0MB framebuffer. The full version of the card was reportedly available for A300 series, A400 series, A5000 and A540 machines.\nSomewhat distinct from general graphics enhancements, various products were also introduced to support the broadcasting industry and other professional imaging applications. In late 1990, Millipede Electronic Graphics announced an imaging product called APEX (Archimedes P3 Expansion) featuring \"four P3 (pixel pipeline processor) chips, together with an Arm3 processor running at 27\u00a0MHz\". With support for \"broadcast quality graphics at 32 bits per pixel\", hardware support for windows and sprites, emphasising real-time image combination and manipulation, the product was aimed at professional users and priced accordingly, with the version providing 4\u00a0MB of RAM projected to cost \u00a32750. Nevertheless, a licensing agreement had been reached with Acorn to \"enable Risc OS graphics functions to be fully emulated\". Following up from this earlier product, Millipede offered an \"all new Apex Imager\" video card in early 1994 featuring the four custom chips, ARM3, FPA, and 16\u00a0MB of video RAM on a double-width podule costing \u00a33975, this being virtually unchanged from the pricing of the original product from 1990. This product appears to make extensive use of FPGA devices and offers numerous video input and output facilities. Apex hardware was used by the Eidos video capture and compression solution, Thumper, which ran on a Risc PC and was able to process \"MPEG 1 resolution video at full PAL frame rate in real time\", being regarded in early 1995 as \"the best digitiser for our needs on any platform\" by Eidos' managing director. Previous Eidos capture solutions used A540 machines with 8\u00a0MB of RAM.\nSound and audio.\nThe Archimedes was capable of producing eight-channel, 8-bit, stereo sound, with the video controller chip being responsible for sound generation, it having direct memory access capabilities to independently stream audio data to the output circuitry. Some users sought to bypass the audio filtering circuitry to improve sound from the external audio connector.\nFloating-point arithmetic.\nThe Archimedes did not provide hardware support for floating-point arithmetic as standard, but the system was designed so that one might be added, with a floating-point co-processor instruction set architecture having been defined by Acorn for programs to use. As part of the system architecture, a software module provides an emulation of such a co-processor, handling floating-point instructions unsupported in hardware using software written using conventional ARM instructions. The co-processor was described as a \"cut-down\" ARM with only eight registers available instead of sixteen, offering instructions to transfer values to and from memory (supporting single, double, extended double and packed binary-coded decimal representations), to transfer values between the main CPU and co-processor, to transfer status information from the co-processor, to perform unary and binary operations on values, and to perform comparisons.\nIn the first generation of Archimedes 300 and 400 series machines, only the 400 series had the appropriate expansion capability to add a floating-point unit (FPU) or co-processor, although the emulator was supported on all models. The expansion capability was retained in the 400/1 series. The FPU expansion card was delivered for the R140 workstation and 400 series in 1989, priced at \u00a3599 plus VAT, and was based on the WE32206, with a \"protocol converter chip\" being used to translate between the ARM and the WE32206. The WE32206 card was also offered for Acorn's Springboard expansion card for IBM PC compatibles. Although Acorn had expected that interfacing the ARM to an existing FPU chip would be \"a much quicker route\" to delivering a hardware-based floating-point solution than developing a new co-processor, the complexity involved in developing the custom gate array responsible for interfacing to the WE32206 was apparently greater than anticipated, taking two years to deliver.\nReviews of the FPU were generally unenthusiastic, noting that Acorn's claims of an eight-fold speed-up were unlikely to be achieved in \"a practical program\", nevertheless reporting that programs performing repeated floating-point operations yielded speed-ups ranging from around four to sixteen times that of a base ARM2-based system. Somewhat more applied testing demonstrated speed-ups for benchmark programs of up to eight times, aligning with Acorn's claims, but contrasted these gains with the broader performance increases attainable from an ARM3 upgrade, these offering a more general four-fold speed improvement. Largely focusing on BASIC programming, one reviewer concluded that the FPU was \"all but obsolete\" with the availability of the ARM3 upgrade. Another conceded that some but not all C programs would benefit from the FPU since \"a good programmer will avoid using floating point instructions if at all possible\", suggesting that Acorn's R140 workstation would benefit more from the upgrade. However, BASIC programs compiled using the Archimedes BASIC Compiler achieved over nine-fold speed-ups for certain benchmarks, unlike those running on the standard BASIC interpreter whose floating-point routines avoided using FPU instructions, thus delivering no real performance improvements with the FPU fitted.\nThe Archimedes models based on the ARM3 processor supported a completely new \"arithmetic co-processor\" or \"floating-point accelerator\" known as the FPA. Released in 1993 for the R260 workstation and the A540 and A5000 machines, priced at \u00a399 plus VAT, the FPA device\u2014known specifically as the FPA10\u2014was fitted in a dedicated socket on the processor card for the R260 and A540, or in a motherboard socket in the A5000. It offered a peak throughput of 5\u00a0MFLOPS at 26\u00a0MHz. The models officially supporting the FPA had been introduced some time prior to availability of the device, and various ARM3 upgrade cards for earlier models had also been made available with an FPA socket in anticipation of eventual availability. Fabrication of the device was performed by GEC Plessey Semiconductors and was reported to be in \"an advanced stage of production\" in early 1993. Availability remained unclear, with ARM releasing technical details indicating that the chip, at 134,000 transistors was reportedly \"Arm's most complex IC to date\" and comparing its performance at \"around 4\u00a0MFLOPS\" to the MIPS R3010 floating-point co-processor, whilst claiming a substantial power consumption advantage. Further details were given upon the eventual release of the FPA10, stating a 26\u00a0MHz operating frequency and a power consumption of 250\u00a0mW. Reception from major software producers such as Computer Concepts and Colton Software was cautious, with the former's products not making any use of floating-point instructions and thus not standing to benefit, and with the latter's using such instructions but indicating skepticism about any significant benefits in performance.\nObservations from testing the FPA10 confirmed that applications such as Resultz and PipeDream 4\u2014both Colton Software products\u2014and other spreadsheets, whilst ostensibly standing to benefit as number processing applications, exhibited \"no noticeable speed improvements\", this being attributed to these applications' avoidance of unnecessary calculation and the more significant overhead of servicing a graphical user interface. Other programs such as Draw and ArtWorks\u2014a Computer Concepts product\u2014used their own arithmetic routines instead of the floating-point emulator (FPE) and, as anticipated, were therefore unable to take advantage of the accelerated floating-point instructions. However, various free of charge or low-cost programs ported from other systems, such as POV-Ray, plus selected native applications such as Clares' Illusionist and Oak Solutions' WorraCAD, did exhibit substantial performance gains from the FPA with speed-ups of between five and ten times. Programs compiled by Intelligent Interfaces' Fortran compiler were reported as running \"some routines up to 20 times faster with the FPA10\". Although the FPA10 only implemented arithmetic operations, delegating trigonometric operations to the FPE, it was able to operate concurrently with the main CPU and maintained its own instruction pipeline, allowing the CPU to proceed with other instructions until a floating-point instruction result was required. Speculative execution was also employed to improve performance.\nObserved BASIC program performance remained in line with experiences from the earlier FPU solution. The BASIC VI (or Basic64) interpreter bundled with RISC OS which was \"much slower than Basic V normally\", with the former using the FPE and the latter providing its own floating-point arithmetic routines, ended up \"slightly faster\" than BASIC V due to observed speed-ups of around four to around eleven times, with non-trigonometric operations benefiting the most in one analysis. Another analysis employing benchmarks of individual arithmetic and trigonometric operations indicated a more uniform distribution of performance improvements for BASIC VI programs, also noting that BASIC VI delivered more precision than BASIC V in its floating-point representation. The product was perceived as \"good value\" but having restricted usefulness with the general lack of support in many applications, these employing their own routines and techniques to attempt to provide performant arithmetic on the base hardware platform, and a lack of incentive amongst software producers to offer support without a large enough market of users having the FPA fitted.\nWith the FPA10 having finally become available but only rated to run at 26\u00a0MHz, and with ARM3 upgrades being delivered at frequencies as high as 35\u00a0MHz, a higher-rated part, the FPA11, supporting 33\u00a0MHz operation was developed and apparently delivered in products such as a processor card upgrade for the A540. ARM3 upgrades were also produced with 33\u00a0MHz ARM3 processors, but unlike their 25\u00a0MHz counterparts which were available with FPA10 co-processors already fitted, these faster cards were not supplied with FPA11 co-processors, perhaps due to availability issues with the faster part.\nARM3 upgrades.\nIn early 1990, Aleph One introduced an upgrade board for Archimedes A300 and A400 series models featuring the ARM3 processor which had been designed by Acorn but was sold independently by VLSI Technology. Although the ARM2 employed by current models could reportedly be run at 20\u00a0MHz, it was only ever run at 8\u00a0MHz due to external limitations, these being the speed of the data bus and of the \"relatively slow\", but correspondingly relatively inexpensive, RAM devices in use. The ARM3 incorporated a 4\u00a0KB on-chip combined instruction and data cache, loosening such external constraints and thus permitting the processor to be run productively at the elevated 20\u00a0MHz frequency. With a processor running at this higher speed, the overall performance of a computer with the ARM3 upgrade was reported as double that of the machine without the upgrade (\"on average, execution times were halved\"), with programs performing input/output benefiting rather less (\"a worst case of 30 percent improvement\"). Original A300 and A400 series models, as opposed to the A400/1 series, required an upgrade to MEMC1a. One hundred percent compatibility with the ARM2 was claimed, and a facility was provided to disable the on-chip cache and to slow the clock to 8\u00a0MHz in order to handle software that ran too fast with the ARM3 running at full speed, but as originally provided, the ARM3 was not compatible with the existing hardware floating point co-processor solution due to the introduction of a different co-processor interface in the device, this interface eventually being used by the FPA device. The upgrade was introduced at a price of \u00a3684.24, with the MEMC1a costing \u00a357.50 for those users who needed it.\nBy the end of 1991, an ARM3 upgrade had been offered for the A3000 by Aleph One in association with Atomwide and by Watford Electronics. Since the ARM2 was soldered directly to the motherboard in the A3000 using surface mounting techniques, the upgrade had to be performed by a fitting service, and prices included courier collection, fitting, testing and return within five working days. With the A5000 having been launched with a 25\u00a0MHz ARM3 fitted, these A3000 upgrade boards carried a processor running at this higher frequency relative to earlier upgrades. Originally, the Aleph One product had been priced at \u00a3468.83, but the announcement of a board by Watford Electronics led to a reduced price of \u00a3392.45. The Watford product had an introductory price of \u00a3274.95.\nOther vendors produced ARM3 upgrades. In late 1992, Simtec Electronics announced a board with an additional socket for the FPA device, thus allowing older machines to join the A540 and A5000 in potentially taking advantage of it. By this time, prices for ARM3 upgrades had been reduced to the point that this Simtec upgrade cost only \u00a3175 plus VAT. Competitors including IFEL and CJE Micros followed Simtec's lead and announced similar combined ARM3/FPA upgrades. In contrast, Aleph One stated that the FPA would \"not be available for a long time yet\", indicating the pursuit of \"a better solution based on the newer Arm600 chip plus an FPA\". Other vendors had apparently ruled out similar ARM600-based products on the basis of cost. In 1993, IFEL later announced a 35\u00a0MHz ARM3 upgrade based on a limited quantity\u2014approximately 1500\u2014of available suitably rated parts, these having a ceramic package whose volume ruled out its use in machines with limited internal space, making the upgrade suitable for A300, A400 or R140 machines. A combined ARM3/FPA upgrade with the faster ARM3 was under consideration, although the lack of suitably rated FPA chips meant that a switch would be provided to manually change the clock frequency between 25\u00a0MHz and 35\u00a0MHz. A target price of \u00a3199 including VAT was estimated.\nPrior to the availability of the FPA, Simtec reduced the price of its combined ARM3/FPA board to \u00a3165 plus VAT. The company also released a \"turbo RAM\" upgrade for ARM250-based machines to provide similar performance benefits to an ARM3 upgrade, replacing the RAM with a faster type that then permitted the processor to be run at a higher frequency, thus pursuing the alternative approach to enhancing system performance (increasing both the processor and memory speed) to that pursued by ARM3 upgrades (introducing a faster processor with a cache). With the upgrade, performance of these machines was reported as increasing from 7 MIPS to 10 MIPS, this compared to almost 13 MIPS for a 25\u00a0MHz ARM3. By employing a 16\u00a0MHz clock signal, as envisaged by Acorn in the design of the A3010, in conjunction with dynamic RAM devices with a 70\u00a0ns access time, the upgrade provided a total of 4\u00a0MB of RAM and a 40 percent performance improvement. Unlike standard RAM upgrades, the turbo upgrade needed to be fitted at a suitable facility, and the board was priced slightly higher than a standard RAM upgrade at \u00a3129 plus VAT. A \"super turbo\" version of the board with 20\u00a0MHz crystal and 45\u00a0ns dynamic RAM devices was reviewed and apparently available subject to component availability, reportedly achieving 12.25 MIPS.\nAleph One, having founded the ARM3 upgrade industry, found that increased competition from \"six or eight companies making Arm3 upgrades\" drove down prices to the point that \"margins fell, and the bottom fell out of the Arm3 market\". However, revenues from ARM3 upgrades allowed Aleph One to pursue the development of IBM PC-compatible podule expansions and eventually the PC processor card for the Risc PC, these having \"a higher intellectual content than Arm3 upgrades\" and being more difficult for potential competitors to make. Plans were indicated to develop a PowerPC processor card for the Risc PC. Neither the PowerPC upgrade for the Risc PC nor the earlier ARM600-based upgrade for the Archimedes series appeared, with Acorn itself abandoning plans to combine newer ARM600 or ARM700 parts with FPA devices to provide improved floating point performance.\nARM3 upgrades were produced for several years, but with the ARM3 part being \"officially discontinued\" by its manufacturer VLSI in 1996, upgrade vendors such as IFEL were predicting scarcity and unable to guarantee further supplies of such products. Demand for such upgrades, even in 1996, was reported as \"steady\" with schools still upgrading \"batches of old A300 and A400 machines\". Later still, in 1997, Simtec announced a \"special batch\" of ARM3 upgrades for A300 and A400 series machines and the A3000, featuring a socket for the 25\u00a0MHz FPA10 or 33\u00a0MHz FPA11, with the former being supplied already fitted for a total product cost of \u00a3199 plus VAT.\nIBM PC-compatible podules.\nAcorn initially planned to produce an IBM PC-compatible system on a podule (peripheral module), complete with 80186 processor (running at 10\u00a0MHz) and disk drive support. Subsequent pricing and competitiveness considerations led to the product being shelved. However, in late 1991, hardware supplier Aleph One announced a PC podule based on a 20\u00a0MHz Intel 80386SX processor with VGA display capability. Launched in early 1992, the podule fitted with 1\u00a0MB of RAM cost \u00a3595, whereas a 4\u00a0MB version cost \u00a3725. Known as the 386PC, the expansion was \"in effect, a PC within your Archimedes\" whose RAM could be upgraded from the minimum of 1\u00a0MB, the price of this configuration having fallen to \u00a3495 at the time of its review, to the maximum of 4\u00a0MB, with this configuration also being offered at a reduced price of \u00a3625. A socket on the board permitted the 80387 maths co-processor to be fitted for hardware floating point arithmetic support, this costing an extra \u00a3120. Integration of the PC system involved the Archimedes providing display, keyboard and disk support. In the initial version, the supplied 386PC application would put the Archimedes into dedicated display mode and thus take over the display, but subsequent versions promised operation of the PC in a window, much like the updated PC Emulator from the era. Screen memory requirements were around 256\u00a0KB for MDA and CGA, with EGA and VGA requiring another 256\u00a0KB. Separate serial and parallel ports were fitted on the expansion board due to limitations with the ports on existing Archimedes machines, but integration with those ports was also planned for subsequent versions of the product.\nWatford Electronics, in association with \"prolific ex-Computer Concepts hardware expert\" Chris Honey, announced a PC podule in early 1992, this effectively delivering \"a stand-alone PC\" within the host computer and potentially allowing two independent users with their own keyboards and monitors, although the PC system would be accessible via a desktop window and have access to RISC OS hard drive partitions. This product was apparently never released, however, and its designers subsequently formed graphics expansion producer State Machine. In late 1992, Aleph One reduced the price of the 386-based card by \u00a3100, also upgrading the processor to a 25\u00a0MHz part, and introduced a card featuring a 25\u00a0MHz Cyrix 486SLC processor, with the new card retaining the maths co-processor option of the earlier product. The stated performance of this new card was approximately twice that of the 386-based card but only \"40 percent of the performance of a standard 33\u00a0MHz 486DX PC clone\". However, upgraded Windows drivers reportedly allowed even the 386-based card to exceed the graphical performance of such a 486-based clone, effectively employing the host Archimedes as a kind of \"Windows accelerator\". A subsequent review moderated such claims somewhat, indicating a Windows performance \"not noticeably better than an average un-accelerated 386SX PC clone\", although acceleration support was expected to improve, with device drivers for various direct drive laser printers also expected. The product was priced at \u00a3495 for the 1\u00a0MB version and \u00a3595 for the 4\u00a0MB version, with a future revision of the product anticipated that would support up to 16\u00a0MB of RAM.\nIn 1993, Aleph One collaborated with Acorn to produce Acorn-branded versions of the PC cards for use with the A3020 and A4000 which used a distinct \"mini-podule expansion system\". The 25\u00a0MHz 386SX and 486SLC cards were offered in this profile to provide DOS and Windows compatibility, branded as the PC386 and PC486, priced at \u00a3275 and \u00a3499 respectively. In late 1993, the supplied software was upgraded and discounts to the products announced, bringing the respective prices down to \u00a3225 and \u00a3425. Acorn also offered bundles of the A4000 with a hard drive and each of the cards. Coincidentally at this time, with speculation building about future Acorn computer products, Acorn's product marketing manager had been reported as suggesting that such products \"would have an empty Intel socket for customers to add PC Dos and Windows compatibility\". Such remarks were clarified by Acorn's technical director, indicating that an Intel \"second processor\" was merely an option in an architecture supporting multiple processors. Ultimately, Acorn would release the Risc PC with dual processor capabilities and support for using a \"low cost (\u00a399 upwards) plug-in 486 PC processor or other CPUs\" alongside an ARM processor.\nRedesigned PC cards were released in 1994, introducing the option of a faster 50\u00a0MHz 486SLC2 processor for a reported doubling of the performance over the fastest existing cards. Up to 16\u00a0MB of SIMM-profile RAM could be fitted, and a local hard drive controller was added. The supplied software was also upgraded to support Windows in a resolution of 800 x 600 at up to 16 colours, and optional network driver support was available to use the card as a Novell NetWare client and for Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Pricing remained similar to earlier models. Reported performance was better than the previous generation of cards but \"still slow compared to all but the most basic of modern PCs, but certainly usable\". The Windows User benchmarks rated the performance as similar to a fast 386SX-based system or a \"standard\" 386DX-based system, with the faster processor yielding a more favourable rating, but with the hard drive and graphics tests bringing the overall rating down. Use of a hard drive fitted directly to the card, using its own dedicated IDE interface, was reported as providing up to ten times the level of hard drive performance relative to using the system's own drive, but use of the SmartDrive caching software made any resulting performance difference marginal.\nParallel and data processing.\nA range of podules providing access to parallel processing capabilities using Inmos Transputer processors were announced by Gnome Computing in late 1989. Aside from a \"Link Adaptor\" podule for interfacing to external Transputer hardware, the \"TRAM Motherboard\" podule combined the Link Adaptor's interfacing logic with the hosting of up to four \"TRAMs\" (Transputer plus RAM modules), providing a complete development system based on the Archimedes. Also offered was a \"Transputer Baseboard\" podule featuring a T425 or T800 with up to 8\u00a0MB of RAM. A single podule with four TRAMs, each employing a T800 processor, was stated as giving 40\u00a0MIPS of performance, with a hypothetical 160\u00a0MIPS available on an Archimedes with four podule slots.\nDigital signal processing capabilities were provided by the Burden Neuroscience 56001 DSP Card, originally developed by the Burden Neurological Institute as in-house hardware for use in conjunction with Archimedes systems but marketed by The Serial Port. This card was fitted as a single-width podule but, unusually, needed manual configuration instead of identifying itself to the host computer. The podule itself offered a 32\u00a0MHz Motorola 56001 digital signal processor together with 192\u00a0KB of RAM, two 16-bit analogue-to-digital converters, two 16-bit digital-to-analogue converters, and serial communications capabilities. A 25-pin connector provided the means to interface the board to other hardware. An assembler was provided, although this reportedly required Acorn's Desktop Development Environment to function, and software was also provided to interact with the board, view memory and register contents, and to visualise memory ranges in real time. Described as appropriate for \"high speed analogue data acquisition or output\" supporting real time signal processing, the product was considered \"a useful 56001 development test bed\", requiring a certain level of expertise, but was also considered good value at a price of \u00a3449 plus VAT.\nCD-ROM and related storage.\nCD-ROM technology was introduced to the Archimedes range in 1990 with the launch of Next Technology's CD-ROM solution for the A3000 and earlier Archimedes models. Combining an SCSI interface and CD-ROM drive and supplied with a sample disc for a total price of \u00a3995, the solution provided a filing system so that standard CD-ROM media could be browsed and read like any other kind of disc. An application was also provided to play audio tracks on CD Audio and mixed-format discs through the drive's headphone socket. The drive itself used a caddy to hold the discs inserted into the drive. One limitation experienced on RISC OS was with the content on various CD-ROM titles, this often being designed for MS-DOS and featuring DOS-only software to offer search and database-related functionality. Next Technology aimed to remedy this situation by offering a service to let users create their own CD-ROMs at around \u00a3300 per disc, leading to the initial conclusion that schools and institutional users would benefit from the format much more than home users.\nTwo years on from the introduction of CD-ROM products, adoption of the technology was still at a \"tentative state\", with \u00a38\u00a0million having been spent on equipment and an estimated 3,000 drives deployed in UK schools. Drive prices had fallen significantly, from around \u00a31,000 to \u00a3300 and with a further decline to \u00a3200 anticipated. As a significant technology in the delivery of multimedia content, the focus had shifted from merely using CD-ROM as a cheap storage medium for large amounts of graphics and text to aspirations of providing \"high-quality, full-screen graphics coupled with hi-fi stereo sound\" on CD media, with the principal challenge identified as being able to deliver compressed video that either a computer or a drive could decompress without compromising video quality or introducing incompatibilities between different manufacturers' products.\nAcorn's video solution for its own computers was the Replay system, introducing compression formats and associated software for playback and authoring. However, laserdisc technology, which had been used several years earlier by Acorn for interactive video applications, notably in the BBC Domesday Project, was still seen as being a \"promising rival\" to CD-based video formats, having finally \"become successful in multimedia training\" and by then \"being aimed at well-heeled home video enthusiasts\". Reservations about the read-only nature of CD-ROM discs was also seen as a \"wounding flaw\", leaving users to consider alternatives for convenient bulk storage, with magneto-optical drives emerging at this time. Nevertheless, CD-ROM adoption was seen as inevitable, particularly given the format's benefits for holding large amounts of text and making the searching of such text convenient, and with government initiatives having helped to make an estimated 100 titles available for both MS-DOS and RISC OS. The dual-function nature of the media and the ability to use drives to play audio also made such products generally attractive purchases, particularly for home users and with Photo CD also regarded as an attraction, although the introduction of Philips' CD-i and Commodore's CDTV risked a level of confusion in this market as well as presenting another challenge in terms of compatibility for Acorn's own products and technologies.\nAcorn would go on to announce Photo CD support in its products in early 1993, with operating system and application enhancements being delivered by the end of that year. Although the video and memory capabilities of the Archimedes machines were generally unable to take advantage of the higher colour depths or the largest sizes of the scanned images on Photo CD media, the introduction of future hardware from Acorn, featuring the next generation of video controller from ARM and supporting 24-bit colour displays, was anticipated. Support for multi-session CD-ROMs entailed some upgrades to existing SCSI interfaces as well as the use of drives with the appropriate capabilities such as Acorn's own Multimedia Expansion Unit.\nNetworking capabilities.\nThe Archimedes was launched with provision for an optional Econet module to be installed, this module being the same as that used by the Master series. Acorn introduced Ethernet connectivity with the launch of the company's R140 Unix workstation, also offering expansion cards for Archimedes models. In 1992, Atomwide also introduced Ethernet cards for the traditional Archimedes expansion bus and for the internal expansion slot in the A3000. Ethernet could be used as faster medium for existing Econet-style networking, or the TCP/IP protocol stack could be employed instead. Acorn sought to introduce Econet functionality on top of Internet protocols with its Acorn Universal Networking (AUN) suite of technologies.\nNumerous vendors offered Ethernet expansion cards, such as Ant Limited (via Atomwide), Digital Services, i-cubed, Oak Solutions, and Risc Developments. Although compatible with AUN, some of the cards offered support for vendor-specific enhancements such as Oak Solutions' ClassNet and Digital Services' NetGain. Other networking approaches were available, including the sharing of hard drives using a SCSI bus, and emerging technologies such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode were deployed on the Acorn platform, notably in SJ Research's Nexus product.\nBBC Micro interfacing and ROM software support.\nAs a way of offering continuity with the BBC Micro and the user port, 1\u00a0MHz bus port and analogue port that were provided by the earlier range of machines, Acorn announced an I/O podule at the launch of the Archimedes, this being fitted with the 6522 VIA featured in the BBC range, with the possibility of upgrading the podule to provide a MIDI port. A ROM podule was also announced with the anticipation that users upgrading from the earlier machines would choose to fit their application and language ROMs in their new machine, these running under the 6502 emulator provided with the operating system.\nIn early 1988, Computer Concepts announced its own ROM/RAM podule that was capable of accepting seven chips, each with a maximum capacity of 128\u00a0KB, supporting the use of installed RAM as \"a RAM-disc filing system\" with optional battery backup to retain the contents with the machine powered down. The company also announced the availability of its existing BBC Micro productivity suite for use with the board. Acorn also released its ROM and I/O podules in the first half of 1988. Other companies also offered I/O expansions, such as the Unilab I/O Box 3000 for the A3000 that provided three user ports, analogue port and 1\u00a0MHz bus port. HCCS and Morley Electronics supplied podules for the A3000 that provided user and analogue ports, with Morley's product also offering an I2C bus connector ostensibly for the use of subsequent peripherals from the company.\nImpact.\nA mid-1987 \"Personal Computer World\" preview of the Archimedes based on the \"A500 Development System\" expressed enthusiasm about the computer's performance, that it \"felt like the fastest computer I have ever used, by a considerable margin\", indicating that the system deserved success in the education market and might have more success than Acorn's earlier models in the business market, comparing favourably to the Macintosh II or IBM PS/2 Model 80. Similar enthusiasm was reflected by the same writer in a \"Byte\" magazine preview of the A310 the following month. However, dissatisfaction with the availability of essential applications, such as the lack of a word processor specifically written for the system at its launch, and the incoherent user experience presented by early applications, highlighted perceived deficiencies with the product from the perspective of users and potential users.\nAcorn had predicted sales of 20,000 Archimedes machines by the end of 1987 and 120,000 by the end of 1988. However, by mid-1988 only 14,000 units had reportedly been sold. One commentator attributed such disappointing sales to the lack of software support for the system, noting that Acorn had not invested sufficiently in software availability and that few established companies in the Acorn market were delivering native applications. Acorn's strategy of commissioning applications available for other platforms, such as First Word Plus and Logistix, was regarded as \"hardly innovative\" and that the platform needed \"a massive injection of native, innovative software\", perhaps by a revitalised Acornsoft.\nWith the imminent arrival of RISC OS for the Archimedes, later coverage around the start of 1989 praised the desktop and supplied applications, noting that \"RISC OS is everything the Archimedes' original Desktop should have been but wasn't\", and looked forward to future applications from Acorn and third parties, only lamenting that it was \"a shame that this impressive environment was not in place at the Archimedes' launch, but it's still not too late for it to turn some heads\". The introduction of the A3000, launched with RISC OS fitted, delivered better than expected sales for Acorn, with an estimated total of 50,000 Archimedes and A3000 systems having been sold by the end of 1989.\nBy early 1991, 100,000 Archimedes machines had been sold, with the A3000 being the largest selling computer in UK schools, with Acorn's Archimedes and Master 128 accounting for 53% of sales in an eight-month period during 1990, and with the 32-bit machines \"outselling the Master 128 by a factor of two to one\". In this period, over two-thirds of computer sales into primary schools had been Acorn models, with Acorn's 40% share of sales into secondary schools making the company the largest single vendor in this section of the market. By mid-1992, a reported 180,000 Archimedes machines had been sold, again due to strong A3000 sales. By 1994 and the launch of the Risc PC, over 300,000 Archimedes machines had been sold, and the A3000 had become the fourth best selling computer in the United Kingdom. By the launch of the StrongARM J233 variant of the Risc PC in 1997, over 600,000 Archimedes, A-series and Risc PC systems had been sold.\nThe Archimedes was distributed to varying degrees outside the UK. Enquiries about the Archimedes range were reportedly handled for the US and Canada via Olivetti Canada, with distribution and servicing in Canada being undertaken by Comspec in association with Olivetti Canada. In Italy, the Archimedes was promoted and distributed by G. Ricordi &amp; C., previously appointed as Acorn's exclusive distributor in the country.\nPerformance.\nAcorn's original claims for the Archimedes noted a performance of 4 million instructions per second (MIPS), these reportedly being equivalent to DEC VAX-11/750 instructions. With the VAX-11/750 rated at 0.62 VAX MIPS, Acorn's claimed 4 MIPS translates crudely to around 2.5 VAX MIPS. However, the initial 8 MHz Archimedes 310 model achieved around 2.8 VAX MIPS, delivering competitive performance against more expensive contemporary personal computers such as the 16 MHz Compaq Deskpro 386 (priced from $6,499 including 40\u00a0MB hard drive), with the Compaq achieving around 2.1 VAX MIPS. (A VAX-11/780 running VAX/VMS 4.2 produced the baseline Dhrystone score of 1757 corresponding to 1 VAX MIPS, this also being used to calculate MIPS ratings for Dhrystone 2 benchmark results.)\nThis level of performance made the Archimedes one of the most powerful home computers available during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its CPU outperforming the Motorola 68000 found in both the cheaper Amiga 500 and Atari ST machines as well as the more expensive Macintosh and Amiga 2000. Although an 8 MHz 68000 has a performance rating of around 1.2 VAX MIPS, the 68000-based Amiga 1000 reportedly achieved around 0.54 VAX MIPS when benchmarked as a system. In comparison, systems based on the 8 MHz ARM2, such as the BBC A3000, benchmarked from 2.7 VAX MIPS up to 3.4 VAX MIPS, depending on the operating system version and display configuration.\nPerformance improvements would be delivered over time for the Archimedes and its competitors. For example, the Compaq Deskpro 386/16 model was replaced in 1988 with a 386/20 model offering somewhat improved CPU performance (around 3.5 VAX MIPS) and in 1989 by a 386/33 model improving CPU performance still further (to around 6.6 VAX MIPS). Upgraded Amiga models also offered steadily improving performance, with the Amiga 2500/20 appearing in 1988 and the Amiga 2500/30 appearing in 1989, these delivering approximately 1.5 VAX MIPS and 3.0 VAX MIPS respectively, with an Amiga 2000 upgraded to a 33 MHz 68030 processor achieving a performance rating of around 3.0\u20133.6 VAX MIPS. The Macintosh II series incrementally improved their performance from around 1.6 VAX MIPS in 1987 with the original 68020-based model, through to around 6.1 VAX MIPS in the 68030-based Macintosh IIfx in 1990.\nThe increasing performance deficit relative to the x86 architecture was somewhat reduced with the introduction of the ARM3 in 1990: an Archimedes system such as the A410/1 upgraded to use a 25 MHz ARM3 could achieve 10.5 VAX MIPS, with the ARM3-based A5000 achieving a reported 13.8 VAX MIPS, rising to 15.1 VAX MIPS in its 33 MHz variant. ARM3 upgrades were initially rather expensive but decreased significantly in price and were available for all ARM2 systems, even the relatively inexpensive A3000. Thus, Acorn's ARM3-based machines, generally priced for business or institutional users, remained broadly competitive. Acorn's low-end A3010, fitted with an ARM250 processor, was capable of delivering from 3.1 VAX MIPS up to 5.0 VAX MIPS, remaining competitive with upgraded Amiga models such as the Amiga 2500.\nWith development of ARM technologies having been transferred to ARM Limited as a separate company, the performance advantages of Acorn's ARM-based computers, maintained by the transition from the ARM2 to ARM3, eroded somewhat in the early 1990s relative to competitors using processors from established vendors such as Intel and Motorola, as new ARM processors gradually arrived offering more modest performance gains over their predecessors. With ARM Limited focusing on embedded applications, it was noted that \"the large performance lead Arm2 and Arm3 once enjoyed\" over contemporary Intel processors was over, at least for the time being.\nThe introduction of the 68040, and particularly the introduction of the 80486 with its subsequent evolution, put ARM3-based Archimedes models at an increasing performance disadvantage. Successors to the Macintosh II in the form of the Quadra and Centris series improved performance two- to four-fold over earlier models. An Amiga 4000 with 68040 CPU (or a suitably upgraded Amiga 2000 and 3000) could achieve a reported 18.7\u201321.6 VAX MIPS, whereas Compaq Deskpro 486/25 and 486/33 models achieved a reported 14.7 VAX MIPS and 19.2 VAX MIPS with 25\u00a0MHz and 33\u00a0MHz 80486 CPUs respectively, and with the introduction of 486DX2 CPUs at 50\u00a0MHz and 66\u00a0MHz during 1992 raising this to as much as around 28.5 VAX MIPS. Against such performance ratings only Acorn's Risc PC 600 (18.4 VAX MIPS to 21.8 VAX MIPS) fitted with an ARM610 CPU could keep up. However, by the time of its introduction in 1994, two years after the reported incorporation of the ARM610 in the Apple Newton, such performance had already been surpassed by Pentium-based models such as the Compaq Deskpro 5/66M Model 510 delivering 40.3 VAX MIPS.\nAlthough the Archimedes, emulating floating-point arithmetic instructions in software, achieved Whetstone benchmark results comparable to Acorn's earlier Cambridge Co-Processor product based on the 6\u00a0MHz NS32016 CPU with NS32081 floating-point unit, such levels of performance were rather less impressive in comparison to contemporary systems equipped with hardware floating-point support, merely reaching a performance level \"within a factor of two or less\" of IBM PC/AT systems equipped with a 80286 CPU and 80287 floating-point co-processor. Already in 1988, a 20\u00a0MHz Compaq system with a 80386 CPU and 80387 co-processor would achieve around 1800 KWhetstones or around 20 times the performance of the ARM2 emulating floating-point instructions. Acorn's WE32206-based Floating Point Unit (FPU), available for the A400 series and R140, was expected to deliver ten-fold performance benefits, and was eventually claimed to offer eight-fold speed-ups. This left FPU-equipped systems delivering around half the performance of accelerated 386-based systems.\nThe claimed performance of Acorn's Floating Point Accelerator (FPA10), available for ARM3-based Archimedes systems, was originally 5\u00a0MFLOPS, subsequently revised to \"around 4\u00a0MFLOPS\", and may ostensibly have been broadly competitive with the MIPS R3010 (as claimed by ARM) in some systems under benchmark testing, with an A5000 fitted with FPA10 reportedly achieving around 3.5\u00a0MFLOPS, compared to various R3000/R3010-based systems achieving between 5.0 and 8.9\u00a0MFLOPS. However, unlike the R3010, announced in 1988 with claimed performance ratings of 4\u00a0MFLOPS for double-precision arithmetic and 7\u00a0MFLOPS for single-precision arithmetic, and available in workstation products the same year, the FPA10 was eventually delivered in 1993, by which time numerous subsequent MIPS products had been delivered with steadily increasing performance, diminishing the relevance of comparisons with the R3010. For example, the MIPS R4400, available from 1992, achieved over 24 MFLOPS when benchmarked in systems. In contrast with the declining competitive situation of the ARM3, the ARM3 and FPA10 combination did appear to rather more competitive with the 486DX2 systems introduced in late 1992, these rated at around 3.6\u20134.5 MFLOPS, but a year later these would be eclipsed by the performance of Pentium-based systems starting at 8.8 MFLOPS.\nEducation.\nContinuing Acorn's involvement with the BBC and its computer literacy initiatives, two of the first Archimedes models bore the BBC branding, as did the later BBC A3000 model. Dissatisfaction with this arrangement was voiced by competitor Research Machines and an industry group led by a Microsoft representative, the British Micro Federation, who advocated the use of \"business standard\" operating systems such as MS-DOS. Responding to claims that the BBC branding was \"unethical\" and \"damaging\", a BBC Enterprises representative stated that the arrangement was \"a continuing part of the original computer literacy project\" and that bringing in \"something totally new would be irresponsible\".\nThe range won significant market share in the education markets of the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Acorn's considerable presence in primary and secondary education had been established through the Archimedes' predecessors\u2014the BBC Micro and BBC Master\u2014with the Archimedes supplementing these earlier models to see Acorn's products collectively representing over half of the installed computers in secondary schools at the start of the 1990s.\nIn 1992, the Tesco supermarket chain initiated its \"Computers for Schools\" scheme in association with Acorn, offering vouchers for every \u00a325 spent in Tesco stores that were redeemable against software and hardware products including complete computer systems, with this promotional campaign taking place over a six-week period. Over 15,000 schools registered to participate in the scheme and over 22 million vouchers were issued during the campaign period, placing the estimated value of the distributed products at over \u00a34.5 million, although the actual value of distributed products was later reported as \u00a33 million. Tesco and Acorn repeated the scheme in 1993 on the basis of the response to the previous year's campaign, distributing software and hardware at an estimated value of \u00a36.5 million to over 11,000 schools including 7,000 computers, and even introducing Acorn computers to some schools for the first time.\nDespite the benefit to Acorn of expanding its customer base, dissatisfaction was expressed by dealers and software companies about the effects of the scheme, with anecdotes emerging of a reluctance to buy equipment that could be obtained for free, thus harming dealer revenues, although Acorn's education marketing manager argued that the scheme's effect was generally positive and actually produced sales opportunities for dealers. The inclusion of software products in the scheme was regarded by one commentator as harmful to both the companies whose products were featured, these \"not making enough profit from the transaction\", and to those whose products were not, these seeing potential customers choose their competitors' \"free\" products. Noting that the scheme was \"not purely philanthropic\", concern was expressed about the effect on the Acorn market and that schools were needing to \"resort to charities and publicity stunts to get the basic tools to do the job\". In response to such criticism, independent software titles were dropped from the scheme in 1994, which ultimately distributed products to over 10,000 schools including 4,000 computers, with a total of 15,000 computers having been given away over the first three years of the scheme.\nWith Tesco having expanded its presence in Scotland through acquisitions, the Tesco scheme was extended to Scotland for the first time in 1995. Alongside updates to the featured product selection, the possibility was introduced of saving unredeemed vouchers for redemption in the 1996 campaign. By the end of the 1996 campaign, \u00a35.7 million worth of products had been distributed, with the scheme having distributed products worth a total of \u00a325.9 million, including 26,000 Acorn computers in its first five years.\nBy the mid to late 1990s, the UK educational market began to turn away from Acorn's products towards IBM PC compatibles, with Acorn and Apple establishing a joint venture, Xemplar, to market these companies' products in the education sector as part of a strategy to uphold their market share. Through Xemplar's involvement in the Computers for Schools scheme, Apple products were featured for the first time in the 1996 campaign. Xemplar's involvement continued in subsequent years, introducing information technology training for teachers in 1998, and seeking to offer Acorn products in the 1999 campaign despite the turmoil around Acorn as the company sought to move away from the desktop computing market, subsequently selling its stake in Xemplar to Apple. In 2000, Tesco changed its partner in the Computers for Schools scheme from Xemplar to RM plc.\nAcorn conducted other promotional initiatives towards the education sector. The Acorn Advantage programme, launched in September 1994, offered a loyalty scheme whereby points were accrued through purchases and redeemed for \"curriculum resources\" that included non-computing items such as musical and scientific instruments as well as computer hardware. Several commercial partners were involved in the scheme such as Fina, which awarded vouchers with petrol purchases that could be exchanged for points, and the Midland Bank which would donate points to schools joining its Midbank school-based banking system. An Acorn-branded Visa credit card would also generate Advantage points for nominated schools.\nLegacy.\nThe Archimedes was used by music composers and scorewriters to run the Sibelius scorewriting software.\nBetween 1994 and 2004 the Archimedes and Risc PC models were used for teleprompters at television studios. The hardware was easy to adapt for TV broadcast use and cheaper than other hardware available at the time. Archimedes models saw use in other commercial broadcasting applications including scheduling and CD jukebox control for the Asda supermarket chain's in-store satellite broadcast radio channel.\nThe performance and adaptability of the Archimedes range led these machines to be used in various entertainment venue applications and solutions. Tecnation's Bitbopper utilised video digitisers, genlock and MIDI cards in Archimedes 440 computers, integrating audio and video inputs under the control of a \"light jockey\" and producing audiovisual output via venue entertainment system installations, utilising projectors, displays and other effects equipment. Laser Grafx's Prisma system employed Archimedes 440 and A5000 machines to control laser effects installations at music concerts and nightclubs. A range of Archimedes and Risc PC models were used to control various aspects of the Quasar laser tag gaming experience, being introduced in an upgrade to the systems known as Chromaburst, itself subsequently being replaced by a more conservative solution using PC compatibles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63146", "revid": "998182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63146", "title": "Edgar Degas", "text": "French Impressionist artist (1834\u20131917)\nEdgar Degas (, ; born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas, ; 19 July 1834\u00a0\u2013 27 September 1917) was a French Impressionist artist famous for his pastel drawings and oil paintings.\nDegas also produced bronze sculptures, prints, and drawings. Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers. Although Degas is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, he rejected the term, preferring to be called a realist, and did not paint outdoors as many Impressionists did.\nDegas was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his rendition of dancers and bathing female nudes. In addition to ballet dancers and bathing women, Degas painted racehorses and racing jockeys, as well as portraits. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and their portrayal of human isolation.\nAt the beginning of his career, Degas wanted to be a history painter, a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classical Western art. In his early thirties he changed course, and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, he became a classical painter of modern life.\nEarly life.\nDegas was born in Paris, France, into a moderately wealthy family. He was the oldest of five children of C\u00e9lestine Musson De Gas, a Creole from New Orleans, Louisiana, and Augustin De Gas, a banker. His maternal grandfather Germain Musson was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, of French descent, and had settled in New Orleans in 1810.\nDegas (he adopted this less grandiose spelling of his family name when he became an adult) began his schooling at age eleven, enrolling in the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand. His mother died when he was thirteen, and the main influences on him for the remainder of his youth were his father and several unmarried uncles.\nDegas began to paint early in life. By the time he graduated from the Lyc\u00e9e with a \"baccalaur\u00e9at\" in literature in 1853, at age 18, he had turned a room in his home into an artist's studio. Upon graduating, he registered as a copyist in the Louvre Museum, but his father expected him to go to law school. Degas duly enrolled at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris in November 1853 but applied little effort to his studies.\nIn 1855, he met Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, whom he revered and whose advice he never forgot: \"Draw lines, young man, and still more lines, both from life and from memory, and you will become a good artist.\" In April of that year Degas was admitted to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. He studied drawing there with Louis Lamothe, under whose guidance he flourished, following the style of Ingres.\nIn July 1856, Degas traveled to Italy, where he would remain for the next three years. In 1858, while staying with his aunt's family in Naples, he made the first studies for his early masterpiece \"The Bellelli Family\". He also drew and painted numerous copies of works by Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and other Renaissance artists, but\u2014contrary to conventional practice\u2014he usually selected from an altarpiece a detail that had caught his attention: a secondary figure, or a head which he treated as a portrait.\nArtistic career.\nUpon his return to France in 1859, Degas moved into a Paris studio large enough to permit him to begin painting \"The Bellelli Family\"\u2014an imposing canvas he intended for exhibition in the Salon, although it remained unfinished until 1867. He also began work on several history paintings: \"Alexander and Bucephalus\" and \"The Daughter of Jephthah\" in 1859\u201360; \"S\u00e9miramis Building Babylon\" in 1860; and \"Young Spartans Exercising\" around 1860. In 1861, Degas visited his childhood friend Paul Valpin\u00e7on in M\u00e9nil-Hubert-en-Exmes, and made the earliest of his many studies of horses. He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1865, when the jury accepted his painting \"Scene of War in the Middle Ages\", which attracted little attention.\nAlthough he exhibited annually in the Salon during the next five years, he submitted no more history paintings, and his \"\" (Salon of 1866) signaled his growing commitment to contemporary subject matter. The change in his art was influenced primarily by the example of \u00c9douard Manet, whom Degas had met in 1864 (while both were copying the same Diego Vel\u00e1zquez portrait in the Louvre, according to a story that may be apocryphal).\nUpon the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Degas enlisted in the National Guard, where his partaking in the defense of Paris left him little time for painting. During rifle training his eyesight was found to be defective, and for the rest of his life his eye problems were a constant worry to him.\nAfter the war, Degas began in 1872 an extended stay in New Orleans, where his brother Ren\u00e9 and a number of other relatives lived. Staying at the home of his Creole uncle, Michel Musson, on Esplanade Avenue, Degas produced a number of works, many depicting family members. One of Degas's New Orleans works, \"A Cotton Office in New Orleans\", garnered favorable attention back in France, and was his only work purchased by a museum (the Pau) during his lifetime.\nDegas returned to Paris in 1873 and his father died the following year, whereupon Degas learned that his brother Ren\u00e9 had amassed enormous business debts. To preserve his family's reputation, Degas sold his house and an art collection he had inherited, and used the money to pay off his brother's debts. Dependent for the first time in his life on sales of his artwork for income, he produced much of his greatest work during the decade beginning in 1874. Disenchanted by now with the Salon, he instead joined a group of young artists who were organizing an independent exhibiting society. The group soon became known as the Impressionists.\nBetween 1874 and 1886, they mounted eight art shows, known as the Impressionist Exhibitions. Degas took a leading role in organizing the exhibitions, and showed his work in all but one of them, despite his persistent conflicts with others in the group. He had little in common with Monet and the other landscape painters in the group, whom he mocked for painting outdoors. Conservative in his social attitudes, he abhorred the scandal created by the exhibitions, as well as the publicity and advertising that his colleagues sought. He also deeply disliked being associated with the term \"Impressionist\", which the press had coined and popularized, and insisted on including non-Impressionist artists such as Jean-Louis Forain and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli in the group's exhibitions. The resulting rancor within the group contributed to its disbanding in 1886.\nAs his financial situation improved through sales of his own work, he was able to indulge his passion for collecting works by artists he admired: old masters such as El Greco and such contemporaries as Manet, Cassatt, Pissarro, C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and \u00c9douard Brandon. Three artists he idolized, Ingres, Delacroix, and Daumier, were especially well represented in his collection.\nIn the late 1880s, Degas also developed a passion for photography. He photographed many of his friends, often by lamplight, as in his double portrait of Renoir and Mallarm\u00e9. Other photographs, depicting dancers and nudes, were used for reference in some of Degas's drawings, and paintings.\nAs the years passed, Degas became isolated, due in part to his belief that a painter could have no personal life. The Dreyfus Affair controversy brought his anti-Semitic leanings to the fore and he broke with all his Jewish friends. His argumentative nature was deplored by Renoir, who said of him: \"What a creature he was, that Degas! All his friends had to leave him; I was one of the last to go, but even I couldn't stay till the end.\"\nAfter 1890, Degas's eyesight, which had long troubled him, deteriorated further. Although he is known to have been working in pastel as late as the end of 1907, and is believed to have continued making sculptures as late as 1910, he apparently ceased working in 1912, when the impending demolition of his longtime residence on the rue Victor Mass\u00e9 forced him to move to quarters on the Boulevard de Clichy. He never married, and spent the last years of his life, nearly blind, restlessly wandering the streets of Paris before dying in September 1917.\nArtistic style.\nDegas is often identified as an Impressionist, an understandable but insufficient description. Impressionism originated in the 1860s and 1870s and grew, in part, from the realism of painters such as Courbet and Corot. The Impressionists painted the realities of the world around them using bright, \"dazzling\" colors, concentrating primarily on the effects of light, and hoping to infuse their scenes with immediacy. They wanted to express their visual experience in that exact moment.\nTechnically, Degas differs from the Impressionists in that he continually belittled their practice of painting \"en plein air\".\nYou know what I think of people who work out in the open. If I were the government I would have a special brigade of gendarmes to keep an eye on artists who paint landscapes from nature. Oh, I don't mean to kill anyone; just a little dose of bird-shot now and then as a warning.\n\"He was often as anti-impressionist as the critics who reviewed the shows\", according to art historian Carol Armstrong; as Degas himself explained, \"no art was ever less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of reflection and of the study of the great masters; of inspiration, spontaneity, temperament, I know nothing.\" Nonetheless, he is described more accurately as an Impressionist than as a member of any other movement. His scenes of Parisian life, his off-center compositions, his experiments with color and form, and his friendship with several key Impressionist artists\u2014most notably Mary Cassatt and Manet\u2014all relate him intimately to the Impressionist movement.\nDegas's style reflects his deep respect for the old masters (he was an enthusiastic copyist well into middle age) and his great admiration for Ingres and Delacroix. He was also a collector of Japanese prints, whose compositional principles influenced his work, as did the vigorous realism of popular illustrators such as Daumier and Gavarni. Although famous for horses and dancers, Degas began with conventional historical paintings such as \"The Daughter of Jephthah\" (c.\u20091859\u201361) and \"Young Spartans Exercising\" (c.\u20091860\u201362), in which his gradual progress toward a less idealized treatment of the figure is already apparent. During his early career, Degas also painted portraits of individuals and groups; an example of the latter is \"The Bellelli Family\" (c.\u20091858\u201367), an ambitious and psychologically poignant portrayal of his aunt, her husband, and their children. In this painting, as in \"Young Spartans Exercising\" and many later works, Degas was drawn to the tensions present between men and women. In his early paintings, Degas already evidenced the mature style that he would later develop more fully by cropping subjects awkwardly and by choosing unusual viewpoints.\nBy the late 1860s, Degas had shifted from his initial forays into history painting to an original observation of contemporary life. Racecourse scenes provided an opportunity to depict horses and their riders in a modern context. He began to paint women at work, milliners and laundresses. His milliner series is interpreted as artistic self-reflection.\n\"Mlle. Fiocre in the Ballet La Source\", exhibited in the Salon of 1868, was his first major work to introduce a subject with which he would become especially identified, dancers. In many subsequent paintings, dancers were shown backstage or in rehearsal, emphasizing their status as professionals doing a job. From 1870 Degas increasingly painted ballet subjects, partly because they sold well and provided him with needed income after his brother's debts had left the family bankrupt. Degas began to paint caf\u00e9 life as well, in works such as and \"Singer with a Glove\". His paintings often hinted at narrative content in a way that was highly ambiguous; for example, \"Interior\" (which has also been called \"The Rape\") has presented a conundrum to art historians in search of a literary source\u2014\"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin\" has been suggested\u2014but it may be a depiction of prostitution.\nAs his subject matter changed, so, too, did Degas's technique. The dark palette that bore the influence of Dutch painting gave way to the use of vivid colors and bold brushstrokes. Paintings such as \"Place de la Concorde\" read as \"snapshots,\" freezing moments of time to portray them accurately, imparting a sense of movement. The lack of color in the 1874 \"Ballet Rehearsal on Stage\" and the 1876 \"The Ballet Instructor\" can be said to link with his interest in the new technique of photography. The changes to his palette, brushwork, and sense of composition all evidence the influence that both the Impressionist movement and modern photography, with its spontaneous images and off-kilter angles, had on his work.\nBlurring the distinction between portraiture and genre pieces, he painted his bassoonist friend, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dihau, in \"The Orchestra at the Opera\" (c. 1870) as one of fourteen musicians in an orchestra pit, viewed as though by a member of the audience. Above the musicians can be seen only the legs and tutus of the dancers onstage, their figures cropped by the edge of the painting. Art historian Charles Stuckey has compared the viewpoint to that of a distracted spectator at a ballet, and says that \"it is Degas' fascination with the depiction of movement, including the movement of a spectator's eyes as during a random glance, that is properly speaking 'Impressionist'.\"\nDegas's mature style is distinguished by conspicuously unfinished passages, even in otherwise tightly rendered paintings. He frequently blamed his eye troubles for his inability to finish, an explanation that met with some skepticism from colleagues and collectors who reasoned, as Stuckey explains, that \"his pictures could hardly have been executed by anyone with inadequate vision\". The artist provided another clue when he described his predilection \"to begin a hundred things and not finish one of them\", and was in any case notoriously reluctant to consider a painting complete.\nHis interest in portraiture led Degas to study carefully the ways in which a person's social stature or form of employment may be revealed by their physiognomy, posture, dress, and other attributes. In his 1879 \"Portraits, At the Stock Exchange\", he portrayed a group of Jewish businessmen with a hint of anti-Semitism. In 1881, he exhibited two pastels, \"Criminal Physiognomies\", that depicted juvenile gang members recently convicted of murder in the \"Abadie Affair\". Degas had attended their trial with sketchbook in hand, and his numerous drawings of the defendants reveal his interest in the atavistic features thought by some 19th-century scientists to be evidence of innate criminality. In his paintings of dancers and laundresses, he reveals their occupations not only by their dress and activities but also by their body type: his ballerinas exhibit an athletic physicality, while his laundresses are heavy and solid.\nBy the later 1870s, Degas had mastered not only the traditional medium of oil on canvas, but pastel as well. The dry medium, which he applied in complex layers and textures, enabled him more easily to reconcile his facility for line with a growing interest in expressive color.\nIn the mid-1870s, he also returned to the medium of etching, which he had neglected for ten years. At first he was guided in this by his old friend Ludovic-Napol\u00e9on Lepic, himself an innovator in its use, and began experimenting with lithography and monotype.\nHe produced some 300 monotypes over two periods, from the mid-1870s to the mid-1880s and again in the early 1890s.\nHe was especially fascinated by the effects produced by monotype and frequently reworked the printed images with pastel. By 1880, sculpture had become one more strand to Degas's continuing endeavor to explore different media, although the artist displayed only one sculpture publicly during his lifetime.\nThese changes in media engendered the paintings that Degas would produce in later life. Degas began to draw and paint women drying themselves with towels, combing their hair, and bathing (see: \"After the Bath, Woman drying herself\"). The strokes that model the form are scribbled more freely than before; backgrounds are simplified.\nThe meticulous naturalism of his youth gave way to an increasing abstraction of form. Except for his characteristically brilliant draftsmanship and obsession with the figure, the pictures created in this late period of his life bear little superficial resemblance to his early paintings. In point of fact, these paintings\u2014created late in his life and after the heyday of the Impressionist movement\u2014most vividly use the coloristic techniques of Impressionism.\nFor all the stylistic evolution, certain features of Degas's work remained the same throughout his life. He always painted indoors, preferring to work in his studio from memory, photographs, or live models. The figure remained his primary subject; his few landscapes were produced from memory or imagination. It was not unusual for him to repeat a subject many times, varying the composition or treatment. He was a deliberative artist whose works, as Andrew Forge has written, \"were prepared, calculated, practiced, developed in stages. They were made up of parts. The adjustment of each part to the whole, their linear arrangement, was the occasion for infinite reflection and experiment.\" Degas explained, \"In art, nothing should look like chance, not even movement\". He was most interested in the presentation of his paintings, patronizing Pierre Cluzel as a framer, and disliking ornate styles of the day, often insisting on his choices for the framing as a condition of purchase.\nSculpture.\nDegas's only showing of sculpture during his life took place in 1881 when he exhibited \"The Little Dancer of Fourteen Years\", which he had created using Marie van Goethem as a model. A nearly life-size wax figure with real hair and dressed in a cloth tutu, it provoked a strong reaction from critics, most of whom found its realism extraordinary but denounced the dancer as ugly. In a review, J.-K. Huysmans wrote: \"The terrible reality of this statuette evidently produces uneasiness in the spectators; all their notions about sculpture, about those cold inanimate whitenesses ... are here overturned. The fact is that with his first attempt Monsieur Degas has revolutionized the traditions of sculpture as he has long since shaken the conventions of painting.\"\nDegas created a substantial number of other sculptures during a span of four decades, but they remained unseen by the public until a posthumous exhibition in 1918. Neither \"The Little Dancer of Fourteen Years\" nor any of Degas's other sculptures were cast in bronze during the artist's lifetime. Degas scholars have agreed that the sculptures were not created as aids to painting, although the artist habitually explored ways of linking graphic art and oil painting, drawing and pastel, sculpture and photography. Degas assigned the same significance to sculpture as to drawing: \"Drawing is a way of thinking, modelling another\".\nAfter Degas's death, his heirs found in his studio 150 wax sculptures, many in disrepair. They consulted foundry owner Adrien H\u00e9brard, who concluded that 74 of the waxes could be cast in bronze. It is assumed that, except for the \"Little Dancer Aged Fourteen\", all Degas bronzes worldwide are cast from \"surmoulages\" (i.e., cast from bronze masters). A \"surmoulage\" bronze is a bit smaller, and shows less surface detail, than its original bronze mold. The H\u00e9brard Foundry cast the bronzes from 1919 until 1936, and closed down in 1937, shortly before H\u00e9brard's death.\nIn 2004, a little-known group of 73 plaster casts, more or less closely resembling Degas's original wax sculptures, was presented as having been discovered among the materials bought by the Airaindor Foundry (later known as Airaindor-Valsuani) from H\u00e9brard's descendants. Bronzes cast from these plasters were issued between 2004 and 2016 by Airaindor-Valsuani in editions inconsistently marked and thus of unknown size. There has been substantial controversy concerning the authenticity of these plasters as well as the circumstances and date of their creation as proposed by their promoters. While several museum and academic professionals accept them as presented, most of the recognized Degas scholars have declined to comment.\nPersonality and politics.\nDegas, who believed that \"the artist must live alone, and his private life must remain unknown\", lived an outwardly uneventful life. In company he was known for his wit, which could often be cruel. He was characterized as an \"old curmudgeon\" by the novelist George Moore, and he deliberately cultivated his reputation as a misanthropic bachelor.\nIn the 1870s, Degas gravitated towards the republican circles of L\u00e9on Gambetta. However, his republicanism did not come untainted, and signs of the prejudice and irritability which would overtake him in old age were occasionally manifested. He fired a model upon learning she was Protestant. Although Degas painted a number of Jewish subjects from 1865 to 1870, his 1879 painting \"Portraits at the Stock Exchange\" may be a watershed in his political opinions. The painting is a portrait of the Jewish banker Ernest May\u2014who may have commissioned the work and was its first owner\u2014and is widely regarded as anti-Semitic by modern experts. The facial features of the banker in profile have been directly compared to those in the anti-Semitic cartoons rampant in Paris at the time, while those of the background characters have drawn comparisons to Degas' earlier work \"Criminal Physiognomies\".\nThe Dreyfus Affair, which divided opinion in Paris from the 1890s to the early 1900s, intensified his anti-Semitism. By the mid-1890s, he had broken off relations with all of his Jewish friends, publicly disavowed his previous friendships with Jewish artists, and refused to use models who he believed might be Jewish. He remained an outspoken anti-Semite and member of the anti-Semitic \"Anti-Dreyfusards\" until his death.\nReputation.\nDuring his life, public reception of Degas's work ranged from admiration to contempt. As a promising artist in the conventional mode, Degas had a number of paintings accepted in the Salon between 1865 and 1870. These works received praise from Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and the critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary. He soon joined forces with the Impressionists, however, and rejected the rigid rules and judgments of the Salon.\nDegas's work was controversial, but was generally admired for its draftsmanship. His \"La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans\", or \"Little Dancer of Fourteen Years\", which he displayed at the sixth Impressionist exhibition in 1881, was probably his most controversial piece; some critics decried what they thought its \"appalling ugliness\" while others saw in it a \"blossoming\". In part Degas' originality consisted in disregarding the smooth, full surfaces and contours of classical sculpture\u00a0... [and] in garnishing his little statue with real hair and clothing made to scale like the accoutrements for a doll. These relatively \"real\" additions heightened the illusion, but they also posed searching questions, such as what can be referred to as \"real\" when art is concerned. The suite of pastels depicting nudes that Degas exhibited in the eighth Impressionist Exhibition in 1886 produced \"the most concentrated body of critical writing on the artist during his lifetime ... The overall reaction was positive and laudatory\".\nRecognized as an important artist in his lifetime, Degas is now considered \"one of the founders of Impressionism\". Though his work crossed many stylistic boundaries, his involvement with the other major figures of Impressionism and their exhibitions, his dynamic paintings and sketches of everyday life and activities, and his bold color experiments, served to finally tie him to the Impressionist movement as one of its greatest artists.\nAlthough Degas had no formal pupils, he greatly influenced several important painters, most notably Jean-Louis Forain, Mary Cassatt, and Walter Sickert; his greatest admirer may have been Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.\nDegas's paintings, pastels, drawings, and sculptures are on prominent display in many museums, and have been the subject of many museum exhibitions and retrospectives. Recent exhibitions include \"Degas: Drawings and Sketchbooks\" (The Morgan Library, 2010); \"Picasso Looks at Degas\" (Museu Picasso de Barcelona, 2010); \"Degas and the Nude\" (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 2011); \"Degas' Method\" (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, 2013); \"Degas's Little Dancer\" (National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., 2014); \"Degas: A passion for perfection\" (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 2017\u20132018); and \"Manet / Degas\" at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and then the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2023 and into 2024.\nRelationship with Mary Cassatt.\nIn 1877, Degas invited Mary Cassatt to exhibit in the third Impressionist exhibition. He had admired a portrait (\"Ida\") she exhibited in the Salon of 1874, and the two formed a friendship. They had much in common: they shared similar tastes in art and literature, came from affluent backgrounds, had studied painting in Italy, and both were independent, never marrying. Both regarded themselves as figure painters, and the art historian George Shackelford suggests they were influenced by the art critic Louis Edmond Duranty's appeal in his pamphlet \"The New Painting\" for a revitalization in figure painting: \"Let us take leave of the stylized human body, which is treated like a vase. What we need is the characteristic modern person in his clothes, in the midst of his social surroundings, at home or out in the street.\"\nAfter Cassatt's parents and sister Lydia joined Cassatt in Paris in 1877, Degas, Cassatt, and Lydia were often to be seen at the Louvre studying artworks together. Degas produced two prints, notable for their technical innovation, depicting Cassatt at the Louvre looking at artworks while Lydia reads a guidebook. These were destined for a prints journal planned by Degas (together with Camille Pissarro and others), which never came to fruition. Cassatt frequently posed for Degas, notably for his millinery series trying on hats.\nDegas introduced Cassatt to pastel and engraving, while for her part Cassatt was instrumental in helping Degas sell his paintings and promoting his reputation in the United States. Cassatt and Degas worked most closely together in the fall and winter of 1879\u201380 when Cassatt was mastering her printmaking technique. Degas owned a small printing press, and by day she worked at his studio using his tools and press. However, in April 1880, Degas abruptly withdrew from the prints journal they had been collaborating on, and without his support the project folded. Although they continued to visit each other until Degas' death in 1917, she never again worked with him as closely as she had over the prints journal.\nAround 1884, Degas made a portrait in oils of Cassatt, \"Mary Cassatt Seated, Holding Cards\". Stephanie Strasnick suggests that the cards are probably \"cartes de visite\", used by artists and dealers at the time to document their work. Cassatt thought it represented her as \"a repugnant person\" and later sold it, writing to her dealer Paul Durand-Ruel in 1912 or 1913 that \"I would not want it known that I posed for it.\"\nDegas was forthright in his views, as was Cassatt. They clashed over the Dreyfus affair. Cassatt later expressed satisfaction at the irony of Lousine Havermeyer's 1915 joint exhibition of hers and Degas' work being held in aid of women's suffrage, equally capable of affectionately repeating Degas' antifemale comments as being estranged by them (when viewing her \"Two Women Picking Fruit\" for the first time, he had commented \"No woman has the right to draw like that\").\nIn 2014, the National Gallery of Art examined their long friendship in its exhibit \"Degas/Cassatt\". The catalog was written by Kimberly Jones \nRelationship with Suzanne Valadon.\nDegas was a friend and admirer of Suzanne Valadon. He was the first person to purchase her art, and he taught her soft-ground etching.\nHe wrote her several letters, most asking her to come see him with her drawings. For example, in an undated letter he said in response to one of her letters to him (translated from French):\nEvery year I see this handwriting, drawn like a saw, arriving, terrible Maria. But I never see the author arrive with a box (of drawings) under her arm. And yet I am getting very old. Happy new year.R. W. Meek's historical fiction novel, \"The Dream Collector: Sabrine &amp; Sigmund Freud\", imagines Edgar Degas's friendship with Suzanne Valadon.\nLegacy with \u00c9douard Manet.\nIn 2023, The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York exhibited a two-person exhibition of Degas and Manet.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the chairman of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, the Free State's cabinet. The President was appointed by the Governor-General, upon the nomination of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (the lower house of the Oireachtas of parliament) and had to enjoy the confidence of the D\u00e1il to remain in office. The office was succeeded by that of Taoiseach, though subsequent Taoisigh are numbered from the first President of the Executive Council.\nAppointment.\nThe President of the Executive Council was nominated by the D\u00e1il from among its members and then formally appointed by the Governor-General, though the Governor-General was bound by constitutional convention to honour the D\u00e1il's choice.\nOn paper, executive authority was vested in the Governor-General, with the Executive Council empowered to \"aid and advise\" him. However, it also stipulated that the Governor-General could only exercise his powers in accordance with constitutional practice established in Canada. Thus, the Governor-General was required to exercise his powers on the advice of the Executive Council, making its President the Free State's \"de facto\" political leader.\nOnce he had appointed the President, the Governor-General appointed the remaining members of the Executive Council on the President's nomination. The President had the freedom to choose any Vice-President (deputy prime minister) he wished from among the members of the D\u00e1il, but the remainder of the Council had to be approved by a vote of consent in the D\u00e1il before they could assume office. If he ceased to \"retain the support of a majority in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann,\" the President, along with his ministerial colleagues, was obliged to resign, but could continue to serve as acting President until the appointment of a successor.\nThe method of appointment of the President of the Executive Council was through a commission of the Monarch or Governor-General, either the leader of the party with a majority of seats in the D\u00e1il, if no party commanded an absolute majority, whichever leader he believed would be best able to avoid a vote of no confidence.\nPowers.\nThe office of the President of the Executive Council was less powerful than either its modern equivalent, the office of Taoiseach, or the offices of most modern prime ministers in countries with a parliamentary system of government. In particular, the powers of the President were subject to two important limitations:\nThe result of these restrictions was, according to Brian Farrell, that the President of the Executive Council was closer to being the Council's chairman or presiding officer, than its dominant leader. Nonetheless a strong president could exercise authority beyond the limits laid down in the 1922 constitution. The President's weak position arose from the fact that the status of his office was modelled on that of the prime minister of the United Kingdom before 1918. Until 1918, the British Prime Minister's powers had been theoretically quite limited and, as a member of the cabinet, the office-holder was regarded strictly as . Under Prime Minister David Lloyd George, however, from 1918 onwards, the powers of the office increased, as Lloyd George unilaterally arrogated to himself a number of powers that had previously belonged to the Cabinet collectively, including, most significantly, the right to seek a parliamentary dissolution.\nIn 1931, the Statute of Westminster 1931 removed nearly all of the UK Parliament's authority to legislate for the Irish Free State, which effectively gave it \"de jure\" independence. Soon after the Statute's passage, the Free State sought, and was granted, the right to have an Irish minister formally advise the King in the exercise of his powers and functions in the Irish Free State, to the exclusion of British ministers. This gave the President of the Executive Council the right to advise the king in his capacity as His Majesty's Irish prime minister.\nHistory.\nThe office of President of the Executive Council came into being on 6 December 1922 with the establishment of the Irish Free State, replacing the previous offices of President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and chairman of the Provisional Government. Only two individuals held the office of President of the Executive Council during its existence: W. T. Cosgrave, until 1932, and \u00c9amon de Valera thereafter. Under a constitutional amendment passed in 1936 and legislation passed in 1937 the office of Governor-General was abolished, with most of his powers being transferred to the Executive Council. At the same time, the President of the Executive Council ceased to be formally appointed by the Governor-General, thenceforth simply being elected by the D\u00e1il.\nThe Irish Free State was reconstituted as 'Ireland' on 29 December 1937, when the present-day Constitution of Ireland came into effect. The new Constitution abolished the office of President of the Executive Council, replacing it with that of Taoiseach, literally meaning \"Chieftain\" or \"Leader\", although in Article 13 of the Constitution, the holder of the office is described as \"the head of the Government or Prime Minister\". The Taoiseach occupies a more powerful position than the President of the Executive Council did and has authority both to dismiss ministers individually and to request a dissolution of the D\u00e1il on his own initiative.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is regarded as the greatest male dancer of the early 20th century. He is often associated with the Ballets Russes and its impresario Sergei Diaghilev, for which he choreographed such influential ballets as \"L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (1912), \"Le Sacre du Printemps\" (1913), \"Jeux\" (1913), and \"Till Eulenspiegel\" (1916). He was celebrated for his virtuosity and for the depth and intensity of his characterizations. He could dance \"en pointe\", a rare skill among male dancers at the time, and was admired for his seemingly gravity-defying leaps.\nBiography.\nVaslav Nijinsky was born in 1889 or 1890 in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), as Wac\u0142aw Ni\u017cy\u0144ski, to ethnic Polish parents, touring dancers Tomasz Ni\u017cy\u0144ski (born 7 March 1862) and Eleonora Bereda (born 28 December 1856). Nijinsky was christened in Warsaw. He identified himself as Polish although he grew up in the interior of Russia with his parents and he had difficulty speaking Polish.\nEleanora, along with her two brothers and two sisters, was orphaned while still a child. She started to earn a living as an extra in Warsaw's Grand Theatre Ballet (Polish: \"Teatr Wielki\"), becoming a full member of the company at age thirteen. In 1868 her talent was spotted and she moved to Kiev as a solo dancer. Tomasz Ni\u017cy\u0144ski also attended the Wielki Theatre school, becoming a soloist there. At age 18 he accepted a soloist contract with the Odessa Theatre. The two met, married in May 1884 and settled into a career with the traveling Setov opera company. Tomasz was \"premier danseur\", and Eleanora a soloist. Eleanora continued to tour and dance while having three children, sons Stanislav (born 29 December 1886 in Tiflis) and Vaslav; and daughter Bronislava ('Bronia', born 8 January 1891 in Minsk). She had depression, which may have been a genetic vulnerability shared in a different form by her son Vaslav. Both boys received training from their father and appeared in an amateur \"Hopak\" production in Odessa in 1894.\nAfter Josef Setov died about 1894, the company disbanded. Thomas attempted to run his own company, but was not successful. He and his family became itinerant dancers, the children appearing in the Christmas show at Nizhny Novgorod. In 1897 Thomas and Eleanora separated after Thomas had fallen in love with another dancer, Rumiantseva, while touring in Finland. Eleanora moved to 20 Mokhovaya Street in St Petersburg with her children. She persuaded a friend from the Wielki Theatre, Victor Stanislas Gillert, who was at the time teaching at the Imperial Ballet School, to help get Vaslav into the school. He arranged for the noted teacher Enrico Cecchetti to sponsor the application. Bronia entered the school two years after Vaslav. Their elder brother Stanislav had had a fall from a window when young and seemed to have suffered some brain damage. Vaslav and Bronia, just two years apart, became very close as they grew. As he got older, Stanislav became increasingly mentally unstable and would have fierce tantrums. He was admitted to an asylum for the insane in 1902.\nImperial Ballet School.\nIn 1900, Nijinsky joined the Imperial Ballet School, where he initially studied dance under Sergei Legat and his brother Nikolai. He studied mime under Pavel Gerdt; all three men were principal dancers at the Imperial Russian Ballet. At the end of the one year probationary period, his teachers agreed upon Nijinsky's exceptional dancing ability and he was confirmed as a boarder at the school. He appeared in supporting parts in classical ballets such as \"Faust\", as a mouse in \"The Nutcracker\", a page in \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Swan Lake\", and won the Didelot scholarship. During his first year, his academic studies had covered work he had already done, so his relatively poor results had not been so much noted. He did well in subjects which interested him, but not otherwise.\nIn 1902 he was warned that only the excellence of his dancing had prevented his expulsion from the school for poor results. This laxity was compounded through his school years by Nijinsky's frequently being chosen as an extra in various productions, forcing him to be away from classrooms for rehearsals and to spend nights at performances. He was teased for being Polish, and nicknamed \"Japonczek\" for his faintly Japanese looks at a time Russia was at war with Japan. Some classmates were envious and resented his outstanding dancing ability. In 1901 one of the class deliberately caused him to fall, leading to his concussion and being in a coma for four days.\nMikhail Oboukhov became his teacher in 1902, and awarded him the highest grade he had ever given to a student. He was given student parts in command performances in front of the Tsar of \"Paquita\", \"The Nutcracker\" and \"The Little Humpbacked Horse\". In music he studied piano, flute, balalaika and accordion, receiving good marks. He had a good ability to hear and play music on the piano, though his sight reading was relatively poor. Against this, his behaviour was sometimes boisterous and wild, resulting in his expulsion from the school in 1903 for an incident involving students shooting at the hats of passers-by with catapults while being driven to the Mariinsky Theatre in carriages. He was readmitted to the school as a non-resident after a sound beating and restored to his previous position after a month's probation.\nIn 1904, at the age of 14, Nijinsky was selected by the great choreographer Marius Petipa to dance a principal role in what proved to be the choreographer's last ballet, \"La Romance d'un Bouton de rose et d'un Papillon\". The work was never performed due to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War.\nOn Sunday, 9 January 1905, Nijinsky was caught in the Bloody Sunday massacre in St. Petersburg, where a group of petitioners led by Father Gapon attempted to present their petition to the Czar. Soldiers fired upon the crowd, leading to an estimated 1000 casualties. Nijinsky was caught in the crowd on Nevsky Prospect and propelled toward the Winter Palace. Imperial cavalry troops charged the crowd, leaving him with a head wound. The following day, he returned to the scene with a friend whose sister was missing. She was never found.\nNijinsky became calmer and more serious as he grew older, but continued to struggle to make friends, something which would persist throughout his life. His reserve and apparent dullness made him unappealing to others except when he danced.\nThe 1905 annual student show included a pas de deux from \"The Persian Market\", danced by Nijinsky and Sofia Fedorova. Oboukhov amended the dance to show off Nijinsky's abilities, drawing gasps and then spontaneous applause in the middle of the performance with his first jump.\nIn 1906, he danced in the Mariinsky production of Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\", in a ballet sequence choreographed by Michel Fokine. He was congratulated by the director of the Imperial Ballet and offered a place in the company although he was a year from graduation. Nijinsky chose to continue his studies. He tried his hand at choreography, with a children's opera, \"Cinderella\", with music by another student, Boris Asafyev. At Christmas, he played the King of the Mice in \"The Nutcracker\". At his graduation performance in April 1907, he partnered Elizaveta Gerdt, in a pas de deux choreographed by Fokine. He was congratulated by \"prima ballerina\" Mathilde Kschessinska of the Imperial Ballet, who invited him to partner her. His future career with the Imperial Ballet was guaranteed to begin at the mid-rank level of coryph\u00e9e, rather than in the corps de ballet. He graduated second in his class, with top marks in dancing, art and music.\nEarly career.\nNijinsky spent his summer after graduation rehearsing and then performing at Krasnoe Selo in a makeshift theatre with an audience mainly of army officers. These performances frequently included members of the Imperial family and other nobility, whose support and interest were essential to a career. Each dancer who performed before the Tsar received a gold watch inscribed with the Imperial Eagle. Buoyed by Nijinsky's salary, his new earnings from giving dance classes, and his sister Bronia's employment with the ballet company, the family moved to a larger flat on Torgovaya Ulitsa. The new season at the Mariinsky theatre began in September 1907, with Nijinsky employed as coryph\u00e9e (instead of in the corps de ballet) on a salary of 780 roubles per year.\nHe appeared with Sedova, Lydia Kyasht and Karsavina. Kchessinska partnered him in \"La fille mal gard\u00e9e\", where he succeeded in an atypical role for him involving humour and flirtation. Designer Alexandre Benois proposed a ballet based upon \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\", choreographed by Fokine to music by Nikolai Tcherepnin. Nijinsky had a minor role, but it allowed him to show off his technical abilities with leaps and pirouettes. The partnership of Fokine, Benois and Nijinsky was repeated throughout his career. Shortly after, he upstaged his own performance, appearing in the \"Bluebird\" pas de deux from the \"Sleeping Beauty\", partnering Lydia Kyasht. The Mariinsky audience was deeply familiar with the piece, but exploded with enthusiasm for his performance and his appearing to fly, an effect he continued to have on audiences with the piece during his career.\nIn subsequent years, Nijinsky was given several soloist roles at the Mariinsky. In 1910, Mathilde Kschessinska selected Nijinsky to dance in a revival of Petipa's \"Le Talisman\". Nijinsky created a sensation in the role of the Wind God Vayou.\nBallets Russes.\nA turning point for Nijinsky was his meeting the Russian Sergei Diaghilev, a celebrated and highly innovative producer of ballet and opera, as well as art exhibitions. He concentrated on promoting Russian visual and musical art abroad, particularly in Paris. The 1908 season of colorful Russian ballets and operas, works mostly new to the West, was a great success, leading him to plan a new tour for 1909 with a new name for his company, the now famous Ballets Russes. He worked closely with choreographer Michel Fokine and artist L\u00e9on Bakst, and later with other contemporary artists and composers. Nijinsky and Diaghilev became lovers for a time, and Diaghilev was deeply involved in directing and managing Nijinsky's career. Nijinsky became the company's star male dancer, causing an enormous stir amongst audiences whenever he performed. In ordinary life, he appeared unremarkable and was withdrawn in conversation. At the same time, the Ballets Russes gave Nijinsky the chance to expand his art and experiment with dance and choreography; he created new directions for male dancers while becoming internationally famous.\n1909 opening season.\nDuring the winter of 1908/9, Diaghilev started planning for the 1909 Paris tour of opera and ballet. He collected a team including designers Alexandre Benois and L\u00e9on Bakst, painters Nicholas Roerich and Konstantin Korovin, composers Alexander Glazunov and Nikolai Tcherepnin, regisseurs and Alexander Sanine and other ballet enthusiasts. As a friend and as a leading dancer, Nijinsky was part of the group. His sister wrote that he felt intimidated by the illustrious and aristocratic company. Fokine was asked to start rehearsals for the existing \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\" and for \"Les Sylphides\", an expanded version of his \"Chopiniana\". Fokine favoured expanding the existing \"Une Nuit d'Egypte\" for a ballet.\nDiaghilev accepted the idea of an Egyptian theme, but he required a comprehensive rewrite based on new music, by which Fokine created a new ballet \"Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre\". To round out the program, they needed another ballet. Without sufficient time to compose a new work, they decided on a suite of popular dances, to be called \"Le Festin\". Anna Pavlova, Karsavina and Nijinsky were chosen as principal dancers. Fokine insisted that Ida Rubenstein would appear as Cleopatra, and Nijinsky insisted that his sister should have a part. Fokine noted Nijinsky's great ability at learning a dance and precisely what a choreographer wanted. Diaghilev departed for Paris in early 1909 to make arrangements, which were immediately complicated on the day of his return, 22 February 1909, by the death of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, who had sponsored an application by Diaghilev for an imperial subsidy of 100,000 roubles for the tour.\nRehearsals started on 2 April at the Hermitage Theatre, which the company had been granted special permission to use, along with loans of scenery. No sooner had rehearsals started that the permission was withdrawn, disappearing as had the imperial subsidy. Diaghilev managed to raise some money in Russia, but he had to rely significantly on Gabriel Astruc, who had been arranging theatres and publicity on behalf of the company in France, to also provide finance. Plans to include Opera had to be dropped because of the lack of finances, and logistical difficulties in obtaining necessary scenery at short notice and for free.\nDiaghilev and Nijinsky travelled to Paris ahead of the rest of the company. Initially Nijinsky stayed at the H\u00f4tel Daunou. He moved to the H\u00f4tel de Hollande together with Diaghilev and his secretary, Alexis Mavrine, before the arrival of the others. Members of the company had noticed Diaghilev keeping a particularly proprietorial eye on Nijinsky during rehearsals in Russia. They took the travel arrangements and accommodation as confirmation of a relationship. Prince Lvov had visited Nijinsky's mother in St Petersburg, telling her tearfully that he would no longer be taking a special interest in her son, but he advanced a significant sum to Diaghilev towards the tour's expenses. Mavrine was known to have been Diaghilev's lover, but left the tour together with Olga Pedorova shortly after it had begun.\nThe season of colorful Russian ballets and operas, works mostly new to the West, was a great success. The Paris seasons of the Ballets Russes were an artistic and social sensation; setting trends in art, dance, music and fashion for the next decade. Nijinsky's unique talent showed in Fokine's pieces such as \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\" (music by Nikolai Tcherepnin); \"Cleopatra\" (music by Anton Arensky and other Russian composers) and a divertissement \"La F\u00eate\". His expressive execution of a pas de deux from \"The Sleeping Beauty\" (Tchaikovsky) was a tremendous success.\nLater seasons.\nIn 1910, he performed in \"Giselle\", and Fokine's ballets \"Carnaval\" and \"Scheherazade\" (based on the orchestral suite by Rimsky-Korsakov). His portrayal of \"Petrushka,\" the puppet with a soul, was a remarkable display of his expressive ability to portray characters. His partnership with Tamara Karsavina, also of the Mariinsky Theatre, was legendary, and they have been called the \"most exemplary artists of the time\".\nIn January 1911 he danced in \"Giselle\" at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg for the Imperial Ballet, with the Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna in attendance. His costume, which had been designed by Benois and used in Paris before, caused a scandal, as he danced in tights without the then-common trousers. He refused to apologize and was dismissed from the Imperial Ballet. It is possible that he was not altogether unhappy about this development, as he was now free to concentrate on the Ballets Russes.\nBallets choreographed by Nijinsky.\nNijinsky took the creative reins and choreographed ballets which pushed boundaries and stirred controversy. His ballets were \"L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (\"The Afternoon of a Faun\", based on Claude Debussy's \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\") (1912); \"Jeux\" (1913); and \"Till Eulenspiegel\" (1916). These introduced his audiences to the new direction of modern dance. As the title character in \"L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\", in the final tableau, he mimed masturbation with the scarf of a nymph, causing a scandal; he was defended by such artists as Auguste Rodin, Odilon Redon and Marcel Proust. Nijinsky's new trends in dance caused a riotous reaction at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es when they premiered in Paris.\nIn \"The Rite of Spring\" (\"Le Sacre du Printemps\"), with music by Igor Stravinsky (1913), Nijinsky created choreography that exceeded the limits of traditional ballet and propriety. The radically angular movements expressed the heart of Stravinsky's radically modern score. Violence broke out in the audience as \"The Rite of Spring\" premiered. The theme of the ballet, based on pagan myths, was a young maiden who sacrificed herself by dancing until she died. The theme, the difficult and challenging music of Stravinsky, and Nijinsky's choreography, led to a violent uproar; Diaghilev was pleased with the notoriety. That same year, Nijinsky conceived \"Jeux\" as a flirtatious interaction among three males, although Diaghilev insisted it be danced by one male and two females.\nMarriage.\nNijinsky's work in choreographing ballets had proved controversial. They were time-consuming to rehearse and badly received by critics. Diaghilev asked him to begin preparing a new ballet, \"La L\u00e9gende de Joseph\", based on the Bible. Aside from Nijinsky's difficulties, Diaghilev came under pressure from financial backers and theatre owners who wanted productions more in the style of previous successful work. Although Diaghilev had become unhappy with Fokine's work, thinking he had lost his originality, he returned to him for two new ballets, including \"Joseph\". Relations between Diaghilev and Nijinsky had deteriorated under the stress of Nijinsky's becoming principal choreographer and his pivotal role in the company's financial success. Diaghilev could not face Nijinsky to tell him personally that he would no longer be choreographing the ballet \"Joseph\", but instead asked his sister Bronia Nijinska to deliver the bad news.\nThe company was to embark on a tour of South America in August 1913. Nijinska, who had always worked closely with her brother and supported him, could not accompany the tour because she had married in July 1912 and become pregnant. In October 1912 their father had died while on tour with his dance company, causing another stress for the siblings. Diaghilev did not accompany the South American tour, claiming he had been told that he would die on the ocean. Others have suggested the reason had more to do with wanting to spend time away from Nijinsky and enjoy a holiday in Venice, \"where perhaps adventures with pretty dark-eyed boys awaited him\". Nijinsky set sail on a 21-day sea voyage in a state of turmoil and without the people who had been his closest advisers in recent years.\nThe tour party included Romola de Pulszky, whose father Count Charles Pulszky was a Hungarian politician, and mother Emilia M\u00e1rkus was a noted actress. In March 1912 the recently engaged Romola was taken to see the Ballets Russes in Budapest by her prospective mother-in-law and was greatly impressed. Nijinsky had not been performing, but she returned the following day and saw him: \"An electric shock passed through the entire audience. Intoxicated, entranced, gasping for breath, we followed this superhuman being... the power, the featherweight lightness, the steel-like strength, the suppleness of his movements...\" Romola broke off her engagement and began following the Ballets Russes across Europe, attending every performance she could. Nijinsky was difficult to approach, being always accompanied by a 'minder'. However, Romola befriended Adolf Bolm, who had previously visited her mother, thereby gaining access to the company and backstage. She and Nijinsky shared no common language; she spoke French but he knew only a little, so many of their early conversations involved an interpreter. When first introduced to her, he gained the impression she was a Hungarian prima ballerina and was friendly. Discovering his mistake, he ignored her thereafter.\nRomola did not give up. She persuaded Diaghilev that her amorous interests lay with Bolm, that she was rich and interested in supporting ballet. He allowed her to take ballet lessons with Enrico Cecchetti, who accompanied the troupe coaching the dancers. Nijinsky objected to her taking class with the professionals. Cecchetti warned her against becoming involved with Nijinsky (describing him as \"like a sun that pours forth light but never warms\"), but Diaghilev's endorsement meant that Nijinsky paid her some attention. Romola took every opportunity to be near Nijinsky, booking train compartments or cabins close to his. She was likely warned that he was homosexual by Marie Rambert, whom Romola befriended and who was also in love with Nijinsky. As a devout Catholic, she prayed for his conversion to heterosexuality. She referred to him as \"Le Petit\", and wanted to have his child.\nOn board ship, Romola had a cabin in first class, which allowed her to keep a watch on Nijinsky's door, while most of the company were exiled to second class. She befriended his masseur and was rewarded with a rundown on his musculature. Determined to take every opportunity, she succeeded in spending more and more time in his company. The unexpected friendliness was noticed by Baron de Gunsbourg, an investor in the Ballets Russes, who had been tasked with keeping an eye on the company. Instead of reporting to Diaghilev on what was occurring, Gunsbourg agreed to act on Nijinsky's behalf in presenting a proposal of marriage to Romola. Romola thought a cruel joke was being played on her, and ran off to her cabin crying. However, Nijinsky asked her again, in broken French and mime, and she accepted. Although Gunsbourg had a financial interest in Ballets Russes, he was also interested in forming his own company, and a split between Diaghilev and his star dancer might have presented him with an opportunity.\nWhen the ship stopped at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the couple went straight to buy wedding rings. Adolph Bolm warned Romola against proceeding, saying \"It will ruin your life\". Gunsbourg hurried to arrange the marriage, getting permission by telegram from Romola's mother. A quick wedding could take place once the ship arrived at Buenos Aires, Argentina; the couple were married on 10 September 1913 and the event was announced to the world's press. Back in Europe, Diaghilev \"gave himself to a wild orgy of dissipation...Sobbing shamelessly in Russian despair, he bellowed accusations and recriminations; he cursed Nijinsky's ingratitude, Romola's treachery, and his own stupidity\".\nAs the company was due to start performing immediately, the couple had no honeymoon. A few days after the marriage, Nijinsky tried to teach Romola some ballet, but she was not interested. \"I asked her to learn dancing because for me dancing was the highest thing in the world\", \"I realized that I had made a mistake, but the mistake was irreparable. I had put myself in the hands of someone who did not love me.\" Romola and Nijinsky did not share accommodations until after the season was safely underway, when she was eventually invited to join him in separate bedrooms in his hotel suite. She \"almost cried with thankfulness\" that he showed no interest in making love on their wedding night. Still, the couple had two daughters together, Kyra and Tamara Nijinska.\nDismissal from Ballets Russes.\nOn returning to Paris, Nijinsky anticipated returning to work on new ballets, but Diaghilev did not meet him. Eventually he sent a telegram to Nijinsky informing him that he was no longer employed by the Ballets Russes. Nijinsky had missed a performance in Rio when Romola was ill, and only in the case of a dancer's own illness, certified by a doctor, was the dancer allowed to miss a performance. Diaghilev also usually dismissed dancers who married. This was perhaps beside the point, since Nijinsky had never had a contract, nor wages, all his expenses having been paid by Diaghilev. His mother also received an allowance of 500 francs per month (other senior dancers had received 200,000 francs for a six-month season). Fokine was re-employed by Diaghilev as choreographer and premier danseur, accepting on the condition that none of Nijinsky's ballets would be performed. Leonide Massine joined the company as the new attractive young lead for \"Joseph\".\nThe Ballets Russes had lost its most famous and crowd-pulling dancer, but Nijinsky's position was even more difficult. He appears not to have appreciated that his marriage would result in a break with Diaghilev's company, although many others immediately expected this would be the result. The Ballets Russes and the Imperial Russian ballet were the pre-eminent ballet companies in the world and uniquely had permanent companies of dancers staging full-scale new productions. Nijinsky now was \"an experimental artist. He needed roles that would extend his gifts, and above all, he needed to choreograph. For these things he did need the Ballets Russes, which at that time was the only forward-thinking ballet company in the world.\"\nNot only had Nijinsky previously left the Imperial ballet on doubtful terms, but he had not been granted exemption from compulsory military service in Russia, something that was normally given to its dancers. He could find only two offers, one a position with the Paris Opera, which would not start for more than a year; the other to take a ballet company to London for eight weeks to perform as part of a mixed bill at the Palace Theatre. Anna Pavlova sent him a caustic telegram, reminding him that he had disapproved some years before when she had appeared there in vaudeville. On another occasion, he had told a reporter, \"One thing I am determined not to do, and that is to go on the music-hall stage.\"\nBronia was still in St Petersburg following the birth of her child, and Nijinsky asked her to be part of his new company. She was glad to do so, being concerned at how well he could cope without his customary supporters. When she arrived, there was friction between her and Romola: Bronia was critical that the new central figure in her brother's life showed so little organisational ability; Romola resented the closeness between brother and sister both in their shared language and in ability to work together in dance. The final company had only three experienced dancers: Nijinsky and Bronia plus her husband. Scenery was late, Fokine refused to allow the use of his ballets, there was inadequate time to rehearse, and Nijinsky became \"more and more nervous and distraught\". Diaghilev came to the opening night in March 1914.\nThe audience divided between those who had never seen ballet, who objected to the delays necessary for scene changes, and those who had seen Nijinsky before, who generally felt something was lacking (\"He no longer danced like a god\"). On another night, when the orchestra played music during the scene change so as to calm the audience, Nijinsky, having expressly banned this, flew into a rage and was discovered half dressed and screaming in his dressing room. He had to be calmed down enough to perform. He jumped on a stagehand who had flirted with Romola (\"I had never seen Vaslav like that\"). A new program was to be performed for the third week, but a packed house had to be told that Nijinsky was ill with a high temperature and could not perform. He missed three days, and the management had had enough. The show was cancelled, and Nijinsky was left with a considerable financial loss. Newspapers reported a nervous breakdown. His physical vulnerability had been aggravated by the great stress.\nLater life.\nRomola was pregnant, so the couple returned to Budapest, Austro-Hungary, to his mother-in-law Emilia Markus' house. Their daughter Kyra was born on 19 June 1914. With the start of the Great War (World War I), Nijinsky was classified as an enemy Russian citizen. He was confined to house arrest in Budapest and could not leave the country. The war made problems for the Ballets Russes too; the company had difficulty recruiting dancers and Fokine returned to Russia.\nDiaghilev started negotiations in October 1914 for Nijinsky to work again for the company, but could not obtain release of the dancer until 1916. The complex negotiations included a prisoner exchange with the United States, and agreement that Nijinsky would dance and choreograph for the Ballets Russes' tour. King Alfonso XIII of Spain, Queen Alexandra of Denmark, Dowager Russian Empress Marie Feodorovna, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, Pope Benedict XV and President Wilson at the urging of Otto Kahn all interceded on his behalf.\nNijinsky arrived in New York on 4 April 1916. The tour had already started in January with a number of problems: \"Faun\" was considered too sexually explicit and had to be amended; \"Scheherazade\", including an interracial orgy, did not appeal to Americans; and ballet aficionados were calling for Nijinsky. Romola took over negotiations, demanding that Diaghilev pay Nijinsky for the years he had been unpaid by the Ballets Russes before he would dance in New York. This was settled after another week's delay by a down payment of $13,000 against the $90,000 claimed, plus a fee of $1000 for each performance in America.\nNegotiations with Otto Kahn of the New York Metropolitan Opera led to an additional tour of the US being agreed to for the autumn. Kahn did not get on with Diaghilev and insisted Nijinsky should manage the tour. Massine and Diaghilev returned to Europe, leaving Nijinsky to dance and manage a company of more than 100 for a salary of $60,000. Nijinsky was also to prepare two new ballets. Rehearsals for \"Till Eulenspiegel\" did not go well; Nijinsky's poor communication skills meant that he could not explain to dancers what he wanted. He would explode into rages. Pierre Monteux, the conductor, refused to take part in performances because he did not want to be associated with failure. Nijinsky twisted his ankle, postponing the season's opening for a week and his own appearance by two weeks. Rehearsals for \"Eulenspiegel\" had not been completed, and it had to be improvised during its first performance. It was still well received, and Nijinsky's performance in \"Faun \" was considered better than Massine's. As the tour progressed, Nijinsky's performances received steady acclaim, although his management was haphazard and contributed to the tour's loss of $250,000.\nHis last professional public performance was during a South American tour, with pianist Arthur Rubinstein in a benefit in Montevideo for the Red Cross on 30 September 1917, at age twenty-eight. Rubinstein wept when he saw Nijinsky's confusion that night. It was around this time that signs of his schizophrenia had become apparent to members of the company, including Bourman. Nijinsky and his wife moved to St. Moritz, Switzerland, where he tried to recover from the stresses of the tour. Also in 1917, Bronia and Vaslav lost their older brother Stanislav, who died in a hospital in Petrograd. Accounts vary as to the cause of death. He had been institutionalized for many years.\nOn Sunday, 19 January 1919, Vaslav Nijinsky made one last public appearance: a solo improvised performance at the Suvretta House in St Moritz. The crowd consisted of skiers, hotel guests, wealthy visitors from abroad, war refugees, and assorted social climbers. Bertha Asseo, a family friend, played the piano. Vaslav stood still for a good while before he finally started moving. His dance reflected a wide range of feelings, from sadness and anger to joyfulness. His strong feelings towards the devastation of the war, and people who did nothing to stop it, were also reflected in his dance.\nNijinsky's diary, which he wrote from January to early March 1919, expressed his great fear of hospitalization and confinement. He filled it with drawings of eyes, as he felt himself under scrutiny, by his wife, a young doctor Frenkel, and others. Finally, Romola arranged a consultation in Zurich with the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1919, asking her mother and stepfather for help in getting Nijinsky there. His fears were realized; he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and committed to Burgh\u00f6lzli. After a few days, he was transferred to the Bellevue Sanatorium in Kreuzlingen, \"a luxurious and humane establishment directed at that time by Ludwig Binswanger.\" In 1920, Nijinsky's second daughter Tamara was born. She never saw him dance in public.\nFor the next 30 years, Nijinsky was in and out of psychiatric hospitals and asylums. During 1945, after the end of the war, after Romola had moved with him to Vienna, he encountered a group of Russian soldiers in an encampment, playing traditional folk tunes on a balalaika and other instruments. Inspired by the music and hearing a language from his youth, he started dancing, astounding the men with his skills. Drinking and laughing with them helped him start to speak again. He had maintained long periods of almost absolute silence during his years of illness. His wife Romola had protected them by staying for a time at the border of Hungary and Austria, trying to keep out of major areas of fighting.\nFrom 1947, Nijinsky lived in Virginia Water, Surrey, England, with his wife. He died from kidney failure at a clinic in London on 8 April 1950 and was buried in London. In 1953, his body was moved to Montmartre Cemetery in Paris and reinterred beside the graves of Ga\u00e9tan Vestris, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, and Emma Livry.\nLegacy.\nNijinsky's daughter Kyra married the Ukrainian conductor Igor Markevitch, and they had a son named Vaslav. The marriage ended in divorce.\nHis second daughter Tamara Nijinsky grew up with her maternal grandmother, never getting to see her father dance. Later she served as executive director of the Vaslav &amp; Romola Nijinsky Foundation, founded by her mother, to preserve art and writing associated with her parents, and her father's dances.\nNijinsky's \"Diary\" was written during the six weeks in 1919 he spent in Switzerland before being committed to the asylum to Zurich. It reflected the decline of his household into chaos. He elevated feeling and action in his writing. It combined elements of autobiography with appeals for compassion toward the less fortunate.\nDiscovering the three notebooks of the diary years later, plus another with letters to a variety of people, his wife published a bowdlerized version of the diary in 1936, translated into English by Jennifer Mattingly. She deleted about 40 per cent of the diary, especially references to bodily functions, sex, and homosexuality, recasting Nijinsky as an \"involuntary homosexual\". She also removed some of his more unflattering references to her and others close to their household. She moved sections around, obscuring the \"march of events\" obvious in the original version and toning down some of the odder portions, including trying to distinguish between sections in which he writes as God and others as himself. (In the original all such sections are written the same.)\nIn 1995, the first unexpurgated edition of \"The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky\" was published, edited by \"The New Yorker\" dance critic Joan Acocella and translated by Kyril FitzLyon. Acocella notes that the diary displays three elements common to schizophrenia: \"delusions, disorganized language, and disorganized behavior.\" It also demonstrates that Nijinsky's thought was showing a \"breakdown in selective attention;\" his associations would connect in ever-widening circles. A \"New York Times\" review said, \"How ironic that in erasing the real ugliness of his insanity, the old version silenced not only Nijinsky's true voice but the magnificently gifted body from which it came. And how fortunate we are to have them both restored.\"\nJill Rivers, The Australian Ballet's media director from 1988 to 1998, stayed with Nijinsky's daughter Tamara and her daughter Kinga Nijinsky Gaspers in Phoenix, Arizona, in the early 2000s to research a biography on Nijinsky. She also interviewed Vaslav Markevitch, Nijinsky's grandson, in Tuscany. Twenty years later, after Tamara and Markevitch had died, and spurred by The Australian Ballet's revival of John Neumeier ballet \"Vaslav\" in 2025, Rivers published \"The Genius of Nijinsky\".\nNijinsky is immortalized in numerous still photographs, many of them by E. O. Hopp\u00e9, who photographed the Ballets Russes seasons in London extensively between 1909 and 1921. No film exists of Nijinsky dancing; Diaghilev never allowed the Ballets Russes to be filmed because he felt that the quality of film at the time could never capture the artistry of his dancers. He believed that the reputation of the company would suffer if people saw their performance only in the short, jerky films of the period.\nCultural depictions.\nIn fine arts.\nOn 11 June 2011, Poland's first sculpture of the Polish/Russian dancers Vaslav Nijinsky and his sister Bronislava Nijinska was unveiled in the Teatr Wielki's foyer. It portrays them in their roles as the Faun and the Nymph from the ballet \"L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\". Commissioned by the Polish National Ballet, the sculpture was made in bronze by the well-known Ukrainian sculptor Giennadij Jerszow. Nijinsky was also portrayed by Auguste Rodin. It was cast posthumously in 1912.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It ended in March 1839 with a British-brokered peace. The intervention followed many claims by French nationals of losses due to unrest in Mexico. This was the first of two French invasions of Mexico; a second, larger intervention would take place in the 1860s.\nBackground.\nDuring the early years of the new Mexican republic there was widespread civil disorder as factions competed for control of the country. The fighting often resulted in the destruction or looting of private property. Average citizens had few options for claiming compensation as they had no representatives to speak on their behalf. Foreigners whose property was damaged or destroyed by rioters or bandits were usually also unable to obtain compensation from the Mexican government and they began to appeal to their own governments for help and compensation.\nCommercial relationships between France and Mexico existed prior to Spain's recognition of Mexico's independence in 1830, and after the establishment of diplomatic relationships France rapidly became Mexico's third largest trade partner. French goods were subject to higher taxes as France had yet to secure trade agreements similar to those which had been established by the United States and United Kingdom, Mexico's two largest trade partners.\nChronology.\nIn a complaint to King Louis-Philippe, a French pastry chef known only as Monsieur Remontel said that in 1832 Mexican officers looted his shop in Tacubaya (then a town on the outskirts of Mexico City). Mexican sources said that the officers, from Santa Anna's government, simply refused to pay their bills. Remontel demanded 60,000 pesos as reparations for the damage (his shop was valued at less than 1,000 pesos).\nIn view of Remontel's complaint (which gave its name to the ensuing conflict) and of other complaints from French nationals (among them the looting in 1828 of French shops at the Parian market and the execution in 1837 of a French citizen accused of piracy), in 1838 prime minister Louis-Mathieu Mol\u00e9 demanded from Mexico the payment of 600,000 pesos (3 million Francs) in damages.\nWhen President Anastasio Bustamante made no payment, the French king ordered a fleet under Rear Admiral Charles Baudin to declare and carry out a blockade of all Mexican ports on the Gulf of Mexico from Yucat\u00e1n to the Rio Grande, to bombard the Mexican fortress of San Juan de Ul\u00faa, and to seize the city of Veracruz, which was the most important port on the Gulf coast. French forces captured Veracruz by December 1838 and Mexico declared war on France.\nWith trade cut off, the Mexicans began smuggling imports in Mexico via Corpus Christi (then part of the Republic of Texas). Fearing that France would blockade the Republic's ports as well, a battalion of Texan forces began patrolling Corpus Christi Bay to stop Mexican smugglers. One smuggling party abandoned their cargo of about a hundred barrels of flour on the beach at the mouth of the bay, thus giving Flour Bluff its name. The United States soon sent the schooner \"Woodbury\" to help the French in their blockade.\nMeanwhile, acting without explicit government authority, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, known for his military leadership, came out of retirement from his hacienda named \"Manga de Clavo\" near Xalapa and surveyed the defenses of Veracruz. He offered his services to the government, which ordered him to fight the French by any means necessary. He led Mexican forces against the French and fought at the Battle of Veracruz in 1838. In a skirmish with the rear guard of the French, Santa Anna was wounded in the leg by French grapeshot. His leg was amputated and buried with full military honors. Exploiting his wounds with propaganda, Santa Anna returned back to power.\nPeace restored.\nThe French forces withdrew on 9 March 1839 after a peace treaty was signed. As part of the treaty, the Mexican government agreed to pay 600,000 pesos as damages to French citizens, while France received promises for future trade commitments in place of war indemnities. The damages were never paid, and this fact was later used as one of the justifications for the second French intervention in Mexico of 1861.\nFollowing the Mexican victory in 1867 and the collapse of the Second French Empire in 1870, Mexico and France would not resume diplomatic relationships until 1880 when both countries renounced claims related to the wars.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In his early works he created a personal form of cubism (known as \"tubism\") which he gradually modified into a more figurative, populist style. His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter has caused him to be regarded as a forerunner of pop art.\nBiography.\nL\u00e9ger was born in Argentan, Orne, Lower Normandy, where his father raised cattle. Fernand L\u00e9ger initially trained as an architect from 1897 to 1899, before moving in 1900 to Paris, where he supported himself as an architectural draftsman. After military service in Versailles, Yvelines, in 1902\u20131903, he enrolled at the School of Decorative Arts after his application to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts was rejected. He nevertheless attended the Beaux-Arts as a non-enrolled student, spending what he described as \"three empty and useless years\" studying with G\u00e9r\u00f4me and others, while also studying at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. He began to work seriously as a painter only at the age of 25. At this point his work showed the influence of impressionism, as seen in \"Le Jardin de ma m\u00e8re\" (My Mother's Garden) of 1905, one of the few paintings from this period that he did not later destroy. A new emphasis on drawing and geometry appeared in L\u00e9ger's work after he saw the C\u00e9zanne retrospective at the Salon d'Automne in 1907.\n1909\u20131914.\nIn 1909, he moved to Montparnasse and met Alexander Archipenko, Jacques Lipchitz, Marc Chagall, Joseph Csaky and Robert Delaunay.\nIn 1910, he exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in the same room (salle VIII) as Jean Metzinger and Henri Le Fauconnier. In his major painting of this period, \"Nudes in the Forest\", L\u00e9ger displays a personal form of Cubism that his critics termed \"Tubism\" for its emphasis on cylindrical forms.\nIn 1911, the hanging committee of the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants placed together the painters identified as 'Cubists'. Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay and L\u00e9ger were responsible for revealing Cubism to the general public for the first time as an organized group.\nThe following year he again exhibited at the Salon d'Automne and Ind\u00e9pendants with the Cubists, and joined with several artists, including Le Fauconnier, Metzinger, Gleizes, Francis Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp to form the Puteaux Group\u2014also called the \"Section d'Or\" (The Golden Section).\nL\u00e9ger's paintings, from then until 1914, became increasingly abstract. Their tubular, conical, and cubed forms are laconically rendered in rough patches of primary colors plus green, black and white, as seen in the series of paintings with the title \"Contrasting Forms\". L\u00e9ger made no use of the collage technique pioneered by Braque and Picasso.\n1914\u20131920.\nL\u00e9ger's experiences in World War I had a significant effect on his work. Mobilized in August 1914 for service in the French Army, he spent two years at the front in Argonne. He produced many sketches of artillery pieces, airplanes, and fellow soldiers while in the trenches, and painted \"Soldier with a Pipe\" (1916) while on furlough. In September 1916, he almost died after a mustard gas attack by the German troops at Verdun. During a period of convalescence in Villepinte he painted \"The Card Players\" (1917), a canvas whose robot-like, monstrous figures reflect his experience of the war. As he explained:\n...I was stunned by the sight of the breech of a 75 millimeter in the sunlight. It was the magic of light on the white metal. That's all it took for me to forget the abstract art of 1912\u20131913. The crudeness, variety, humor, and downright perfection of certain men around me, their precise sense of utilitarian reality and its application in the midst of the life-and-death drama we were in ... made me want to paint in slang with all its color and mobility.\nThis work marked the beginning of his \"mechanical period\", during which the figures and objects he painted were characterized by sleekly rendered tubular and machine-like forms. Starting in 1918, he also produced the first paintings in the \"Disk\" series, in which disks suggestive of traffic lights figure prominently. In December 1919 he married Jeanne-Augustine Lohy, and in 1920 he met Le Corbusier, who would remain a lifelong friend.\n1920s.\nThe \"mechanical\" works L\u00e9ger painted in the 1920s, in their formal clarity as well as in their subject matter\u2014the mother and child, the female nude, figures in an ordered landscape\u2014are typical of the postwar \"return to order\" in the arts, and link him to the tradition of French figurative painting represented by Poussin and Corot. In his \"paysages anim\u00e9s\" (animated landscapes) of 1921, figures and animals exist harmoniously in landscapes made up of streamlined forms. The frontal compositions, firm contours, and smoothly blended colors of these paintings frequently recall the works of Henri Rousseau, an artist L\u00e9ger greatly admired and whom he had met in 1909.\nThey also share traits with the work of Le Corbusier and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant who together had founded Purism, a style intended as a rational, mathematically based corrective to the impulsiveness of cubism. Combining the classical with the modern, L\u00e9ger's \"Nude on a Red Background\" (1927) depicts a monumental, expressionless woman, machinelike in form and color. His still life compositions from this period are dominated by stable, interlocking rectangular formations in vertical and horizontal orientation. \"The Siphon\" of 1924, a still life based on an advertisement in the popular press for the aperitif Campari, represents the high-water mark of the Purist aesthetic in L\u00e9ger's work. Its balanced composition and fluted shapes suggestive of classical columns are brought together with a quasi-cinematic close-up of a hand holding a bottle.\nAs an enthusiast of the modern, L\u00e9ger was greatly attracted to cinema, and for a time he considered giving up painting for filmmaking. In 1923\u201324 he designed the set for the laboratory scene in Marcel L'Herbier's \"L'Inhumaine\" (The Inhuman One). In 1924, in collaboration with and George Antheil and Man Ray, L\u00e9ger and the filmmaker Dudley Murphy co-produced and co-directed the iconic and Futurism-influenced film \"Ballet M\u00e9canique\" (Mechanical Ballet). Neither abstract nor narrative, it is a series of images of a woman's lips and teeth, close-up shots of ordinary objects, and repeated images of human activities and machines in rhythmic movement.\nIn collaboration with Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant he established the Acad\u00e9mie Moderne, a free school where he taught from 1924, with Alexandra Exter and Marie Laurencin. He produced the first of his \"mural paintings\", influenced by Le Corbusier's theories, in 1925. Intended to be incorporated into polychrome architecture, they are among his most abstract paintings, featuring flat areas of color that appear to advance or recede.\n1930s.\nStarting in 1927, the character of L\u00e9ger's work gradually changed as organic and irregular forms assumed greater importance. The figural style that emerged in the 1930s is fully displayed in the \"Two Sisters\" of 1935, and in several versions of \"Adam and Eve\". With characteristic humor, he portrayed Adam in a striped bathing suit, or sporting a tattoo.\nIn 1931, L\u00e9ger made his first visit to the United States, where he traveled to New York City and Chicago. In 1935, the Museum of Modern Art in New York presented an exhibition of his work. In 1938, L\u00e9ger was commissioned to decorate Nelson Rockefeller's apartment.\n1940s.\nDuring World War II L\u00e9ger lived in the United States. He taught at Yale University, and found inspiration for a new series of paintings in the novel sight of industrial refuse in the landscape. The shock of juxtaposed natural forms and mechanical elements, the \"tons of abandoned machines with flowers cropping up from within, and birds perching on top of them\" exemplified what he called the \"law of contrast\". His enthusiasm for such contrasts resulted in such works as \"The Tree in the Ladder\" of 1943\u201344, and \"Romantic Landscape\" of 1946. Reprising a composition of 1930, he painted \"Three Musicians\" (Museum of Modern Art, New York) in 1944. Reminiscent of Rousseau in its folk-like character, the painting exploits the law of contrasts in its juxtaposition of the three men and their instruments.\nDuring his American sojourn, L\u00e9ger began making paintings in which freely arranged bands of color are juxtaposed with figures and objects outlined in black. L\u00e9ger credited the neon lights of New York City as the source of this innovation: \"I was struck by the neon advertisements flashing all over Broadway. You are there, you talk to someone, and all of a sudden he turns blue. Then the color fades\u2014another one comes and turns him red or yellow.\"\nUpon his return to France in 1945, he joined the Communist Party. During this period his work became less abstract, and he produced many monumental figure compositions depicting scenes of popular life featuring acrobats, builders, divers, and country outings. Art historian Charlotta Kotik has written that L\u00e9ger's \"determination to depict the common man, as well as to create for him, was a result of socialist theories widespread among the avant-garde both before and after World War II. However, L\u00e9ger's social conscience was not that of a fierce Marxist, but of a passionate humanist\". His varied projects included book illustrations, murals, stained-glass windows, mosaics, polychrome ceramic sculptures, and set and costume designs.\n1950s.\nAfter the death of Leger's wife Jeanne-Augustine Lohy in 1950, L\u00e9ger married Nadia Khodossevitch in 1952. In his final years he lectured in Bern, designed mosaics and stained-glass windows for the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, Venezuela, and painted \"Country Outing\", \"The Camper\", and the series \"The Big Parade\". In 1954 he began a project for a mosaic for the S\u00e3o Paulo Opera, which he would not live to finish. Fernand L\u00e9ger died suddenly at his home in 1955 and is buried in Gif-sur-Yvette, Essonne.\nLegacy.\nL\u00e9ger wrote in 1945 that \"the \"object\" in modern painting must become the \"main character\" and overthrow the subject. If, in turn, the human form becomes an object, it can considerably liberate possibilities for the modern artist.\" He elaborated on this idea in his 1949 essay, \"How I Conceive the Human Figure\", where he wrote that \"abstract art came as a complete revelation, and then we were able to consider the human figure as a plastic value, not as a sentimental value. That is why the human figure has remained willfully inexpressive throughout the evolution of my work\". As the first painter to take as his idiom the imagery of the machine age, and to make the objects of consumer society the subjects of his paintings, L\u00e9ger has been called a progenitor of Pop Art.\nHe was active as a teacher for many years, first at the Acad\u00e9mie Vassilieff in Paris, then in 1931 at the Sorbonne, and then developing his own \"Acad\u00e9mie Fernand L\u00e9ger\", which was in Paris, then at the Yale School of Art and Architecture (1938\u20131939), Mills College Art Gallery in Oakland, California during 1940\u20131945, before he returned to France. Among his many international pupils were Paul Crotto, Nadir Afonso, Paul Georges, Charlotte Gilbertson, Hananiah Harari, Asger Jorn, Michael Loew, Beverly Pepper, Victor Reinganum, Marcel Mouly, Ren\u00e9 Margotton, Saloua Raouda Choucair and Charlotte Wankel, Peter Agostini, Lou Albert-Lasard, Tarsila do Amaral, Arie Aroch, Alma del Banco, Christian Berg, Louise Bourgeois, Marcelle Cahn, Norman Carton, Otto Gustaf Carlsund, Saloua Raouda Choucair, Robert Colescott, Lars Englund, Tsuguharu Foujita, Sam Francis, Serge Gainsbourg, Hans Hartung, Florence Henri, William Klein, Maryan, George Lovett Kingsland Morris, Marlow Moss, Aur\u00e9lie Nemours, Gerhard Neumann, Jules Olitski, Erik Olson, Richard Stankiewicz, Theo Stavropoulos, and Stasys Usinskas.\nIn 1952, a pair of L\u00e9ger murals was installed in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations headquarters in New York City.\nIn 1960, the Fernand L\u00e9ger Museum was opened in Biot, Alpes-Maritimes, France.\nL\u00e9ger bequeathed his residence (at 108 Avenue du General Leclerc, Gif sur Yvette, Paris) to the French Communist Party, which later hosted negotiations of the Paris Peace Accords between the United States, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of South Vietnam\nIn May 2008, his painting \"\u00c9tude pour la femme en bleu\" (1912\u201313) sold for $39,241,000 (hammer price with buyer's premium) United States dollars.\nIn August 2008, one of L\u00e9ger's paintings owned by Wellesley College's Davis Museum and Cultural Center, \"Mother and Child\", was reported missing. It is believed to have disappeared some time between April 9, 2007, and November 19, 2007. A$100,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to the safe return of the painting.\nL\u00e9ger's work was featured in the exhibition \"L\u00e9ger: Modern Art and the Metropolis\" from October 14, 2013, through January 5, 2014, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nIn 2022, it was announced that a lost painting of the rooftop series was discovered on the opposite side of the painting \"Bastille Day\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cosgrave", "text": "Head of government of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1932\nWilliam Thomas Cosgrave (5 June 1880 \u2013 16 November 1965) was an Irish politician who served as the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1932, Leader of the Opposition from 1932 to 1944, Leader of Fine Gael from 1934 to 1944, founder and leader of Cumann na nGaedheal, from 1923 to 1933, Chairman of the Provisional Government from August 1922 to December 1922, the President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann from September 1922 to December 1922, the Minister for Finance from 1922 to 1923 and Minister for Local Government from 1919 to 1922. He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1921 to 1944. He was also a Member of parliament (MP) for the Kilkenny North constituency from 1918 to 1922.\nHis son, Liam, served as Taoiseach from 1973 to 1977.\nEarly and private life.\nWilliam Thomas Cosgrave was born at 174 James's Street, Dublin in 1880, to Thomas Cosgrave, grocer, and Bridget (Nixon) Cosgrave. He was educated at the Christian Brothers School at Malahide Road, Marino, before entering his father's publican business. Cosgrave first became politically active when he attended the first Sinn F\u00e9in convention in 1905.\nHe was a Sinn F\u00e9in councillor on Dublin Corporation from 1909 until 1922 and joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913, although he never joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood because he didn't believe in secret societies.\nHe played an active role in the Easter Rising of 1916, serving under \u00c9amonn Ceannt as a Captain at the South Dublin Union. Following the rebellion, Cosgrave was sentenced to death, but that was later commuted to penal servitude for life and he was interned at Frongoch internment camp, Wales. While imprisoned, he won a seat for Sinn F\u00e9in in the Kilkenny City by-election of August 1917. After his victory, he made a speech on the courthouse balcony. In September 1917, he and Michael Collins addressed a crowd in Dunboyne, County Meath, urging people to join the Irish Volunteers.\nCosgrave again won an Irish seat at the 1918 general election, this time for Kilkenny North. Although he and many other Sinn F\u00e9in MPs were still in prison at the time, 27 free Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, in accordance with their party's manifesto, refused to go to Westminster and instead formed the First D\u00e1il, in which Cosgrave took his seat after he was released from prison in 1919. On 24 June 1919, he married Louisa Flanagan (28 August 1882 \u2013 1959) in Dublin, daughter of Alderman Michael Flanagan, a nationalist councillor on Dublin Corporation between 1884 and 1919. During his later years, Cosgrave was cared for by his son and daughter-in-law, Liam and Vera.\nPolitical career.\nMinister for local government.\nAlthough Cosgrave was one of the most politically experienced of Sinn F\u00e9in's TDs, Cosgrave was not within the leadership of the party. However, when \u00c9amon de Valera formed the Second Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 2 April 1919, Cosgrave was named as Secretary of Local Government. His close friendship with de Valera and his long experience on Dublin Corporation, most recently as chairman of its finance committee, were among the reasons he was selected. His chief task as Minister was the job of organising the non-cooperation of the people with the British authorities and establishing an alternative system of government.\nAfter the 1920 local elections, elected under the new system of single transferable vote, 28 of the 33 local councils pledged loyalty to the Ministry of Local Government established by the D\u00e1il. These councils then cut their links to the British government.\nAnglo-Irish Treaty.\nCosgrave supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which had been signed on 6 December 1921. At the cabinet meeting in Dublin held to consider the Treaty immediately after it had been signed, Cosgrave surprised de Valera by agreeing with Collins and with Arthur Griffith, de Valera's predecessor as leader of Sinn F\u00e9in and the chairman of the delegation which included Collins that had negotiated the Treaty. It was narrowly supported by the cabinet in a vote of 4 to 3, and was supported by the D\u00e1il in a vote of 64 to 57. However, de Valera voted against and resigned as president in January 1922 (which in August 1921 had been upgraded from a prime ministerial President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to a full head of state, called President of the Irish Republic). Griffith succeeded de Valera as president. Collins, following the Treaty, formed a Provisional Government; this included Cosgrave amongst its membership as Minister for Local Government. From July onward, he also became Minister for Finance.\nChairman of the Provisional Government.\nThe months following the acceptance of the Treaty saw a gradual progression to civil war. The split in Sinn F\u00e9in gradually deepened, and hardened against accepting anything less than a full republic. Collins and de Valera tried desperately to find a middle course and formed a pact whereby Sinn F\u00e9in fought a general election in June with a common slate of candidates. Despite this pact, the electorate voted heavily in favour of pro-Treaty candidates. On the day of the election, the draft Constitution of the Irish Free State was published; it was rejected by the Anti-Treatyites, for it was not a republican document. Collins, forced to a decision, opted to maintain the Treaty position and the support of the British government, and moved to suppress the Republican opposition that had seized the Four Courts in Dublin. The Civil War began on 28 June 1922, and the IRA was decisively defeated in the field over the following two months, being largely pinned back to Munster. In August 1922, both Griffith and Collins died in quick succession; the former of natural causes, the latter a few days later when ambushed by Republicans at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th, County Cork. With de Valera now on the fringes as the nominal leader of the anti-Treaty forces in the Civil War, the new dominion (which was in the process of being created but which would not legally come into being until December 1922) had lost all its most senior figures.\nThough it had the option of going for General Richard Mulcahy, Collins' successor as Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, the pro-Treaty leadership opted for Cosgrave, in part due to his democratic credentials as a long-time politician. Having previously held the Local Government and Finance portfolios, Cosgrave became Chairman of the Provisional Government on 30 August and President of D\u00e1il \u00c9irean on 9 September. He served in both offices simultaneously until 6 December 1922, when the Irish Free State came into being.\nPresident of the Executive Council (1922\u20131932).\nOn 6 December 1922, Cosgrave was elected by the D\u00e1il as president of the executive council. He formed the First Executive Council of the Irish Free State. Cosgrave was a small, quiet man, and at 42 was the oldest member of the Cabinet. He had not sought the leadership of the new country, but once it was his he made good use of it. One of his chief priorities was to hold the new country together and to prove that the Irish could govern themselves. \nDomestic policy.\nAs head of the Free State government during the Civil War, he was ruthless in what he saw as the defence of the state against his Republican former comrades. Although he disagreed with the use of the death penalty in principle, in October 1922, he enacted a Public Safety Bill, after difficult debates, and following the offer of an amnesty, that allowed for the execution of anyone who was captured bearing arms against the state, or aiding armed attacks on state forces. He told the D\u00e1il on 27 September 1922: \"Although I have always objected to the death penalty, there is no other way that I know of in which ordered conditions can be restored in this country, or any security obtained for our troops, or to give our troops any confidence in us as a government\". His view was that if harsh action were not taken, a guerrilla war could drag on indefinitely, making the achievement of law and order and establishing the Free State impossible.\nHis army ordered courts martial on the rebels, 77 of whom were executed by firing squads by May 1923, including Erskine Childers, Liam Mellowes and Rory O'Connor, far more than the 14 IRA volunteers the British executed in the War of Independence. The Republican side, for their part, attacked pro-Treaty politicians and their homes and families. Cosgrave's family home was burned down by anti-Treaty fighters, and one of his uncles was shot dead. (see also Destruction of country houses in the Irish revolutionary period and Executions during the Irish Civil War).\nCosgrave said \"I am not going to hesitate if the country is to live, and if we have to exterminate ten thousand Republicans, the three million of our people is greater than this ten thousand\".\nIn April 1923, the pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in members organised a new political party called Cumann na nGaedheal with Cosgrave as leader. The following month the Civil War was brought to an end when the remaining anti-Treaty IRA guerrillas announced a ceasefire and dumped their arms.\nOne of his first acts in government was to pass a Bill for the Constitution of the Irish Free State, which some TDs felt did not need to be in writing. This was done by October 1922, ahead of the establishment of the Irish Free State in December.\nIn the first few years in office, Cosgrave's government faced several problems. The government attempted to reduce the size of the National Army. During the Civil War, it had grown to over 55,000 men which, now that the war was over, was far too large and costly to maintain. Some army officers challenged the authority of the government to cut the size of the Army. The officers, mostly Pro-Treaty IRA men, were angry that the government was not doing enough to help create a republic and predicted massive unemployment. \nWhen he and his position were challenged by the disgruntled Army officers of the Irish Republican Army Organisation, other politicians and soldiers took the important decisions.\nIn March 1924, more layoffs were expected, and army officers Major-General Liam Tobin and Colonel Charles Dalton sent an ultimatum to the government demanding an end to the demobilisation. Minister for Justice Kevin O'Higgins, who was also acting president for Cosgrave while the latter was in hospital, moved to resolve the so-called \"Army Mutiny\". Richard Mulcahy, the Minister for Defence, resigned, and O'Higgins was victorious in a very public power struggle within Cumann na nGaedheal. The crisis within the army was solved but the government was divided.\nIn 1924, the British and Irish governments agreed to attend a Boundary Commission to redraw the border which partitioned Ireland between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. The Free State's representative was Minister for Education Eoin MacNeill, a respected scholar. The Free State expected to gain much territory in heavily Catholic and republican parts of Counties Londonderry, Fermanagh, Tyrone, and Armagh, for the British government had indicated during the Treaty negotiations that the wishes of the nationalist inhabitants along the border would be taken into account. However, after months of secret negotiations, a newspaper reported that there would be little change to the border, and the Free State would lose territory in County Donegal. MacNeill resigned from the Commission and, shortly afterwards, from the government for not reporting to Cosgrave on the details of the commission. Cosgrave immediately went to London for a meeting with the British Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, where they agreed to let the border remain as it was, and in return, the Free State did not have to pay its pro-rata share of the Imperial debt. In the D\u00e1il debate on 7 December, Cosgrave stated: \"I had only one figure in my mind and that was a huge nought. That was the figure I strove to get, and I got it.\"\nCosgrave turned down a plea for asylum in Ireland for Leon Trotsky while in exile. The request was made by the trade union leader William O'Brien in 1930. Cosgrave recorded that he: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Told [O'Brien] \"I could see no reason why Trotsky should be considered by us. Russian bonds had been practically confiscated. He said there was to be consideration of them. I said it was not by Trotsky, whose policy was the reverse. I asked his nationality. Reply Jew. They were against religion (he said that was modified). I said not by Trotsky. He said he had hoped there would be an asylum here as in England for all. I agreed that under normal conditions, which we had not here, that would be alright. But we had no touch with this man or his Government, nor did they interest themselves in us in his 'day'.\nIn June 1927, a general election was held in which de Valera's new party, Fianna F\u00e1il, won many seats on an abstentionist platform. In July the Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins, was assassinated on his way home from Sunday Mass by the IRA. The government passed the Electoral Amendment Bill (1927) to force Fianna F\u00e1il to take their seats in the D\u00e1il. This proved successful with de Valera and his party entering the D\u00e1il in August of that year. Previously, without de Valera, Cosgrave faced very little opposition, giving him considerable freedom of action. However, de Valera's arrival significantly altered the situation. \nForeign policy.\nAlthough Cosgrave and his government accepted dominion status for the Irish Free State, they did not trust the British to respect this new independence. The government embarked on fairly radical foreign initiatives. In 1923 the Irish Free State became a member of the League of Nations. The new state also became the first British Commonwealth country to have a separate or non-British representative in Washington, D.C., and exchanged diplomats with many other European nations. In January 1926, Cosgrave was honoured by Pope Pius XI by making him the first Irishman to receive the rank of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Pope Pius IX.\nThe Anglo-Irish Treaty itself also gave the Irish much more independence than many other dominions. The Oath of Allegiance in the Irish Free State was much less monarchist than its equivalent in Canada or Australia. The king's representative in Ireland was Irish, unlike the other dominions, and although the head of state was the king, power was derived from the Irish people and not him. There were also questions raised about the word \"treaty\". The British claimed it was an internal affair while the Irish saw it as an international agreement between two independent states, a point which was accepted by the League of Nations when that body registered the Treaty as an international agreement in 1924.\nEven with these advances, the Irish Free State legally remained subject to the United Kingdom until 1931, when the Statute of Westminster gave the Free State and the other dominions the right to the full independence of legislative and constitutional action. This step effectively granted the Free State internationally recognised independence. While the state was still partitioned, it arguably fulfilled Collins' vision of the Treaty giving the Irish people \"the freedom to achieve freedom.\" Shortly after the Statute passed, Cosgrave sought and received the right to have an Irish minister advise the king on matters related to the Free State to the exclusion of British ministers. This allowed the President of the Executive Council to directly advise the King in his capacity as His Majesty's Irish Prime Minister.\nEconomic policy.\nDuring the ten years that Cosgrave and Cumann na nGaedheal were in power, they adopted a conservative economic policy. Taxation was kept as low as possible and the budget was balanced to avoid borrowing. The Irish currency remained linked to the British currency, resulting in the overvaluation of the Irish pound. Free trade was advocated as opposed to protection, but moderate tariffs were introduced on some items.\nThe new government decided to concentrate on developing agriculture while doing little to help the industrial sector. Agriculture responded well with stricter quality control being introduced and the passing of a Land Act to help farmers buy their farms. Also, the Irish Sugar Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation were established to encourage growth. However, the economic depression that hit in the 1930s soon undid the good work of Cosgrave and his ministers. Industry was seen as secondary to agriculture and little was done to improve it. The loss of the industrialised north-east of Ireland had a bad effect on the country as a whole. However, the Electricity Supply Board, with the first national grid in Europe, was established to provide employment and electricity to the new state.\nGeneral election 1932.\nA general election was not required by law until the end of 1932. However, Cosgrave called one for February of that year. There was growing unrest in the country and a fresh mandate was needed for an important Commonwealth meeting in the summer. Another reason for calling the election early was the Eucharistic Congress to be held in June, a major national and international event.\nCosgrave, like most of his cabinet a devout Catholic, had invested much time in the build-up to it and wished it to proceed without any tension from a pending general election. In the event, \u00c9amon de Valera and Fianna F\u00e1il were the ones to derive all the kudos from that event. Cumann na nGaedheal fought the election on its record of providing ten years of honest government and political and economic stability. Instead of developing new policies, the party played the \"red card\" by portraying the new party, Fianna F\u00e1il, as communists. Fianna F\u00e1il offered the electorate a fresh and popular manifesto of social reform. Unable to compete with this, Cosgrave and his party lost the election, and a minority Fianna F\u00e1il government came to power.\nCosgrave in opposition.\nFollowing the general election of that year, Cosgrave assumed the role of Leader of the Opposition, as Fianna F\u00e1il began what turned out to be sixteen years of single-party government. In 1933, three groups, Cumann na nGaedheal, the National Centre Party and the National Guard came together to form a new party, called Fine Gael. Cosgrave was named the merged party's deputy leader, with Eoin O'Duffy as party leader. However, since O'Duffy didn't have a seat in the D\u00e1il, Cosgrave became Fine Gael's parliamentary leader and thus remained Leader of the Opposition. He became party leader the following year when O'Duffy stepped down. Under his leadership, Fine Gael lost elections in 1937, 1938 and 1943. Cosgrave retired as leader of the party at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis in the Mansion House, Dublin, on 26 January 1944, and was succeeded by Richard Mulcahy.\nLegacy.\nAn effective and good chairman rather than a colourful or charismatic leader, he led the new state during the more turbulent period of its history, when the legislation necessary for the foundation of a stable independent Irish polity needed to be pushed through. Cosgrave's governments in particular played a crucial role in the evolution of the British Empire into the British Commonwealth, with fundamental changes to the concept of the role of the Crown, the governor-generalship and the British Government within the Commonwealth.\nIn overseeing the establishment of the formal institutions of the state, his performance as its first political leader may have been undervalued. In an era when democratic governments formed in the aftermath of the First World War were moving away from democracy and towards dictatorships, the Free State, under Cosgrave, remained unambiguously democratic, a fact shown by his handing over of power to his one-time friend, then rival, \u00c9amon de Valera, when de Valera's Fianna F\u00e1il won the 1932 general election, in the process killing off talk within the Irish Army of staging a coup to keep Cosgrave in power and de Valera out of government.\nPerhaps the best endorsement made of Cosgrave came from his old rival \u00c9amon de Valera, with whom he was reconciled before his death. To his son, Vivion, weeks after taking power in 1932 and reading the files on the actions of Cosgrave's governments concerning its work in the Commonwealth, he said of Cosgrave and Cosgrave's ministers, \"[W]hen we got in and saw the files \u2026 they did a magnificent job, Viv. They did a magnificent job.\"\nDeath.\nCosgrave died on 16 November 1965, aged 85. The Fianna F\u00e1il government under Se\u00e1n Lemass awarded him the honour of a state funeral, which was attended by the cabinet, the leaders of all the main Irish political parties, and \u00c9amon de Valera, then President of Ireland. He is buried in Goldenbridge Cemetery in Inchicore in Dublin. Richard Mulcahy said, \"It is in terms of the Nation and its needs and its potential that I praise God who gave us in our dangerous days the gentle but steel-like spirit of rectitude, courage and humble self-sacrifice, that was William T. Cosgrave\".\nCosgrave's son, Liam, served as a TD from 1943 to 1981 and served as leader of Fine Gael from 1965 to 1977 and Taoiseach from 1973 to 1977. W. T.'s grandson, also called Liam, also served as a TD and as Senator and his granddaughter, Louise Cosgrave, served as on D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown County Council from 1999 to 2009.\nIn October 2014, his grave was vandalised, the top of a Celtic cross on the headstone being broken off. It was again vandalised in March 2016.\nGovernments.\nThe following governments were led by Cosgrave:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was a principal artist of the Imperial Russian Ballet and the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev, but is most recognized for creating the role of \"The Dying Swan\" and, with her own company, being the first ballerina to tour the world, including South America, India, Mexico and Australia.\nEarly life.\nAnna Matveyevna Pavlova was born in the Preobrazhensky Regiment hospital, Saint Petersburg where her father, Matvey Pavlovich Pavlov, served. Some sources say that her parents married just before her birth, others\u2014years later. Her mother, Lyubov Feodorovna Pavlova, came from peasants and worked as a laundress at the house of a Russian-Jewish banker, Lazar Polyakov, for some time. When Anna rose to fame, Polyakov's son Vladimir claimed that she was an illegitimate daughter of his father; others speculated Matvey came from Crimean Karaites (there is a monument in one of Yevpatoria's kenesas dedicated to Pavlova), yet both legends find no historical proof. Anna Matveyevna changed her patronymic to Pavlovna when she started performing on stage.\nPavlova was a premature child, regularly felt ill and was soon sent to the Ligovo village where her grandmother looked after her. Pavlova's passion for the art of ballet took off when her mother took her to a performance of Marius Petipa's original production of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" at the Imperial Maryinsky Theatre in 1890. The lavish spectacle made an impression on Pavlova. When she was nine, her mother took her to audition for the Imperial Ballet School. Because of her youth and sickly appearance, she was rejected, but, at age 10, in 1891, she was accepted. She appeared for the first time on stage in Petipa's \"Un conte de f\u00e9es\" (\"A Fairy Tale\"), which the ballet master staged for the students of the school.\nImperial Ballet School.\nYoung Pavlova's years of classical ballet training were difficult. Her severely arched feet, thin ankles and long limbs clashed with the small, compact body favoured for the ballerina of the time. Her fellow students taunted her with such nicknames as \"The broom\" and \"La petite sauvage\". Undeterred, she trained to improve her technique. She practised repeatedly after learning a step. She said: \"No one can arrive from being talented alone. God gives talent, work transforms talent into genius.\" She took extra lessons from the noted teachers of the day\u2014Christian Johansson, Pavel Gerdt, Nikolai Legat\u2014and from Enrico Cecchetti, considered the greatest ballet virtuoso of the time and founder of the Cecchetti method, a very influential ballet technique used to this day. In 1898, she entered the \"classe de perfection\" of Ekaterina Vazem, former \"Prima ballerina\" of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatres.\nDuring her final year at the Imperial Ballet School, Pavlova performed many roles with the principal company. She graduated in 1899 at age 18, chosen to enter the Imperial Ballet a rank ahead of \"corps de ballet\" as a \"coryph\u00e9e\". She made her official d\u00e9but at the Mariinsky Theatre in Pavel Gerdt's \"Les Dryades pr\u00e9tendues\" (\"The False Dryads\"). Her performance drew praise from the critics, particularly Nikolai Bezobrazov.\nCareer.\nSt. Petersburg.\nMarius Petipa.\nAt the height of Petipa's strict academicism, the public was taken aback by Pavlova's style, a combination of a gift that paid little heed to academic rules: she frequently performed with bent knees, bad turnout, misplaced \"port de bras\" and incorrectly placed \"tours\". Such a style, in many ways, harkened back to the time of the romantic ballet and the great ballerinas of old.\nPavlova performed in various classical variations, \"pas de deux\" and \"pas de trois\" in such ballets as \"La Camargo\", \"Le Roi Candaule\", \"Marcobomba\" and \"The Sleeping Beauty\". Her enthusiasm often led her astray: once during a performance as the River Thames in Petipa's \"The Pharaoh's Daughter\" her energetic double \"pique turns\" led her to lose her balance and fall into the prompter's box. Her weak ankles led to difficulty while performing as the fairy Candide in Petipa's \"The Sleeping Beauty\", leading the ballerina to revise the fairy's jumps \"en pointe\", much to the surprise of the Ballet Master. She tried desperately to imitate the renowned Pierina Legnani, \"Prima ballerina assoluta\" of the Imperial Theatres. Once, during class, she attempted Legnani's famous fouett\u00e9s, causing her teacher, Pavel Gerdt, to fly into a rage. He told her,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... leave acrobatics to others. It is positively more than I can bear to see the pressure such steps put on your delicate muscles and the severe arch of your foot. I beg you to never again try to imitate those who are physically stronger than you. You must realize that your daintiness and fragility are your greatest assets. You should always do the kind of dancing which brings out your own rare qualities instead of trying to win praise by mere acrobatic tricks.\nPavlova rose through the ranks quickly, becoming a favourite of the old maestro Petipa. From him she learned the title role in \"Paquita\", Princess Aspicia in \"The Pharaoh's Daughter\", Queen Nisia in \"Le Roi Candaule\" and \"Giselle\". She was named \"danseuse\" in 1902, \"premi\u00e8re danseuse\" in 1905 and \"prima ballerina\" in 1906 after a resounding performance in \"Giselle\". Petipa revised many \"grand pas\" for her, as well as many supplemental variations. She was much celebrated by the fanatical balletomanes of Tsarist Saint Petersburg, her legions of fans calling themselves the \"Pavlovatzi\".\nWhen the ballerina Mathilde Kschessinska was pregnant in 1901, she coached Pavlova in the role of Nikiya in \"La Bayad\u00e8re\". Kschessinska, not wanting to be upstaged, was certain Pavlova would fail in the role, as she was considered technically inferior because of her small ankles and lithe legs. Instead, audiences became enchanted with Pavlova and her frail, ethereal look, which fit the role perfectly, particularly in the scene \"The Kingdom of the Shades\".\nMichel Fokine.\nPavlova is perhaps most renowned for creating the role of \"The Dying Swan\", a solo choreographed for her by Michel Fokine. The ballet, created in 1905, is danced to \"Le cygne\" from \"The Carnival of the Animals\" by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. She also choreographed several solos herself, one of which is \"The Dragonfly\", a short ballet set to music by Fritz Kreisler. While performing it, she wore a gossamer gown with large dragonfly wings fixed to the back.\nPavlova had a rivalry with Tamara Karsavina. According to the film \"A Portrait of Giselle\", Karsavina recalls a wardrobe malfunction during a performance; her shoulder straps fell, exposing her breasts and Pavlova helped embarrass her to tears.\nBallets Russes.\nIn the first years of the Ballets Russes, Pavlova worked briefly for Sergei Diaghilev. Originally, she was to dance the lead in Mikhail Fokine's \"The Firebird\", but refused the part, as she could not come to terms with Igor Stravinsky's avant-garde score, and the role was given to Tamara Karsavina. All her life, she preferred the melodious \"musique dansante\" of the old maestros such as Cesare Pugni and Ludwig Minkus, caring little for anything else which strayed from the salon-style ballet music of the 19th century.\nPavlova's ballet company.\nTouring the world.\nAfter the first Paris season of Ballets Russes, Pavlova left it to form her own company. It performed throughout the world, with a repertory primarily of abridgements of Petipa's works and pieces choreographed specially for her. Going independent was\n\"a very enterprising and daring act. She toured on her own... for twenty years until her death. She traveled everywhere in the world that travel was possible, and introduced the ballet to millions who had never seen any form of Western dancing.\"\nPavlova also performed many 'ethnic' dances, some of which she learned from local teachers during her travels. In addition to the dances of her native Russia, she performed Mexican, Japanese and East Indian dances. Supported by her interest, Uday Shankar, her dance partner in \"Krishna Radha\" (1923), went on to revive the long-neglected art of the dance in his native India. She also toured China. \nIn 1916, she produced a 50-minute adaptation of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" in New York City. Members of her company were largely English girls with Russianized names. In 1918\u20131919, her company toured throughout South America, during which time Pavlova exerted an influence on the young American ballerina Ruth Page.\nIn 1915, she appeared in the film \"The Dumb Girl of Portici\", in which she played a mute girl betrayed by an aristocrat.\nEngland.\nAfter leaving Russia, Pavlova moved to London, England, settling, in 1912, at the Ivy House on North End Road, Golders Green, north of Hampstead Heath, where she lived for the rest of her life. The house had an ornamental lake where she fed her pet swans, and where now stands a statue of her by the Scots sculptor George Henry Paulin. The house was featured in the film \"Anna Pavlova\". It used to be the London Jewish Cultural Centre, but a blue plaque marks it as a site of significant historical interest being Pavlova's home. While in London, Pavlova was influential in the development of British ballet, most notably inspiring the career of Alicia Markova. The Gate public house (https://thegatearkley.co.uk) located on the border of Arkley and Totteridge (London Borough of Barnet), has a story, framed on its walls, describing a visit by Pavlova and her dance company.\nThere are at least five memorials to Pavlova in London, England: a contemporary sculpture by Tom Merrifield of Pavlova as the Dragonfly in the grounds of Ivy House, a sculpture by Scot George Henry Paulin in the middle of the Ivy House pond, a blue plaque on the front of Ivy House, a statuette sitting with the urn that holds her ashes in Golders Green Crematorium and the gilded statue atop the Victoria Palace Theatre. When the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, England, opened in 1911, a gilded statue of Pavlova had been installed above the cupola of the theatre. This was taken down for its safety during World War II and was lost. In 2006, a replica of the original statue was restored in its place.\nIn 1928, Anna Pavlova engaged St. Petersburg conductor Efrem Kurtz to accompany her dancing, which he did until her death in 1931. During the last five years of her life, one of her soloists, Cleo Nordi, another St Petersburg ballerina, became her dedicated assistant, having left the Paris Opera Ballet in 1926 to join her company and accompanied her on her second Australian tour to Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney in 1929. On the way back on board ship, Nordi married Pavlova's British musical director, Walford Hyden. Nordi kept Pavlova's flame burning in London, well into the 1970s, where she tutored hundreds of pupils including many ballet stars.\nUnited States.\nBetween 1912 and 1926, Pavlova made almost annual tours of the United States, traveling from coast to coast.\n\"A generation of dancers turned to the art because of her. She roused America as no one had done since Elssler. ... America became Pavlova-conscious and therefore ballet-conscious. Dance and passion, dance and drama were fused.\"\nPavlova was introduced to audiences in the United States by Max Rabinoff during his time as managing director of the Boston Grand Opera Company from 1914 to 1917 and was featured there with her Russian Ballet Company during that period.\nIn 1914, Pavlova performed in St. Louis, Missouri, after being engaged at the last minute by Hattie B. Gooding, responsible for a series of worthy musical attractions presented to the St. Louis public during the season of 1913\u201314. Gooding went to New York to arrange with the musical managers for the attractions offered. Out of a long list, she selected those who represent the highest in their own special field and which she felt sure St. Louisans would enjoy. The list began with Madame Louise Homer, prima donna contralto of the Metropolitan Grand Opera Co., followed by Josef Hofmann, pianist, Pavlova with the Russian ballet. For the last, the expenses were $5,500.00 ($ in 2024 dollars) for two nights, and the receipts $7,500.00 ($ in 2024 dollars), netting a clear gain of $2,000.00 ($ in 2024 dollars); her other evenings were proportionately successful financially. The advance sales were greater than any other city in the United States. At the Pavlova concert, when Gooding engaged, at the last hour, the Russian dancer for two nights, the New York managers became dubious and anxiously rushed four special advance agents to assist her. On seeing the bookings for both nights, they quietly slipped back to New York fully convinced of her ability to attract audiences in St. Louis, which had always, heretofore, been called \"the worst show town\" in the country.\nPersonal life.\nVictor Dandr\u00e9, her manager and companion, said he was her husband in his biography of the dancer in 1932, \"Anna Pavlova: In Art and Life\". They had secretly married in 1914 after first meeting in 1904 (some sources say 1900). He died on 5 February 1944 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and his ashes placed below those of Anna.\nDandr\u00e9 wrote of Pavlova's many charity dance performances and charitable efforts to support Russian orphans in post-World War I Paris\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...who were in danger of finding themselves literally in the street. They were already suffering terrible privations and it seemed as though there would soon be no means whatever to carry on their education.\nFifteen girls were adopted into a home Pavlova purchased near Paris at Saint-Cloud, overseen by the Comtesse de Guerne and supported by her performances and funds solicited by Pavlova, including many small donations from members of the Camp Fire Girls of America, who made her an honorary member.\nDuring her life, she had many pets, including a Siamese cat, various dogs and many birds, including swans. Dandr\u00e9 indicated she was a lifelong animal lover, corroborated by photographic portraits for which she sat, often with an animal she loved. A formal studio portrait was taken of her with Jack, her favourite swan.\nDeath.\nWhile travelling from Paris to The Hague, Pavlova became very ill and more ill upon arrival. She sent to Paris for her personal physician, Zalewski, to attend her. She died of pleurisy in the bedroom next to the Japanese Salon of the Hotel Des Indes in The Hague twenty days short of her 50th birthday.\nVictor Dandr\u00e9 wrote that Pavlova died a half hour past midnight on Friday, 23 January 1931, with her maid Marguerite L\u00e9tienne, Zalevsky and himself at her bedside. Her last words were, \"Get my 'Swan' costume ready.\" Dandr\u00e9 and L\u00e9tienne dressed her body in her favourite beige lace dress and placed her in a coffin with a sprig of lilac. At 7 am, a Russian Orthodox priest arrived to say prayers over her body. At 7:30 am, her coffin was taken to the mortuary chapel attaching the Catholic hospital in The Hague.\nIn accordance with old ballet tradition, on the day she was to have next performed, the show went on, as scheduled, with a single spotlight circling an empty stage where Pavlova would have been. Memorial services were held in the Russian Orthodox Church in London. She was cremated and her ashes placed in a columbarium at Golders Green Crematorium, where her urn was adorned with her ballet shoes (which have since been stolen).\nPavlova's ashes have been a source of much controversy, following attempts by Valentina Zhilenkova and Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov to have them flown to Moscow for interment in the Novodevichy Cemetery. These attempts were based on claims that it was Pavlova's dying wish that her ashes be returned to Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union. These claims were later found to be false, as there is no evidence to suggest that this was her wish at all. The only documentary evidence that suggests that such a move would be possible is in the will of Pavlova's husband, who stipulated that, if Russian authorities agreed to such a move and treated her remains with proper reverence, then the crematorium caretakers should agree to it. Despite this clause, the will does not contain a formal request or plans for a posthumous journey to Russia.\nThe most recent attempt to move Pavlova's remains to Russia came in 2001. Golders Green Crematorium had made arrangements for them to be flown to Russia for interment on 14 March 2001 in a ceremony to be attended by various Russian dignitaries. This plan was later abandoned after Russian authorities withdrew permission for the move. It was later revealed that neither Pavlova's family nor the Russian Government had sanctioned the move and that they had agreed the remains should stay in London.\nLegacy.\nPavlova inspired choreographer Frederick Ashton (1904\u20131988), who as a boy of 13, saw her dance in the Municipal Theatre in Lima, Peru.\nThe Pavlova dessert is named after her.\nPavlova's dances inspired many artworks of the Irish painter John Lavery. The critic of \"The Observer\" wrote on 16 April 1911: \"Mr. Lavery's portrait of the Russian dancer Anna Pavlova, caught in a moment of graceful, weightless movement ... Her miraculous, feather-like flight, which seems to defy the law of gravitation\".\nThe Jarabe Tapat\u00edo, known in English as the \"Mexican Hat Dance\", gained popularity outside of Mexico when Pavlova created a staged version in pointe shoes, for which she was showered with hats by her adoring Mexican audiences. Afterward, in 1924, the Jarabe Tapat\u00edo was proclaimed Mexico's national dance.\nPavlova appears as a character, played by Maria Tallchief, in the 1952 film \"Million Dollar Mermaid\".\nBotanist Roger William Butcher in 1952, circumscribed \"Pavlova\" which is a genus of algae, belonging to the family Pavlovaceae. This was named so, because \"the movement of the type species, \"Pavlova gyrans\", is positively balletic\". \nIn 1980, Igor Carl Faberge licensed a collection of 8-inch full-lead crystal wine glasses to commemorate the centenary of Pavlova's birth. The glasses were crafted in Japan under the supervision of The Franklin Mint. A frosted image of Pavlova appears in the stem of each glass. Originally each set contained 12 glasses.\nPavlova's life was depicted in the 1983 film \"Anna Pavlova\".\nA McDonnell Douglas MD-11 of the Dutch airline KLM, with the registration PH-KCH carried her name. It was delivered on 31 August 1995.\nPavlova appears as a character in Rosario Ferre's novel of 2001, \"Flight of the Swan\".\nPavlova appears as a character in the fourth episode of the British series \"Mr Selfridge\" (2013), played by real-life ballerina Natalia Kremen.\nAnna Pavlova was feature in a Manga called The War of Greedy Witches(2020), as a fighter and one of the 32 participants.\nPointe shoes.\nPavlova's feet were extremely arched, so she strengthened her pointe shoe by adding a piece of hard leather on the soles for support and flattening the box of the shoe. At the time, many considered this \"cheating\", for a ballerina of the era was taught that she, not her shoes, must hold her weight \"en pointe\". In Pavlova's case, this was extremely difficult, as the shape of her feet required her to balance her weight on her big toes. Her solution became, over time, the precursor of the modern pointe shoe, as pointe work became less painful and easier for curved feet. According to Margot Fonteyn's biography, Pavlova did not like the way her invention looked in photographs, so she would remove it or have the photographs altered so that it appeared she was using a normal pointe shoe.\nChoreographic notation.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the Imperial Ballet began a project that notated much of its repertory in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation. Most of the notated choreographies were recorded while dancers were being taken through rehearsals. After the revolution of 1917, this collection of notation was taken out of Russia by the Imperial Ballet's former \"r\u00e9gisseur\" Nicholas Sergeyev, who utilized these documents to stage such works as \"The Nutcracker\", \"The Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Swan Lake\", as well as Marius Petipa's definitive versions of \"Giselle\" and of \"Copp\u00e9lia\" for the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet and the Vic-Wells Ballet of London (precursor of the Royal Ballet). The productions of these works formed the foundation from which all subsequent versions would be based to one extent or another. Eventually, these notations were acquired by Harvard University and are now part of the cache of materials relating to the Imperial Ballet known as the Sergeyev Collection that includes not only the notated ballets but rehearsal scores as used by the company at the turn of the 20th century.\nThe notations of \"Giselle\" and the full-length \"Paquita\" were recorded c.\u20091901\u20131902 while Marius Petipa himself took Anna Pavlova through rehearsals. Pavlova is also included in some of the other notated choreographies when she participated in performances as a soloist. Several of the violin or piano reductions used as rehearsal scores reflect the variations that Pavlova chose to dance in a particular performance, since, at that time, classical variations were often performed ad libitum, i.e. at the dancer's choice. One variation, in particular, was performed by Pavlova in several ballets, being composed by Riccardo Drigo for Pavlova's performance in Petipa's ballet \"Le Roi candaule\" that features a solo harp. This variation is still performed in modern times in the Mariinsky Ballet's staging of the \"Paquita\" grand pas classique.\nRepertoire.\nPavlova's repertoire includes the following roles:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after its capital Lugdunum (today's Lyon), possibly Roman Europe's major city west of Italy, and a major imperial mint. Outside Lugdunum was the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls, where representatives met to celebrate the cult of Rome and Augustus.\nHistory.\nIn describing his conquest of Gaul (58\u201350 BC), Julius Caesar distinguished between in the south of Gaul, which already was a Roman province in his time, and the three other parts of Gaul: the territories of the , of the , and of the also known as the . The territory of the Galli extended from the rivers Seine and Marne in the north-east, which formed the boundary with , to the river Garonne in the south-west, which formed the border with . Under Augustus, was created by reducing in size the territory of the Gauls (): the portion between the river Loire and the Garonne was given to , and central-eastern portions were given to the new province of . The map shows the extent after these reductions. The date of the creation of is under discussion, whether between 27 and 25 BC or between 16 and 13 BC, during Augustus' visits to Gaul.\nIt was an imperial province, deemed important enough to be governed by an imperial legate. Under the Tetrarchy (AD 296), it was first divided into two, , with its capital at Lyon, and , with its capital at Rouen. This division is recorded in the Verona List. Both new provinces belonged to the diocese of Gaul, alongside the Helvetic, Belgian and German provinces.\nConstantine I (r.\u2009306\u00a0\u2013\u00a0337\u00a0AD) divided the provinces again. , with its capital at Sens, was split off from Prima, while , with its capital at Tours, was separated from . According to the , Prima was governed by a , while the other three were governed by a . All the provinces were gradually overrun by invading Franks and Burgundians during the 5th century. What was left of the provinces effectively ceased to exist in AD 486/487 when the Roman general Syagrius, who controlled and , was defeated by the Franks.\nThe cities and of the four provinces are listed in the late 4th-century by their ethnic titles.

He has appeared in ten of the eleven theatrical \"Star Wars\" films to date, including every film in the \"Skywalker Saga\", which includes the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy and the sequel trilogy. At various points throughout the course of the films, R2, an astromech droid, is a friend to C-3PO, Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. R2-D2 and his companion C-3PO are the only characters to appear in every theatrical \"Star Wars\" film, with the exception of \"\" (2018).\nEnglish actor Kenny Baker played R2-D2 in all three original \"Star Wars\" films and received billing credit for the character in the prequel trilogy, where Baker's role was reduced as R2-D2 was portrayed mainly by radio controlled props and CGI models. In the sequel trilogy, Baker was credited as consultant for \"The Force Awakens\"; however, Jimmy Vee also co-performed the character in some scenes. Vee later took over the role beginning in \"The Last Jedi\". In \"The Rise of Skywalker\", puppeteers Hassan Taj and Lee Towersey perform the role of R2-D2, replacing Jimmy Vee, who had played the role in the previous two films. His sounds and vocal effects were created by sound designer Ben Burtt.\nR2-D2 was designed in artwork by Ralph McQuarrie, co-developed by John Stears and built by Peteric Engineering. The revised \"Empire Strikes Back\" droids had fibreglass shells built by Tony Dyson and his White Horse Toy Company.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDesign.\nGeorge Lucas's creation of R2-D2 was influenced by the peasant Matashichi from Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film \"The Hidden Fortress\". Lucas and artist Ralph McQuarrie also drew inspiration from the robots Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Douglas Trumbull's 1972 film \"Silent Running\".\nThe name derives from when Lucas was making one of his earlier films, \"American Graffiti\". Sound editor Walter Murch states that he is responsible for the utterance which sparked the name for the droid. Murch asked for Reel 2, Dialog Track 2, in the abbreviated form \"R-2-D-2\". Lucas, who was in the room and had dozed off while working on the script for \"Star Wars\", momentarily woke when he heard the request and, after asking for clarification, stated that it was a \"great name\" before going back to writing his script.\nR2-D2 stands for Second Generation Robotic Droid Series-2, according to a \"Star Wars\" encyclopedia published after the release of the film \"Star Wars\". Tony Dyson, owner of the special effects studio The White Horse Toy Company, was commissioned by special effects supervisor Brian Johnson to fabricate the revised mechanical design for \"The Empire Strikes Back\", making several units operated by remote control. A number were used by Baker, and two were stunt double models made for the scene where the droid was shot from the swamp onto the shore on Dagobah.\nAppearances.\nOriginal trilogy.\n\"Star Wars\".\nIn \"Star Wars\", R2-D2 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are both introduced on board the \"Tantive IV\", along with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) of Alderaan, when they are being pursued by Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) aboard an Imperial Star Destroyer. Leia inserts into R2-D2 an information disc containing the plans for the Death Star battle station, and encodes a distress message on the droid's holographic projector. The droids then escape in a pod that crashes on Tatooine near Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi's (Alec Guinness) desert abode.\nR2-D2 and C-3PO are then abducted by Jawas and bought by Owen (Phil Brown) and Beru Lars (Shelagh Fraser), uncle and aunt of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). While Luke cleans the sand out of R2-D2's gears, he discovers a fragment of Leia's message, and removes the droid's restraining bolt to see more; once free of the bolt, R2 claims to have no knowledge of the message. That night, R2-D2 leaves the farm to seek out Obi-Wan. When Owen and Beru are killed by Imperial stormtroopers, Luke is forced to leave Tatooine with Obi-Wan, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) on board the \"Millennium Falcon\" to deliver R2-D2 to the Rebel Alliance. On their arrival at Alderaan's co-ordinates, they are pulled in by the Death Star's tractor beam and are forced to land, but eventually rescue Princess Leia. After Vader kills Obi-Wan, the rest of the group escapes and delivers the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. R2 later serves as Luke's droid during the attack on the station. R2-D2 is severely damaged during the battle, but is repaired before the ceremony at the end of the film.\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\".\nIn \"The Empire Strikes Back\", R2-D2 accompanies Luke to Dagobah, and later to Cloud City, where he helps to rescue and repair a heavily damaged C-3PO and to override city security computers. He also manages to reactivate the \"Millennium Falcon\"'s hyperdrive, resulting in a last-minute escape from Imperial forces.\n\"Return of the Jedi\".\nIn \"Return of the Jedi\", R2-D2 plays a critical role in rescuing Luke, Leia, and Han from Jabba the Hutt. He later joins the Rebel strike team on Endor. He is badly damaged during the battle between the Imperial troops and the Rebels, but is repaired in time for the celebration marking the second Death Star's destruction and the fall of the Empire.\nPrequel trilogy.\n\"The Phantom Menace\".\nIn \"The Phantom Menace\", set 32 years before \"A New Hope\", R2-D2 is portrayed as belonging to the Naboo defense forces, one of five astromech droids deployed for repair duty onboard Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala's (Natalie Portman) starship as it attempts to get past the Trade Federation blockade. The sole survivor of the five, R2-D2 repairs the deflector shields and saves the day. Having proved his worth, R2-D2 then becomes part of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn's (Liam Neeson) party on Tatooine where he meets nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and C-3PO, whom Anakin built from scrap. Later still, he serves as the astromech droid for Anakin's starfighter during the Battle of Naboo, helping Anakin destroy the Trade Federation's command center and free the planet Naboo from the Federation's grip. R2-D2, along with Anakin and the young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), are awarded medals by Padm\u00e9 and Boss Nass (Brian Blessed) at the end of the film.\n\"Attack of the Clones\".\nIn \"Attack of the Clones\", set 10 years after \"The Phantom Menace\", R2-D2 again serves Obi-Wan and Anakin (Hayden Christensen), who is now Obi-Wan's Jedi apprentice. He accompanies Anakin and Padm\u00e9 to Naboo, and then to Tatooine when Anakin tries in vain to rescue his mother Shmi (Pernilla August) from a pack of Tusken Raiders. Here, he is reunited with C-3PO, and the two get into various misadventures on the planet Geonosis. He and C-3PO are later witness to Anakin and Padm\u00e9's secret wedding.\n\"Revenge of the Sith\".\nIn \"Revenge of the Sith\", set three years later, R2-D2 helps Anakin and Obi-Wan in their mission to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from Count Dooku's (Christopher Lee) capital ship, the \"Invisible Hand\". He is attacked by super battle droids, but he defeats them through ingenious tactics. After Anakin falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader, he takes R2-D2 with him when he goes to assassinate the Separatist council, but he tells him to stay with the ship. After Obi-Wan defeats Vader in a lightsaber duel, R2-D2 goes with him aboard Padm\u00e9's ship, where he witnesses as Padm\u00e9 dies after giving birth to her and Vader's children, Luke and Leia.\nAfter Palpatine and Vader overthrow the Republic and establish the Galactic Empire at the end of the film, C-3PO's memory is erased to keep the knowledge of Luke and Leia's locations a secret from their father. However, R2-D2's memory is not wiped; as a result, R2-D2 is the only surviving character at the end of the saga who knows the entire story of the Skywalker family. Both R2-D2 and C-3PO end up in the possession of Captain Raymus Antilles (Rohan Nichol) onboard the \"Tantive IV\".\nSequel trilogy.\n\"The Force Awakens\".\nIn \"\", set approximately 30 years after \"Return of the Jedi\", R2-D2 is revealed to be kept in storage at the Resistance base on the planet D'Qar, having put himself in a low-power mode after Luke Skywalker's disappearance. He later awakens and reveals Luke's location by combining map data stored in his memory with that of the droid BB-8. He then travels with Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Chewbacca to the planet highlighted on the map, where they find Luke in self-imposed exile. In the credits, Kenny Baker was credited as 'R2-D2 consultant,' while Jimmy Vee provided an uncredited portrayal in some scenes.\n\"The Last Jedi\".\nR2-D2 appeared in \"\", with actor Jimmy Vee taking over the role from Kenny Baker, who retired from the role due to his age and health. Baker died in August 2016.\nR2-D2 has a brief but pivotal role in the film, reuniting with Luke aboard the \"Millennium Falcon\" and showing him Leia's distress message from the original film in a successful attempt to convince Luke to train Rey. He is later shown interfacing with the \"Falcon\"'s computer while Rey and Chewbacca pilot the ship amid the final confrontation with the evil First Order's forces.\n\"The Rise of Skywalker\".\nR2-D2 returns once more in \"\". Initially remaining at the Resistance base, he is shown watching Leia as she dies. He later plays an important role in restoring C-3PO's memory after Rey, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) are forced to erase it so the droid can translate a Sith artifact that holds a clue to the location of the Sith homeworld, the resurrected Palpatine, and the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order. R2-D2 accompanies Poe in his X-wing for the final assault, and is later shown joining the others in celebrating the defeat of Palpatine and the Sith Eternal.\nAnthology films.\n\"Rogue One\".\nR2-D2 makes a cameo appearance in \"Rogue One\" alongside C-3PO.\nTelevision.\nR2-D2 and C-3PO had their own animated series, \"\", set before they came into Luke Skywalker's possession. This was excluded from the new canon in 2014. They also appear in both the live action and animated segments of the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\". In the animated segment they are rescued by a mysterious bounty hunter, Boba Fett, who offers to help them. Later R2-D2 intercepts a transmission between Darth Vader and Fett - thus confirming to him, C-3PO and the others Fett's true allegiances.\nR2-D2 makes a guest appearance with C-3PO, Luke Skywalker (and Mark Hamill) and Chewbacca in an episode of \"The Muppet Show\".\nR2-D2 appears in the 2008 animated film ', and the subsequent . In the film, he accompanies Anakin (voiced by Matt Lanter) and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein) on a mission to rescue Jabba the Hutt's son Rotta. In the series, he helps them fight the Separatists. He previously appeared in ', but this micro-series has been excluded from the new canon.\nR2-D2 also appears in \"Star Wars Rebels\" in the episodes \"Droids in Distress\" and \"Blood Sisters\", and in several episodes of \"Star Wars Forces of Destiny\".\nIn the second season of the Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\", R2-D2 accompanies Luke Skywalker as he goes to retrieve Grogu to be trained as a Jedi.\nR2-D2 appears in the sixth and seventh episodes of \"The Mandalorian\" spin-off series \"The Book of Boba Fett\". After Grogu decides to abandon his Jedi training, Luke has R2-D2 fly Grogu to Tatooine in his X-wing starfighter so that he may be reunited with his guardian, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal).\nR2-D2 also appears in the 2025 animated web series, \"Droid Diaries\".\nNovels and comics.\nThe makes it clear that R2-D2 has been in Padm\u00e9's possession since the events of \"The Phantom Menace\".\nR2-D2 appears in Marvel's 2015 \"Star Wars\" comic series, which is set between the films of the original trilogy. He also appears briefly in the miniseries \"\".\n\"Legends\".\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film \"Star Wars\" were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.\nOther films.\nAlong with the \"Star Wars\" films, R2-D2 makes non-canon cameo appearances in several other films, including: \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\", where he was seen flying in debris; \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", in which he is seen on the underside of the alien ship; in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", in which he is seen on the wall of the room containing the Ark; in \"Poltergeist\", where he is seen in several objects on Robbie's room; and in \"\", where he is seen flying among rubble and debris in the sky. In \"Ready Player One\", R2-D2 is also seen as a toy model in Wade and Samantha's apartment. He also appears in the \"Wreck-It Ralph\" sequel, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\".\nIn an early script to 2014's \"The Lego Movie\", R2-D2 was set to be one of the main characters, but was written out due to the directors failing to obtain the rights to the character.\nProduction.\nSeveral R2-D2 models were built for the original \"Star Wars\" films; one that was remote controlled and rolled on three wheeled legs, and others which were worn by English actor Kenny Baker and walked on two legs. Set director Roger Christian cited the Daleks of \"Doctor Who\" as an inspiration for how the crew realized an actor could control R2-D2's prop from the inside. Deep Roy served as Baker's double, in both \"Episodes V\" and \"VI\"; providing stunts and filling in when Baker was unavailable. The original props for \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\" were designed by John Stears and built by Stears' team and Peteric Engineering. The revised fibreglass droids used in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" were built by Tony Dyson and the White Horse Toy Company. The radio controlled R2 was operated by John Stears in \"A New Hope\", Brian Johnson in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and by Kit West in \"Return of the Jedi\".\nKenny Baker, who portrayed R2-D2 in costume, was not involved in the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\". R2-D2 was portrayed entirely by a radio controlled unit, operated by Mick Garris (Lucas' receptionist at the time). In the credits, R2-D2 is credited as playing himself. Garris later went on to operate the radio controlled R2-D2 at various events, including the Oscars.\nThere were a total of 15 R2-D2s on the set of \"Attack of the Clones\". Eight were radio-controlled; two were worn by Baker; the remainder were stunt models that could be moved by puppet strings or towed by wires. The robotic R2-D2s were prone to failure, particularly while shooting the Tatooine scenes in Tunisia.\nRadio-controlled units were extensively utilized for the Prequel trilogy due to advances in technology, though Baker was still used in some scenes. R2-D2 had three principal operators: Don Bies, Jolyon Bambridge and Grant Imahara.\nThe sound effects for R2-D2's \"voice\" were created by sound designer Ben Burtt, using an ARP 2600 analog synthesizer, as well as his own vocalizations processed through other effects. Original props of R2-D2 and C-3PO are used as Audio-Animatronics in the queue area of Disneyland's Star Tours\u2013The Adventures Continue attraction.\nAlthough Kenny Baker is credited, Anthony Daniels (who portrays C-3PO) has stated that Baker did not film any scenes in \"Revenge of the Sith\". Baker himself has said he probably only appears in footage caught while shooting the previous two movies.\nFor \"The Force Awakens\", producer Kathleen Kennedy hired two fans, Lee Towersey and Oliver Steeples, to build new R2-D2 robots for the film, after being impressed by their working replicas that were brought to \"Star Wars\" Celebration Europe in 2013.\nTowersey was also one of the two puppeteers, along with Hassan Taj, who operated the droid in \"The Rise of Skywalker\".\nEwan McGregor, who portrayed Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, said in an interview, \"As soon as R2-D2 comes on the set, everyone goes a bit silly.\" He said \"there is something about him that makes you feel great affection for him\". In the DVD audio commentary for \"Revenge of the Sith\", George Lucas says R2-D2 is his favorite character, and that it is intentional that R2-D2 saves the day at least once in every film.\nCultural influence.\nR2-D2 was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame in 2003 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A replica can be seen at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh. The Smithsonian Institution included R2-D2 in its list of 101 Objects that Made America. In 2022 R2-D2 was surveyed as being the most popular movie robot in the United States.\nR2-D2 and C-3PO guest starred in a two episodes of \"Sesame Street\" in 1980. The two droids were featured as presenters at the 50th Academy Awards.\nThe telescope dome of Zweibr\u00fccken Observatory in Germany was repainted to resemble R2-D2 in 2018.\nIn the Latin American Spanish dubbing of the \"Star Wars\" films, the name R2-D2 is pronounced as \"Arturito\" (Little Arthur), which sounds similar to the English pronunciation.\nIn the Italian version of the original trilogy, R2-D2 was named \"C1-P8\". Anglicisms were not common in the Italian language during the 1970s and 1980s, and the names of various characters were changed to be easier to pronounce and recognize for Italian speakers. Some of these changes were reverted in the dubbing of the prequel and sequel trilogies, where the original name R2-D2 was used instead.\nAround the same time that \"A New Hope\" was being shot, Ray Harryhausen had already created \"Bubo\" for the 1981 film \"Clash of the Titans\". In the film, Bubo is a mechanical metal owl that flies heavily and communicates through whistles and tweets. Harryhausen denied a relation.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63169", "revid": "18144528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63169", "title": "Posse Comitatus Act", "text": "United States law limiting use of the federal military in domestic policy\nThe Posse Comitatus Act is a United States federal law (\u00a0https://, original at 20\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://) signed into law on June 18, 1878, by President Rutherford B. Hayes that limits the use of federal military personnel to enforce domestic law by the federal government or by other government entities such as county sheriffs and justices of the peace. Congress passed the Act as an amendment to an army appropriations bill following the end of Reconstruction and updated it in 1956, 1981 and 2021.\nThe Act originally applied only to the United States Army, but a subsequent amendment in 1956 expanded its scope to the United States Air Force. In 2021, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 further expanded the scope of the Act to cover the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Space Force. The Act does not prevent the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard under state authority from acting in a law enforcement capacity within its home state or in an adjacent state if invited by that state's governor. The United States Coast Guard (under the Department of Homeland Security) is not covered by the Act either, primarily because although it is an armed service, it also has a maritime law enforcement mission.\nThe title of the Act comes from the legal concept of \"posse comitatus\", the authority under which a county sheriff, or another law officer, can conscript any able-bodied person or group to assist in keeping the peace.\nHistory.\nThe Act, \u00a7 15 of the appropriations bill for the Army for 1879 (found at 20\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://) was a response to, and subsequent prohibition of, the military occupation of the former Confederate States by the United States Army during the twelve years of Reconstruction (1865\u20131877) following the American Civil War (1861\u20131865).\nThe U.S. Constitution places primary responsibility for the holding of elections in the hands of the individual states. The maintenance of peace, conduct of orderly elections, and prosecution of unlawful actions are all state responsibilities, according to any state's role of exercising police power and maintaining law and order, whether part of a wider federation or a unitary state. However, in the former Confederate States, many paramilitary groups sought to suppress, often through intimidation and violence, African-American political power and return the South to rule by the predominantly white Democratic Party. Although African Americans were initially supported by the federal government, as Reconstruction went on, that support waned. Following the bitterly disputed 1876 U.S. presidential election and Compromise of 1877, Congressmen and Senators from the former Confederate States returned to Washington and prioritized prohibiting the federal government from reimposing control over their states. After President Hayes used federal troops to end the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, there was sufficient bipartisan support to pass what became the Posse Comitatus Act.\nThe original Posse Comitatus Act referred exclusively to the United States Army. The Air Force, established during the 20th century initially as a branch of the Army, was added in 1956. The Navy and Marine Corps were not mentioned in the Act but were subject to the same restrictions by Department of Defense regulation until their inclusion in the act in 2021. The Space Force, established in 2020, was also included in the Act in 2021. The United States Coast Guard is not included in the act even though it is part of the six armed services as it is explicitly given federal law enforcement authority on maritime law. The modern Coast Guard did not exist at the time the Act became law in 1878. Its predecessor, the United States Revenue Cutter Service, was primarily a customs enforcement agency and part of the United States Department of the Treasury. In 1915, when the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were amalgamated to form the Coast Guard, the service was both made a military branch and given federal law enforcement authority.\nIn the mid-20th century, the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower used an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, derived from the Enforcement Acts, to send federal troops into Little Rock, Arkansas, during the 1957 school desegregation crisis. The Arkansas governor had opposed desegregation after the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1954 in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. The Enforcement Acts, among other powers, allowed the president to call up military forces when state authorities were either unable or unwilling to suppress violence that was in opposition to the citizens' constitutional rights.\nIn the summer of 2020, the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C. generated controversy when National Guard troops were called in to suppress protests without President Donald Trump's invoking the Insurrection Act (though he threatened to do so). One set of troops, the District of Columbia National Guard, has historically operated as the equivalent of a state militia (under Title 32 of the United States Code) not subject to Posse Comitatus Act restrictions, even though it is a federal entity under the command of the President and the Secretary of the Army. National Guard troops from cooperative states were also called in at the request of federal agencies, some of whom were deputized as police. Attorney General William Barr cited \u00a0https://, which says National Guard troops may engage in \"support of operations or missions undertaken by the member's unit at the request of the President or Secretary of Defense.\" Saying the intent of \u00a7502 (titled \"Required drills and field exercises\") was to cover training exercises only, Senator Tom Udall and U.S. Representative Jim McGovern described this as a \"loophole\" to circumvent Posse Comitatus Act restrictions, and introduced legislation to close it.\nIn 2020, U.S. Representative Adam Schiff introduced an amendment to the Act to expand its coverage to include the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Space Force. This amendment was eventually included in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.\nThe 2025 lawsuit \"Newsom v. Trump\" raised constitutional and statutory challenges under the Posse Comitatus Act in response to the domestic deployment of U.S. Marines and National Guard troops in California. On September 2, 2025, federal judge Charles Breyer ruled that the federal deployment of the National Guard in California violated the Posse Comitatus Act and issued an injunction against it.\nLegislation.\nThe original provision of 1878 was enacted as Section 15 of chapter 263, of the Acts of the 2nd session of the 45th Congress.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe text of the relevant legislation following its amendment in 2021 is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0https://. Use of Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force as posse comitatus:\nWhoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\nAlso notable is the following provision within Title 10 of the United States Code (which concerns generally the organization and regulation of the armed forces and Department of Defense):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0https://. Restriction on direct participation by military personnel\nThe Secretary of Defense shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to ensure that any activity (including the provision of any equipment or facility or the assignment or detail of any personnel) under this chapter does not include or permit direct participation by a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps in a search, seizure, arrest, or other similar activity unless participation in such activity by such member is otherwise authorized by law.\n2006\u20132007 suspension.\nIn 2006, Congress modified the Insurrection Act as part of the 2007 Defense Authorization Bill (repealed as of 2008). On September 26, 2006, President George W. Bush urged Congress to consider revising federal laws so that U.S. armed forces could restore public order and enforce laws in the aftermath of a natural disaster, terrorist attack or incident, or other condition. These changes were included in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (), which was signed into law on October 17, 2006.\nSection 1076 is titled \"Use of the Armed Forces in major public emergencies\". It provided that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The President may employ the armed forces ... to ... restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when, as a result of a natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident, or other condition ... the President determines that ... domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of maintaining public order ... or [to] suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy if such ... a condition ... so hinders the execution of the laws ... that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law ... or opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\nIn 2008, these changes in the Insurrection Act of 1807 were repealed in their entirety, reverting to the previous wording of the Insurrection Act. It was initially written to limit presidential power as much as possible in the event of insurrection, rebellion, or lawlessness.\nExceptions, exclusions, and limitations.\nThere are several situations in which the Act does not apply. These include:\nExclusion applicable to U.S. Coast Guard.\nAlthough it is an armed service, the U.S. Coast Guard, which operates under the United States Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, is not restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act and has explicit authority to enforce federal law. This is true even when the Coast Guard operates as a service within the United States Navy during wartime.\nIn December 1981, the Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act was enacted, clarifying permissible military assistance to domestic law enforcement agencies and the Coast Guard, especially in combating drug smuggling into the United States. Posse Comitatus clarifications emphasize supportive and technical assistance (such as the use of facilities, vessels, and aircraft, as well as intelligence support, technological aid, and surveillance) while generally prohibiting direct participation of U.S. military personnel in law enforcement (such as search, seizure, and arrests). For example, a U.S. Navy vessel may be used to track, follow, and stop a vessel suspected of drug smuggling, but Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) embarked aboard the Navy vessel would perform the actual boarding and, if needed, arrest the suspect vessel's crew.\nAdvisory and support roles.\nFederal troops have a long history of domestic roles, including occupying secessionist Southern states during Reconstruction and putting down major urban riots. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits using active duty personnel to \"execute the laws\"; however, there is disagreement over whether this language may apply to troops used in an advisory, support, disaster response, or other homeland defense role, as opposed to domestic law enforcement.\nOn March 10, 2009, members of the U.S. Army Military Police Corps from Fort Rucker were deployed to Samson, Alabama, in response to a shooting spree. Samson officials confirmed that the soldiers assisted in traffic control and securing the crime scene. The governor of Alabama did not request military assistance, nor did President Barack Obama authorize their deployment. Subsequent investigation found that the Posse Comitatus Act was violated and several military members received \"administrative actions\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is a protocol droid designed to assist in etiquette and translation, and is fluent in over six million forms of communication. The character appears in all nine films of the Skywalker Saga\u2014which includes the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy and the sequel trilogy. Anthony Daniels portrays C-3PO in all the Skywalker Saga films and the standalone film \"Rogue One,\" and he voices the droid in the animated series \"\". In addition to films, C-3PO appears in television series, novels, comics, and video games. Daniels' memoirs, \"I Am C-3PO: The Inside Story\" was released by Dorling Kindersley on 5 November 2019. The book detailed how George Lucas' ideas, Ralph McQuarrie's paintings, Liz Moore's character designs and the art department's work led to the creation of C-3PO - as well as Daniels' experience and portrayal of the character from 1977's \"Star Wars\" to 2019's \"The Rise of Skywalker\".\nCreation and development.\nRalph McQuarrie, a concept artist for the original 1977 \"Star Wars\" film, based the initial design for C-3PO on the female robot from the Fritz Lang film \"Metropolis\" (1927). When Anthony Daniels saw one of McQuarrie's paintings of C-3PO, he was struck by the vulnerability in the droid's face, and he wanted the role. George Lucas, who created the \"Star Wars\" franchise and directed \"Star Wars\", selected Daniels for the physical performance. He was planning to hire another actor for the droid's voice, because he was hesitant to give the character Daniels's British accent. According to Daniels, Lucas wanted C-3PO to have a \"sleazy New York second-hand car dealer\" type of voice. Daniels recalled that thirty well-established actors auditioned for the voice role\u2014including Richard Dreyfuss and Mel Blanc\u2014but Daniels ultimately received the part after one of the actors suggested the idea to Lucas. With Daniels voicing him, C-3PO's persona transformed from oily used-car salesman to neurotic English butler.\nFor the second film, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), Lucas wanted to create audience sympathy for C-3PO by having him get dismantled. He considered having the villain Darth Vader destroy the droid's heart or \"turn it into an alarm clock\". In the finished film, C-3PO is blasted into pieces by an offscreen foe, then rescued from a scrap pile by Chewbacca. Because both C-3PO and Chewbacca were likeable characters\u2014and disliked one another\u2014Lucas wanted them to have a bonding experience. Towards this end, the Wookiee carries and then repairs the dismantled droid.\nPortrayals &amp; Reception.\nPortrayal.\nAmong all the characters in \"Star Wars\", C-3PO stands apart as actor Anthony Daniels is the only performer to have played the same role\u2014both inside the suit and behind the microphone\u2014 in ten live-action films (all nine Skywalker Saga films and \"Rogue One\") and one . He both physically portrays the character and provides the voice in all of these films except for \"\". For that film, a C-3PO puppet was operated by Michael Lynch, with Daniels providing the voice. \nIronically, Daniels wasn\u2019t drawn to the role at first. He reportedly disliked the early design until he came across Ralph McQuarrie\u2019s concept art. The painting, which gave the droid a fragile, almost human vulnerability, changed his mind . Although \"Star Wars\" was immensely successful, Daniels was initially hesitant to return for the first sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back\". According to Daniels, the publicists for \"Star Wars\" wanted to give the impression that C-3PO was portrayed by a real robot, and not an actor in a costume. Although Daniels felt his acting was undervalued, he eventually agreed to return for a higher salary.\nShooting \"A New Hope\" in 1977 proved rough for Daniels. In his memoir \"I Am C-3PO: The Inside Story\", Daniels described the first fiberglass costume as \u201cclaustrophobic and painful\u201d . The thing barely moved, cracked easily, and had no ventilation. He overheated, scraped himself up, and could hardly see where he was going . Oddly enough, those limits became part of the character: the stiff stance, the nervous hand motions, the fussy tone. Over time, Daniels shaped C-3PO\u2019s voice into something between a fretful butler and a refined gentleman perpetually on edge.\nDaniels portrays C-3PO in the television series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" and ', and voices the droid in the animated film '. He also voices the character in the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\",\"\" the radio drama adaptations of the original trilogy, various \"Lego Star Wars\" series and specials, and the series ', ', \"\", \"Forces of Destiny\", \"Star Wars Rebels\" and \"Star Wars Resistance\". In video games, C-3PO is voiced by Daniels, Tom Kane and Tony Pope. Simon Pegg voices the character in a of the animated television series \"Phineas and Ferb\".\nCritical Reception and Cultural Analysis.\nWhen \"Star Wars\" debuted in 1977, reviewers mostly saw C-3PO as a technical marvel and a bit of comic relief . \"Rolling Stone\" called the droids \u201ctwo minor miracles of technology,\u201d noting C-3PO\u2019s \u201cconsiderable urbanity\u201d . The golden worrywart quickly became essential to the films\u2019 rhythm\u2014a polished, anxious foil to the impulsive humans around him.\nIn later years, critics and scholars began reading more into him. Some argued that C-3PO mirrors systems of servitude and hierarchy within the saga\u2019s universe. Built to obey, he\u2019s anxious, deferential, and almost entirely without agency\u2014a \u201ccosmic eunuch,\u201d as one critic put it, or even a symbol of enslavement. His unshakable manners and fear of confrontation throw the rebellion\u2019s defiance into sharper relief, hinting that \"Star Wars\" has always carried a quiet commentary on class, control, and the uneasy status of sentient machines treated as property.\nAppearances.\nOriginal trilogy.\nC-3PO first appears in \"Star Wars\" (1977) aboard a Rebel ship that is boarded by the Empire. Princess Leia hides C-3PO and his companion droid R2-D2 in an escape pod, which she jettisons over the planet Tatooine. There, the droids are captured by Jawas, who sell them to Owen Lars. While cleaning R2-D2, Lars's nephew Luke Skywalker discovers a message in the droid that Leia recorded for Obi-Wan Kenobi. After Imperial stormtroopers destroy the Lars homestead, C-3PO and R2-D2 go along with Luke and Obi-Wan on a mission to rescue Leia, transported by the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca on board the \"Millennium Falcon\". While on the Death Star, C-3PO and R2-D2 shut down the space station's trash compactor to save the lives of their companions. The group then escapes the station and joins the Rebels at their base. When R2-D2 is damaged during the Battle of Yavin, a grief-stricken C-3PO offers to donate his own parts to repair his counterpart.\nIn \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), C-3PO identifies an Imperial probe droid, which gives the Rebels advance warning of an Imperial attack on their base on Hoth. C-3PO escapes the planet with Han, Chewbacca and Leia on the \"Millennium Falcon.\" They eventually arrive in Cloud City, where C-3PO is blasted apart by a stormtrooper. After searching for the protocol droid, Chewbacca finds him dismantled on a conveyor belt. The Wookiee later tries to rebuild C-3PO, but puts his head on backwards. Chewbacca carries the partially-rebuilt droid on his back during Han's encasement in carbonite. With the help of Lando Calrissian, C-3PO and his friends escape from Darth Vader. On board the \"Falcon\", R2-D2 successfully repairs C-3PO.\nAt the beginning of \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), Luke sends C-3PO and R2-D2 to the palace of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, who has purchased the frozen Han from the bounty hunter Boba Fett. To C-3PO's dismay, R2-D2 plays a recorded message in which Luke offers the droids as a goodwill gift to Jabba. Now in the service of the crime lord, C-3PO acts as a translator as Leia, Chewbacca, Lando and Luke arrive at the palace to liberate Han. Jabba foils the plan, but Luke leads a successful escape attempt and the group departs the planet. On Endor, C-3PO and his companions are captured by Ewoks, but are released after they perceive C-3PO to be a deity. Later that night, C-3PO narrates the history of the Rebellion's fight against the Empire to the Ewok tribe, which convinces them to help the Rebels. After the second Death Star is destroyed, C-3PO and his friends celebrate the fall of the Empire.\nPrequel trilogy.\nC-3PO returns in \"\" (1999), the first film of the prequel trilogy. The film reveals that C-3PO was built on Tatooine by the nine-year-old slave boy Anakin Skywalker. The protocol droid meets his future companion, R2-D2, along with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo and the Gungan Jar Jar Binks. C-3PO and R2-D2 help improve Anakin's podracer for the Boonta Eve Classic race, and C-3PO becomes part of Anakin's pit crew. C-3PO and Anakin part ways when Qui-Gon frees the boy from slavery and takes him off-planet. Before leaving, Anakin assures the droid that his mother Shmi will not sell him.\n\"Attack of the Clones\" (2002) is set ten years after \"The Phantom Menace\". Shmi is kidnapped by a group of Tusken Raiders. Sensing that his mother is in danger, Anakin travels with Padm\u00e9 to Tatooine, where they reunite with C-3PO. He presents Anakin and Padm\u00e9 to Anakin's stepfamily: Owen Lars, Cliegg Lars and Beru Whitesun. When Anakin returns with his mother's body, C-3PO attends her funeral. When Anakin and Padm\u00e9 depart Tatooine, C-3PO accompanies them to the planet Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan from the Sith Lord Count Dooku. Shortly afterward, he follows R2-D2 into a droid-construction factory, where his head is exchanged with that of a battle droid. Influenced by the battle droid's programming, C-3PO reluctantly participates in the film's climactic battle scene. After being restored by R2-D2, he leaves Geonosis with his companions. At the end of the film, he is a witness to Padm\u00e9 and Anakin's marriage on Naboo.\nIn \"Revenge of the Sith\" (2005), C-3PO is aware of Padm\u00e9's pregnancy. After Anakin falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes the Sith Lord Darth Vader, he takes C-3PO and R2-D2 with him as he massacres the Jedi. C-3PO rationalizes Vader's behavior by saying he has been under a great deal of stress. The protocol droid accompanies Padm\u00e9 to Mustafar, where he witnesses Vader strangle her into unconsciousness. C-3PO and R2-D2 then take her to safety. When Obi-Wan returns to their spaceship following his duel with Vader, C-3PO pilots it to Polis Massa and witnesses Padm\u00e9 give birth to the Skywalker twins, Luke and Leia. C-3PO and R2-D2 become the property of Captain Raymus Antilles, who orders C-3PO's memory erased to protect the Skywalker children from their father and the newly created Galactic Empire.\nSequel trilogy.\nC-3PO appears in \"The Force Awakens\" (2015), the first installment of the sequel trilogy. He has a red left arm at one point, and is now fluent in seven million forms of communication. He is first seen with Leia and a Resistance team picking up Han, Chewbacca, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 on the planet Takodana. During their adventures, C-3PO is reunited with R2-D2, who is reactivated after being shut off for years. In \"The Last Jedi\" (2017), C-3PO serves as an assistant to Leia and the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron. Daniels complained that his character was a \"table decoration\" in this film, and that C-3PO is \"worth more than that\".\nIn \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (2019), the droid and his companions travel to Passana, where they search for a clue to the location of a Sith wayfinder. With the help of Lando, they locate the clue\u2014a dagger with inscriptions in the Sith language. C-3PO is able to translate the runes, but his programming prevents him from sharing the translation with his friends. The group travels to Kijimi, where a black-market droid-smith extracts the message from C-3PO, erasing his memory in the process. When C-3PO returns to the Resistance camp, R2-D2 is able to restore his memory.\nStandalone films.\nIn \"Rogue One\" (2016), C-3PO makes a cameo appearance alongside R2-D2.\nSeries.\nC-3PO appears in the live action series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" (2022) and \"Ahsoka\" (2023), and the animated series \"The Clone Wars\" (2008\u20132020), \"Forces of Destiny\" (2017\u20132018) \"Star Wars Rebels\" (2014\u20132018) and \"Star Wars Resistance\" (2018\u20132020). He is also featured in the of \"The Clone Wars\" (2008).\nOther.\nC-3PO appears in the comics \"Star Wars\" (2015\u2013present), ' (2015), ' (2016) and \"\" (2016\u20132018), as well as the novel (2016). He also appears in the radio adaptations of the original film trilogy (1981, 1983, and 1996).\n\"Star Wars Legends\".\nFollowing the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise. The \"Legends\" works comprise a separate narrative universe.\nNovels.\nIn \"The Truce at Bakura\" (1994), C-3PO translates Ssi-ruuvi, the language of the Ssi-ruuk, to aid the Alliance. C-3PO and R2-D2 are members of the Senate Planetary Intelligence Network (SPIN) in \"The Glove of Darth Vader\" (1992), and are disguised as Kessel droids so they can infiltrate a gathering of Imperials. In \"The Courtship of Princess Leia\" (1994), C-3PO is led to believe that Han is ancestrally the King of Corellia during Han's competition with Prince Isolder for Leia's hand in marriage. C-3PO agrees to assist Han as a counselor droid, but is shocked when Han kidnaps Leia and takes her to Dathomir. He later discovers that Han's ancestor was merely a pretender to the throne. Following Han and Leia's marriage, C-3PO travels with them to Tatooine in \"Tatooine Ghost\" (2003). He helps them search for an Alderaanian moss painting storing a valuable code. He also reunites with Kitster Banai and Wald, childhood friends of Anakin Skywalker. With their help, C-3PO discovers Shmi Skywalker's diary.\nIn \"Heir to the Empire\" (1991), Lando reprograms C-3PO to sound like Leia in order to hide from Imperials on Nkllon. The Empire, led by Grand Admiral Thrawn, sees through the deception. In \"Dark Force Rising\" (1992), C-3PO goes to Honoghr with Leia during the Thrawn Crisis to discover what caused the plight of the Noghri. He is forced to hide with Leia and Chewbacca when Imperial forces arrive, but later returns to Coruscant, where Leia gives birth to Jaina and Jacen Solo. He cares for the twins, and later Anakin Solo as well. C-3PO accompanies Han, Lando, R2-D2, Luke, Chewbacca, and Mara Jade to Wayland in \"The Last Command\" (1993). The party recruits aid from the local population and destroys the Mount Tantiss storehouse.\nIn \"Dark Apprentice\" (1994), the Solo twins elude Chewbacca and C-3PO during a trip to a Coruscant zoo, and arrive in the planet's sub-levels. C-3PO frantically searches for them, but they are found by King Onibald Daykim and reunited with their parents. C-3PO and R2-D2 accompany Leia on a diplomatic mission to Nam Chorios in \"Planet of Twilight\" (1997). They are unable to prevent her kidnapping and fail to stop the Death Seed plague unleashed by Seti Ashgad and Dzym. Eventually rescued by Han and Lando, the two droids convey their message for help. In \"The Crystal Star\" (1994), C-3PO accompanies Luke and Han to Crseih Station to investigate the possible existence of Jedi trainees, but instead find Waru, a creature from another dimension. They learn of Waru's alliance with Lord Hethrir and of the kidnapping of the Solo children. Hethrir is destroyed following a confrontation with Leia, Han, and Luke.\nIn \"The Black Fleet Crisis\" trilogy, C-3PO accompanies Lando, R2-D2, and Lando's associate Lobot to investigate the runaway alien ship \"\". They eventually discover that the ship contains the last vestiges of the Quella civilization. In \"The New Rebellion\" (1997), C-3PO and several companions are instrumental in stopping Kueller from regaining power by disabling explosive devices he had placed in a large number of droids. During the outbreak of the First Corellian Insurrection in \"Ambush at Corellia\" (1995), C-3PO and Chewbacca retrieve Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin from the burning Corona House. In \"Showdown at Centerpoint\" (1995), the protocol droid accompanies Luke, Lando, Gaeriel Captison and Belindi Kalenda to Centerpoint Station. He informs them that the temperature inside Hollowtown has increased to dangerously high levels. He serves as a translator for Talon Karrde's expedition to the Kathol Sector in \"Vision of the Future\" (1998).\nComics.\nAccording to the \"Star Wars\" comic strip, C-3PO was activated on the planet Affa hundreds of years before the events of the original \"Star Wars\" film. \"A Guide to the Star Wars Universe\" states his activation date as 112 years before \"Star Wars\". In the \"Star Wars Tales\" story \"Thank the Maker\", Vader remembers finding the defunct droid in Watto's junk heap and guessing it was several decades old. In the \"\" story \"The New Face of War\", Queen Jamillia appoints C-3PO to serve as a liaison to the Jedi. In 1994, Dark Horse Comics serialized a story titled \"Droids,\" which led to a 14-issue comic series continuing the adventures of C-3PO and R2-D2 before the events of \"Star Wars\". Lucasfilm did not require this series to align narratively with the animated series \"Droids\". Anthony Daniels and Ryder Windham also co-wrote a 1997 one-shot comic titled \"The Protocol Offensive\".\nIn \"Empire's End\" (1997), C-3PO and R2-D2 are nearly destroyed after they spot an Imperial installing a homing beacon on the\" Millennium Falcon\", but are saved by Han and Chewbacca. The resurrected Palpatine and his fleet discover the Alliance's existence, leading C-3PO and the others to flee to Iziz, a city on the planet of Onderon. Palpatine eventually finds them, but is mortally wounded by Han and destroyed when Empatojayos Brand sacrifices himself to save Anakin Solo. C-3PO is found partially destroyed and abandoned by two slave boys, Otalp and Remoh, in the \"Star Wars Tales\" story \"Storyteller\", which takes place after the original film trilogy. The droid tells them stories of Luke's adventures, and they imagine the stories played out by members of their own alien race. As he is finishing his tale, a Vindar slavedriver appears, blasts C-3PO's head off, and kills Otalp. Later, Remoh finds hope for his people's freedom when he discovers a lightsaber in the remains of C-3PO's body.\nAnimated series.\nIn addition to novels and comics, some animated series are part of \"Star Wars\" \"Legends.\" In ' (1985), which takes place between \"Revenge of the Sith\" and \"Star Wars\", C-3PO and R2-D2 are traded among various masters. In ' (2003), C-3PO's outer plating is upgraded during his tenure as Padm\u00e9's servant. He is a reluctant participant in many of her adventures, including a hazardous mission during the Battle of Ilum. On this mission, he helps Yoda rescue the Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and the Padawan Barriss Offee.\nOther appearances.\nOutside of the official canon and the \"Legends\" universe, C-3PO appears in the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" (1978), \"The Muppet Show\", The Stars of Star Wars (1980), \"Sesame Street\" (1980), \"The Lego Movie\" (2014), ' (2016), \"The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special\" (2020), (2022), the animated short \"How NOT to Draw R2-D2\" (2024), ' (2024-2025) and various video games. The character also appears in a 2014 \"Star Wars\"-themed episode of the animated television series \"Phineas and Ferb.\"\nImpact on Real-World Robotics and Society.\nC-3PO, often paired with R2-D2, has played a surprisingly influential role in shaping how people imagine robots and artificial intelligence. Commentators have pointed out that the \"Star Wars\" franchise helped form public perceptions for what robots should look and behave like, particularly when designed to interact with humans rather than worker robots operating in factories or warehouses. Unlike the quintessential portrayal of robots as threatening or emotionless, C-3PO is anxious, polite, and focused on translation and etiquette. That combination of traits aligns closely with what researchers today describe as a \"social robot\". Discussions about automation and future labor often reference this portrayal, noting that \"Star Wars\" presented robots as collaborators and helpers long before those ideas entered mainstream policy debates.\nC-3PO's impact is also evident in how the Roboticist community communicate their research with the public. Science writers and engineers frequently use C-3PO as a benchmark when explaining how far current technology still is from producing a robot capable of natural conversation or cultural fluency. Human\u2013robot interaction studies echo this pattern: people\u2019s expectations of real robots are often shaped by the fictional ones they grew up with, and C-3PO is one of the figures most commonly cited in this context. Even within academic writing on android design, C-3PO is frequently brought up as an example of a artificial being built to learn from and adapt to the humans around it.\nBeyond technology, C-3PO\u2019s design and role tie into longer-running cultural questions about artificial labor and personhood. The humanoid form traces back to iconic cinematic robots like the Maschinenmensch from \"Metropolis\", which established visual and narrative traditions around automated mechanical workers. In the Star Wars universe, C-3PO clearly expresses fear, worry, and personal preference, yet he and other droids remain property. Analysts have argued that this tension of sentient beings being treated as tools reflects the films\u2019 depiction of droids as an exploited labor class. Commentators have examined this dynamic through moral, political, and class-based perspectives, describing droids as a permanent servant group within the galaxy\u2019s social order. Some writers extend this critique by focusing on how droid suffering is framed: the films often show droids in pain or distress but rarely treat that pain as meaningful or deserving of empathy.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is a small, green, elderly humanoid alien who is powerful with the Force, and he typically speaks in an inverted phrase order. He first appeared in the 1980 film \"The Empire Strikes Back\", in which he is voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, who reprised the role in \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), the prequel trilogy, the sequel trilogy, and the animated series \"Star Wars Rebels\". Other actors who have voiced Yoda are Tom Kane, Piotr Michael, John Lithgow, Tony Pope and Peter McConnell. In addition to films and television series, Yoda appears in comics, novels, video games and commercials.\nIn the original trilogy, Yoda lives in solitude on the swamp planet Dagobah. He is introduced as a former mentor of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he trains Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force until his death at the age of 900. In the prequel films, Yoda leads the Jedi High Council and trains young Jedi until they are assigned to a master. When the Clone Wars break out, he becomes a general in the army of the Republic and leads several legions of clone troopers. Yoda is one of the few Jedi to survive the events of Order 66 at the end of the war, when he battles Darth Sidious and is forced to go into hiding. Yoda's Force spirit appears again in the sequel trilogy, advising an older Luke on his training of Rey.\nCreation.\nThe \"Star Wars\" franchise was created by George Lucas, who wrote and directed the original \"Star Wars\" film (1977). He created the character Obi-Wan Kenobi as a mentor for Luke Skywalker, and originally planned for Obi-Wan to continue training Luke in the sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back\". However, Lucas ultimately decided that Obi-Wan would die in the first film. Lucas then introduced a new mentor character, who was originally a diminutive frog-like creature called \"Minch Yoda\". The name \"Yoda\" was chosen because Lucas envisioned the character as a \"little Dalai Lama\", and he wanted him to have an \"Eastern-sounding\" name. One of the film's screenwriters, Lawrence Kasdan, said that Yoda was based on Shimada, the lead samurai from the 1954 Akira Kurosawa film \"Seven Samurai\". According to Lucas, the narrative goal of Yoda's design was to teach Luke \"to respect everybody and pay attention to the poorest person\". Lucas wanted the Jedi Master to be the \"exact opposite\" of what audiences would expect.\nThe film's visual effects art director, Joe Johnston, sketched hundreds of different versions of Yoda. The design that Lucas finally settled on was described by Johnston as a combination of a leprechaun, a troll and a gnome. Lucas gave Yoda a backward speech pattern because he felt the character needed a unique way of speaking that was more dramatic than an accent.\nPortrayal.\nThe production team working on \"The Empire Strikes Back\" considered several ways of portraying Yoda, such as using stop-motion animation or dressing a monkey, a child or a dwarf in a Yoda costume. They ultimately decided to use a sophisticated puppet, which was created by Stuart Freeborn and Wendy Froud. Freeborn based Yoda's face on his own facial features and those of Albert Einstein, hoping that Einstein's features would make the character appear intelligent. Lucas asked Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, to perform the puppeteering for Yoda. Henson was busy with another project, however, and recommended Frank Oz for the role. To perform Yoda in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Oz inserted his hand into the puppet's head to manipulate the mouth and brow. Kathryn Mullen, Wendy Froud and David Barclay operated Yoda's eyes, ears and other body parts using cables, strings, hydraulics and electronic mechanisms. There was also a radio-controlled Yoda puppet that was used when the Jedi Master is riding on Luke's back. Lucas had intended for a different actor to provide Yoda's voice, but ultimately decided that Oz was the best performer for the role.\nIn the original 1999 release of \"\", Yoda was portrayed by a new puppet in all but two shots. In these two wide shots, the character was created using computer-generated imagery (CGI). The puppet was replaced with a digital Yoda in the 2011 Blu-ray release of the film and the 2012 theatrical 3D release. In \"Attack of the Clones\" (2002) and \"Revenge of the Sith\" (2005), Yoda is entirely computer-generated. The digital character accomplishes movements not possible with the puppet, such as fighting with a lightsaber. In \"Revenge of the Sith\", Yoda's face is shown in several close-ups, which required highly detailed CGI work.\nReception.\nYoda was well-received by several prominent critics when he debuted in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in 1980. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called him \"delightful\" and \"the hit of the movie\", but felt he was only a success when used sparingly. Joy Gould Boyum of \"The Wall Street Journal\" praised the \"exquisitely constructed\" Yoda puppet, and said that Oz \"so finely put together [the character]...as to make us wonder continually if he isn't real.\" Arthur Knight of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" similarly felt that Yoda was incredibly lifelike, with Arnold comparing his face to that of a human actor. Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called Yoda the highlight of the film, while \"People\" magazine called him a pivotal character. In his review of the 1997 re-release of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Roger Ebert praised the range of emotions conveyed by Yoda, and said his acting was possibly the best in the film.\nYoda has been a popular character since his introduction more than forty years ago. Brandon Katz of \"Observer\" has called him an icon of cinema. \"Empire\" magazine claimed that after the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, Yoda is the \"most beloved\" character in the \"Star Wars\" franchise.\nAppearances.\nOriginal trilogy.\nYoda was introduced in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), in which he is puppeteered and voiced by Frank Oz. In the film, Luke arrives on Dagobah to seek his guidance at the behest of Obi-Wan's Force spirit. At first, Yoda does not identify himself to Luke and instead tests his patience by provoking him. Luke is shocked when he discovers that this small, eccentric creature is the powerful Jedi Master he was seeking. Finding Luke to be impatient and undisciplined, Yoda is reluctant to mentor him in the ways of the Force, but agrees to the task after conferring with Obi-Wan. Before finishing his training, Luke chooses to leave Dagobah to confront Darth Vader and help his friends in Cloud City. Yoda and Obi-Wan warn that he is not ready, but Luke leaves anyway. When Obi-Wan laments that Luke is their \"last hope\", Yoda reminds him that \"there is another\".\nYoda appears briefly in \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), again performed and voiced by Oz. Now sick and frail, he tells Luke that his training is complete, but that he will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader. Yoda also confirms that Vader is Luke's father, something Vader had told Luke in the previous film. Yoda then peacefully dies at the age of 900, his body disappearing as he becomes \"one with the Force\". He leaves Luke with the knowledge that \"there is another Skywalker.\" Soon after, Obi-Wan's spirit helps Luke realize that the \"other\" is his twin sister, Princess Leia. In the film's final scene, Yoda's spirit appears on Endor alongside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker.\nPrequel trilogy.\nA younger Yoda appears in the prequel trilogy, beginning with ' (1999). In the film\u2014which is set 35 years before \"The Empire Strikes Back\"\u2014Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn brings the young Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi Council. Convinced that Anakin is the \"Chosen One\" of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force, Qui-Gon requests that the boy be trained as a Jedi. Yoda senses great fear in Anakin, especially in regards to his attachment to his mother Shmi, and foresees \"grave danger\" in his training. The Council, led by Mace Windu, rejects Qui-Gon's request. When Qui-Gon is mortally wounded in a duel with the Sith Lord Darth Maul, his dying request is that his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi train Anakin. Obi-Wan tells Yoda that he will train the boy, even without the Council's approval. Yoda reluctantly gives his blessing to Anakin's training.' (2002) is set a decade after \"The Phantom Menace\". Yoda is now the Master of the High Council in addition to his position as Grandmaster. He and many other Jedi are concerned about the emergence of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a secessionist movement seeking independence from the Galactic Republic. After the first attempted assassination of Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Chancellor Palpatine suggests that she be put under the protection of Obi-Wan, who is training Anakin. At the climax of the film, Yoda saves Obi-Wan and Anakin from the Separatists and defeats his former apprentice, Count Dooku, in a lightsaber duel.\nIn \"\" (2005), Yoda and the Jedi Council pursue the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Palpatine has now amassed near-dictatorial emergency powers, and begins interfering in Jedi affairs. The Council orders Anakin to spy on Palpatine, whom he considers a friend and mentor. Anakin seeks Yoda's counsel about his prophetic visions that someone close to him will die. Yoda, unaware that Anakin is referring to Padm\u00e9, tells him to train himself to let go of everything he fears to lose. Unsatisfied, Anakin turns to Palpatine, who then reveals himself as Darth Sidious. The Sith Lord manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his apprentice, suggesting that the dark side of the Force can save Padm\u00e9 from dying.\nSidious transforms the Republic into the Galactic Empire, proclaiming himself emperor and ordering the clone troopers to kill their Jedi generals. Through the Force, Yoda feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are betrayed by their own troops. After killing the clone troopers instructed to assassinate him, he escapes with the Wookiee leaders Tarfful and Chewbacca to Coruscant, where he and Obi-Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple. They discover that all the Jedi inside have been slaughtered, including the children. Yoda and Obi-Wan find a recording revealing that Anakin\u2014now known as Darth Vader\u2014was the assassin. Yoda decides to face Sidious, and sends Obi-Wan to kill Vader. When Obi-Wan protests, Yoda tells him that the Anakin he knew no longer exists. Yoda battles Sidious in a lightsaber duel in the Senate. In the end, neither is able to overcome the other and Yoda is forced to retreat. After Padm\u00e9 dies in childbirth, Yoda recommends that her infant twins Luke and Leia be hidden from Vader and Sidious; he sends Leia to Alderaan and Luke to Tatooine. At the end of the film, it is revealed that Yoda has been learning the secret of immortality from Qui-Gon's spirit and passing it on to Obi-Wan.\nSequel trilogy.\nOz reprises the Yoda role in the sequel trilogy, both as a puppeteer and as a voice actor. The first film of the trilogy, ' (2015), takes place thirty years after Yoda's death in \"Return of the Jedi\". When the scavenger Rey has a Force vision and discovers Luke's lightsaber, she hears Yoda's voice. In ' (2017), Yoda appears to Luke as a Force spirit. As Luke considers whether to burn down a tree storing sacred Jedi texts, Yoda reminds him that a Jedi must always be sure of his path. When Luke decides to burn down the tree, Yoda summons a lightning bolt and sets it ablaze. Luke is suddenly concerned about the loss of the texts, but Yoda assures him that they contained no knowledge that Rey does not already possess. Yoda's voice is heard again in \"\" (2019) when many deceased Jedi are speaking to Rey during her battle against the resurrected Darth Sidious.\n\"The Clone Wars\".\nYoda appears in the 2008 animated film \"\" and the of the same name. He is voiced by Tom Kane in both productions. In the film, he assigns Anakin an apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, believing the responsibility will help him grow as a Jedi and mature as a person. Throughout most of the series, Yoda is on Coruscant with the Jedi Council, but he occasionally leaves for certain tasks, such as negotiations with King Katuunko on Rugosa and a confrontation with Asajj Ventress's droid army. Yoda also watches over Anakin and Ahsoka, pleased that they are both maturing with each other's influence. In season five, Ahsoka is framed for a crime she did not commit, and Yoda and the Jedi Council turn her over to the Republic military. Before a verdict is read in Ahsoka's trial, Anakin reveals the true culprit, the fallen Jedi Barriss Offee. Yoda, Anakin, and the Council then invite Ahsoka to rejoin the Order, but she refuses.\nIn the sixth season, Yoda hears the voice of the deceased Qui-Gon Jinn. He travels to Dagobah to find answers. He sees cryptic visions of the fall of the Jedi, and learns that he has been chosen to manifest his consciousness after death as a Force spirit. A group of spirit priestesses then gives him various tests, including facing an illusion of the ancient Sith Lord Darth Bane. His final challenge is to resist an attempt by Sidious and Dooku to lure him to the dark side. Yoda engages in a metaphysical battle with Sidious and seemingly sacrifices himself to save Anakin, only to awaken and discover that the battle was merely a vision, and that he passed the test. The priestesses inform Yoda that his training will resume in time.\n\"Star Wars Rebels\".\nYoda returns in the animated series \"Star Wars Rebels\" (2014\u20132018).\"\" In the season one episode \"Path of the Jedi\", he telepathically communicates with the Jedi apprentice Ezra Bridger and his master Kanan Jarrus, helping the pair to understand their true motivations. In the season two episode \"Shroud of Darkness\", Yoda appears to Ezra in a vision.\n\"Tales of the Jedi\".\nYoda appears in two episodes of \"Tales of the Jedi\" (2022), although he has no dialogue. In the third episode, he attends the funeral of Jedi Master Katri, and in the fifth episode he observes the training of Ahsoka.\nOther.\nYoda is voiced by John Lithgow in the radio dramatizations of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1983) and \"Return of the Jedi\" (1996). He is featured in the audio drama ' and the novel \"Master and Apprentice\", both released in 2019. He appears in the web series \"Forces of Destiny\" (2017\u20132018), the children's television series ' (2023\u2013present) and the 2021 comic \"\", which takes place 200 years before the prequel trilogy. He also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the final episode of the television series \"The Acolyte\" (2024). In 2012, Yoda was featured in a series of Vodafone commercials, which were broadcast in the United Kingdom. \n\"Star Wars Legends\".\nFollowing the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise. The \"Legends\" works comprise a separate narrative universe.\nNovels and comics.\nYoda appears in the 2004 Sean Stewart novel \"Yoda: Dark Rendezvous\", in which he sends an impersonator of himself to negotiate a treaty with Dooku. He is also a character in the comic series \".\"\n\"Clone Wars\".\nYoda is voiced by Tom Kane in the animated television series \"\", which aired on Cartoon Network from 2003 to 2005. In the series, Yoda becomes a general during the Clone Wars. While escorting Padm\u00e9 on a journey, he senses a Force disturbance on the planet Ilum. After using a Jedi mind trick to convince Captain Typho to take them there, Yoda saves the lives of two Jedi. In the final episode of the series, Yoda fights alongside Mace Windu to defend Coruscant, which is under attack from the Separatists. The two Jedi Masters realize too late that the battle was intended to distract them from the kidnapping of Palpatine by the Separatist leader General Grievous. \"Clone Wars\" was removed from the official canon in 2014 and placed in the \"Legends\" universe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nhttps:// in the \"StarWars.com\" Databank"}

Officially known as the Cimeti\u00e8re du Nord, it is the third largest necropolis in Paris, after the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery and the Montparnasse Cemetery.\nHistory.\nIn the mid-18th century, overcrowding in the cemeteries of Paris had created numerous problems, from impossibly high funeral costs to unsanitary living conditions in the surrounding neighborhoods. In the 1780s, the Cimeti\u00e8re des Innocents was officially closed and citizens were banned from burying corpses within the city limits of Paris. During the early 19th century, new cemeteries were constructed outside the precincts of the capital: Montmartre in the north, P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in the east, Passy Cemetery in the west and Montparnasse Cemetery in the south.\nThe Montmartre Cemetery was opened on 1 January 1825. It was initially known as le Cimeti\u00e8re des Grandes Carri\u00e8res (Cemetery of the Large Quarries). The name referenced the cemetery's unique location, in an abandoned gypsum quarry. The quarry had previously been used during the French Revolution as a mass grave. It was built below street level, in the hollow of an abandoned gypsum quarry located west of the \"Butte\" near the beginning of Rue Caulaincourt in \"Place de Clichy.\" As is still the case today, its sole entrance was constructed on Avenue Rachel under Rue Caulaincourt.\nA popular tourist destination, Montmartre Cemetery is the final resting place of many famous artists who lived and worked in the Montmartre area.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63173", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63173", "title": "Joyce Kilmer", "text": "American poet, editor, literary critic, soldier (1886\u20131918)\nAlfred Joyce Kilmer (December 6, 1886 \u2013 July 30, 1918) was an American writer and poet mainly remembered for a short poem titled \"Trees\" (1913), which was published in the collection \"Trees and Other Poems\" in 1914. Though a prolific poet whose works celebrated the common beauty of the natural world as well as his Catholic faith, Kilmer was also a journalist, literary critic, lecturer, and editor. At the time of his deployment to Europe during World War I, Kilmer was considered the leading American Catholic poet and lecturer of his generation, whom critics often compared to British contemporaries G. K. Chesterton (1874\u20131936) and Hilaire Belloc (1870\u20131953). He enlisted in the New York National Guard and was deployed to France with the 69th Infantry Regiment (the famous \"Fighting 69th\") in 1917. He was killed by a sniper's bullet at the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918 at the age of 31. He was married to Aline Murray, also an accomplished poet and author, with whom he had five children.\nWhile most of his works are largely unknown today, a select few of his poems remain popular and are published frequently in anthologies. Several critics\u2014including both Kilmer's contemporaries and modern scholars\u2014have dismissed Kilmer's work as being too simple and overly sentimental, and suggested that his style was far too traditional, even archaic. Many writers, including notably Ogden Nash, have parodied Kilmer's work and style\u2014as attested by the many imitations of \"Trees.\"\nBiography.\nEarly years and education: 1886\u20131908.\nKilmer was born December 6, 1886, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the fourth and youngest child, of Annie Ellen Kilburn, a minor writer and composer, and Frederick Barnett Kilmer, a physician and analytical chemist employed by the Johnson and Johnson Company and inventor of the company's baby powder. He was named Alfred Joyce Kilmer after two priests at Christ Church in New Brunswick: Alfred R. Taylor, the curate; and Elisha Brooks Joyce, the rector. Christ Church is the oldest Episcopal parish in New Brunswick and the Kilmer family were parishioners. Rector Joyce, who served the parish from 1883 to 1916, baptised the young Kilmer, who remained an Episcopalian until his 1913 conversion to Catholicism. Kilmer's birthplace in New Brunswick, where the Kilmer family lived from 1886 to 1892, is still standing and houses a small museum to Kilmer, as well as a few Middlesex County government offices.\nKilmer entered Rutgers College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School) in 1895 at the age of 8. During his years at the Grammar School, Kilmer was editor-in-chief of the school's paper, the \"Argo\", and loved the classics but had difficulty with Greek. He won the first Lane Classical Prize, for oratory, and obtained a scholarship to Rutgers College which he would attend the following year. Despite his difficulties with Greek and mathematics, he stood at the head of his class in preparatory school.\nAfter graduating from Rutgers College Grammar School in 1904, he continued his education at Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) from 1904 to 1906. At Rutgers, Kilmer was associate editor of the \"Targum\", the campus newspaper, and a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. However, he was unable to complete the curriculum's rigorous mathematics requirement and was asked to repeat his sophomore year. Under pressure from his mother, Kilmer transferred to Columbia University in New York City.\nAt Columbia, Kilmer was vice-president of the Philolexian Society (a literary society), associate editor of \"Columbia Spectator\" (the campus newspaper), and member of the Debating Union. He completed his Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree and graduated from Columbia on May 23, 1908. Shortly after graduation, on June 9, 1908, he married Aline Murray (1888\u20131941), a fellow poet to whom he had been engaged since his sophomore year at Rutgers. The Kilmers had five children: Kenton Sinclair Kilmer (1909\u20131995); Rose Kilburn Kilmer (1912\u20131917); Deborah Clanton Kilmer (1914\u20131999), who became a nun (\"Sister Michael\") at the Saint Benedict Monastery, St. Joseph, Minnesota; Michael Barry Kilmer (1916\u20131927); and Christopher Kilmer (1917\u20131984).\nYears of writing and faith: 1909\u20131917.\nIn the autumn of 1908, Kilmer was employed teaching Latin at Morristown High School in Morristown, New Jersey. At this time, he began to submit essays to \"Red Cross Notes\" (including his first published piece, an essay on the \"Psychology of Advertising\") and his early poems to literary periodicals. Kilmer also wrote book reviews for \"The Literary Digest\", \"Town &amp; Country\", \"The Nation\", and \"The New York Times\". By June 1909, Kilmer had abandoned any aspirations to continue teaching and relocated to New York City, where he focused solely on developing a career as a writer.\nFrom 1909 to 1912, Kilmer was employed by Funk and Wagnalls, which was preparing an edition of \"The Standard Dictionary\" that would be published in 1912. According to Hillis, Kilmer's job \"was to define ordinary words assigned to him at five cents for each word defined. This was a job at which one would ordinarily earn ten to twelve dollars a week, but Kilmer attacked the task with such vigor and speed that it was soon thought wisest to put him on a regular salary.\"\nIn 1911, Kilmer's first book of verse was published, entitled \"Summer of Love.\" Kilmer later wrote, \"some of the poems in it, those inspired by genuine love, are not things of which to be ashamed, and you, understanding, would not be offended by the others.\"\nIn 1912, Kilmer became a special writer for the \"New York Times Review of Books\" and the \"New York Times Sunday Magazine\" and was often engaged in lecturing. He moved to Mahwah, New Jersey, where he resided until his service and death in World War I. By this time he had become established as a published poet and as a popular lecturer. According to Robert Holliday, Kilmer \"frequently neglected to make any preparation for his speeches, not even choosing a subject until the beginning of the dinner which was to culminate in a specimen of his oratory. His constant research for the dictionary, and, later on, for his New York Times articles, must have given him a store of knowledge at his fingertips to be produced at a moment's notice for these emergencies.\"\nWhen the Kilmers' daughter Rose (1912\u20131917) was stricken with poliomyelitis (also known as infantile paralysis) shortly after birth, they turned to their religious faith for comfort. A series of correspondence between Kilmer and Fr. James J. Daly led the Kilmers to convert to Catholicism, and they were received in the church in 1913. In one of these letters, Kilmer writes that he \"believed in the Catholic position, the Catholic view of ethics and aesthetics, for a long time,\" and he \"wanted something not intellectual, some conviction not mental \u2013 in fact I wanted Faith.\" Kilmer would stop \"every morning for months\" on his way \"to the office and prayed for faith,\" claiming that when \"faith did come, it came, I think, by way of my little paralyzed daughter. Her lifeless hands led me; I think her tiny feet know beautiful paths. You understand this and it gives me a selfish pleasure to write it down.\"\nWith the publication of \"Trees\" in the magazine \"Poetry\" in August 1913, Kilmer gained immense popularity as a poet across the United States. He had established himself as a successful lecturer\u2014particularly one seeking to reach a Catholic audience. His close friend and editor Robert Holliday wrote that it \"is not an unsupported assertion to say that he was in his time and place the laureate of the Catholic Church.\" \"Trees and Other Poems\" (1914) was published the following year. This collection also introduced the popular poem \"The House With Nobody In It\". Over the next few years, Kilmer was prolific in his output, managing an intense schedule of lectures, publishing a large number of essays and literary criticism, and writing poetry. In 1915 he became poetry editor of \"Current Literature\" and contributing editor of \"Warner's Library of the World's Best Literature\". In 1916 and 1917, before the American entry into World War I, Kilmer would publish four books: \"The Circus and Other Essays\" (1916), a series of interviews with literary personages entitled \"Literature in the Making\" (1917), \"Main Street and Other Poems\" (1917), and \"Dreams and Images: An Anthology of Catholic Poets\" (1917). In the aftermath of the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland, Kilmer helped organize a large memorial service in New Yorks Central Park for those who died in that conflict.\nWar years: 1917\u20131918.\nIn April 1917, a few days after the United States entered World War I, Kilmer enlisted in the Seventh Regiment of the New York National Guard. In August, Kilmer was assigned as a statistician with the 165th Infantry Regiment (better known as the re-designated \"Fighting 69th\", the 69th New York Infantry Regiment), of the 42nd \"Rainbow\" Division, and quickly rose to the rank of sergeant. Though he was eligible for commission as an officer and often recommended for such posts during the course of the war, Kilmer refused, stating that he would rather be a sergeant in the Fighting 69th than an officer in any other regiment.\nShortly before his deployment to Europe, the Kilmers' daughter Rose died, and twelve days later their son Christopher was born. Before his departure, Kilmer had contracted with publishers to write a book about the war, deciding upon the title \"Here and There with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth\". The regiment arrived in France in November 1917, and Kilmer wrote to his wife that he had not written \"anything in prose or verse since I got here\u2014except statistics\u2014but I've stored up a lot of memories to turn into copy when I get a chance.\" Kilmer did not write such a book; however, toward the end of the year, he did find time to write prose sketches and poetry. The most notable of his poems during this period was \"Rouge Bouquet\" (1918) which commemorated the deaths of two dozen members of his regiment in a German artillery barrage on American trench positions in the Rouge Bouquet forest north-east of the French village of Baccarat. At the time, this was a relatively quiet sector of the front, but the first battalion was struck by a German heavy artillery bombardment on the afternoon of March 7, 1918, that buried 21 men of the unit, killing 19 (of which 14 remained entombed).\nKilmer sought more hazardous duty and was transferred to the military intelligence section of his regiment, in April 1918. In a letter to his wife, Aline, he remarked: \"Now I'm doing work I love \u2013 and work you may be proud of. None of the drudgery of soldiering, but a double share of glory and thrills.\" According to Hillis, Kilmer's fellow soldiers had accorded him much respect for his battlefield demeanour\u2014\"He was worshipped by the men about him. I have heard them speak with awe of his coolness and his nerve in scouting patrols in no man's land. This coolness and his habit of choosing, with typical enthusiasm, the most dangerous and difficult missions, led to his death.\"\nDeath and burial.\nDuring the Second Battle of Marne there was heavy fighting throughout the last days of July 1918. On July 30, 1918, Kilmer volunteered to accompany Major \"Wild Bill\" Donovan (later, in World War II, the founder of the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency) when Donovan's battalion (1\u2013165th Infantry) was sent to lead the day's attack.\nDuring the course of the day, Kilmer led a scouting party to find the position of a German machine gun. When his comrades found him, some time later, they thought at first that he was peering over the edge of a little hill, where he had crawled for a better view. When he did not answer their call, they ran to him and found him dead. According to Father Francis P. Duffy: \"A bullet had pierced his brain. His body was carried in and buried by the side of Ames. God rest his dear and gallant soul.\" A sniper's bullet likely killed him instantly. According to military records, Kilmer died on the battlefield near Muercy Farm, beside the Ourcq River near the village of Seringes-et-Nesles, in France, on July 30, 1918, at the age of 31. For his valor, Kilmer was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre (War Cross) by the French Republic.\nKilmer was buried in the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial, near Fere-en-Tardenois, Aisne, Picardy, France just across the road and stream from the farm where he was killed. A cenotaph erected to his memory is located on the Kilmer family plot in Elmwood Cemetery, in North Brunswick, New Jersey. A Memorial Mass was celebrated at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City on October 14, 1918.\nWorks.\n\"Trees\".\nJoyce Kilmer's reputation as a poet is staked largely on the widespread popularity of one poem\u2014\"Trees\" (1913). It was first published in the August 1913 issue of \"Poetry: A Magazine of Verse\" which had begun publishing the year before in Chicago, Illinois and was included as the title poem in a collection of poems \"Trees and Other Poems\" (1914). According to Kilmer's oldest son, Kenton, the poem was written on February 2, 1913, when the family resided in Mahwah, New Jersey.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was written in the afternoon in the intervals of some other writing. The desk was in an upstairs room, by a window looking down a wooded hill. It was written in a little notebook in which his father and mother wrote out copies of several of their poems, and, in most cases, added the date of composition. On one page the first two lines of 'Trees' appear, with the date, February 2, 1913, and on another page, further on in the book, is the full text of the poem. It was dedicated to his wife's mother, Mrs. Henry Mills Alden, who was endeared to all her family.\nMany locations including Rutgers University (where Kilmer attended for two years), University of Notre Dame, as well as historians in Mahwah, New Jersey and in other places, have boasted that a specific tree was the inspiration for Kilmer's poem. However, Kenton Kilmer refutes these claims, remarking that, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mother and I agreed, when we talked about it, that Dad never meant his poem to apply to one particular tree, or to the trees of any special region. Just any trees or all trees that might be rained on or snowed on, and that would be suitable nesting places for robins. I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.\"\nThe popular appeal of this simple poem is likely the source of its endurance despite the continuing negative opinion of the poem's merits from scholars and critics. According to Robert Holliday, Kilmer's friend and editor, \"Trees\" speaks \"with authentic song to the simplest of hearts\" and that \"(t)he exquisite title poem now so universally known, made his reputation more than all the rest he had written put together. That impeccable lyric which made for immediate widespread popularity.\" Its popularity has also led to parodies of the poem\u2014some by noted poets and writers. The pattern of its first lines (\"I think that I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree.\") is of seemingly simple rhyme and meter and easy to mimic along with the poem's choice of metaphors. One of the best known parodies is \"Song of the Open Road\" by American humorist and poet Ogden Nash (1902\u20131971):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInfluences upon Kilmer's verse.\nKilmer's early works were inspired by, and were imitative of, the poetry of Algernon Charles Swinburne, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Ernest Dowson, Aubrey Beardsley, and William Butler Yeats (and the Celtic Revival). It was later through the influence of works by Coventry Patmore, Francis Thompson, and those of Alice Meynell and her children Viola Meynell and Francis Meynell, that Kilmer seems to have become interested in Catholicism. Kilmer wrote of his influences:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have come to regard them with intense admiration. Patmore seems to me to be a greater poet than Francis Thompson. He has not the rich vocabulary, the decorative erudition, the Shelleyan enthusiasm, which distinguish the \"Sister Songs\" and the \"Hound of Heaven,\" but he has a classical simplicity, a restraint and sincerity which make his poems satisfying.\nBecause he was initially raised Episcopalian (or Anglican), Kilmer became literary editor of the Anglican weekly, \"The Churchman\", before his conversion to Catholicism. During this time he did considerable research into 16th and 17th century Anglican poets as well as metaphysical, or mystic poets of that time, including George Herbert, Thomas Traherne, Robert Herrick, Bishop Coxe, and Robert Stephen Hawker (the eccentric vicar of the Church of Saint Morwenna and Saint John the Baptist at Morwenstow in Cornwall)\u2014the latter whom he referred to as \"a coast life-guard in a cassock.\" These poets also had an influence on Kilmer's writings.\nCritics compared Kilmer to British Catholic writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton\u2014suggesting that his reputation might have risen to the level where he would have been considered their American counterpart if not for his untimely death.\nLegacy.\nKilmer's death at age 31 denied him the opportunity to develop into a more mature poet. Because modern critics often dismiss \"Trees\" as simple verse, much of Kilmer's work (especially his literary criticism) has slipped into obscurity. Only a very few of his poems have appeared in anthologies, and with the exception of \"Trees\"\u2014and to a much lesser extent \"Rouge Bouquet\" (1917\u20131918)\u2014almost none have obtained lasting widespread popularity.\nThe entire corpus of Kilmer's work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and Modernism took root\u2014especially with the influence of the Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen especially in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Kilmer's verse is conservative and traditional, and does not break the formal rules of poetics\u2014he can be considered as one of the last poets of the Romantic era. His style has been criticized for not breaking free of traditional modes of rhyme, meter, and theme, and for being too sentimental to be taken seriously.\nIn the 1940 film, \"The Fighting 69th\", the role of Sergeant Joyce Kilmer was portrayed by actor Jeffrey Lynn.\nTributes.\nNew York\nNew Jersey\nIllinois\nNorth Carolina\nVirginia\nPennsylvania\nMassachusetts\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "63174", "revid": "48181213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63174", "title": "Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry", "text": "French writer and aviator (1900\u20131944)\nAntoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger, vicomte de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (29 June 1900 \u2013 c. 31 July 1944), known simply as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (, , ), was a French writer, poet, journalist and aviator.\nBorn in Lyon to an aristocratic family, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry trained as a commercial pilot in the early 1920s, working airmail routes across Europe, Africa, and South America. Between 1926 and 1939, four of his literary works were published: the short story \"The Aviator\", novels \"Southern Mail\" and \"Night Flight\", and the memoir \"Wind, Sand and Stars\". Saint-Exup\u00e9ry joined the French Air Force for World War II and flew reconnaissance missions until France's armistice with Germany in 1940. After being demobilised by the Air Force, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in exile in the United States between 1941 and 1943 and helped persuade it to enter the war. During this time, his works \"Flight to Arras\" and \"The Little Prince\" were published.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry returned to combat by joining the Free French Air Force in 1943, despite being past the maximum age for a war pilot and in declining health. On 31 July 1944, during a reconnaissance mission over Corsica, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's plane disappeared: it is presumed to have crashed. Debris from the wreckage was discovered near Marseille in 2000, but the cause of the crash remains unknown.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nYouth and aviation.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was born in Lyon, into the French aristocratic Catholic family that traced its lineage back several centuries. Their surname references the 5th-century bishop Saint Exuperius. He was the third child of Viscount Jean de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (1863\u20131904) and his wife, Marie Boyer de Fonscolombe (1875\u20131972). His father, an executive of the \"Le Soleil\" (The Sun) insurance brokerage, died of a stroke in the train station of La Foux before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 4th birthday. His father's death affected the entire family, transforming their status to that of \"impoverished aristocrats\".\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry had three sisters and a younger brother, Fran\u00e7ois, who died at age 15 of rheumatic fever contracted while both were attending the Marianist College Villa St. Jean in Fribourg, Switzerland, during World War I. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry attended to his brother, who he claimed was his closest confidant, beside his death bed, and later wrote that Fran\u00e7ois \"remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a [young] tree falls\", imagery later recrafted into the climactic ending of \"The Little Prince\". At the age of 17, now the only male in the family following the death of his brother, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry soon assumed the role of a protector and took to consoling his family, despite still being distraught over his father's death.\nAfter twice failing his final exams at a preparatory Naval Academy, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts as an auditor to study architecture for 15 months, again without graduating, and then fell into the habit of accepting odd jobs. In 1921, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry began his military service as a basic-rank soldier with the \"2e R\u00e9giment de chasseurs \u00e0 cheval\" (2nd Mounted Hunters Regiment) and was sent to Neuhof, near Strasbourg. While there, he took private flying lessons and the following year was offered a transfer from the French Army to the French Air Force. He received his pilot's wings after being posted to the 37th Fighter Regiment in Casablanca, Morocco.\nLater, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was reposted to the 34th Aviation Regiment at Le Bourget on the outskirts of Paris, and then experienced the first of his many aircraft crashes. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, influenced by the urgings of the family of his fianc\u00e9e, future novelist Louise L\u00e9v\u00eaque de Vilmorin, subsequently left the air force to take an office job. The couple ultimately broke off their engagement and he worked at several more odd jobs over the next few years.\nBy 1926, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was flying again. He became one of the pioneers of international postal flight, in the days when aircraft had few instruments. Later, he complained that those who flew the more advanced aircraft had become more like accountants than pilots. He worked for A\u00e9ropostale between Toulouse and Dakar, and then also became the airline stopover manager for the Cape Juby airfield in the Spanish zone of South Morocco, in the Sahara. His duties included negotiating the safe release of downed fliers taken hostage by Saharan tribes, a perilous task that earned him his first L\u00e9gion d'honneur from the French Government in 1930.\nIn 1929, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was transferred to Argentina, where he was appointed director of the Aeroposta Argentina airline. He lived in Buenos Aires, in the Galer\u00eda G\u00fcemes building. He surveyed new air routes across South America, negotiated agreements, and occasionally flew the airmail as well as search missions looking for downed fliers. This period of his life is briefly explored in \"Wings of Courage\", an IMAX film by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud.\nWriting career.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's first novella, \"L'Aviateur\" (\"The Aviator\"), was published in 1926 in a short-lived literary magazine, \"Le Navire d'Argent\" (\"The Silver Ship\"). In 1929, his first book, \"Courrier Sud\" (\"Southern Mail\") was published. It chronicled his time flying the Casablanca-Dakar mail route.\nThe 1931 publication of \"Night Flight\" established Saint-Exup\u00e9ry as a rising star in the literary world. It was the first of his major works to gain widespread acclaim, and it won the prix Femina. The novel mirrored his experiences as a mail pilot and director of the Aeroposta Argentina.\nThat same year, at Grasse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry married Consuelo Suncin (n\u00e9e Sunc\u00edn Sandoval), a once-divorced, once-widowed Salvadoran writer and artist, who Saint-Exup\u00e9ry described as having possessed a bohemian spirit and a \"viper's tongue\".\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry left and returned to his wife many times\u2014he saw her as both his muse, but, over the long term, the source of much of his angst. The relationship has been described as 'rocky', with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry travelling frequently and indulging in numerous affairs, most notably with the Frenchwoman H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 (1908\u20132003), known as \"Nelly\" and referred to as \"Madame de B.\" in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry biographies. Vog\u00fc\u00e9 became Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's literary executrix after his death and also wrote her own Saint-Exup\u00e9ry biography under a pseudonym, Pierre Chevrier.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry continued to write until the spring of 1943 when he left the United States with American troops bound for North Africa in the Second World War.\nCanadian and American sojourn and \"The Little Prince\".\nFollowing the German invasion of France in 1940, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew a Bloch MB.174 with the \"Groupe de reconnaissance II/33\" reconnaissance squadron of the Arm\u00e9e de l'Air.\nAfter France's armistice with Germany, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry went into exile in North America, escaping through Portugal. He stayed in Estoril, at the Hotel Pal\u00e1cio, between 28 November and 20 December 1940. He described his impressions of his stay in . On the same day that he checked out, he boarded the S.S. \"Siboney\" and arrived in New York City on the last day of 1940, with the intention of convincing the US to enter the conflict against Nazi Germany quickly. On 14 January 1941, at a Hotel Astor author luncheon attended by approximately 1,500, he belatedly received his National Book Award for \"Wind, Sand and Stars\", won a year earlier while he was occupied witnessing the destruction of the French Army. Consuelo followed him to New York City several months later after a chaotic migration to the southern French town of Opp\u00e8de, where she lived in an artist's commune, the basis of her autobiography, \"Kingdom of the Rocks: Memories of Opp\u00e8de\".\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in New York City's Central Park South in twin penthouse apartments, as well as The Bevin House mansion in Asharoken on Long Island, New York and a townhouse on Beekman Place in Manhattan.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry added the hyphen to his surname after his arrival in the United States, saying that he was annoyed with Americans addressing him as \"Mr. Exup\u00e9ry\". During this period, he authored \"Pilote de guerre (Flight to Arras)\", which earned widespread acclaim, and \"Lettre \u00e0 un otage\" (\"Letter to a Hostage\u200a\"), dedicated to the 40 million French living under Nazi oppression, in addition to numerous shorter pieces in support of France. The Saint-Exup\u00e9rys also resided in Quebec City, Canada for several weeks during the late spring of 1942. During their time in Quebec City, the family lived with the philosopher Charles De Koninck and his family, including his \"precocious\" 8-year-old son, Thomas.\nAfter he returned from his stay in Qu\u00e9bec, which had been fraught with illness and stress, the wife of one of his publishers helped persuade Saint-Exup\u00e9ry to produce a children's book, hoping to calm his nerves and also compete with the new series of \"Mary Poppins\" stories by P.L. Travers. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote and illustrated \"The Little Prince\" in New York City and the village of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October. It was published in early 1943 in both English and French in the United States, and only later appeared in France, posthumously, after the liberation of France, as his works had been banned by the collaborationist Vichy Regime. \"The Little Prince\" is dedicated to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's close friend L\u00e9on Werth.\nReturn to war.\nIn April 1943, following his 27 months in North America, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry departed with an American military convoy for Algiers, to fly with the Free French Air Force and fight with the Allies in a Mediterranean-based squadron. Then 43, soon to be promoted to the rank of commandant (major), he was far older than most men in operational units. Although eight years over the age limit for such pilots, he had petitioned endlessly for an exemption which had finally been approved by General Dwight Eisenhower. However, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had been suffering pain and immobility due to his many previous crash injuries, to the extent that he could not dress himself in his own flight suit or even turn his head leftwards to check for enemy aircraft.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was assigned with a number of other pilots to his former unit, renamed \"Groupe de reconnaissance 2/33 \"Savoie\"\", flying P-38 Lightnings, which an officer described as \"war-weary, non-airworthy craft\". The Lightnings were also more sophisticated than models he previously flew, requiring him to undertake seven weeks of stringent training before his first mission. After wrecking a P-38 through engine failure on his second mission, he was grounded for eight months, but was then later reinstated to flight duty on the personal intervention of General Ira Eaker, Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces.\nAfter Saint-Exup\u00e9ry resumed flying, he also returned to his longtime habit of reading and writing while flying his single-seat Lockheed F-5B (a specially configured P-38 reconnaissance variant). His prodigious studies of literature gripped him and on occasion, he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff, with mechanics having warmed up and tested his aircraft for him in preparation for his flight. On one flight, to the chagrin of his colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the airport for an hour after returning, so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined notebook (\"carnet\") during his long solitary flights and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him.\nDisappearance.\nBefore his return to flight duty with his squadron in North Africa, the collaborationist Vichy Regime unilaterally promoted Saint-Exup\u00e9ry as one of its members. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was shocked and dismayed by this, in keeping with his historical harsh criticism of the Vichy Regime. Subsequently, French General (later French President) Charles de Gaulle, whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry held in low regard, made a public statement that implied that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was supporting Germany. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry became depressed by these events and began to consume alcohol heavily. His physical and mental health began deteriorating. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was said, by his peers in the air force, to be intermittently subject to depression, and there was discussion about grounding him.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's last reconnaissance mission was to collect intelligence on German troop movements in and around the Rhone Valley preceding Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Although he had been reinstated to his old squadron with the provision that he was to fly only five missions, on 31 July 1944, he took off in an unarmed P-38 on his ninth reconnaissance mission from an airbase on Corsica. To the great alarm of his squadron compatriots, he did not return, vanishing without a trace. Word of his disappearance soon spread across the literary world and then it spread into international headlines.\nDiscovery at sea.\nIn September 1998, to the east of Riou Island (south of Marseille), a fisherman found a silver identity bracelet bearing the names of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, his wife Consuelo, and his American publisher, Reynal &amp; Hitchcock. The bracelet was hooked to a piece of fabric, presumably from his flight suit. Announcement of the discovery was an emotional event in France, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a national icon, and some disputed its authenticity because it was found far from his intended flight path, implying that the aircraft might not have been shot down.\nIn May 2000, a diver found debris from a Lockheed P-38 Lightning submerged off the coast of Marseille, near where the bracelet was found. The discovery galvanized the country, which had conducted searches for his aircraft and speculated on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's fate for decades. After a two-year delay imposed by the French government, the remnants of the aircraft were recovered in October 2003. In 2004, French officials and investigators from the French Underwater Archaeological Department officially confirmed that the wreckage was from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft.\nNo marks or holes attributable to gunfire were found, but that was not considered significant as only a small portion of the aircraft was recovered. In June 2004, the fragments were given to the \"Mus\u00e9e de l'Air et de l'Espace\" (Air and Space Museum) in Le Bourget, Paris, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's life is commemorated in a special exhibit.\nSpeculations in 1948, 1972 and 2008.\nIn 1948, former Luftwaffe telegrapher Rev. Hermann Korth published his war logs, noting an incident that occurred at around noon on 31 July 1944 in which a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 shot down a P-38 Lightning. Korth's account ostensibly supported a shoot-down hypothesis for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. The veracity of his log was met with skepticism, because it could have described a P-38 which was flown by Second Lieutenant Gene Meredith on 30 July, shot down south of Nice.\nIn 1972, the German magazine \"Der Landser\" quoted a letter from Luftwaffe reconnaissance pilot Robert Heichele, in which he purportedly claimed to have shot down a P-38 on 31 July 1944. His account, corroborated by a spotter, seemingly supported a shoot-down hypothesis of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. Heichele's account was met with skepticism because he described flying a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 D-9, a variant which had not yet entered Luftwaffe service.\nIn the lists which are held by the \"Bundesarchiv-Milit\u00e4rarchiv\", no victory was credited to Heichele or his unit in either July or August 1944, and the decrypted report of the day's reconnaissance does not include any flights by 2./NAG 13's Fw 190s. Heichele was shot down on 16 August 1944 and died five days later.\nIn 2008, a French journalist from \"La Provence\", who was investigating Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's death, contacted former Luftwaffe pilots who flew in the area of Marseille, eventually getting an account from Horst Rippert (1922\u20132013). Rippert was the older brother of the famous bass singer Ivan Rebroff, who was born in Berlin as Hans-Rolf Rippert. In his memoirs, Horst Rippert, an admirer of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's books, expressed both fears and doubts that he was responsible, but in 2003 he stated that he became certain that he was responsible when he learned the location of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's wreckage. Rippert claimed to have reported the kill over his radio, but there are no surviving records to verify this account.\nRippert's account, as it is discussed in two French and German books, was met with both publicity and skepticism. Luftwaffe comrades expressed doubts in Rippert's claim, given that he held it private for 64 years. Very little German documentation survived the war, and contemporary archival sources, consisting mostly of Allied intercepts of Luftwaffe signals, offer no evidence to verify Rippert's claim. The entry and exit points of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's mission were likely near Cannes, yet his wreckage was discovered south of Marseille.\nThough it is possible that German fighters could have intercepted, or at least altered, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flight path, the cause of his death remains unknown, and Rippert's account remains one hypothesis among many.\nLiterary works.\nWhile not precisely autobiographical, much of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's work is inspired by his experiences as a pilot. One notable example is his novella, \"The Little Prince,\" a poetic tale self-illustrated in watercolours in which a pilot stranded in the desert meets a young prince fallen to Earth from a tiny asteroid. \"His most popular work, \"The Little Prince\" was partially based upon a crash he and his navigator survived in the Libyan desert. They were stranded and dehydrated for four days, nearing death when they miraculously stumbled upon a Bedouin who gave them water.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote in \"Wind, Sand and Stars\" that the Bedouin saved their lives and gave them \"charity and magnanimity [by] bearing the gift of water.\" \"The Little Prince\" is a philosophical story, including societal criticism, remarking on the strangeness of the adult world. One biographer wrote of his most famous work: \"Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince,\" and remarking of their dual fates, \"...the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.\"\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's notable literary works (published English translations in parentheses) include:\n \"Wind, Sand and Stars\" (simultaneous distinct English version) \u2013 winner of the U.S. National Book Award\nOther works.\nDuring the 1930s, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry led a mixed life as an aviator, journalist, author and publicist for Air France, A\u00e9ropostale's successor. His journalistic writings for \"Paris-Soir\", \"Marianne\" and other newspapers covered events in Indochina and the Far East (1934), the Mediterranean, Soviet Union and Moscow (1935), and the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131937). Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote a number of shorter pieces, essays and commentaries for various newspapers and magazines.\nNotable among those during World War II was \"An Open Letter to Frenchmen Everywhere\", which was highly controversial in its attempt to rally support for France against Nazi oppression at a time when the French were sharply divided between support of the Gaullists and Vichy factions. It was published in \"The New York Times Magazine\" in November 1942, in its original French in \"Le Canada, de Montr\u00e9al\" at the same time, and in \"Pour la Victoire\" the following month. Other shorter pieces include (in French except where translated by others to English):\nCensorship and publication bans.\n\"Pilote de guerre\" (\"Flight To Arras\"), which describes the German invasion of France, was slightly censored when it was released in its original French during wartime by \u00c9ditions Gallimard in his homeland in 1942, due to the removal of a derogatory remark which was made about Hitler (which Gallimard failed to reinsert in subsequent editions after World War II). Shortly after the book's wartime release in France, Nazi appeasers and Vichy supporters objected to its praise of one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's squadron colleagues, Captain Jean Isra\u00ebl, who was portrayed as being amongst the squadron's bravest defenders during the Battle of France.\nIn support of their German occupiers and masters, Vichy authorities attacked the author as a defender of Jews (in racist terms) leading to the praised book being banned in France, along with prohibitions against further printings of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's other works. Prior to France's liberation new printings of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works were made available there only by means of covert print runs, such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of \"Pilote de guerre\" were printed in Lyon.\nA further complication occurred due to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and others' view of General Charles de Gaulle, who was held in low regard. Early in the war, de Gaulle became the leader of the Free French Forces in exile, with his headquarters in London. Even though both men were working to free France from Nazi occupation, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry viewed de Gaulle with apprehension as a possible post-war dictator, and he consequently provided no public support to the General. De Gaulle retaliated by implying that the author was a supporter of Germany, and he then had his literary works banned in France's North African colonies. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's writings were, with irony, banned simultaneously in occupied France and the territory which was controlled by Free France.\nExtension of copyrights in France.\nDue to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's wartime death, the French government awarded his estate the civil code designation \"Mort pour la France\" (English: \"Died for France\") in 1948. Amongst the law's provisions is an increase of 30 years to the duration of the original copyright's duration of 70 years; thus most of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.\nHonours and legacy.\nMuseums and exhibits.\nMuseum exhibits, exhibitions and theme villages dedicated to both him and his diminutive Little Prince have been created in Le Bourget, Paris and other locations in France, as well as in the Republic of South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Brazil, the United States and Canada:\n Additionally, Mich\u00e8le Lalonde and Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost's oratorio \"Terre des hommes\", performed at the \"Place des Nations\" opening ceremonies and attended by the international delegates of the participating countries, strongly projected the French writer's 'idealist rhetoric'. Consuelo de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (1901\u20131979), his widow, was also a guest of honour at the opening ceremonies of the World's Fair.\nInternational.\nThe main street of the town of Campeche on the Ilha da Santa Catarina (where Florianopolis the capital of the state is also situated), is named avenida principe pequeno because of his connection to the region.\nOther.\nNumerous other tributes have been awarded to honour Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his most famous literary creation, his \"Little Prince\":\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The CU is a centrist party, maintaining more progressive stances on economic, immigration and environmental issues while holding more socially conservative positions on issues, such as opposing abortion and euthanasia. The party describes itself as \"social Christian\".\nThe CU was founded in 2000 as a merger of the Reformed Political League (GPV) and Reformatory Political Federation (RPF). After doubling its seat tally in the 2006 Dutch general election, it became the smallest member of the fourth Balkenende cabinet, and since that time has been likewise part of the third Rutte cabinet and the fourth Rutte cabinet. In some elections it forms an alliance with the Calvinist Reformed Political Party (SGP), which, unlike the CU, is a testimonial party.\nPrimarily a Protestant party, the CU bases its policies on the Bible, and takes the theological principles of charity and stewardship as bases for its support for public expenditure and environmentalism. It seeks for government to uphold Christian morality, but supports freedom of religion under the doctrine of sphere sovereignty. The party is moderately Eurosceptic; it was formerly in the European Parliament with the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group) and European People's Party Group (EPP Group). It is a member of the European Christian Political Party.\nHistory.\nPrecursors.\nAlong with the larger Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), the Netherlands has a long tradition of small orthodox or conservative Protestant (i.e., mostly Reformed) parties in parliament, including the Reformed Political Party (SGP), founded in 1918. After a group of Reformed Churches members formed the Reformed Churches (Liberated) over a religious disagreement, the Reformed Political Alliance (GPV) split off from the ARP in 1948. It took until 1963 for the party to enter parliament. In the 1981 election, the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF) entered parliament. It had split off from the ARP six years earlier over the formation of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).\nThe RPF explicitly stated in its manifesto of principles that it sought to unite all reformed parties in the Netherlands. However, the GPV and SGP were somewhat less receptive. The GPV was only open to a specific current in reformed Protestantism, namely the Reformed Churches (Liberated), and did not wish to cooperate with non-'liberated' reformed: it had rejected on religious grounds the entry of the group that in the 1970s was to become the RPF. The SGP had rejected cooperation with these parties because they had female members; the SGP consistently rejected female suffrage until 2006. The RPF, GPV and SGP were testimonial parties, which chose to voice their concerns about government policy, while acknowledging that they were not big enough to force their opinion upon others.\nIn 1984, however, the three parties cooperated in the European election and presented a common list in order to enter the European Parliament. In the 1989 general election they formed an electoral alliance in order to enhance their chances of obtaining seats. In 1995 informal talks were opened between the three parties. The GPV had opened itself to non-liberated members, but the SGP not to women. The discussions with the SGP were broken off and the GPV and RPF continued together. For a long time the GPV was not willing to enter a major internal debate with the RPF, which also performed better electorally; it had won three seats in the 1998 election, while the GPV received only two. From 1998 the two parliamentary parties cooperated with each other, held common meetings and appointed common spokespersons. In 1999 a group called \"Transformatie\" (Transformation) was set up by young people from both parties in reaction to the slow cooperation process: they tried to intensify the debate about cooperation. In the same year the cooperation talks were formalised and intensified, leading to the foundation of the Christian Union.\nEstablishment.\nThe Christian Union was founded in January 2000 as an alliance between the RPF and GPV. Later in that year, their youth organisations, GPJC and RPFJ, fused completely, presenting an example to their mother organisations. In 2001, they formed a common parliamentary party in both the House of Representatives and Senate. In 2002 the alliance entered the election for the first time. The party obtained four seats, one seat less than in the 1998 election when they campaigned separately. It had polled much better, with some polling stations predicting seven or eight seats. The party's leader Kars Veling stepped down. He had been good at keeping the peace internally in a party still somewhat divided between the old GPV and RPF memberships, but had not appealed well enough to the population at large. With preference votes a woman, Tineke Huizinga (positioned seventh on the CU candidate list) was elected into parliament for the CU, becoming the first woman to enter parliament for the party or its predecessors. Because of her election, prominent party figure Eimert van Middelkoop, who was no. 4 on the candidate-list, had to leave parliament.\nIn the 2003 general election the party lost an additional seat, and was left with three seats. Again Huizinga (now no. 4 on the list) was elected with preference votes and this time former RPF leader Leen van Dijke (no. 3) had to leave parliament. The decline of the CU in 2003 was probably due to party supporters voting for the Christian democratic CDA, which was competing with the social democratic Labour Party (PvdA), to become the largest party. The Christian Union was heavily involved in the formation of the second cabinet Balkenende, along with the SGP. However, the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) vetoed the formation of a cabinet that included the two conservative Reformed parties, and so the progressive liberal D66 became a part of the governing alliance instead. In 2004 the two organisations RPF and GPV officially ceased to exist, making final the fusion into the CU.\nCabinet participation.\nIn the 2006 election the party doubled its seat count and joined the fourth Balkenende cabinet. CU leader Andr\u00e9 Rouvoet became Deputy Prime Minister and minister without portfolio for family and youth, while Middelkoop became Minister of Defence and Huizinga junior minister (\"staatssecretaris\") of Transport and Water management. Since the party has entered government, there has been some controversy about the conservative Christian ethical views of some of its members. In 2007 Yvette Lont, a CU municipal council member for Amsterdam, expressed the view that homosexuals should not be admitted to representative functions within the party. Also in 2007, municipal council member Monique Heger decided to resign from office, because she had recently discovered that she was a lesbian, and she and her (female) partner moved in together.\nAfter the collapse of the Balkenende cabinet, the Christian Union no longer had representatives in government; Rouvoet returned to parliament as leader of the CU parliamentary group until he left politics in April/May 2011. Arie Slob succeeded him as the party leader.\nIn October 2013, the second Rutte cabinet (VVD and PvdA), lacking a majority in the Senate, reached a budgetary agreement with the CU, the Reformed Political Party (SGP) and the Democrats 66 (D66). This occasional coalition was nicknamed \"purple with the Bible\" (\"Paars met de Bijbel\") as it included the secular parties VVD, PvdA and D66 plus the religiously-oriented parties Christian Union and SGP. The term \"purple with the Bible\" had already been used in February that year, when the same parties reached an agreement on modernising the housing market. Although the cabinet was quite unpopular and the VVD and PvdA lost many municipal seats during the municipal elections of 19 March 2014, the parties that provided tactical support to the government won many seats.\nAfter the 2017 general election, the Christian Union became part of the third Rutte cabinet, as a minor coalition partner to the VVD, CDA and D66. The party has three representatives in the current cabinet: minister Carola Schouten for the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, Arie Slob, Minister for Primary Education, Secondary Education and Media and Paul Blokhuis, State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sports.\nFollowing the 2019 European Parliament election, the Christian Union left the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in the European Parliament (of which it had been a founding member) arguing that the ECR was moving too far to the right by including MEPs of far-right parties such as the Dutch Forum for Democracy and the Sweden Democrats. The party instead joined the European People's Party Group.\nIn January 2023, Mirjam Bikker succeeded Segers as the party leader. During the 2023 Dutch general election the Christian Union lost two of their five seats, getting 2% of the votes.\nIdeology.\nThe CU describes itself as a Christian social party. The party has its roots in orthodox Protestant (i.e. mostly Reformed) parties, often referred to as the \"small right\". It combines a conservative point of view on ethical and foreign policy issues, with more centre-left ideas on economic, asylum, social and environmental issues. Its conservative reformed ideals are reflected in its program of principles. It believes that the state is the swordmaiden of God. It bases its politics directly on the Bible. However, it sees separate duties for the state and the church in public life: the church should spread the Word of God, while the state should merely uphold public morality. The state should respect the religion of its citizens. Other Christian principles, like neighbourly love and stewardship for the Earth, however have given the CU's political program a centre-left orientation.\nSome of CU's socially conservative policies include:\nMore centre-left policies include:\nSocial issues.\nThe CU describes itself as \"Christelijk-sociaal\" \"(Social Christian)\" and explicitly distance themselves from the labels Christian socialism or Christian right. \"Social Christian\" describes a Christian democracy ideology that is more right-wing than Christian socialism and more left-wing than the Christian right and social conservatism. Described as centrist and Orthodox Protestant, it has an emphasis on the community, social solidarity, support for a welfare state, and support for some regulation of market forces but is more conservative on some social issues opposition to euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, same-sex marriage, abortion, and some elements of the EU. The party is left of centre on issues such as asylum policy, development aid, green environmental policy and the economy.\nThe party supports Dutch membership of the European Union to ensure peace and prosperity, and to counter the influence of Russia and China, while simultaneously being critical of several EU policies which it claims are undemocratic and \"mainly benefits large companies and the upper middle classes.\" The CU instead calls for more transparency within the EU, for domestic decision making of EU member states to be respected and wants reforms made to the Eurozone. The CU is also against the accession of Turkey to the European Union.\nIn May 2019, the Christian Union voted against banning gay conversion therapy.\nElection results.\nEuropean Parliament.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRepresentation.\nMembers of the cabinet.\nFrom 2007 to 2010 the CU supplied two ministers and one state secretary in the fourth Balkenende cabinet:\nStarting in 2017, the CU has once again supplied two ministers and one state secretary in the third Rutte cabinet:\nThe following CU members served in the fourth Rutte cabinet between 2021 and 2024:\nElectorate.\nThe CU was supported by orthodox Reformed of many denominations, such as the Christian Reformed Churches, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated) and the Dutch Reformed Church. But members of newer churches such as the Evangelical Church and the Pentecostal community also supported this party. The electorate is concentrated in the smaller rural districts in the so-called \"Bible Belt\" an area of more conservative Christian municipalities that reaches from Overijssel, through the Veluwe and the Biesbos to Zeeland. The party also draws support from Christians with an immigrant background, who are mostly located in the large cities.\nThe party is also drawing support from a growing number of conservative Roman Catholics, dissatisfied with the less Christian policies of the CDA. Roman Catholics are welcome to become a member of the party although one of the foundations of the party is the Heidelberg Catechism, known for its staunch anti-Catholicism. During the provincial elections of 2007 the party fielded two Roman Catholic candidates on their shortlist of the province of Limburg. This process has alerted some prominent CDA politicians. CU-senator Egbert Schuurman stated the CU would provide a shelter for everyone who actively believes in Jesus Christ but also said the CU will always be a Protestant party.\nThe party's congress, held on 13 June 2015, replaced the Heidelberg Catechism with Nicean Creed.\nOrganisation.\nLeadership.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOrganisational structure.\nThe highest body in the CU is the Union Congress, formed by delegates from the municipal branches. It appoints the party board and decides the order of the candidates on the lists for elections to the Senate, House of Representatives and European Parliament and has the final say over the party program. A member congress has an important role in the formation of the CU's political direction.\nMembers.\nThe CU currently has 25,170 members (as of 1 January 2019). They are organised in over 200 municipal branches.\nLinked organisations.\nThe youth organisation of the party is PerspectieF which was formed as a fusion of the two youth organisations of the CU's predecessors the GPJC and RPFJ. The party publishes the HandSchrift (HandWriting) six times a year. The party's scientific institute is the Mr. Groen van Prinsterer Foundation, which publishes the DenkWijzer (ThoughtWiser). The women's organisation is Inclusief.\nThe CU participates in the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, a democracy assistance organisation of seven Dutch political parties.\nInternational organisations.\nInternationally, the CU is a member of the European Christian Political Party. Its MEPs were seated in the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. Until 2019 when the CU joined the EPP Group\nOrthodox-Protestant (pillarised) organisations.\nThe CU still has ideological strong links with so-called pillarised organisations. Together with conservative Protestant schools, papers like the \"Nederlands Dagblad\" and the \"Reformatorisch Dagblad\", the Protestant broadcaster Evangelische Omroep, several Reformed churches they constitute the conservative or orthodox Reformed pillar (Dutch \"zuil\"). While all four of the traditional Dutch pillars (socialists, liberals, Protestants and Catholics) have broken down since the 1960s, the orthodox reformed pillar has actually strengthened in reaction to the process of secularisation.\nRelationships to other parties.\nThe Christian Union had been in the opposition until 2006. It has good relations with the orthodox Reformed Political Party (SGP), with which it formed a single European parliamentary party CU-SGP until 2022 and the Christian Democratic Appeal, with which the ChristenUnie-SGP had an electoral alliance for the 2004 European Parliament elections. As an opposition party against the centre-right second Balkenende cabinet, the CU has gained sympathy from the left-wing parties in parliament, the Labour Party, the Socialist Party, and the GroenLinks, with which it cooperates in several municipal executives after the 2006 municipal elections.\nInternational comparisons.\nThe Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland is nearest to the Christian Union as a conservative Protestant party that is left-wing in social matters, conservative in ethical matters and critical of the European Union.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "63176", "revid": "12396222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63176", "title": "Reformed Political Party", "text": "Dutch political party\nThe Reformed Political Party ( , SGP) is a conservative Reformed Christian political party in the Netherlands. The SGP is the oldest political party in the Netherlands existing in its present form, and has been in opposition for its entire existence. Since 1925, it has won between 1.5% and 2.5% of the votes in general elections. Owing to its orthodox political ideals and its traditional role in the opposition, the party is considered a testimonial party.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe SGP was founded in 1918 by orthodox Protestants led by Yerseke pastor Gerrit Hendrik Kersten, some of which originated from the Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP). After the Pacification of 1917, compulsory voting and proportional representation was introduced in the Netherlands. The founders did not want to vote for existing parties, but saw an opportunity for a smaller party because of proportional representation. The party first participated in the 1918 general election. The hastily organised campaign focused on the ARP and its support of what SGP called state coercion, such as compulsory vaccination and insurance law. Because some might object to him combining being politician and pastor, Kersten was not a candidate, but instead Barend Lemans and Pieter Gijze. The party received over 5,000 votes, not enough for a seat.\nDespite not winning a seat, the SGP continued its activities In 1919, the party board started a petition against the Invaliditeitswet (Disability Act), which forced workers to pay premiums to insure against disability. It received 4,800 signatures. The party encouraged its members to send back their stamp cards which tracked their premiums. In December 1920, the Senate passed a law that would accommodate their conscientious objections. A similar petition against compulsory vaccination received 27,059 signatures in 1922, but sorted no effect.\n1922\u20131945.\nFor the 1922 general election, Kersten was lead candidate, accepting objections within his electorate. The party won one seat in the House of Representatives, which was taken by Kersten. His speeches in parliament regularly received media attention, for example when he opposed the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In the 1925 general election, the party won another seat which was taken by Pieter Zandt.\nLater that year, the anti-Catholic SGP would cause the fall of the second Ruijs de Beerenbrouck cabinet in what became known as the Night of Kersten. During the debate on the budget of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Kersten had proposed cutting the budget of the diplomatic mission of the Netherlands to the Holy See. The amendment received a majority, because it was supported by the Protestant Christian Historical Union (CHU), which was in cabinet together with the Catholic General League. It resulted in more publicity and a third seat in the 1929 general election, which was taken by Cor van Dis sr.. Kersten, Zandt and Van Dis formed the parliamentary group until the 1937 general election, when the SGP lost one seat. The SGP did not achieve much in parliament other than during the Night of Kersten, but achieved some smaller goals outside of parliament through contact with the ministers.\nKersten saw the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940 as a punishment for its sins. He rejected resistance against the German occupation and was seen as friendly towards them. After the war, he was nominated again as lead candidate, but he was barred from the House of Representatives for his stances during the war.\n1945\u2013present.\nKersten was succeeded by Zandt, under whose leadership the SGP was very stable, continually getting 2% of votes. In the 1956 general election, the SGP profited from the enlargement of parliament, and entered the Senate for the first time. It lost that seat in 1960 Senate election, but regained it in the 1971 Senate election.\nIn 1961 Zandt died and was succeeded by Van Dis sr. After ten years he stood down in favour of Reverend Hette Abma, who also stepped down after ten years, in favour of Henk van Rossum, a civil engineer. In the 1984 European Parliament election, the SGP joined the two other orthodox Protestant parties, the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF) and the Reformed Political League (GPV). They won one seat in the European Parliament, which was taken by SGP member Leen van der Waal, a mechanical engineer.\nIn 1986, Van Rossum was succeeded by Bas van der Vlies. In the 1994 election the party lost one seat in the House, regained it in 1998, and lost it again in 2002. During the 2003 cabinet formation, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) held talks with the SGP \u2014 the first time that the SGP was seriously considered as a possible coalition partner. Ultimately, the Democrats 66 joined the second Balkenende cabinet instead of the SGP, mostly because of the ideological differences between the VVD and the SGP.\nIn 2010, Kees van der Staaij succeeded Van der Vlies. During the 2010 cabinet formation, the negotiating CDA, VVD and Party for Freedom (PVV) took into account some wishes of the SGP, so that SGP would provide confidence and supply in the Senate where the first Rutte cabinet did not have a majority.\nIdeology and political positions.\nAs a Protestant fundamentalist party the SGP draws much from its ideology from the Reformed Christian tradition, specifically the ecclesiastical doctrinal standards known as the Three Forms of Unity, including an unamended version of the Belgic Confession (). It includes 21 words that were removed by the synod of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in 1905, which state that the government must \"eliminate and eradicate all idolatry and false religion, so as to destroy the kingdom of Antichrist\". This contrasted with the other two Protestant parties, the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and the Christian Historical Union (CHU) when SGP was founded, which had accepted the change. \nChurch and state.\nThe SGP is a theocratic party, although its precise position on the relation between religion and politics has changed over time. The SGP does favor some, but no strict, separation of church and state. The church and state should cooperate, including the advancement of the true faith. The state should not curtail the freedom of the church, while the church similarly should not impose upon the state. Abma rejected theocracy as form of government, instead harmonizing theocracy and democracy. Over time, it has however become more realistic, accepting the religiously neutral state. The party has also tried to distinguish its theocratic positions from Islamic theocracy. The SGP supports freedom of conscience, but not an unconditional freedom of religion.\nThe SGP is critical of Islam, although Muslims have also been seen as allies against secularism. With the argument that Judeo-Christian culture must be preserved, the party opposes public expressions such as public calls to prayer, big mosques and minarets.\nSocial issues.\nThe SGP has generally opposed women's suffrage, both passive and active, believing it to be contrary to a \"woman's calling\". Some within the party however argue that the biblical argumentation is not clear or that this could hurt them electorally. In 1989 the party changed its principles, approving women voting if they can answer this to God in their conscience. No similar change was made for passive suffrage.\nThe SGP opposes gay rights. In May 2019, the party voted against banning conversion therapy. In 2024, the SGP introduced a motion in the House of Representatives to call on the government to withdraw the so-called \"transgender bill\" which had been introduced by the previous Dutch government and would enable people under the age of 16 to legally declare their gender without requiring a medical diagnosis.\nThe SGP is opposed to abortion and euthanasia. It supports the reintroduction of the death penalty.\nIsrael and Judaism.\nThe party has evolved into a pro-Israel party. Due to its early focus on anti-Catholicism and belief in supersessionism, the SGP and Kersten were critical of the reception of German-Jewish refugees in the years leading up to World War II. The establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 and its victories against neighboring Arab countries contributed to increased sympathy among SGP members. From 1968 onwards, this was also evident in Abma's contributions in parliament. In 2000, a separate article was included in the party's manifesto emphasizing the importance of good diplomatic relations with Israel and advocating for secure borders for Israel.\nRepresentation.\nEuropean Parliament.\nBetween 1984 and 2019, the SGP filed joint candidate lists with the Christian Union and its predecessors. See CU-SGP for these election results.\nSince the 1984 European Parliament election the party has had one elected representative in the European Parliament. From 1984 to 1997 Leen van der Waal was the representative, from 1999 Bas Belder was the party's representative, succeeded by Bert-Jan Ruissen in the 2019 European Parliament election. In European Parliament elections, the SGP formed one candidate list with the Christian Union, called CU\u2013SGP, until the 2024 European Parliament election. The SGP's representative is a member of the European Christian Political Party and European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group).\nElectorate.\nThe SGP has had a very stable electorate since first entering the States-General in 1922. Since winning a second seat in 1926, it has usually varied between two and three seats in the House of Representatives.\nReligion.\nMost of its electorate is formed by so-called pietistic Reformed Protestants (\"bevindelijk gereformeerden\"), Reformed Protestants for whom personal religious experience is very important. Most of the Old Reformed Congregations and the Reformed Congregations are considered pietistic Reformed Protestants. Pietistic Reformed Protestants are also present in the Christian Reformed Churches, the Reformed Association in the Protestant Church in the Netherlands and the Restored Reformed Church.\nGeographical.\nThe SGP's support is concentrated geographically in the Dutch Bible Belt, a band of strongly Reformed and mostly rural municipalities ranging from Zeeland in the South via Goeree-Overflakkee and the Alblasserwaard in South Holland and the Veluwe in Gelderland to the Western part of Overijssel, around Staphorst. Outside the Bible Belt, the SGP also performs well in Urk, Uddel and Rijssen-Holten. The geographical concentration of SGP voters has however decreased between 1956 and 2017. Its votes have shifted away from Utrecht and South Holland towards Zeeland, Gelderland, Overijssel, with a modest turnout in Drenthe and Gelderland.\nGender.\nDespite SGP's opposition to women's suffrage, it draws significant support from women. In the period 1971\u20131977, when the Dutch National Voter Survey started, around half of its voters were female. This declined to 34% in 1989\u20131998, but rose back to half in 2010\u20132017. In the March 2021 general election and the March 2023 provincial elections, nearly 60% of SGP voters were female.\nOrganisation.\nOrganisational structure.\nThe highest organ of the SGP is the congress, which is formed by delegates from the municipal branches. It convenes once every year. It appoints the party board and decides the order of the Senate, House of Representatives, European Parliament candidates list and has the last say over the party program. The SGP chairman is always a minister. Since 2001 this position is ceremonial, as the general chair leads the party's organisation.\nThe party has 245 municipal branches and has a provincial federation in each province, except for Limburg.\nMembership.\nFemale membership.\nInitially, women were not allowed to be member of the party. In 1983, the first woman, W. van Donge-van Bezooijen, applied for membership, but The Hague electoral association had rejected her application because she was a woman. She then wrote to the national party board, after which she and Riet Grabijn-van Putten became member in 1985. The party board however changed its position in 1991, rejecting membership for women. This position was supported by ninety percent of electoral associations in 1993. The party was aware that this might be against the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\nMeanwhile, public opinion in the Netherlands turned against SGP's decision not to allow women. UN committees also recommended intervention. In 2003, the Clara Wichmann Institute and some other organisations sued the Dutch government, for subsidising SGP. The district court of The Hague ruled that the party could no longer receive subsidies from the government, while it did not force the SGP to change it statutes. Based on the verdict, the party decided to allow female membership, while still not allowing them on candidate lists. At the end of 2017, SGP had 800 female members.\nMeanwhile in 2005, the Dutch government had refused the SGP's application for subsidies. The administrative law division of the district court of The Hague supported the rejection. However, the Council of State overturned this decision in December 2007, maintaining that a party's political philosophy takes precedence, and that women have the opportunity to join other political parties where they can obtain a leadership role. Two weeks later, The Hague courts of appeal ruled on the first case that the SGP should also allow women's passive suffrage. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands affirmed this decision in 2010 and an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights was unsuccessful in 2012. As a result, the SGP changed its internal regulations to formally allow women to be candidates in elections, while still discouraging it in their principles.\nSome women have been candidates starting with the 2014 municipal elections, with lead candidate Lilian Janse becoming the first female elected representative for the SGP when she was elected municipal councilor in Vlissingen in 2014.\nHowever the party still forbid women from joining its list for general elections.\nLinked organisations.\nThe party publishes the Banner () two-weekly since 1921. Its think tank was founded in 1974, and it was renamed after Walloon theologian Guido de Br\u00e8s in 1992. It publishes the quarterly magazine Zicht (Sight). The youth organisation of the SGP is called the Reformed Political Party Youth (SGPJ).\nThe SGP participates in the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, a democracy assistance organisation of seven Dutch political parties.\nPillarised organisations.\nThe SGP has close links with several other orthodox Protestant organisations, such as several Reformed churches and the newspaper \"Reformatorisch Dagblad\". Together they form a small but strong orthodox-Reformed pillar.\nRelationships to other parties.\nThe SGP has traditionally been very focused on its independence. In the 1950s, the SGP created common candidates lists in municipal elections with the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and/or Christian Historical Union (CHU). These collaborations stalled when these two parties intensified their collaboration with the Catholic People's Party (KVP).\nCU, GPV and RPF.\nIn 1963 another orthodox Protestant party, the Reformed Political League (GPV) entered parliament, although they had little contact with the SGP at first. Another orthodox Protestant party, the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF). Over time they started to work together to oppose the secularisation and created shared lists and connections between their lists (). This included common lists for the European Parliamentary elections starting in 1984.\nAfter 1993 the cooperation between the GPV and the RPF intensified, but the SGP's position at the time on female suffrage prevented the SGP joining this closer cooperation. However, in 2000 the GPV and RPF merged to form the ChristianUnion (CU). Traditionally the SGP and the CU worked together closely as they were both based on Protestant Christian politics. Recently however, as the CU has moved more towards the centre-left, discernible differences of philosophy between the SGP and CU have caused the parties to not join in elections.\nFar-right.\nIn the 2019 Senate election, some provincial councillors of the far-right Forum for Democracy (FvD) strategically voted for the SGP to keep their second seat. The parties also joined the same European Parliament Group after the 2019 European Parliament election. In 2021, incoming party chair Van Meeuwen ruled out cooperation with the FvD, although party leader Van der Staaij didn't want to rule any parties out in advance.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a proponent of epic theatre whose plays reflected the recent experiences of World War II. The politically active author's work included avant-garde dramas, philosophical crime novels, and macabre satire. D\u00fcrrenmatt was a member of the Gruppe Olten, a group of left-wing Swiss writers who convened regularly at a restaurant in the city of Olten.\nLife.\nD\u00fcrrenmatt was born in Konolfingen, canton of Bern, the son of a Protestant pastor. His grandfather, Ulrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, was a conservative politician. The family moved to Bern in 1935. D\u00fcrrenmatt began studies in philosophy, German philology, and German literature at the University of Z\u00fcrich in 1941, but moved to the University of Bern after one semester where he also studied natural science. In 1943, he decided to become an author and dramatist and dropped his academic career. In 1945\u201346, he wrote his first play \"It Is Written\". On 11 October 1946, he married the actress Lotti Gei\u00dfler. \nD\u00fcrrenmatt traveled in 1969 to the United States, in 1974 to Israel, and in 1990 to Auschwitz in Poland.\nIn 1975 he played himself in the film \"End of the Game.\"\nD\u00fcrrenmatt also enjoyed painting. Some of his works and his drawings were exhibited in Neuch\u00e2tel in 1976 and 1985 and in Z\u00fcrich in 1978.\nHis wife, Lotti Gei\u00dfler, died on 16 January 1983. D\u00fcrrenmatt married another actress, Charlotte Kerr, in 1984.\nIn 1990 he gave two famous speeches, one in honour of V\u00e1clav Havel (\"Die Schweiz \u2013 ein Gef\u00e4ngnis/Switzerland \u2013 A Prison\") on discovering that he had been spied on for five decades, along with 800,000 of his left-leaning fellow citizens, by the Swiss secret service; the other in honour of Mikhail Gorbachev (\"Kants Hoffnung/Kant's Hope\"). D\u00fcrrenmatt often compared the three Abrahamic religions and Marxism, which he also saw as a religion.\nD\u00fcrrenmatt died from heart failure on 14 December 1990 in Neuch\u00e2tel.\nSince 2000 his works have been exhibited in the Centre D\u00fcrrenmatt, part of the Swiss National Library.\nDramatic works.\nLike Bertolt Brecht D\u00fcrrenmatt explored the dramatic possibilities of epic theatre. Next to Brecht he has been called its \"most original theorist\".\nWhen he was 26 his first play, \"It Is Written\", premiered to great controversy. The story of the play revolves around a battle between a sensation-craving cynic and a religious fanatic who takes scripture literally, all of this taking place while the city they live in is under siege. The play's opening night in April 1947 caused fights and protests in the audience. Between 1948 and 1949 D\u00fcrrenmatt wrote several segments and sketches for the anti-Nazi Cabaret Cornichon in Z\u00fcrich including the short single-act grotesque play \"Der Gerettete\" (\"The Rescued\").\nHis first major success was the play \"Romulus the Great\". Set in the year A.D. 476, the play explores the last days of the Roman Empire, presided over and brought about by its last emperor, Romulus. \"The Visit\" (\"Der Besuch der alten Dame\", 1956) is a grotesque fusion of comedy and tragedy about a wealthy woman who offers the people of her hometown a fortune if they will avenge the wrongs done to her. The satirical drama \"The Physicists\" (\"Die Physiker\", 1962), which deals with issues concerning science and its responsibility for dramatic and dangerous changes to the world, has also been presented in translation.\nRadio plays published in English include \"Hercules in the Augean Stables\" (\"Herkules und der Stall des Augias\", 1954), \"Incident at Twilight\" (\"Abendstunde im Sp\u00e4therbst\", 1952) and \"The Mission of the Vega\" (\"Das Unternehmen der Wega\", 1954). The two late works \"Labyrinth\" and \"Turmbau zu Babel\" are a collection of unfinished ideas, stories and philosophical thoughts.\nAdaptations.\nHis novel, \"A Dangerous Game\" (also known as \"Die Panne\" (\"Traps\")) was adapted into a Marathi play, \"Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe\" (Silence! The Court Is in Session) by Indian playwright Vijay Tendulkar in 1967. The play has since then been performed in various Indian languages, and made into a film by the same name by Satyadev Dubey. It was also adapted into the 2021 Hindi feature film \"Chehre\".\nHis play \"The Visit\" has been adapted and Indianised into a play called \"Miss.Meena\" by Chennai-based theatre group 'perch'. \"The Visit\" has also been adapted as a musical by Kander and Ebb.\nHis play \"Incident at Twilight\" has been adapted into a play called \"Sann 2025\" by Piyush Mishra.\nIn November 2024, Ian McDiarmid adapted \"A Conversation at Night\" and \"An Incident at Twilight\" under the name \"Different Truths\" for BBC Radio Drama on 3. It featured Ian McDiarmid, Jim Broadbent, Michael Moreland and Ian Dunnett Jnr.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After the election of 1998, Balkenende was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 19 May 1998 and served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Finances and as deputy parliamentary leader. After Party Leader and Parliamentary leader, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stepped down before an upcoming election Balkenende announced his candidacy and was selected as his successor on 1 October 2001. For the election of 2002, Balkenende served as lead candidate and after a cabinet formation with the Pim Fortuyn List and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy formed the Cabinet Balkenende I and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office 22 July 2002.\nThe cabinet of Balkenende I fell just 87 days into its term. For the election of 2003, Balkenende again served as lead candidate and following a cabinet formation with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and Democrats 66, they formed the Cabinet Balkenende II and continued as prime minister. This second cabinet fell on 30 June 2006 and was replaced with the caretaker Cabinet Balkenende III on 7 July 2006. For the election of 2006, Balkenende once again served as lead candidate and following a cabinet formation with Labour Leader Wouter Bos and fellow Christian-democrats, formed the Cabinet Balkenende IV and continued as prime minister for another term. This fourth cabinet fell exactly 3 years into its term. For the election of 2010, Balkenende once again served as lead candidate but suffered a large defeat and announced his retirement and stepped down as Leader on 9 June 2010. Balkenende left office following the installation of the Cabinet Rutte I on 14 October 2010.\nBalkenende retired from active politics at 54 and became active in the private sector as a corporate director and also works as a professor of Governance, Institutions and Internationalisation at the Erasmus University Rotterdam since December 2010. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for several major reforms to the education system, immigration laws and reducing the deficit following the 2008 financial crisis. He is the fourth longest-serving Prime Minister after World War II, and his premiership is consistently regarded both by scholars and the public to have been above average. Balkenende was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 14 October 2022 exactly twelve years after leaving office.\nEarly life.\nJan Pieter Balkenende Jr. was born on 7 May 1956 in Biezelinge in the province of Zeeland in a family belonging to the Reformed faith, the son of Jan Pieter Balkenende Sr. a cereal grains merchant and Thona Johanna Sandee, a teacher.\nDuring his childhood, Balkenende was an active supporter of the Dutch football team PSV Eindhoven, and along with his father, he frequented many matches. He also regularly visited the local music school and theatre. Balkenende went to a Reformed Protestant primary school in Kapelle. He attended secondary school at the \"Christian Lyceum for Zeeland\" in Goes, graduating in 1974.\nHe studied at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam where he received an MA degree in history in 1980, subsequently an LLM degree in Dutch law in 1982, and finally a PhD in law in 1992.\nBalkenende resides with his wife, Bianca Hoogendijk, and his daughter, Amelie, in Capelle aan den IJssel. During his tenure as prime minister, he did not use the Catshuis, the formal residency of the prime minister.\nEarly political career.\nHe began his career on the staff of the research institute of the CDA and as a city councilman in Amstelveen. As a councilman, he proposed the Krokettenmotie, which gave council members the right to a croquette if the council went past 23:00, and it was passed. In 1992, he received his PhD with a thesis on \"Governance regulation and social organisations\" (Overheidsregelgeving en maatschappelijke organisaties), which was strongly inspired by the Communitarian ideas of Amitai Etzioni. One year later in 1993, he became an extraordinary professor of Christian-Social Thought at the Free University of Amsterdam.\nBalkenende first entered the House of Representatives on 19 May 1998 while the CDA was in opposition. He became the CDA's financial spokesman and was also involved with social affairs, justice, and domestic affairs. In this role, he advocated a substantial reduction of the national debt and sound public finances.\nHe was elected Chairman of the CDA parliamentary fraction on 1 October 2001, succeeding Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. On 3 November 2001, he was appointed lead candidate for the CDA in the tumultuous May 2002 parliamentary elections. These elections restored the CDA's former position as the largest political party in the House of Representatives.\nPrime Minister of the Netherlands.\nFirst cabinet.\nOn 4 July 2002, Queen Beatrix asked Balkenende to form a new government after the general elections following the resignation of Prime Minister Wim Kok. The coalition cabinet included the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) party, whose leader (Pim Fortuyn) was assassinated just days before the election. It collapsed after just 87 days in office because of internal conflicts within the LPF that destabilised the government.\nSecond cabinet.\nAfter early elections in 2003, Balkenende formed his second government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the progressive liberal D66. Once again leader of a centre-right coalition, Balkenende's policies centred on reform of the Dutch public services, social security, pre-pension facilities, public health, reducing crime, a tough immigration policy and historically large cuts in public spending. The measures gave rise to large public anger and bad results in opinion polls for his CDA party. While his party remained the largest Dutch delegation in the European Parliament after the European elections, beating the general expectation of a huge loss in parliamentary seats, the party suffered strong losses during Dutch municipal elections of 2006, losing their position as the largest party in many municipalities. Despite his unpopularity among Dutch voters (polls in 2006 showed that only 26\u201333% of the voters had confidence in him as prime minister), his position as leader of the CDA remained stable. In the beginning of 2006, some CDA members tried to replace Balkenende as leader with Agriculture Minister Cees Veerman. Veerman did not accept the proposition and offered his support to Balkenende. Balkenende's popularity recovered since then, surpassing that of his main competitor Wouter Bos in the autumn of 2006. By then, 53% preferred Balkenende as Prime Minister of the Netherlands while 40% preferred Bos. The switch in public opinion is sometimes explained by the steady recovery of the Dutch economy during the last year of his administration and the positive effects of the reformed policy of the Balkenende cabinet, combined with declining confidence in Bos as a good alternative for the position of prime minister.\nOn 1 July 2004, Balkenende took up the rotating presidency of the European Union.\nThird cabinet.\nOn 30 June 2006, the Democrats 66, the smallest coalition party, withdrew its support of the government over the way Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk had handled the crisis around the naturalisation of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a member of the House of Representatives. Balkenende resigned for the second time as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, announced early elections and presented his third government a week later. This rump cabinet, formed of a minority coalition of CDA and VVD, stayed in office until the elections of 22 November 2006.\nFourth cabinet.\nThough his old coalition partners, VVD and D66, fared badly in the parliamentary elections of 2006, Balkenende managed to defend the dominant position of his CDA. Needing alternative coalition partners to form a new majority government, he formed a social-Christian coalition with the Labour Party (PvdA) and the orthodox-Protestant Christian Union. The Fourth Balkenende cabinet was formed after Balkenende was appointed \"formateur\" by Queen Beatrix on 9 February 2007. His cabinet was announced on 13 February and was scheduled to be in office until 2011, but it fell in the early morning of 20 February 2010 as the result of disagreement between the majority of the parliament and the coalition partners CDA and PvdA over the extension of the Dutch ISAF-mission in Afghanistan. In contrast to the formation of a new caretaker cabinet with full responsibility (Balkenende III after the fall of Balkenende II), Balkenende IV continued as a demissionary cabinet, a caretaker cabinet with limited responsibility. Balkenende government opposed Ukraine and Georgia becoming NATO action plan members at 2008 Bucharest summit. \"Ukraine is seen by Russia as part of its own historic and cultural domain,\" Dutch politician stated.\n2010 election and resignation.\nDespite serious criticism by former prime ministers from the CDA, Balkenende was the Christian Democratic Appeal lead candidate for the Dutch general election of 2010.\nBalkenende raised mild controversy during his campaign for the 2010 Dutch elections. While appearing in a television show, Balkenende was asked by a female presenter what parties he would most likely form a coalition with. Balkenende first gave evasive answers, then when asked again by the presenter, responded saying \"U kijkt zo lief\" (English: \"You look so cute\"). The comment was regarded as sexist and criticised by several people, including Opzij chief-editor Margriet van der Linden and GroenLinks leader Femke Halsema (who stated that \"[the prime minister] deserves a knee to the groin\" (in Dutch: \"een knietje verdient\")). Balkenende apologised for the comment later.\nOn 9 June 2010, Balkenende resigned his position as leader of the CDA as well as his seat in the newly elected parliament, taking political responsibility for the CDA's disappointing election results in the 2010 general election.\nOther issues.\nIn 2004, during his second cabinet, Balkenende was diagnosed with necrotising fasciitis. He was treated through surgical debridement and made a full recovery after several weeks in hospital.\nOn 4 June 2005, the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel De Gucht said in the Flemish newspaper \"Het Laatste Nieuws\" (The Latest News) that \"Balkenende is a mix of Harry Potter and a petty rigid bourgeois mentality\". This comparison caused a small diplomatic controversy, and the Belgian ambassador had to apologise to Ben Bot, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs. Retired deputy prime minister Hans Wiegel commented he preferred Harry Potter to \"Manneken Pis\".\nBalkenende has a close relationship with the Dutch people from Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles. He has visited several Keti Koti celebrations in recent years.\nBalkenende's nicknames were \"JP\" and \"Harry Potter\", among others.\nHe was a member of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and, since 1 May 2004, a member of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63184", "revid": "46346656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63184", "title": "Crossroads (folklore)", "text": "Places in folklore where the supernatural can happen\nIn folklore, crossroads may represent a location \"between the worlds\" and, as such, a site where supernatural spirits can be contacted and paranormal events can take place. Symbolically, it can mean a locality where two realms touch and therefore represents liminality, a place literally \"neither here nor there\", \"betwixt and between\".\nAncient religions.\n In Greek mythology, crossroads were associated with both Hecate and Hermes, with shrines and ceremonies for both taking place there. The herm pillar associated with Hermes frequently marked these places due to the god's association with travelers and role as a guide. Though less central to Greek mythology than Hermes, Hecate's connection to crossroads was more cemented in ritual. 'Suppers of Hecate' were left for her at crossroads at each new moon, and one of her most common titles was 'goddess of the crossroads.' In her later three-fold depictions, each of the three heads or bodies is often associated with one of three crossing roads.\n\"According to the fourth-century historian Philochorus... at Athens, offerings also were sent to the crossroads on the sixteenth of the month - i.e., half a month after the new-moon offering, at the time of the full moon.\" In Graeco-Roman society, rituals of protection were done at crossroads and purification ritual remains were left at the crossroads. The Greeks and Romans believed doors, gates, rivers, frontiers and crossroads held spiritual meanings regarding transitioning, leaving one area and going somewhere else, a change in directions physically and spiritually; therefore rituals of protection and rituals regarding change (transition) were done at crossroads.\nAn 11th-century homily called \"De Falsis Deis\" tells us that Mercury or Odin were honored on crossroads.\n53. Sum man eac w\u00e6s gehaten Mercurius on life, se w\u00e6s swy\u00f0e facenfull\n54. And, \u00f0eah full snotorwyrde, swicol on d\u00e6dum and on leasbregdum. \u00d0one\n55. macedon \u00fea h\u00e6\u00f0enan be heora get\u00e6le eac heom to m\u00e6ran gode and \u00e6t wega\n56. gel\u00e6tum him lac offrodon oft and gelome \u00feurh deofles lare and to heagum\n57. beorgum him brohton oft mistlice loflac.\nThe modern English text gives:\n\"There once lived a man named Mercury, who was very deceitful, and, though quite wise in speech, was treacherous in actions and lies. The pagans, in their account, also made him their great god and often and frequently offered him sacrifices at crossroads, through the teachings of the devil, and to high hills they often brought various offerings of praise.\"\nMedieval folklore.\nIn Great Britain, there existed a tradition of burying criminals and suicides at the crossroads. This may have been due to the crossroads marking the boundaries of the settlement coupled with a desire to bury those outside of the law outside the settlement, or that the many roads would confuse the dead. Crossroads were also commonly used as a place of criminal punishment and execution (e.g. by gibbet or dule tree), which may have also been a reason for it being a site of suicidal burial as suicide was considered a crime. This ritual of crossroads burial dates back to Anglo-Saxon times and continued until being abolished in 1823.\nWhile they became a place of burial for suicides and others unable to be given proper burial in the Middle Ages, the crossroads were once a burial place second only to the consecrated church for Christians.\nIn Western folk mythology, a crossroads can be used to summon a demon or devil in order to make a deal. This legend can be seen in many stories. For example, the 1587 \"Historia von D. Johann Fausten\", describes the character Faust inscribing magic circles at a crossroads in order to summon the devil. The Freisch\u00fctz folktales often similarly involve summoning the devil at a crossroads in order to cast magic bullets.\nIn the 1885 historical essay \"Transylvanian Superstitions\", Emily Gerard describes how crossroads were often avoided as a matter of course, and describes a Romanian belief that a demon could be summoned at a crossroad by drawing a magic circle, offering copper coin as payment, and reciting an incantation.\nHoodoo.\nIn conjure, rootwork, and hoodoo, a form of African magical spirituality practiced by African Americans in the United States, the crossroads originates from the Kongo cosmogram in Central Africa. It represents the rising and setting of the sun, and the human life cycle of death and rebirth. The center of the crossroads is where the communication with spirits take place. During the transatlantic slave trade, the Kongo cosmogram was brought to the United States by African slaves. Archeologists unearthed representations of the Kongo cosmogram on slave plantations in South Carolina on clay pots made by enslaved Africans. The Kongo cosmogram is also called the Bakongo cosmogram and the \"Yowa\" cross. The Yowa cross (Kongo cosmogram) \"Is a fork in the road (or even a forked branch) can allude to this crucially important symbol of passage and communication between worlds. The 'turn' in the path,' i.e., the crossroads, remains an indelible concept in the Kongo-Atlantic world, as the point of intersection between the ancestors and the living.\" \"It is at the crossroads where many Africans believe one will witness the powers of God and emerge from the waters spiritually renewed.\"\nOther African origins of the crossroads in Hoodoo are found in West Africa among the Yoruba people. For example, the Yoruba trickster deity called Eshu-Elegba resides at the crossroads, and the Yoruba people leave offerings for Eshu-Elegba at the crossroads. In Hoodoo, there is a spirit that resides at the crossroads to give offering for; however, the word Eshu-Elegba does not exist in Hoodoo because the names of African deities were lost during slavery. Folklorist Newbell Niles Puckett, recorded a number of crossroads rituals in Hoodoo practiced among African-Americans in the South and explained its meaning. Puckett wrote...\"Possibly this custom of sacrificing at the crossroads is due to the idea that spirits, like men, travel the highways and would be more likely to hit upon the offering at the crossroads than elsewhere.\" African crossroads spirits were brought to the United States during the transatlantic slave trade. In the Vodou tradition, Papa Legba is the lwa of crossroads and a messenger to the spirit world. \nIn Hoodoo, there has been a practice that is believed to be hoodoo in origin such as selling your soul to the devil at the crossroads in order to acquire facility at various manual and body skills, such as playing a musical instrument, throwing dice, or dancing. It is believed that one may attend upon a crossroads a certain number of times, either at midnight or just before dawn, and one will meet a \"black man,\" whom some call the Devil, who will bestow upon one the desired skills. This practice is believed to have originated from an African American Blues musician by the name of Robert Johnson. In the oral history of hoodoo it is said that Robert Johnson became a skilled Blues musician after he sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads, and because of this, people began going to a crossroads at midnight to sell their soul to a devil to acquire a skill or to become better at a skill. The family of Robert Johnson have come forward and said this is not true. How Johnson became a skilled Blues musician was through training under Ike Zimmerman who was a blues guitarist. In an article from the National Blues Museum it reads... \"In the case of Robert Johnson, many family members have come forward to dispel these rumors and have advocated that the truth be told about Robert Johnson. During the time that he was missing, Johnson returned home, where he ran into Ike Zimmerman. Zimmerman took Johnson under his wing, and from years of practicing, Johnson became the legendary Blues musician that we know today.\" Therefore, the idea one can sell their soul to the devil at the crossroads and acquire a skill may not be traditional in Hoodoo.\nBrazilian mythology.\nCrossroads are very important both in Brazilian mythology (related to the headless mule, the devil, the Besta Fera and the Brazilian version of the werewolf) and religions (as the favourite place for the manifestation of \"left-hand\" entities such as Exus and where to place offerings to the Orishas). Eshu and Legba derive from the same African deity, although they are viewed in markedly different manners among traditions. For example, Papa Legba is considered by Haitian Vodou practitioners to be closest to Saint Peter, although in Brazilian Quimbanda it is not uncommon to see Exu closely associated with demonic entities such as Lucifer, clad in Mephistophelean attire and bearing a trident.\nIn modern fiction.\nBlues songs.\nSome 20th-century blues songs may be about making a deal with the devil at the crossroads. Many modern listeners believe that the premier song about soul-selling at a crossroads is \"Cross Road Blues\" by Robert Johnson. According to a legend, Johnson himself sold his soul at a crossroads in order to learn to play the guitar. This is chronicled in the Netflix documentary \"\". However, the song's lyrics merely describe a man trying to hitchhike; the sense of foreboding has been interpreted as the singer's apprehension of finding himself, a young black man in the 1920s deep south, alone after dark and at the mercy of passing motorists.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63185", "revid": "50857774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63185", "title": "Norbert Wiener", "text": "American mathematician and philosopher (1894\u20131964)\nNorbert Wiener (November 26, 1894 \u2013 March 18, 1964) was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and philosopher. He became a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). A child prodigy, Wiener later became an early researcher in stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems.\nWiener is considered the originator of cybernetics, the science of communication as it relates to living things and machines, with implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and the organization of society. His work heavily influenced computer pioneer John von Neumann, information theorist Claude Shannon, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and others.\nWiener is credited as being one of the first to theorize that all intelligent behavior was the result of feedback mechanisms, that could possibly be simulated by machines and was an important early step towards the development of modern artificial intelligence.\nBiography.\nFamily and Youth.\nWiener was born in Columbia, Missouri, the first child of Leo Wiener and Bertha Kahn, Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Germany, respectively. Through his father, he was related to Maimonides, the famous rabbi, philosopher and physician from Al Andalus, as well as to Akiva Eger, chief rabbi of Posen from 1815 to 1837.(p4)\nHe met his paternal grandfather on his father's side\u2014Solomon Wiener, whom he describes as a scholarly journalist incapable of keeping the family together\u2014only once in New York. Despite this, he was impressed by his grandfather's efforts to replace Yiddish in his lived environment with German. Solomon was born in Krotoschin, but married his father's mother\u2014who came from a family of Jewish tanners\u2014before settling in Byelostok where his father was born in 1862. He was told they had originally been minor nobles in Russia, such that when the Russian Tzar came to visit Byelostok it was his grandmother's house which was selected as a place of temporary residence. \nHis paternal grandmother's side of the family was very different to his father's side, and Wiener suggests that his father developed \"solid, business-like habits that gave my father a firm footing in life\", which made him a better custodian of the family than his grandfather. Nonetheless, his father still displayed an idealist streak. By the age of thirteen and because of their family situation\u2014and because according to Wiener there is a tendency within the Jewish community to give adolescent boy the responsibility of men\u2014his father Leo had begun to support his family as a private tutor. Due to the German bias of his grandfather, Wiener's father went to a Lutheran school and learnt several languages. \nHis father later left the Minsk Gymnasium for Warsaw in Poland, where Wiener claims his father developed good relations with his Polish schoolmates\u2014so much so his father became privy to the underground Polish resistance movement. His father became a contemporary of Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, to which Wiener claims: \"my father was one of the first to study the new artificial language\". His father later went to the University of Warsaw to study medicine, although could not handle the profession so went to study at the Polytechnicum in Berlin to study engineering. Relatives in Berlin with connections to Mendelssohn bank tried to get his father to pursue a career in banking, but his father declined. Instead, his father had begun to develop a Tolstoyan ethic which was reinforced through his attendance of a humanitarian student meeting, which would eventually lead him coming to the United States as well as Wiener's vegetarianism. Wiener however expressed resentment over his father's dogmatism over this later point during his childhood, which in his view lead to emotional abuse by his father towards himself.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;However, assuming for the sake of argument that all these events had occurred in their due sequence, I should still not have been brought up as a vegetarian, should \nnot have lived in a house in which I was surrounded by horrible and hair raising vegetarian tracts concerning cruelty to animals, and should not have been subjected to the overwhelming precept and example of my father in such matters.\nHis father planned to set up a commune in Central America based on these ideas. However, his companion abandoned him leaving him on a ship to Hartlepool. His father then went to Liverpool, then Havana and then New Orleans\u2014picking up both on English and Spanish during his trip. Eventually, his father decided to teach languages and went into Philology. Later meeting Wiener's mother, Bertha Kahn who was the daughter of a department\u2014Henry Kahn\u2014store owner in St. Joseph's, Missouri.\nHis maternal grandfather was a German Jewish immigrant from Rhineland. His wife's maiden name was Ellinger, who had settled in the United States a few generations beforehand. He notes that his maternal grandmother's mother was not Jewish, and suggests that while women in that side of the family tended to marry inside the Jewish community, men from that side of the family tended to marry Gentiles. The family also could trace its roots to American South. He notes that many from this side of the family men tended to leave some \"career of impeccable propriety by suddenly leaving his family and taking to the great open spaces\". With rumours that one family member ended up becoming a Western Bandit and was shot trying to evade capture. In his autobiography, Wiener contrasted the melting pot culture that he was bought up in and contextualised his and his families experience as compared to the more socially homogeneous Old American culture that had been predominant before. He saw this culture as offering greater freedom and opportunity compared to the European Serfdom that was found for many in Eastern Europe.\nHe writes of his youth: \"Child as I was, I absorbed a real understanding of many things, and my childish point of view is not totally devoid of significance\". Leo had educated Norbert at home until 1903, employing teaching methods of his own invention, except for a brief interlude when Norbert was seven years of age. Earning his living teaching German and Slavic languages, Leo read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young Norbert benefited greatly. Leo also had ample ability in mathematics and tutored his son in the subject until he left home. In his autobiography, Norbert described his father as calm and patient, unless he (Norbert) failed to give a correct answer, at which his father would lose his temper.\nIn \"The Theory of Ignorance\", a paper he wrote at the age of 10, he disputed \"man\u2019s presumption in declaring that his knowledge has no limits\", arguing that all human knowledge \"is based on an approximation\", and acknowledging \"the impossibility of being certain of anything.\"\nHe graduated from Ayer High School in 1906 at 11 years of age, and Wiener then entered Tufts College. He was awarded a BA in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14, whereupon he began graduate studies of zoology at Harvard. In 1910 he transferred to Cornell to study philosophy. He graduated in 1911 at 17 years of age.\nHarvard and World War I.\nThe next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his philosophical studies. Back at Harvard, Wiener became influenced by Edward Vermilye Huntington, whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener a PhD in June\u00a01913, when he was only 19\u00a0years old, for a dissertation on mathematical logic (a comparison of the work of Ernst Schr\u00f6der with that of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell), supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which were published as . He was one of the youngest to achieve such a feat. In that dissertation, he was the first to state publicly that ordered pairs can be defined in terms of elementary set theory. Hence relations can be defined by set theory, thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those of set theory. In 1921, Kazimierz Kuratowski proposed a simplification of Wiener's definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has been in common use ever since. It is formula_1\nIn 1914, Wiener traveled to Europe, to be taught by Bertrand Russell and G. H. Hardy at Cambridge University, and by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. At G\u00f6ttingen he also attended three courses with Edmund Husserl \"one on Kant's ethical writings, one on the principles of Ethics, and the seminar on Phenomenology.\" (Letter to Russell, c. June or July, 1914). During 1915\u20131916, he taught philosophy at Harvard, then was an engineer for General Electric and wrote for the \"Encyclopedia Americana\". Wiener was briefly a journalist for the \"Boston Herald\", where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles about a politician the newspaper's owners sought to promote.\nAlthough Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War I. In 1916, with America's entry into the war drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, Oswald Veblen invited Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in a letter to his parents, \"I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier.\" This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.\nAfter the war.\nWiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard, a situation he attributed largely to anti-Semitism at the university and in particular the antipathy of Harvard mathematician G. D. Birkhoff. He was also rejected for a position at the University of Melbourne. At W. F. Osgood's suggestion, Wiener was hired as an instructor of mathematics at MIT, where, after his promotion to professor, he spent the remainder of his career. For many years his photograph was prominently displayed in the Infinite Corridor and often used in giving directions, but by 2017 it had been removed.\nIn 1926, Wiener returned to Europe as a Guggenheim scholar. He spent most of his time at G\u00f6ttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge, working on Brownian motion, the Fourier integral, Dirichlet's problem, harmonic analysis, and the Tauberian theorems.\nIn 1926, Wiener's parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant, Margaret Engemann; they had two daughters. His sister, Constance (1898\u20131973), married mathematician Philip Franklin. Their daughter, Janet, Wiener's niece, married mathematician V\u00e1clav E. Bene\u0161. Norbert Wiener's sister, Bertha (1902\u20131995), married the botanist Carroll William Dodge.\nMany tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of Norbert Wiener at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness. It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty. He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day. He thanked her for the information and she replied, \"It's ok, Daddy, Mommy sent me to get you\".\nAsked about the story, Wiener's daughter reportedly asserted that \"he never forgot who his children were! The rest of it, however, was pretty close to what actually happened\u00a0...\"\nIn the run-up to World War II (1939\u201345) Wiener became a member of the China Aid Society and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars. (Wiener had served as a visiting lecturer at Tsing-Hua University in 1935-1936.) He was interested in placing scholars such as Yuk-Wing Lee and Antoni Zygmund who had lost their positions.\nDuring and after World War II.\nIn 1941, Wiener accepted an appointment with the National Defense Research Committee at the invitation of Vannevar Bush. Assigned to work with the NDRC's Fire Control committee, his work on the automatic aiming and firing of anti-aircraft guns caused Wiener to investigate information theory independently of Claude Shannon and to invent the Wiener filter. (The now-standard practice of modeling an information source as a random process\u2014in other words, as a variety of noise\u2014is due to Wiener.) Initially his anti-aircraft work led him to write, with Arturo Rosenblueth and his research assistant Julian Bigelow, the 1943 article 'Behavior, Purpose and Teleology', which was published in Philosophy of Science. Subsequently his anti-aircraft work led him to formulate cybernetics. Wiener left the NDRC when his contract ended in 1943.\nAfter the war, his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in cognitive science, composed of researchers in neuropsychology and the mathematics and biophysics of the nervous system, including Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts. These men later made pioneering contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence. Soon after the group was formed, Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members, mystifying his colleagues. This emotionally traumatized Pitts, and led to his career decline. In their biography of Wiener, Conway and Siegelman suggest that Wiener's wife Margaret, who detested McCulloch's bohemian lifestyle, engineered the breach.\nPatrick D. Wall speculated that after the publication of \"Cybernetics\", Wiener asked McCulloch for some physiological facts about the brain that he could then theorize. McCulloch told him \"a mixture of what was known to be true and what McCulloch thought should be\". Wiener then theorized it, went to a physiology congress, and was shot down. Wiener was convinced that McCulloch had set him up.\nWiener later helped develop the theories of cybernetics, robotics, computer control, and automation. He discussed the modeling of neurons with John von Neumann, and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener.\nWiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, and credited the contributions of others. These included Soviet researchers and their findings. Wiener's acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the Cold War. He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living, and to end economic underdevelopment. His ideas became influential in India, whose government he advised during the 1950s.\nAfter the war, Wiener became increasingly concerned with what he believed was political interference with scientific research, and the militarization of science. His article \"A Scientist Rebels\" from the January 1947 issue of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work. After the war, he refused to accept any government funding or to work on military projects. The way Wiener's beliefs concerning nuclear weapons and the Cold War contrasted with those of von Neumann is the major theme of the book \"John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener\".\nHe continued his collaborations with Rosenblueth, visiting Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog\u00eda (National Institute of Cardiology) at the latter's invitation beginning in 1945. He wrote much of \"Cybernetics\" while in residence there. Rosenblueth and Wiener subsequently received a five-year grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to support their collaboration in Mexico and at MIT. Together, they developed \"the first mathematical model of circus movement reentry\" in 1946. \nHe was a Fulbright scholar at the Coll\u00e8ge de France (1951), visiting lecturer at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (1953-1954), guest professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta (1955-1956), the University of Naples (1960-1961), and the Netherlands Central Institute for Brain Research (1964), where he was honorary head of the neurocybernetics department. Netherlands. \nWiener was a participant of the Macy conferences.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1926 Wiener married Margaret Engemann, an assistant professor of modern languages at Juniata College. They had two daughters.\nWiener admitted in his autobiography \"I Am a Mathematician: The Later Life of a Prodigy\" to abusing benzadrine throughout his life without being fully aware of its dangers.\nWiener died in March 1964, aged 69, in Stockholm, from a heart attack. Wiener and his wife are buried at the Vittum Hill Cemetery in Sandwich, New Hampshire.\nWork.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Information is information, not matter or energy.\u2014\u200a\nWiener was an early studier of stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal as if it were an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example often given to students is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener's early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.\nWiener is one of the key originators of cybernetics, a formalization of the notion of feedback, with many implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, philosophy, and the organization of society. While he claims the field arose during his personal development, it has roots in the works of Leibnitz, Babbage, Maxwell, and Gibbs. His work with cybernetics influenced Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, and through them, anthropology, sociology, and education.\nWiener equation.\nA simple mathematical representation of Brownian motion, the Wiener equation, named after Wiener, assumes the current velocity of a fluid particle fluctuates randomly.\nWiener filter.\nFor signal processing, the Wiener filter is a filter proposed by Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1942 as a classified document, which was funded by the National Defense Research Committee. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimate of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality \u2013 a theory for predicting the future as best one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that did not, strictly speaking, predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.\nNonlinear control theory.\nWiener studied polynomial chaos, a key piece of which is the Hermite-Laguerre expansion. This was developed in detail in \"Nonlinear Problems in Random Theory\".\nWiener applied Hermite-Laguerre expansion to nonlinear system identification and control. Specifically, a nonlinear system can be identified by inputting a white noise process and computing the Hermite-Laguerre expansion of its output. The identified system can then be controlled.\nIn mathematics.\nWiener took a great interest in the mathematical theory of Brownian motion (named after Robert Brown) proving many results now widely known, such as the non-differentiability of the paths. Consequently, the one-dimensional version of Brownian motion was named the Wiener process. It is the best known of the L\u00e9vy processes, c\u00e0dl\u00e0g stochastic processes with stationary statistically independent increments, and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, physics and economics (e.g. on the stock-market).\nWiener's tauberian theorem, a 1932 result of Wiener, developed Tauberian theorems in summability theory, on the face of it a chapter of real analysis, by showing that most of the known results could be encapsulated in a principle taken from harmonic analysis. In its present formulation, the theorem of Wiener does not have any obvious association with Tauberian theorems, which deal with infinite series; the translation from results formulated for integrals, or using the language of functional analysis and Banach algebras, is however a relatively routine process.\nThe Paley\u2013Wiener theorem relates growth properties of entire functions on Cn and Fourier transformation of Schwartz distributions of compact support.\nThe Wiener\u2013Khinchin theorem, (also known as the \"Wiener \u2013 Khintchine theorem\" and the \"Khinchin \u2013 Kolmogorov theorem\"), states that the power spectral density of a wide-sense-stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function.\nAn abstract Wiener space is a mathematical object in measure theory, used to construct a \"decent\", strictly positive and locally finite measure on an infinite-dimensional vector space. Wiener's original construction only applied to the space of real-valued continuous paths on the unit interval, known as classical Wiener space. Leonard Gross provided the generalization to the case of a general separable Banach space.\nThe notion of a Banach space itself was discovered independently by both Wiener and Stefan Banach at around the same time.\nViews.\nJudaism.\nDue to his ancestry, Judaism played a significant role in shaping his character and sense of self. While neither his father nor Wiener were religious, he credits the Jewish social and cultural structure in fostering certain aspects of his development. He writes: \"The Jews seem to me primarily a community and a social entity although most of them have been members of a religion as well\". Even with the increased rapprochement between Jewish and non-Jewish communities, he notes that particular facets of Jewish life and culture have persisted. \nJewish family structures are described by Wiener as being closer than their European and American peers, from which religious, racial prejudice and minority prejudice has had an effect historically \"modified their psychology and their attitude toward life\". He believes that the emphasis and encouragement of scholarly pursuits in Judaism and community structures\u2014as compared with Christianity historically\u2014meant that biological and cultural traits tended to solidify over time as compared to Christianity where there were greater rates of diffusion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let me insert here a word or two about the Jewish family structure which is not irrelevant to the Jewish tradition of learning. At all times, the young learned man, and especially the rabbi, whether or not he had an ounce of practical judgment and was able to make a good career for himself in life, was always a match for the daughter of the rich merchant.\nBecause of such tendencies within Jewish culture, this meant scholars were more likely to have larger families which\u2014in his view, which according to Wiener was also shared by his fellow collegiate and friend J. B. S. Haldane\u2014amplified certain biological and cultural traits within the Jewish community. He expressed ambivilance on issues related to Jewish nationalism and Zionism, and distanced the Jewish character from such manifestations. He did not see Jewish identity as resting on such institutions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am saying nothing about Zionism and other forms of Jewish nationalism, for the Jews are much older than any movements of this sort which have amounted to more than literary and ritual conventions, and might well continue to exist even though the new state of Israel succumbs or gives way to other manifestations of nationalism.\nWhile his family had a tradition of claiming descendance from Moses Maimonides\u2014praising their emphasis on secular learning\u2014he was more certain of being descended from Aqiba Eger who\u2014whilst being one of the greatest talmudic authorities according to Wiener\u2014opposed it.\nPublications.\nWiener wrote many books and hundreds of articles:\nWiener's papers are collected in the following works: \nFiction:\nAutobiography:\nUnder the name \"W. Norbert\":\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nWiener's life and work has been examined in many works:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt; "}
{"id": "63186", "revid": "32437858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63186", "title": "Linda Hamilton", "text": "American actress (born 1956)\nLinda Carroll Hamilton (born September 26, 1956) is an American actress. Known for portraying tough, resilient characters, she made her film debut in 1979 before achieving fame with her starring role as Sarah Connor in \"The Terminator\" (1984) and two of its sequels, ' (1991) and ' (2019). She is the recipient of various accolades, including two Saturn Awards, two MTV Movie Awards, a Satellite Award and a Romy Award, as well as nominations for three Golden Globes and one Primetime Emmy.\nHamilton's other film credits include \"Children of the Corn\" (1984), \"Black Moon Rising\", \"King Kong Lives\" (both 1986), \"Mr. Destiny\" (1990), \"Dante's Peak\" (1997), and \"The Kid &amp; I\" (2005). On television, she starred as Catherine Chandler in \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1987\u20131989) and played the recurring role of Mary Elizabeth Bartowski on NBC's \"Chuck\" (2010\u20132012). Her stage work includes \"Laura\" (Tiffany Theater, 2000) and \"The Night of the Iguana\" (Berkshire Theatre, 2006). Divorced from actor Bruce Abbott and director James Cameron, she has a child from each marriage.\nEarly life.\nHamilton was born in Salisbury, Maryland, on September 26, 1956. Hamilton's father (1928\u20131962) died when she was five; her mother (1931\u20132019) later married a police chief. Hamilton had an identical twin sister, Leslie Hamilton Freas (1956\u20132020), as well as one older sister, a younger brother, and a stepbrother. She has said that she was raised in a \"very boring, white Anglo-Saxon\" household, and that she \"voraciously read books\" in her spare time. Hamilton went to Wicomico Junior High and Wicomico High School in Salisbury.\nShe studied for two years at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, before moving on to acting studies in New York City. Hamilton has said that her acting professor at Washington College told her she had no hope of earning a living as an actress. In New York, she attended acting workshops given by Lee Strasberg.\nCareer.\n1979\u20131983: Film debut and early roles.\nHamilton made her professional debut at age 23 with a small part in the 1979 drama \"Night-Flowers\". Her first major role came the following year when she appeared as Lisa Rogers on the short-lived CBS soap opera \"Secrets of Midland Heights\" (December 1980\u2013January 1981). She appeared in the TV series \"King's Crossing,\" as Lauren Hollister, immediately afterward in 1982. Hamilton played in supporting roles to actress Marilyn Jones in both of those last\ntwo efforts, with Linda Hamilton playing the bad girl in each instance. Hamilton subsequentally appeared in her first starring film role in the low-budget thriller \"\" (1982), and co-starred that same year in the made-for-television movie \"Country Gold\". She was listed as one of twelve \"Promising New Actors of 1982\" in John A. Willis' \"Screen World\", Vol. 34.\n1984\u20131997: The \"Terminator\" franchise and television work.\nHamilton made two prominent film appearances in 1984: firstly, a starring role in \"Children of the Corn\", a horror film based on the short story by Stephen King. Hamilton played Vicky Baxter, a motorist who runs into trouble while travelling with her boyfriend through rural Nebraska. The film was financially profitable, making US$14 million at the domestic box office against a budget of US$3 million, but received generally negative reviews. In a more positive assessment by \"The New York Times\", Hamilton's performance was praised. Her next role was co-starring in James Cameron's science fiction action film \"The Terminator\" (1984) as Sarah Connor, a young waitress\u2014and soon-to-be mother of a valiant resistance leader\u2014who finds herself at the center of a nightmarish ordeal when a soldier travels back in time to help her defeat the titular cyborg assassin, sent from the future to execute her. The film was a surprise commercial hit, topping the U.S. box office for two weeks. Critics believed it to be a perfect example of its genre, with some attributing its strength to Hamilton's performance; \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that she displayed \"tremendous resiliency\" as Connor, while Janet Maslin felt she played the part \"engrossingly\" in her review for \"The New York Times\". That same year, she guest-starred in four episodes of the NBC police drama \"Hill Street Blues\".\nFollowing the success of \"The Terminator\", Hamilton starred as car thief Nina in the action thriller \"Black Moon Rising\" (1986). Also that year, she guest-starred in an episode of \"Murder, She Wrote\" and headlined the big-budget adventure film \"King Kong Lives\", a sequel to the 1976 remake of \"King Kong\". The film was a moderate financial success but was universally panned by critics.\nHamilton's next major role was that of savvy district attorney Catherine Chandler in the television series \"Beauty and the Beast\". A modern re-telling of the classic fairy tale, the show ran for three seasons on CBS between 1987 and 1990, though Hamilton requested to be written out during its third season when she fell pregnant. For her portrayal of Chandler, she won Austria's Romy Award for Favorite Actress in a Series in 1990, as well as receiving Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations in 1988 and 1989, respectively.\nHamilton returned to film with a starring role opposite in the 1990 fantasy-comedy \"Mr. Destiny\". In her review for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Sheila Benson believed that the film only worked because of \"Hamilton's intrinsic warmth\". The following year, she re-teamed with James Cameron to star in \"\". Reported at the time to be the most expensive motion picture ever made, it went on to gross over US$500 million worldwide; more than any other film that year. Of his decision to present a more troubled version of the Sarah Connor character, Cameron later reflected, \"It was all inspired by Linda really. I called her and said, 'Hey, we're [doing] another \"Terminator\"'. And she [replied], 'I want to be crazy'. I said, 'I can do that \u2014 I'll put you in a mental hospital'. She said, 'Perfect. That's what I want'\". Hamilton underwent intense physical training to emphasize the character's transformation during the seven years since the first film. \"I hated [my trainer] most of the time\", she later said; \"He would yell at me and throw tennis balls while I was shooting weapons blindfolded. I'd go off to the bathroom to cry for a minute, then I'd wipe away my tears and go back\". Critics were impressed by Hamilton's \"wild-eyed\" performance, with Derek Malcolm of \"The Guardian\" singling out her \"formidable sweaty intensity\". She went on to receive two MTV Movie Awards and the 1991 Saturn Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Connor, which has since been recognised as one of the most iconic female roles in cinematic history. Following the success of \"T2\", she was invited to host an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" on November 16, 1991.\nHamilton's subsequent film appearances were in the psychological thrillers \"Silent Fall\" (1994) and \"Separate Lives\" (1995). For her performance in the television movie \"A Mother's Prayer\" (1995), where she played a widow diagnosed with AIDS, Hamilton received a CableACE Award and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. On her decision to take the part, she said, \"So many people think I'm just this incredibly ferocious, fierce woman. Sarah Connor has sort of etched herself into my psyche and will never go away. So I chose [to play] this woman because she was a great balance of strength and frailty\". She put herself on a strict diet in preparation for the role, saying, \"I had to know what it was like ... I knew that I had to sort of sink in on myself. So I got very, very thin\".\nAfter guest-starring in an episode of \"Frasier\", Hamilton played leading roles in two features that were released one week apart in 1997: political thriller \"Shadow Conspiracy\" and the big-budget action-adventure film \"Dante's Peak\". The latter proved to be one of the biggest commercial hits of the year, grossing US$180 million. Critics were mostly unimpressed by the film's derivative narrative, but some praised the effects and performances, with Roger Ebert writing in his review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", \"In Brosnan and Hamilton [the filmmakers] have actors who play for realism and don't go over the top\". For her portrayal of small-town mayor Rachel Wando, Hamilton was named Best Actress at the following year's Blockbuster Entertainment Awards. Speaking of her casting, she said, \"Police officers, military officers and lesbians. That was pretty much what I [used to get offered] and nothing else. [When I auditioned for director] Roger Donaldson, he literally said to me: 'You've never played a part like this before' ... And [I said], 'What do you mean?' [He replied] 'Normal.' He thought I couldn't play normal! Jesus! It was just the way people thought [about me]\".\n1998\u20132018: Stage, television, and film roles.\nBetween 1998 and 1999, Hamilton appeared in a succession of voice roles in episodes of \"The New Batman Adventures\", \"Hercules\", and \"Batman Beyond\". Her next project was the Lifetime movie \"Sex &amp; Mrs. X\" (2000), where she played a magazine writer who experiences a sexual reawakening when she is assigned to interview an upper-class Parisian madam. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called it an \"[intriguing] character study that passes muster on the strength of good performances by [its leads]\", adding that Hamilton was both \"tough\" and \"tender\" in the part. Later that year, she received a Satellite Award for Best Actress for her performance in the television film \"The Color of Courage\", which \"Variety\" called \"excellent\". She also headlined a production of \"Laura\", an adaptation of the 1944 film noir of the same name, at California's Tiffany Theater in December 2000. Hamilton received praise for her portrayal of the title character, with Jay Reiner of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" commenting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There's an inherent risk in reviving a film classic like \"Laura\" ... [original star] Gene Tierney ... left such an indelible impression that any [actress] trying to fill [her] shoes [is] probably going to suffer by comparison. Linda Hamilton accepts this risk, and even turns it to her advantage, in [this] sparkling production ... Where [Tierney] gave us Laura Hunt as a ravishing femme fatale shrouded in mystery, Hamilton gives us a genuine charmer \u2014 a woman intriguing enough to invite attention, elusive enough to ensure pursuit and smart enough to make it all seem worthwhile ... after a few minutes in her company, you don't want to be anywhere else.\nThe following year, Hamilton starred in the small-scale mystery thriller \"Skeletons in the Closet\" (2001), subsequently winning a DVD Exclusive Award for Best Supporting Actress. She then portrayed the real-life Ethel Rosenberg in \"Worse Than Murder: Ethel and Julius Rosenberg\", admitting that her decision to \"transform myself into a tenement Jew from the Lower East Side\" had been a daunting one: \"I'm already prepared for the critics to be unkind to me, like, 'Why is she playing a Jewish character' or 'What's she trying to do, prove she's an actress?' But the fear is just part of the process\". The play opened in May 2002\u2014at the Ventura Theatre in California\u2014to a rave review from \"Variety\", who felt that Hamilton played her part with \"sumptuous veracity\". Next, she had supporting roles in two films: the post-Vietnam war drama \"Missing in America\" (2005) and the Penelope Spheeris-directed comedy \"The Kid &amp; I\" (2005).\nHamilton's portrayal of Maxine Faulk in the 2006 stage adaptation of \"The Night of the Iguana\" by Tennessee Williams was met with acclaim. Writing for \"Variety\", Frank Rizzo said, \"[She is] well cast as the recently widowed but hardly mourning proprietress ... She takes over the stage with natural assurance and plays this overripe survivor with lusty humor and cunning\". The production ran between August 1\u201312 at the Berkshire Theatre in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\nHamilton reprised the role of Sarah Connor for a second time with a voice cameo in 2009's \"Terminator Salvation\", which grossed US$371 million at the worldwide box office. In 2010, she joined the cast of NBC's espionage-style comedy series \"Chuck\", playing the recurring role of CIA agent Mary Elizabeth Bartowski. That same year, she guest-starred in three episodes of the Showtime dark comedy \"Weeds\"\u2014as the marijuana supplier for the series' protagonist\u2014and appeared as a \"cartoon American cop\" in the poorly received Irish film \"Holy Water\".\nIn 2011, Hamilton narrated the Chiller network's \"The Future of Fear\", a documentary on the history of horror films. She then played a fictional U.S. president in the television miniseries \"Air Force One Is Down\" (2013), and had recurring roles as a bounty hunter on the Showcase series \"Lost Girl\" (2013) and a mentally ill mother on Syfy's \"Defiance\" (2014\u20132015). Her next projects were the television pilot \"Shoot Me Nicely\" (2016), which was later released as a short film, and the small-scale science fiction film \"Curvature\" (2017). In his evaluation of the latter for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Frank Scheck described it as \"awfully loopy\", adding, \"it's always a pleasure to see Hamilton, even if it's painfully obvious that she's been cast [here] because of the genre resonance she brings to the table\".\n2019\u2013present: Return to mainstream projects.\nHamilton returned once more to the \"Terminator\" franchise and the character of Sarah Connor when she headlined the Tim Miller-directed \"\", set 25 years after the events of \"T2\". She admitted to being reluctant to sign on to the project, having spent the previous few years away from the spotlight: \"I love my alone time like no one you've ever met ... That was my hesitation: Do I want to trade this lovely, authentic life [that I've built] for that? I didn't want my neighbours looking at me differently. We're neighbors because of who we are, not what we do, and I don't want that to creep into my life again\".\nFilming on \"Dark Fate\" took place in Hungary, Spain and the U.S. between May and November 2018. Though a financial disappointment, it received generally positive reviews upon its 2019 release, particularly for Hamilton's performance. Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", David Fear felt that she provided the film's \"sinew, heart, and soul\", and said of her introduction:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A truck pulls up, we see boots hit the ground, and there she is: Sarah Connor 1.0, sunglasses on, stoic and iconic as fuck, gunning down a sprinting shape-shifter and employing a rocket launcher for a finishing move. It's the sort of movie entrance that the character (and the actor) deserves, the kind that prompts spontaneous, uncontrollable cheering in theaters ... Her weathered survivor will charitably share the screen with newcomers and old co-stars alike, but from this moment on, \"Dark Fate\" is Hamilton's property. She calmly slips the superior sequel into the back pocket of her faded work pants and walks away with it. Everyone else is acting in \"her\" movie.\nLater that year, Hamilton was named Best Actress at the Los Angeles Crime and Horror Film Festival for her portrayal of \"King George\"\u2014a ruthless crime boss\u2014in \"Easy Does It\", which \"Film Threat\" described as \"excellent ... a throwback to grindhouse adventure films [and westerns]\". She began appearing as General McCallister on Syfy's \"Resident Alien\" in 2021, which \"IndieWire\" called a \"genre-bending ... spry half-hour comedy [series]\". Also that year, she guest-starred as a hippie life coach in six episodes of the TNT dark comedy \"Claws\" during its final season.\nIt was announced in June 2023 that Hamilton would join the ensemble of the Netflix mystery-horror series \"Stranger Things\" for its fifth and final season\u2014due to air in late 2025\u2014as an unspecified character, later revealed to be Dr. Kay. A self-proclaimed fan of the show, she said of her casting, \"I don't know how to be a fangirl and an actress at the same time. I'm going to work on that\". In a 2025 interview with Variety, Hamilton said she had been considering retirement due to a long-term hip issue before being cast in Stranger Things, but decided to join the series after the Duffer brothers personally expressed their enthusiasm for her involvement.\nPersonal life.\nHamilton's twin sister, Leslie, died on August 22, 2020, at the age of 63. Leslie appeared as Linda's double in a few scenes of \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", including the scene in which the T-1000 disguises itself as Sarah Connor. Hamilton has described herself politically as a Democrat, but she voted for Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2014her \"Terminator\" co-star\u2014in the 2003 California election after his campaign convinced her he was suitable for the job. While filming \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", Hamilton suffered permanent hearing damage in one ear because she had forgotten to put in her earplugs for a scene which called for Schwarzenegger to fire a shotgun inside an elevator.\nMarriage and relationships.\nHamilton has been married and divorced twice. Her first marriage was to actor Bruce Abbott, from 1982 to 1989. He left Hamilton when she was pregnant with their son Dalton, who was born in 1989. She later stated Abbott departed due to her mood swings and physical abuse towards him stemming from bipolar disorder, and she publicly apologized to him 14 years later in 2004.\nIn 1991, Hamilton began a relationship and moved in with film director James Cameron after filming \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\". They had a daughter, born in 1993. Hamilton said she experienced postpartum depression after the birth of her second child. Hamilton and Cameron briefly separated when Cameron was filming \"Titanic\" (1997) because he was having an affair with actress Suzy Amis, who played a small role in the film. Hamilton and Cameron later got back together and married in 1997; this ended in a $50 million divorce settlement for Hamilton in 1999. Hamilton explained that they divorced because of her struggles with bipolar disorder; his relationship with Amis; them being \"terribly mismatched;\" and Cameron's intense dedication to his work, telling \"The Sun\", \"\"Titanic\" was the mistress he left me for.\"\nIn a 2019 interview for \"The New York Times\", Hamilton said she had been celibate for \"at least 15 years\". \"One loses track, because it just doesn't matter \u2014 or at least it doesn't matter to me. I have a very romantic relationship with my world every day and the people who are in it,\" she said.\nMental health.\nHamilton started to binge eat when she entered high school. After seeing a psychologist for the first time at the age of 22 in 1978\u20131979, she thought acting would help her feel better, but she ended up having a breakdown in the beginning of her acting career and turned to drugs and alcohol use and self-medicated with cocaine in order to get her confidence up. In an October 2005 appearance on \"Larry King Live\", Hamilton discussed her depression and bipolar disorder, which led to violent mood swings and suicidal thoughts during her marriage to Abbott and, in her view, caused the failure of both her marriages. She also discussed how she eventually received therapy and medication to manage the condition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His landmark novel \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1928), based on his experience in the Imperial German Army during World War I, was an international bestseller which created a new literary genre of veterans writing about conflict. The book was adapted to film several times. Remarque's anti-war themes led to his condemnation by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels as \"unpatriotic\". He was able to use his literary success and fame to relocate to Switzerland as a refugee, and to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.\nEarly life.\nRemarque was born on 22 June 1898, as Erich Paul Remark, to Peter Franz Remark and Anna Maria (n\u00e9e\u00a0Stallknecht), a working-class Roman Catholic family in Osnabr\u00fcck. He was never close with his father, a bookbinder, but he was close with his mother and he began using the middle name Maria after World War\u00a0I in her honor. Remarque was the third of four children. His siblings were his older sister Erna, older brother Theodor Arthur (who died at the age of five or six), and younger sister Elfriede.\nThe spelling of his last name was changed to Remarque when he published \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" in honor of his French ancestors and in order to disassociate himself from his earlier novel \"The Dream Room\" (). His grandfather had changed the spelling from Remarque to Remark in the 19th century. Research by Remarque's childhood and lifelong friend Hanns-Gerd Rabe proved that Remarque had French ancestors\u00a0\u2013 his great-grandfather Johann Adam Remarque, who was born in 1789, came from a French family in Aachen. This is contrary to the falsehood\u00a0\u2013 perpetuated by Nazi propaganda\u00a0\u2013 that his real last name was Kramer (\"Remark\" spelled backwards) and that he was Jewish.\nMilitary service.\nDuring World War I, Remarque was conscripted into the Imperial German Army at the age of 18. On 12\u00a0June 1917, he was transferred to the Western Front, 2nd\u00a0Company, Reserves, Field Depot of the 2nd\u00a0Guards Reserve Division at Hem-Lenglet. On 26\u00a0June 1917 he was posted to the 15th\u00a0Reserve Infantry Regiment, 2nd\u00a0Company, Engineer Platoon Bethe, and fought in the trenches between Torhout and Houthulst. On 31\u00a0July 1917 he was wounded by shell shrapnel in his left leg, right arm and neck, and after being medically evacuated from the field was repatriated to an army hospital in Duisburg, where he recovered from his wounds. In October 1918, he was recalled to military service, but the war's armistice a month later put an end to his military career.\nPost-war employment.\nAfter the war he continued his teacher training and worked from 1\u00a0August 1919 as a primary-school teacher in Lohne, at that time in the county of Lingen, now in the county of Bentheim. From May 1920 he worked in Klein Berssen in the former County of H\u00fcmmling, now Emsland, and from August 1920 in Nahne, which has been a part of Osnabr\u00fcck since 1972. On 20\u00a0November 1920 he applied for a leave of absence from teaching.\nHe worked at a number of different jobs in this phase of his life, including librarian, businessman, journalist, and editor. His first paid writing job was as a technical writer for the Continental Rubber Company, a German tire manufacturer.\nWriting career.\nRemarque had made his first attempts at writing at the age of 16. Among them were essays, poems, and the beginnings of a novel that was finished later and published in 1920 as \"The Dream Room\" (). Between 1923 and 1926 he also scripted a comic series, , drawn by Hermann Sch\u00fctz, published in the magazine \"Echo Continental\", a publication by the rubber and tire company Continental\u00a0AG.\nAfter coming back from the war, the atrocities of war along with his mother's death caused him a great deal of mental trauma and grief. In later years as a professional writer, he started using \"Maria\" as his middle name instead of \"Paul\", to commemorate his mother. When he published \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", he had his surname reverted to an earlier spelling\u00a0\u2013 from Remark to Remarque\u00a0\u2013 to disassociate himself from his novel .\nIn 1927, he published the novel \"Station at the Horizon\" (). It was serialised in the sports journal for which Remarque was working. (It was first published in book form in 1998.) \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" () (1929), his career-defining work, was also written in 1927. Remarque was at first unable to find a publisher for it. Its text described the experiences of German soldiers during World War\u00a0I. On publication it became an international bestseller and a landmark work in twentieth-century literature. It inspired a new genre of veterans writing about conflict, and the commercial publication of a wide variety of war memoirs. It also inspired dramatic representations of the war in theatre and cinema, in Germany as well as in countries that had fought in the conflict against the German Empire, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States.\nRiding on the tail of the success of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", a number of similar works followed from Remarque. In simple, emotive language, they described wartime and the postwar years in Germany. In 1931, after finishing \"The Road Back\" (), he bought a villa (Casa Monte Tabor) in Ronco, Switzerland with the substantial financial wealth that his published works had brought him. He planned to live both there and in France.\nOn 10 May 1933, at the initiative of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Remarque's writing was publicly declared as \"unpatriotic\" and was banned in Germany. Copies were removed from all libraries and restricted from being sold or published anywhere in the country.\nGermany was rapidly descending into a totalitarian society, leading to mass arrests of elements of the population of which the new governing order disapproved. Remarque left Germany to live at his villa in Switzerland. His French background as well as his Catholic faith were also publicly attacked by the Nazis. They continued to decry his writings in his absence, proclaiming that anyone who would change the spelling of his name from the German \"Remark\" to the French \"Remarque\" could not be a true German. The Nazis further made the false claim that Remarque had not seen active service during World War\u00a0I. In 1938, Remarque's German citizenship was revoked. In 1938, he and his ex-wife were remarried to prevent her repatriation to Germany. Just before the outbreak of World War\u00a0II in Europe, they left Porto Ronco, Switzerland, for the United States. They became naturalised citizens of the United States in 1947.\nRemarque continued to write about the German experience after WWI. His next novel, \"Three Comrades\" (), focuses on life in Weimar Republic in the years of 1928 and 1929. His fourth novel, \"Flotsam\" (in German titled , or \"Love Thy Neighbour\"), first appeared in a serial version in English translation in \"Collier's\" magazine in 1939. He spent another year revising the text for its book publication in 1941, both in English and German. His next work, the novel \"Arch of Triumph\", was first published in 1945 in English, and the next year in German as . Another instant bestseller, it reached worldwide sales of nearly five million. \nIn 1943, the Nazis arrested his youngest sister, Elfriede Scholz, who had stayed behind in Germany with her husband and two children. After a trial at the notorious (Hitler's extra-constitutional \"People's Court\"), she was found guilty of \"undermining morale\" for stating that she considered the war lost. Court President Roland Freisler declared, \"\" (\"Your brother is unfortunately beyond our reach\u00a0\u2013 you, however, will not escape us\"). Scholz was beheaded on 16 December 1943. Remarque later said that his sister had been involved in anti-Nazi resistance activities.\nIn exile, Remarque was unaware of his sister Elfriede's fate until after the war. He would dedicate his 1952 novel \"Spark of Life\" () to her. The dedication was omitted in the German version of the book, reportedly because she was still seen as a traitor by some Germans.\nHis final novel was \"Shadows in Paradise\". He wrote it while living at 320 East 57th Street in New York City. The apartment building \"played a prominent role in his novel\".\nLater years.\nIn 1948, Remarque returned to Switzerland, where he spent the remainder of his life. There was a gap of seven years\u00a0\u2013 a long silence for Remarque\u00a0\u2013 between \"Arch of Triumph\" and his next work, \"Spark of Life\" (), which appeared both in German and in English in 1952. While he was writing \"The Spark of Life\" he was also working on a novel (\"Time to Live and Time to Die\"). It was published first in English translation in 1954 with the not-quite-literal title \"A Time to Love and a Time to Die\". In 1958, Douglas Sirk directed the film \"A Time to Love and a Time to Die\" in Germany, based on Remarque's novel. Remarque appeared in the film as an honorable teacher in hiding from the Nazis.\nIn 1955, Remarque wrote the screenplay for an Austrian film \"The Last Act\" (), about Hitler's final days in the bunker of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, which was based on the book \"Ten Days to Die\" (1950) by Michael Musmanno. In 1956, Remarque wrote a drama \"Full Circle\" () for the stage, which played in both Germany and on Broadway. An English translation was published in 1974. \"Heaven Has No Favorites\" was serialised (as \"Borrowed Life\") in 1959 before appearing as a book in 1961 and was made into the 1977 film \"Bobby Deerfield\". \"The Night in Lisbon\" (), published in 1962, is the last work Remarque finished. The novel sold about 900,000 copies in Germany.\nPersonal life.\nRemarque's first marriage was to the actress Ilse Jutta Zambona in 1925. The marriage was stormy, and unfaithful on both sides. Remarque and Zambona divorced in 1930, but in 1933 they fled together to Switzerland. In 1938, they remarried, to prevent her from being forced to return to Germany, and in 1939 they emigrated to the United States, where they both became naturalized citizens in 1947. They divorced again on 20\u00a0May 1957, this time for good. Ilse Remarque died on 25\u00a0June 1975.\nDuring the 1930s, Remarque had relationships with Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr, Mexican actress Dolores del R\u00edo, and German actress Marlene Dietrich. The affair with Dietrich began in September 1937, when they met on the Lido while in Venice for the film festival, and continued until at least 1940, maintained mostly by way of letters, telegrams and telephone calls. A selection of their letters was published in 2003 in the book (\"Tell Me That You Love Me\") and then in the 2011 play \"Puma\".\nRemarque married actress Paulette Goddard in 1958.\nDeath and legacy.\nRemarque died of heart failure at the age of 72 in Locarno on 25 September 1970. His body was buried in the Ronco Cemetery in Ronco, Ticino, Switzerland. He never regained his German citizenship. Asked about this in an interview on his 69th birthday, Remarque replied that he refused to apply to be naturalized again as he had, after all, never applied to be denaturalized either.\nGoddard, Remarque's wife, died in 1990, and her body was interred next to her husband's. She left a bequest of US$20\u00a0million to New York University to fund an institute for European studies, which is named in honour of Remarque, as well as funding \"Goddard Hall\" on the Greenwich Village campus in New York City.\n The first director of The Remarque Institute was Professor Tony Judt. Remarque's papers are housed at NYU's Fales Library.\nAfter Erich Maria Remarque's death in 1970, his wife Paulette Goddard lived in the villa until her death in 1990. The villa was bequeathed to New York University as part of the estate of Paulette Goddard. Since New York University was not prepared to pay the associated inheritance tax of 18 million Swiss francs to the Canton of Ticino, the villa was confiscated by the canton.\nThe canton offered the villa at an auction around 2010, but there was initially no buyer, probably due to the high price and the high costs of modernizing the property. In November 2010, efforts to raise 6.2\u00a0million Swiss francs (US$7M), to buy and save the villa of Erich Maria Remarque and Paulette Goddard from demolition were underway. The intent was to transform the \"Casa Monte Tabor\" into a museum and home to an artist-in-residence program. In 2017, the property was being offered for sale as a private residence. However, by 2021, the property was finally purchased by a German couple who wish to preserve Casa Monte Tabor as a place to promote peace and preserve the legacy of Erich Maria Remarque. It will continue to be used for events on peace topics. The villa was extensively renovated in 2023.\nList of works.\nNote: the dates of English publications are those of the first publications in book form.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition to reported cases, descriptions of the alleged phenomenon appear in literature, and both types have been observed to share common characteristics in terms of circumstances and the remains of the victim.\nScientific investigations have attempted to analyze reported instances of SHC and have resulted in hypotheses regarding potential causes and mechanisms, including victim behavior and habits, alcohol consumption, and proximity to potential sources of ignition, as well as the behavior of fires that consume melted fats. Natural explanations, as well as unverified natural phenomena, have been proposed to explain reports of SHC. The current scientific consensus is that purported cases of SHC involve overlooked external sources of ignition.\nOverview.\n\"Spontaneous human combustion\" refers to the death from a fire originating without an apparent external source of ignition: a belief that the fire starts within the body of the victim. This idea and the term \"spontaneous human combustion\" were both first proposed in 1746 by Paul Rolli, a Fellow of the Royal Society, in an article published in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" concerning the mysterious death of Countess Cornelia Zangari Bandi. Writing in \"The British Medical Journal\" in 1938, coroner Gavin Thurston describes the phenomenon as having \"apparently attracted the attention not only of the medical profession but of the non-medical professionals one hundred years ago\" (referring to a fictional account published in 1834 in the Frederick Marryat cycle). In his 1995 book \"Ablaze!\", Larry E. Arnold, a director of ParaScience International, wrote that there had been about 200 cited reports of spontaneous human combustion worldwide over a period of around 300 years.\nCharacteristics.\nThe topic received coverage in the \"British Medical Journal\" in 1938. An article by L. A. Parry cited an 1823-published book \"Medical Jurisprudence\", which stated that commonalities among recorded cases of spontaneous human combustion included the following characteristics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlcoholism is a common theme in early SHC literary references, in part because some Victorian era physicians and writers believed spontaneous human combustion was the result of alcoholism.\nScientific investigation.\nAn extensive two-and-a-half-year research project, involving 30 historical cases of alleged SHC from 1725 to 1982, was conducted by science investigator Joe Nickell and forensic analyst John F. Fischer. Their lengthy, two-part report was published in 1984 in the journal of the International Association of Arson Investigators, and incorporated into their 1988 book \"Secrets of the Supernatural\". Nickell has written frequently on the subject, appeared on television documentaries, conducted additional research, and lectured at the New York State Academy of Fire Science at Montour Falls, New York, as a guest instructor.\nThe Nickell and Fischer investigation, which looked at cases in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, showed that the burned cadavers were close to plausible sources for the ignition: candles, lamps, fireplaces, and so on. Such sources were often omitted from published accounts of these incidents, presumably to deepen the aura of mystery surrounding an apparently \"spontaneous\" death. The investigations also found that there was a correlation between alleged SHC deaths and the victim's intoxication (or other forms of incapacitation) which could conceivably have caused them to be careless and unable to respond properly to an accident. Where the destruction of the body was not particularly extensive, a primary source of combustible fuel could plausibly have been the victim's clothing or a covering such as a blanket or comforter.\nHowever, where the destruction was extensive, additional fuel sources were involved, such as chair stuffing, floor coverings, the flooring itself, and the like. The investigators described how such materials helped to retain melted fat, which caused more of the body to be burned and destroyed, yielding still more liquified fat, in a cyclic process known as the \"wick effect\" or the \"candle effect\".\nAccording to the Nickell and Fischer investigation, nearby objects often remained undamaged because fire tends to burn upwards, but burns laterally with some difficulty. The fires in question are relatively small, achieving considerable destruction by the wick effect, and nearby objects may not be close enough to catch fire themselves (much as one can closely approach a modest campfire without burning). As with other mysteries, Nickell and Fischer cautioned against a \"single, simplistic explanation for all unusual burning deaths\" but rather urged investigating \"on an individual basis\". Neurologist Steven Novella has said that skepticism about spontaneous human combustion is now bleeding over into becoming popular skepticism about spontaneous combustion.\nIn a 2002 study, Angi M. Christensen of the University of Tennessee cremated both healthy and osteoporotic samples of human bone and compared the resulting color changes and fragmentation. The study found that osteoporotic bone samples \"consistently displayed more discoloration and a greater degree of fragmentation than healthy ones.\" The same study found that when human tissue is burned, the resulting flame produces a small amount of heat, indicating that fire is unlikely to spread from burning tissue.\nSuggested explanations.\nThe scientific consensus is that incidents which might appear as \"spontaneous\" combustion did in fact have an external source of ignition, and that spontaneous human combustion without an external ignition source is extremely implausible. Pseudoscientific hypotheses have been presented which attempt to explain how SHC might occur without an external flame source. Benjamin Radford, science writer and deputy editor of the science magazine \"Skeptical Inquirer\", casts doubt on the plausibility of spontaneous human combustion: \"If SHC is a real phenomenon (and not the result of an elderly or infirm person being too close to a flame source), why doesn't it happen more often? There are 8 billion people in the world [\u200a\u2060today in 2024\u2060], and yet we don't see reports of people bursting into flame while walking down the street, attending football games, or sipping a coffee at a local Starbucks.\"\nExamples.\nOn 2 July 1951, Mary Reeser, a 67-year-old woman, was found burned to death in her house in St. Petersburg, Florida after her landlady noted that the house's doorknob was unusually warm. The landlady notified the police, and upon entering the home they found Reeser's remains completely burned into ash, with only one leg remaining. The chair she was sitting in was also destroyed. Reeser had taken sleeping pills and had also been a smoker. Despite its proliferation in popular culture, the contemporary FBI investigation ruled out the possibility of SHC. A common theory was that she was smoking a cigarette after taking sleeping pills and then fell asleep while still holding the burning cigarette, which could have ignited her gown, ultimately leading to her death. Her daughter-in-law stated, \"The cigarette dropped to her lap. Her fat was the fuel that kept her burning. The floor was cement, and the chair was by itself. There was nothing around her to burn\".\nMargaret Hogan, an 89-year-old widow who lived alone in a house on Prussia Street, Dublin, Ireland, was found burned almost to the point of complete destruction on 28 March 1970. Plastic flowers on a table in the centre of the room had been reduced to liquid and a television with a melted screen sat 12 feet from the armchair in which the ashen remains were found; otherwise, the surroundings were almost untouched. Her two feet, and both legs from below the knees, were undamaged. A small coal fire had been burning in the grate when a neighbour left the house the previous day; however, no connection between this fire and that in which Mrs. Hogan died could be found. An inquest, held on 3 April 1970, recorded death by burning, with the cause of the fire listed as \"unknown\".\nOn 24 November 1979, during Thanksgiving weekend, Beatrice Oczki, a 51-year-old woman, was found charred to death in her home in the village of Bolingbrook, Illinois, United States.\nHenry Thomas, a 73-year-old man, was found burned to death in the living room of his council house on the Rassau estate in Ebbw Vale, South Wales, in 1980. Most of his body was incinerated, leaving only his skull and part of each leg below the knee. The feet and legs were still clothed in socks and trousers. Half of the chair in which he had been sitting was also destroyed. Police forensic officers decided that the incineration of Thomas was due to the wick effect.\nIn December 2010, the death of Michael Faherty, a 76-year-old man in County Galway, Ireland, was recorded as \"spontaneous combustion\" by the coroner. The doctor, Ciaran McLoughlin, made this statement at the inquiry into the death: \"This fire was thoroughly investigated and I'm left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation.\"\n\"The Skeptic\" magazine ascribed to possible SHC the 1899 case of two children from the same family who were burned to death in different places at the same time. The evidence showed that although the coincidence seemed strange, the children both loved to play with fire and had been \"whipped\" for this behavior in the past. Looking at all the evidence, the coroner and jury ruled that these were both accidental deaths.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His writings were characterized by the \"rags-to-riches\" narrative, which had a formative effect on the United States from 1868 through to his death in 1899.\nAlger secured his literary niche in 1868 with the publication of his fourth book, \"Ragged Dick\", the story of a poor bootblack's rise to middle-class respectability. The novel was a success. His many books that followed were essentially variations on \"Ragged Dick\" and featured stock characters: the valiant, hardworking, honest youth; the noble mysterious stranger; the snobbish youth; and the evil, greedy squire. \nIn the 1870s, Alger's fiction was growing stale. His publisher suggested he tour the Western United States for fresh material to incorporate into his fiction. Alger took a trip to California, but the trip had little effect on his writing: he remained mired in the staid theme of \"poor boy makes good\". The backdrops of these novels, however, became the Western United States, rather than the urban environments of the Northeastern United States.\nBiography.\nChildhood: 1832\u20131847.\nAlger was born on January 13, 1832, in Chelsea, Massachusetts, the son of Horatio Alger Sr., a Unitarian minister, and Olive Augusta Fenno.\nHe had many connections with the New England Puritan aristocracy of the early 19th century. He was the descendant of Pilgrim Fathers Robert Cushman, Thomas Cushman, and William Bassett. He was also the descendant of Sylvanus Lazell, a Minuteman and brigadier general in the War of 1812, and Edmund Lazell, a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1788.\nAlger's siblings Olive Augusta and James were born in 1833 and 1836, respectively. A disabled sister, Annie, was born in 1840, and a brother, Francis, in 1842. Alger was a precocious boy afflicted with myopia and asthma, but Alger Sr. decided early that his eldest son would one day enter the ministry. To that end, Alger's father tutored him in classical studies and allowed him to observe the responsibilities of ministering to parishioners.\nAlger began attending Chelsea Grammar School in 1842, but by December 1844 his father's financial troubles had worsened considerably. In search of a better salary, he moved the family to Marlborough, Massachusetts, an agricultural town 25 miles west of Boston, where he was installed as pastor of the Second Congregational Society in January 1845 with a salary sufficient to meet his needs. Alger attended Gates Academy, a local preparatory school, and completed his studies at age 15. He published his earliest literary works in local newspapers.\nHarvard and early works: 1848\u20131864.\nIn July 1848, Alger passed the Harvard entrance examinations and was admitted to the class of 1852. The 14-member, full-time Harvard faculty included Louis Agassiz and Asa Gray (sciences), Cornelius Conway Felton (classics), James Walker (religion and philosophy), and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (belles-lettres). Edward Everett served as president. Alger's classmate Joseph Hodges Choate described Harvard at this time as \"provincial and local because its scope and outlook hardly extended beyond the boundaries of New England; besides which it was very denominational, being held exclusively in the hands of Unitarians\".\nAlger thrived in the highly disciplined and regimented Harvard environment, winning scholastic and other prestigious awards. His genteel poverty and less-than-aristocratic heritage, however, barred him from membership in the Hasty Pudding Club and the Porcellian Club. In 1849, he became a professional writer when he sold two essays and a poem to the \"Pictorial National Library\", a Boston magazine. He began reading Walter Scott, James Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, and other modern writers of fiction and cultivated a lifelong love for Longfellow, whose verse he sometimes employed as a model for his own. He was chosen Class Odist and graduated with Phi Beta Kappa Society honors in 1852, eighth in a class of 88.\nAlger had no job prospects following graduation and returned home. He continued to write, submitting his work to religious and literary magazines, with varying success. He briefly attended Harvard Divinity School in 1853, possibly to be reunited with a romantic interest, but he left in November 1853 to take a job as an assistant editor at the \"Boston Daily Advertiser\". He loathed editing and quit in 1854 to teach at The Grange, a boys' boarding school in Rhode Island. When The Grange suspended operations in 1856, Alger found employment directing the 1856 summer session at Deerfield Academy.\nHis first book, \"Bertha's Christmas Vision: An Autumn Sheaf\", a collection of short pieces, was published in 1856, and his second book, \"Nothing to Do: A Tilt at Our Best Society\", a lengthy satirical poem, was published in 1857. He attended Harvard Divinity School from 1857 to 1860 and, upon graduation, toured Europe. In the spring of 1861, he returned to a nation in the throes of the Civil War. Exempted from military service for health reasons in July 1863, he wrote in support of the Union cause and associated with New England intellectuals. He was elected an officer in the New England Historic Genealogical Society in 1863.\nHis first novel, \"Marie Bertrand: The Felon's Daughter\", was serialized in the \"New York Weekly\" in 1864, and his first boys' book, \"Frank's Campaign\", was published by A. K. Loring in Boston the same year. Alger initially wrote for adult magazines, including \"Harper's Magazine\" and \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\", but a friendship with William Taylor Adams, a boys' author, led him to write for the young.\nMinistry: 1864\u20131866.\nOn December 8, 1864, Alger was enlisted as a pastor with the First Unitarian Church and Society of Brewster, Massachusetts. Between ministerial duties, he organized games and amusements for boys in the parish, railed against smoking and drinking, and served as president of the local chapter of the Cadets for Temperance. He submitted stories to \"The Student and Schoolmate\", a boys' monthly magazine of moral writings, edited by William Taylor Adams and published in Boston by Joseph H. Allen. In September 1865, his second boys' book, \"Paul Prescott's Charge\", was published, receiving favorable reviews.\nChild sexual abuse.\nEarly in 1866, a church committee of men was formed to investigate reports that Alger had sexually molested boys. Church officials reported to the hierarchy in Boston that Alger had been charged with \"the abominable and revolting crime of gross familiarity with boys\". Alger admitted he had been imprudent, considered his association with the church dissolved, and left town. Alger sent Unitarian officials in Boston a letter of remorse, and his father assured them his son would never seek another post in the church. The officials were satisfied and decided no further action would be taken.\nNew York City: 1866\u20131896.\nIn 1866, Alger relocated to New York City where he studied the condition of the street boys, and found in them an abundance of interesting material for stories. He abandoned forever any thought of a career in the church, and focused instead on his writing. He wrote \"Friar Anselmo\" at this time, a poem that tells of a sinning cleric's atonement through good deeds. He became interested in the welfare of the thousands of vagrant children who flooded New York City following the Civil War. He attended a children's church service at Five Points, which led to \"John Maynard\", a ballad about an actual shipwreck on Lake Erie, which brought Alger not only the respect of the literati but a letter from Longfellow. He published two poorly received adult novels, \"Helen Ford\" and \"Timothy Crump's Ward\". He fared better with stories for boys published in \"Student and Schoolmate\" and a third boys' book, \"Charlie Codman's Cruise\".\nIn January 1867, the first of 12 installments of \"Ragged Dick\" appeared in \"Student and Schoolmate\". The story, about a poor bootblack's rise to middle-class respectability, was a huge success. It was expanded and published as a novel in 1868. It proved to be his best-selling work. After \"Ragged Dick\" he wrote almost entirely for boys, and he signed a contract with publisher Loring for a Ragged Dick Series.\nIn spite of the series' success, Alger was on financially uncertain ground and tutored the five sons of the international banker Joseph Seligman. He wrote serials for \"Young Israel\" and lived in the Seligman home until 1876. In 1875, Alger produced the serial \"Shifting for Himself\" and \"Sam's Chance\", a sequel to \"The Young Outlaw\". It was evident in these books that Alger had grown stale. Profits suffered, and he headed West for new material at Loring's behest, arriving in California in February 1877. He enjoyed a reunion with his brother James in San Francisco and returned to New York late in 1877 on a schooner that sailed around Cape Horn. He wrote a few lackluster books in the following years, rehashing his established themes, but this time the tales were played before a Western background rather than an urban one.\nIn New York, Alger continued to tutor the town's aristocratic youth and to rehabilitate boys from the streets. He was writing both urban and Western-themed tales. In 1879, for example, he published \"The District Messenger Boy\" and \"The Young Miner\". In 1877, Alger's fiction became a target of librarians concerned about sensational juvenile fiction. An effort was made to remove his works from public collections, but the debate was only partially successful, defeated by the renewed interest in his work after his death.\nIn 1881, Alger informally adopted Charlie Davis, a street boy, and another, John Downie, in 1883; they lived in Alger's apartment. In 1881, he wrote a biography of President James A. Garfield but filled the work with contrived conversations and boyish excitements rather than facts. The book sold well. Alger was commissioned to write a biography of Abraham Lincoln, but again it was Alger the boys' novelist opting for thrills rather than facts.\nIn 1882, Alger's father died. Alger continued to produce stories of honest boys outwitting evil, greedy squires and malicious youths. His work appeared in hardcover and paperback, and decades-old poems were published in anthologies. He led a busy life with street boys, Harvard classmates, and the social elite. In Massachusetts, he was regarded with the same reverence as Harriet Beecher Stowe.\nLast years: 1896\u20131899.\nIn the last two decades of the 19th century, the quality of Alger's books deteriorated, and his boys' works became nothing more than reruns of the plots and themes of his past. The times had changed, boys expected more, and a streak of violence entered Alger's work. In \"The Young Bank Messenger\", for example, a woman is throttled and threatened with death\u2014something that never occurred in his earlier work.\nHe attended the theater and Harvard reunions, read literary magazines, and wrote a poem at Longfellow's death in 1882. His last novel for adults, \"The Disagreeable Woman\", was published under the pseudonym Julian Starr. He took pleasure in the successes of the boys he had informally adopted over the years, retained his interest in reform, accepted speaking engagements, and read portions of \"Ragged Dick\" to boys' assemblies.\nHis popularity\u2014and income\u2014dwindled in the 1890s. In 1896, he had what he called a \"nervous breakdown\"; he relocated permanently to his sister's home in South Natick, Massachusetts.\nHe suffered from bronchitis and asthma for two years. He died on July 18, 1899, at the home of his sister. His death was barely noticed. He is buried in the family lot at Glenwood Cemetery, South Natick, Massachusetts.\nBefore his death, Alger asked Edward Stratemeyer to complete his unfinished works. In 1901, \"Young Captain Jack\" was completed by Stratemeyer and promoted as Alger's last work. Alger once estimated that he earned only $100,000 between 1866 and 1896; at his death he had little money, leaving only small sums to family and friends. His literary work was bequeathed to his niece, to two boys he had casually adopted, and to his sister Olive Augusta, who destroyed his manuscripts and his letters, according to his wishes.\nAlger's works received favorable comments and experienced a resurgence following his death. By 1926, he sold around 20 million copies in the United States. In 1926, however, reader interest plummeted, and his major publisher ceased printing the books altogether. Surveys in 1932 and 1947 revealed very few children had read or even heard of Alger. The first Alger biography was a heavily fictionalized account published in 1928 by Herbert R. Mayes, who later admitted the work was a fraud.\nLegacy.\nSince 1947, the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans has bestowed an annual award on \"outstanding individuals in our society who have succeeded in the face of adversity\" and scholarships \"to encourage young people to pursue their dreams with determination and perseverance\".\nIn Maya Angelou's 1969 autobiography, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\", she describes her childhood belief that he was \"the greatest writer in the world\" and envy that all his protagonists were boys.\nIn 1982, to mark his 150th birthday, the Children's Aid Society held a celebration. Helen M. Gray, the executive director of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, presented a selection of Alger's books to Philip Coltoff, the Children's Aid Society executive director.\nA 1982 musical, \"Shine!\", was based on Alger's work, particularly \"Ragged Dick\" and \"Silas Snobden's Office Boy\".\nIn 2015, many of Alger's books were published as illustrated paperbacks and ebooks under the title \"Stories of Success\" by Horatio Alger. In addition, Alger's books were offered as dramatic audiobooks by the same publisher.\nStyle and themes.\nAlger scholar Gary Scharnhorst describes Alger's style as \"anachronistic\", \"often laughable\", \"distinctive\", and \"distinguished by the quality of its literary allusions\". Ranging from the Bible and William Shakespeare (half of Alger's books contain Shakespearean references) to John Milton and Cicero, the allusions he employed were a testament to his erudition. Scharnhorst credits these allusions with distinguishing Alger's novels from pulp fiction.\nScharnhorst describes six major themes in Alger's boys' books. The first, the Rise to Respectability, he observes, is evident in both his early and his late books, notably \"Ragged Dick\", whose impoverished young hero declares, \"I mean to turn over a new leaf, and try to grow up 'spectable.\" His virtuous life wins him not riches but, more realistically, a comfortable clerical position and salary. The second major theme is Character Strengthened Through Adversity. In \"Strong and Steady\" and \"Shifting for Himself\", for example, the affluent heroes are reduced to poverty and forced to meet the demands of their new circumstances. Alger occasionally cited the young Abe Lincoln as a representative of this theme for his readers. The third theme is Beauty versus Money, which became central to Alger's adult fiction. Characters fall in love and marry on the basis of their character, talents, or intellect rather than the size of their bank accounts. In \"The Train Boy\", for example, a wealthy heiress chooses to marry a talented but struggling artist, and in \"The Erie Train Boy\" a poor woman wins her true love despite the machinations of a rich, depraved suitor. Other major themes include the Old World versus the New.\nAll of Alger's novels have similar plots: a boy struggles to escape poverty through hard work and clean living. However, it is not always the hard work and clean living that rescue the boy from his situation, but rather a wealthy older gentleman, who admires the boy as a result of some extraordinary act of bravery or honesty that the boy has performed. For example, the boy rescues a child from an overturned carriage or finds and returns the man's stolen watch. Often the older man takes the boy into his home as a ward or companion and helps him find a better job, sometimes replacing a less honest or less industrious boy.\nAccording to Scharnhorst, Alger's father was \"an impoverished man\" who defaulted on his debts in 1844. His properties around Chelsea were seized and assigned to a local squire who held the mortgages. Scharnhorst speculates this episode in Alger's childhood accounts for the recurrent theme in his boys' books of heroes threatened with eviction or foreclosure and may account for Alger's \"consistent espousal of environmental reform proposals\". Scharnhorst writes, \"Financially insecure throughout his life, the younger Alger may have been active in reform organizations such as those for temperance and children's aid as a means of resolving his status-anxiety and establish his genteel credentials for leadership.\"\nAlger scholar Edwin P. Hoyt notes that Alger's morality \"coarsened\" around 1880, possibly influenced by the Western tales he was writing, because \"the most dreadful things were now almost casually proposed and explored\". Although he continued to write for boys, Alger explored subjects like violence and \"openness in the relations between the sexes and generations\"; Hoyt attributes this shift to the decline of Puritan ethics in America.\nScholar John Geck notes that Alger relied on \"formulas for experience rather than shrewd analysis of human behavior\", and that these formulas were \"culturally centered\" and \"strongly didactic\". Although the frontier society was a thing of the past during Alger's career, Geck contends that \"the idea of the frontier, even in urban slums, provides a kind of fairy tale orientation in which a Jack mentality can be both celebrated and critiqued\". He claims that Alger's intended audience were youths whose \"motivations for action are effectively shaped by the lessons they learn\".\nGeck notes that perception of the \"pluck\" characteristic of an Alger hero has changed over the decades. During the Jazz Age and the Great Depression, \"the Horatio Alger plot was viewed from the perspective of Progressivism as a staunch defense of laissez-faire capitalism, yet at the same time criticizing the cutthroat business techniques and offering hope to a suffering young generation during the Great Depression\". By the Atomic Age, however \"Alger's hero was no longer a poor boy who, through determination and providence rose to middle-class respectability. He was instead the crafty street urchin who through quick wits and luck rose from impoverishment to riches\".\nGeck observes that Alger's themes have been transformed in modern America from their original meanings into a \"male Cinderella\" myth and are an Americanization of the traditional Jack tales. Each story has its clever hero, its \"fairy godmother\", and obstacles and hindrances to the hero's rise. \"However\", he writes, \"the true Americanization of this fairy tale occurs in its subversion of this claiming of nobility; rather, the Alger hero achieves the American Dream in its nascent form, he gains a position of middle-class respectability that promises to lead wherever his motivation may take him\". The reader may speculate what Cinderella achieved as Queen and what an Alger hero attained once his middle-class status was stabilized, and \"[i]t is this commonality that fixes Horatio Alger firmly in the ranks of modern adaptors of the Cinderella myth\".\nPersonal life.\nScharnhorst writes that Alger \"exercised a certain discretion in discussing his probable homosexuality\" and was known to have mentioned his sexuality only once after the Brewster incident. In 1870, Henry James Sr. wrote that Alger \"talks freely about his own late insanity\u2014which he in fact appears to enjoy as a subject of conversation\". Although Alger was willing to speak to James, his sexuality was a closely guarded secret. According to Scharnhorst, Alger made veiled references to homosexuality in his boys' books, and these references, Scharnhorst speculates, indicate Alger was \"insecure with his sexual orientation\". Alger wrote, for example, that it was difficult to distinguish whether Tattered Tom was a boy or a girl and in other instances, he introduces foppish, effeminate, lisping \"stereotypical homosexuals\" who are treated with scorn and pity by others. In \"Silas Snobden's Office Boy\", a kidnapped boy disguised as a girl is threatened with being sent to the \"insane asylum\" if he should reveal his actual sex. Scharnhorst believes Alger's desire to atone for his \"secret sin\" may have \"spurred him to identify his own charitable acts of writing didactic books for boys with the acts of the charitable patrons in his books who wish to atone for a secret sin in their past by aiding the hero\". Scharnhorst points out that the patron in \"Try and Trust\", for example, conceals a \"sad secret\" from which he is redeemed only after saving the hero's life.\nAlan Trachtenberg, in his introduction to the Signet Classic edition of \"Ragged Dick\" (1990), points out that Alger had tremendous sympathy for boys and discovered a calling for himself in the composition of boys' books. \"He learned to consult the boy in himself\", Trachtenberg writes, \"to transmute and recast himself\u2014his genteel culture, his liberal patrician sympathy for underdogs, his shaky economic status as an author, and not least, his dangerous erotic attraction to boys\u2014into his juvenile fiction\". He observes that it is impossible to know whether Alger lived the life of a secret homosexual, \"[b]ut there are hints that the male companionship he describes as a refuge from the streets\u2014the cozy domestic arrangements between Dick and Fosdick, for example\u2014may also be an erotic relationship\". Trachtenberg observes that nothing prurient occurs in \"Ragged Dick\" but believes the few instances in Alger's work of two boys touching or a man and a boy touching \"might arouse erotic wishes in readers prepared to entertain such fantasies\". Such images, Trachtenberg believes, may imply \"a positive view of homoeroticism as an alternative way of life, of living by sympathy rather than aggression\". Trachtenberg concludes, \"in \"Ragged Dick\" we see Alger plotting domestic romance, complete with a surrogate marriage of two homeless boys, as the setting for his formulaic metamorphosis of an outcast street boy into a self-respecting citizen\".\nAlger's cousin was the Unitarian pastor William Rounseville Alger. Though he was less widely known than Horatio, Gary Scharnhorst called William the \"more talented\" cousin in his 1990 biography of William Alger.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the executive in charge of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, which included, among others and at various times, animators and directors Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising, Tex Avery, Michael Lah, and William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, the creators of \"Tom and Jerry\". MGM's cartoon characters included Droopy, Butch Dog, Barney Bear, and others, and they also released multiple one-shot cartoons.\nLife and career.\nQuimby was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and started his career as a journalist. In 1907, he managed a film theater in Missoula, Montana. Later, he worked at Path\u00e9, and became a member of the board of directors before leaving in 1921 to become an independent producer. He was hired by Fox Film in 1924, and moved to MGM in 1927 to head its short features department. In 1937, he was assigned to create MGM's animation department.\nIn 1939, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera presented Quimby with a proposal for a series of cartoons featuring a cat and a mouse. Although he had no interest in the idea, Quimby approved, and the result was \"Puss Gets the Boot\", which was nominated for an Academy Award. Initially, he refused to pursue more Cat and Mouse cartoons after \"Puss Gets the Boot\". However, following the critical and financial success of that cartoon, he agreed to make \"Tom and Jerry\" an official cartoon of the MGM cartoon studio.\nAs producer, Quimby became a multiple recipient of the Academy Award for Animated Short Film for the \"Tom and Jerry\" films, though he never invited Hanna and Barbera onstage when he accepted the awards. His name became well known due to its prominence in the credits of MGM'S cartoons, appearing alone in the final title card before the beginning of the cartoon proper, a placement often used for the cartoon's director in shorts released by other studios, such as Warner Bros.\nQuimby took sole credit for approving and producing the \"Tom and Jerry\" series, but was not involved in the creative process and had a difficult relationship with animators, including Hanna and Barbera, who believed that Quimby was not fit for a real animation leader:\nAfter the production of \"Good Will to Men\" (a remake of \"Peace on Earth\"), Quimby retired from MGM in May 1955, with Hanna and Barbera assuming his role as co-heads of the studio and taking over the production title for the \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts.\nDespite its success with Hanna and Barbera's releases, MGM assumed that re-releasing old cartoons would be more profitable, and the cartoon division was closed in 1957. MGM would later contract first Gene Deitch and then Chuck Jones to produce more \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts through their own studios during the 1960s.\nQuimby died of a heart attack in Santa Monica, California on September 16, 1965, about seven weeks after his 79th birthday, and was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63216", "revid": "12949512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63216", "title": "Startup company", "text": "New company developing a novel, scalable business\nA startup or start-up is a company or project typically undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable business model. While entrepreneurship includes all new businesses including self-employment and businesses that do not intend to go public, startups are new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo-founder. At the early stages, startups face significant uncertainty and high rates of failure. However, a minority achieve notable success and influence, with some growing into unicorns- private companies valued at over US$1 billion. It is typically characterized by an innovative stance, a potential for rapid growth, external funding, and vulnerability.\nActions.\nStartups typically begin by a founder (solo-founder) or co-founders who have a way to solve a problem. The founder of a startup will do the market validation by problem interview, solution interview, and building a minimum viable product (MVP), i.e. a prototype, to develop and validate their business models. The startup process can take a long period of time; hence, sustaining effort is required. Over the long term, sustaining effort is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes. Having a business plan in place outlines what to do and how to plan and achieve an idea in the future. Typically, these plans outline the first three to five years of your business strategy.\nDesign principles.\nModels behind startups presenting as ventures are usually associated with design science. Design science uses design principles considered to be a coherent set of normative ideas and propositions to design and construct the company's backbone. For example, one of the initial design principles is affordable loss.\nHeuristics and biases in startup actions.\nBecause of the lack of information, high uncertainty, and the need to make decisions quickly, founders usually use many heuristics and exhibit biases in their leadership decisions.\nEntrepreneurs often become overconfident about their startups and their influence on an outcome (case of \"the illusion of control\"). Below are some of the most critical decision biases of entrepreneurs to start up a new business.\nStartups use several action principles to generate evidence as quickly as possible to reduce the downside effect of decision biases such as an escalation of commitment, overconfidence, and the illusion of control.\nMentoring.\nMany entrepreneurs seek feedback from mentors in creating their startups. Mentors guide founders and impart entrepreneurial skills and may increase the self-efficacy of nascent entrepreneurs. Mentoring offers direction for entrepreneurs to enhance their knowledge of how to sustain their assets relating to their status and identity and strengthen their real-time skills.\nPrinciples.\nThere are many principles in creating a startup. Some of the principles needed are listed below:\nLean startup.\nLean startup is a clear set of principles to create and design startups under limited resources and tremendous uncertainty to build their ventures more flexibly and at a lower cost. It is based on the idea that entrepreneurs can make their implicit assumptions about how their venture works explicit and empirically testing it. The empirical test is to de/validate these assumptions and to get an engaged understanding of the business model of the new ventures, and in doing so, the new ventures are created iteratively in a build\u2013measure\u2013learn loop. Hence, lean startup is a set of principles for entrepreneurial learning and business model design. More precisely, it is a set of design principles aimed for iteratively experiential learning under uncertainty in an engaged empirical manner. Typically, a lean startup focuses on a few lean principles:\nMarket validation.\nA key principle of startup is to validate the market need before providing a customer-centric product or service to avoid business ideas with weak demand. Market validation can be done in a number of ways, including surveys, cold calling, email responses, word of mouth or through sample research.\nDesign thinking.\nDesign thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving that emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and experimentation. It is widely used to deeply understand customers' needs, behaviors, and pain points through immersive engagement and iterative feedback. By placing users at the center of the innovation process, design thinking seeks to uncover insights that can lead to more effective, relevant, and impactful solutions.\nHowever, while design thinking\u2014and its complementary methodology, customer development\u2014aim to reduce assumptions and promote evidence-based innovation, they are not immune to cognitive biases. In fact, both processes can inadvertently reinforce existing biases at multiple stages. For instance, the way problems are framed, the sources of information selected, the questions posed during interviews, and the interpretation of qualitative data can all be influenced by the facilitator\u2019s or team\u2019s preconceived notions.\nThese biases can subtly shape what is observed and how it is understood, potentially leading to solutions that reflect the designers' perspectives more than the users\u2019. As a result, the promise of achieving \"customer empathy\" can be compromised if critical reflection and bias-checking mechanisms are not embedded throughout the process. Therefore, while design thinking is a powerful tool for innovation, its effectiveness depends heavily on the rigor, objectivity, and self-awareness of the individuals applying it. Encouraging people to consider the opposite of whatever decision they are about to make tends to reduce biases such as overconfidence, the hindsight bias, and anchoring.\nDecision-making under uncertainty.\nIn startups, many decisions are made under uncertainty, and hence a key principle for startups is to be agile and flexible. Founders can embed options to design startups in flexible manners, so that the startups can change easily in future.\nUncertainty can vary within-person (I feel more uncertain this year than last year) and between-person (he feels more uncertain than she does). A study found that when entrepreneurs feel more uncertain, they identify more opportunities (within-person difference), but entrepreneurs who perceive more uncertainties than others do not identify more opportunities than others do (no between-person difference).\nPartnering.\nStartups may form partnerships with other firms to enable their business model to operate. To become attractive to other businesses, startups need to align their internal features, such as management style and products with the market situation. In their 2013 study, Kask and Linton develop two ideal profiles, or also known as configurations or archetypes, for startups that are commercializing inventions. The \"inheritor\" profile calls for a management style that is not too entrepreneurial (more conservative) and the startup should have an incremental invention (building on a previous standard). This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market with a dominant design (a clear standard is applied in this market). In contrast to this, profile is the \"originator\" which has a management style that is highly entrepreneurial and in which a radical invention or a disruptive innovation (totally new standard) is being developed. This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that does not have a dominant design (established standard). New startups should align themselves to one of the profiles when commercializing an invention to be able to find and be attractive to a business partner. By finding a business partner, a startup has greater chances of success.\nStartups usually need many different partners to realize their business idea. The commercialization process is often a bumpy road with iterations and new insights during the process. Hasche and Linton argue that startups can learn from their relationships with other firms, and even if the relationship ends, the startup will have gained valuable knowledge about how it should move on going forward. When a relationship is failing for a startup it needs to make changes. Three types of changes can be identified according to Hasche and Linton:\nEntrepreneurial learning.\nStartups need to learn at a huge speed before running out of resources. Proactive actions (experimentation, searching, etc.) enhance a founder's learning to start a company. To learn effectively, founders often formulate falsifiable hypotheses, build a minimum viable product (MVP), and conduct A/B testing.\nBusiness model design.\nWith the key learnings from market validation, design thinking, and lean startup, founders can design a business model. However it is important not to dive into business models too early before there is sufficient learning on market validation. Paul Graham said: \"What I tell founders is not to sweat the business model too much at first. The most important task at first is to build something people want. If you don't do that, it won't matter how clever your business model is.\"\nFounders/entrepreneurs.\nFounders or co-founders are people involved in the initial launch of startup companies. Three people are mainly required as co-founders to create a powerful team: the product person (e.g. an engineer), a marketing person (for market research, customer interaction, vision) and a finance or operation's person (to handle operations or raise funds).\nThe founder that is responsible for the overall strategy of the startup plays the role of founder-CEOs, much like CEOs in established firms. Startup studios provide an opportunity for founders and team members to grow along with the business they help to build. In order to create forward momentum, founders must ensure that they provide opportunities for their team members to grow and evolve within the company.\nThe language of securities regulation in the United States considers co-founders to be promoters under Regulation D. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission definition of promoter includes: (i) Any person who, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more other persons, directly or indirectly takes initiative in founding and organizing the business or enterprise of an issuer; However, not every promoter is a co-founder. In fact, there is no formal, legal definition of what makes somebody a co-founder. The right to call oneself a co-founder can be established through an agreement with one's fellow co-founders or with permission of the board of directors, investors, or shareholders of a startup company. When there is no definitive agreement (like shareholders' agreement), disputes about who the co-founders are, can arise.\nSelf-efficacy.\nSelf-efficacy refers to the confidence an individual has to create a new business or startup. It has a strong relation with startup actions. Entrepreneurs' sense of self-efficacy can play a major role in how they approach goals, tasks, and challenges. Entrepreneurs with high self-efficacy\u2014that is, those who believe they can perform well\u2014are more likely to view difficult tasks as something to be mastered rather than something to be avoided.\nStress.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStartups are pressure cookers. Don't let the casual dress and playful office environment fool you. New enterprises operate under do-or-die conditions. If you do not roll out a useable product or service in a timely fashion, the company will fail. Bye-bye paycheck, hello eviction.\nIman Jalali, chief of staff at ContextMedia\nEntrepreneurs often feel stressed. They have internal and external pressures. Internally, they need to meet deadlines to develop the prototypes and get the product or service ready for market. Externally they are expected to meet milestones of investors and other stakeholders to ensure continued resources from them on the startups. Coping with stress is critical to entrepreneurs because of the stressful nature of starting up a new firm under uncertainty. Coping with stress unsuccessfully could lead to emotional exhaustion, and the founders may close or exit the startups.\nEmotional exhaustion.\nSustaining effort is required as the startup process can take a long period of time, by one estimate, three years or longer. Sustaining effort over the long term is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes.\nFounder identity and culture.\nSome startup founders have a more casual or offbeat attitude in their dress, office space and marketing, as compared to executives in established corporations. For example, startup founders in the 2010s wore hoodies, sneakers and other casual clothes to business meetings. Their offices may have recreational facilities in them, such as pool tables, ping pong tables, football tables and pinball machines, which are used to create a fun work environment, stimulate team development and team spirit, and encourage creativity. Some of the casual approaches, such as the use of \"flat\" organizational structures, in which regular employees can talk with the founders and chief executive officers informally, are done to promote efficiency in the workplace, which is needed to get their business off the ground.\nIn a 1960 study, Douglas McGregor stressed that punishments and rewards for uniformity in the workplace are not necessary because some people are born with the motivation to work without incentives. Some startups do not use a strict command and control hierarchical structure, with executives, managers, supervisors and employees. Some startups offer employees incentives such as stock options, to increase their \"buy in\" from the start up (as these employees stand to gain if the company does well). This removal of stressors allows the workers and researchers in the startup to focus less on the work environment around them, and more on achieving the task at hand, giving them the potential to achieve something great for both themselves and their company.\nFailure.\nThe failure rate of startup companies is very high. Analysts continue to report very high startup failure rates. While a 2014 Fortune article estimated that 90% fail, more recent analyses indicate that about 65\u201380% of startups fail within five years, depending on industry and geography. In the UK, for example, startups (companies in their first seven years) accounted for 46% of all company insolvencies in 2024\u2014the lowest proportion in over a decade, according to PwC. In a sample of 101 unsuccessful startups, companies reported that experiencing one or more of five common factors were the reason for failure; the lack of consumer interest in the product or service (42% of failures), funding or cash problems (29%), personnel or staffing problems (23%), competition from rival companies (19%) and problems with pricing of the product or service (18%). In cases of funding problems, it can leave employees without paychecks. Sometimes, these companies are purchased by other companies if they are deemed to be viable, but oftentimes, they leave employees with very little recourse to recoup lost income for worked time. More than one-third of founders believe that running out of money led to failure. Second to that, founders attribute their failure to a lack of financing or investor interest. These common mistakes and missteps that happen early in the startup journey can result in failure, but there are precautions entrepreneurs can take to help mitigate risk. For example, startup studios offer a buffer against many of the obstacles that solo entrepreneurs face, such as funding and insufficient team structure, making them a good resource for startups in their earliest phases. Another large study of 160.000 failed companies, identified key factors such as a dysfunctional founding team, a poor business plan, or just a flawed product-market fit as examples of the primary sources of failure.\nThe lack of human and financial resources or even dedicated patent attorneys in the early stages of a startup makes it difficult to compete with larger companies, and likewise increases the time and reduces the probability of patent applications.\nRe-starters.\nFailed entrepreneurs, or restarters, who after some time restart in the same sector with more or less the same activities, have an increased chance of becoming a better entrepreneur. However, some studies indicate that restarters are more heavily discouraged in Europe than in the US.\nTraining.\nMany institutions and universities provide training on startups. In the context of universities, some of the courses are entrepreneurship courses that also deal with the topic of startups, while other courses are specifically dedicated to startups. Startup courses are found both in traditional economic or business disciplines as well as the side of information technology disciplines. As startups are often focused on software, they are also occasionally taught while focusing on software development alongside the business aspects of a startup.\nFounders go through a lot to set up a startup. A startup requires patience and resilience, and training programs need to have both the business components and the psychological components. Entrepreneurship education is effective in increasing the entrepreneurial attitudes and perceived behavioral control, helping people and their businesses grow. Most of startup training falls into the mode of experiential learning, in which students are exposed to a large extent to a real-life entrepreneurship context as new venture teams. An example of group-based experiential startup training is the Lean LaunchPad initiative that applies the principles of customer development and Lean Startup to technology-based startup projects.\nAs startups are typically thought to operate under a notable lack of resources, have little or no operating history, and to consist of individuals with little practical experience, it is possible to simulate startups in a classroom setting with reasonable accuracy. In fact, it is not uncommon for students to actually participate in real startups during and after their studies. Similarly, university courses teaching software startup themes often have students found mock-up startups during the courses and encourage them to make them into real startups should they wish to do so. Such mock-up startups, however, may not be enough to accurately simulate real-world startup practice if the challenges typically faced by startups (e.g. lack of funding to keep operating) are not present in the course setting.\nTo date, much of the entrepreneurship training is yet to be personalized to match the participants and the training.\nEcosystem.\nThe size and maturity of the startup ecosystem is where a startup is launched and where it grows to have an effect on the volume and success of the startups. The startup ecosystem consists of the individuals (entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, angel investors, mentors, advisors); institutions and organizations (top research universities and institutes, business schools and entrepreneurship programs and centres operated by universities and colleges, non-profit entrepreneurship support organizations, government entrepreneurship programs and services, Chambers of commerce) business incubators and business accelerators and top-performing entrepreneurial firms and startups. A region with all of these elements is considered to be a \"strong\" startup ecosystem.\nOne of the most famous startup ecosystems is Silicon Valley in California, where major computer and internet firms and top universities such as Stanford University create a stimulating startup environment. Boston (where Massachusetts Institute of Technology is located) and Berlin, home of WISTA (a top research area), also have numerous creative industries, leading entrepreneurs and startup firms. Basically, attempts are being made worldwide, for example in Israel with its Silicon Wadi, in France with the Inovall\u00e9e or in Italy in Trieste with the AREA Science Park, to network basic research, universities and technology parks in order to create a startup-friendly ecosystem.\nAlthough there are startups created in all types of businesses, and all over the world, some locations and business sectors are particularly associated with startup companies. The internet bubble of the late 1990s was associated with huge numbers of internet startup companies, some selling the technology to provide internet access, others using the internet to provide services. Most of this startup activity was located in the most well-known startup ecosystem - Silicon Valley, an area of northern California renowned for the high level of startup company activity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The spark that set off the explosive boom of \"Silicon startups\" in Stanford Industrial Park was a personal dispute in 1957 between employees of Shockley Semiconductor and the company's namesake and founder, Nobel laureate and co-inventor of the transistor William Shockley... (His employees) formed Fairchild Semiconductor immediately following their departure...\nAfter several years, Fairchild gained its footing, becoming a formidable presence in this sector. Its founders began leaving to start companies based on their own latest ideas and were followed on this path by their own former leading employees... The process gained momentum and what had once begun in a Stanford's research park became a veritable startup avalanche... Thus, over the course of just 20 years, a mere eight of Shockley's former employees gave forth 65 new enterprises, which then went on to do the same... \nStartup advocates are also trying to build a community of tech startups in New York City with organizations like NY Tech Meet Up and Built in NYC. In the early 2000s, the patent assets of failed startup companies were being purchased by people known as patent trolls, who assert those patents against companies that might be infringing the technology covered by the patents.\nInvesting.\nStartup investing is the action of making an investment in an early-stage company. Beyond founders' own contributions, some startups raise additional investment at some or several stages of their growth. Not all startups trying to raise investments are successful in their fundraising. Venture Capital is a subdivision of Private Equity wherein external investors fund small-scale startups that have high growth potential in the long run. Venture capital is the money of invention that is invested into young businesses which hold no historic background. Usually, the business of venture capital is highly risky but one can at the same time expect high returns as well.\nIn the United States, the solicitation of funds became easier for startups as result of the JOBS Act. Prior to the advent of equity crowdfunding, a form of online investing that has been legalized in several nations, startups did not advertise themselves to the general public as investment opportunities until and unless they first obtained approval from regulators for an initial public offering (IPO) that typically involved a listing of the startup's securities on a stock exchange. Today, there are many alternative forms of IPO commonly employed by startups and startup promoters that do not include an exchange listing, so they may avoid certain regulatory compliance obligations, including mandatory periodic disclosures of financial information and factual discussion of business conditions by management that investors and potential investors routinely receive from registered public companies.\nOver the last decade, Europe has developed a rapid start-up scene that has given birth to global players, including more than 70 unicorns, and has created more than two million jobs. Investment in European start-ups increased sixfold between 2010 and 2020, reaching approximately \u20ac40 billion. Europe does a poorer job of nurturing young companies because of a failure to support their development into industry leaders. Promising European start-ups then struggle to raise the necessary capital to expand and mature. They are forced to either relocate to the US's deep capital markets or sell themselves to larger rivals with more financial availability. As a result, start-ups in the United States can typically raise far more money\u2014up to five times as much as in Europe.\nInvestors are generally most attracted to those new companies distinguished by their strong co-founding team, a balanced \"risk/reward\" profile (in which high risk due to the untested, disruptive innovations is balanced out by high potential returns) and \"scalability\" (the likelihood that a startup can expand its operations by serving more markets or more customers). Attractive startups generally have lower \"bootstrapping\" (self-funding of startups by the founders) costs, higher risk, and higher potential return on investment. Successful startups are typically more scalable than an established business, in the sense that the startup has the potential to grow rapidly with a limited investment of capital, labor or land. Timing has often been the single most important factor for biggest startup successes, while at the same time it is identified to be one of the hardest things to master by many serial entrepreneurs and investors.\nStartups have several options for funding. Revenue-based financing lenders can help startup companies by providing non-dilutive growth capital in exchange for a percentage of monthly revenue. Venture capital firms and angel investors may help startup companies begin operations, exchanging seed money for an equity stake in the firm. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing to a range of startups (a portfolio), with the expectation that a very small number of the startups will become viable and make money. In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using \"bootstrapping\", in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and credit card debt to finance the venture. Factoring is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of crowdfunding, for example equity crowdfunding, in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the Internet.\nStartups can receive funding via more involved stakeholders, such as startup studios. Startup studios provide funding to support the business through a successful launch, but they also provide extensive operational support, such as HR, finance and accounting, marketing, and product development, to increase the probability of success and propel growth.\nStartup are funded through preset rounds, depending on their funding requirement and the stage of growth of the company. Startup investing is generally divided into six stage, namely\nNecessity of funding.\nWhile some (would-be) entrepreneurs believe that they can't start a company without funding from VC, Angel, etc.\u00a0that is not the case. In fact, many entrepreneurs have founded successful businesses for almost no capital, including the founders of MailChimp, Shopify, and ShutterStock.\nValuations.\nIf a company's value is based on its technology, it is often equally important for the business owners to obtain intellectual property protection for their idea. The newsmagazine \"The Economist\" estimated that up to 75% of the value of US public companies is now based on their intellectual property (up from 40% in 1980). Often, 100% of a small startup company's value is based on its intellectual property. As such, it is important for technology-oriented startup companies to develop a sound strategy for protecting their intellectual capital as early as possible. Startup companies, particularly those associated with new technology, sometimes produce huge returns to their creators and investors\u2014a recent example of such is Google, whose creators became billionaires through their stock ownership and options.\nInvesting rounds.\nWhen investing in a startup, there are different types of stages in which the investor can participate. The first round is called seed round. The seed round generally is when the startup is still in the very early phase of execution when their product is still in the prototype phase. There is likely no performance data or positive financials as of yet. Therefore, investors rely on strength of the idea and the team in place. At this level, family friends and angel investors will be the ones participating. At this stage the level of risk and payoff are at their greatest. The next round is called Series A. At this point the company already has traction and may be making revenue. In Series A rounds venture capital firms will be participating alongside angels or super angel investors. The next rounds are Series B, C, and D. These three rounds are the ones leading towards the Initial Public Offering (IPO). Venture capital firms and private equity firms will be participating. Series B: Companies are generating consistent revenue but must scale to meet growing demand. Series C &amp; D: Companies with strong financial performance looking to expand to new markets, develop new products, make an acquisition, and/or preparing for IPO.\nHistory of startup investing.\nAfter the Great Depression, which was blamed in part on a rise in speculative investments in unregulated small companies, startup investing was primarily a word of mouth activity reserved for the friends and family of a startup's co-founders, business angels, and Venture Capital funds. In the United States, this has been the case ever since the implementation of the Securities Act of 1933. Many nations implemented similar legislation to prohibit general solicitation and general advertising of unregistered securities, including shares offered by startup companies. In 2005, a new Accelerator investment model was introduced by Y Combinator that combined fixed terms investment model with fixed period intense bootcamp style training program, to streamline the seed/early-stage investment process with training to be more systematic.\nFollowing Y Combinator, many accelerators with similar models have emerged around the world. The accelerator model has since become very common and widely spread and they are key organizations of any Startup ecosystem. Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), first implemented on 23 September 2013, granted startups in and startup co-founders or promoters in US. the right to generally solicit and advertise publicly using any method of communication on the condition that only accredited investors are allowed to purchase the securities. However the regulations affecting equity crowdfunding in different countries vary a lot with different levels and models of freedom and restrictions. In many countries there are no limitations restricting general public from investing to startups, while there can still be other types of restrictions in place, like limiting the amount that companies can seek from investors. Due to positive development and growth of crowdfunding, many countries are actively updating their regulation in regards to crowdfunding.\nInvesting online.\nThe first known investment-based crowdfunding platform for startups was launched in February 2010 by Grow VC, followed by the first US. based company ProFounder launching model for startups to raise investments directly on the site, but ProFounder later decided to shut down its business due regulatory reasons preventing them from continuing, having launched their model for US. markets prior to JOBS Act. With the positive progress of the JOBS Act for crowd investing in US., equity crowdfunding platforms like SeedInvest and CircleUp started to emerge in 2011 and platforms such as investiere, Companisto and Seedrs in Europe and OurCrowd in Israel. The idea of these platforms is to streamline the process and resolve the two main points that were taking place in the market. The first problem was for startups to be able to access capital and to decrease the amount of time that it takes to close a round of financing. The second problem was intended to increase the amount of deal flow for the investor and to also centralize the process.\nInternal startups.\nInternal startups are a form of corporate entrepreneurship. Large or well-established companies often try to promote innovation by setting up \"internal startups\", new business divisions that operate at arm's length from the rest of the company. Examples include Bell Labs, a research unit within the Bell System and Target Corporation (which began as an internal startup of the Dayton's department store chain) and threedegrees, a product developed by an internal startup of Microsoft.\nUnicorns.\nSome startups become big and they become unicorns, i.e. privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion. The term was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, choosing the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures. As of January 2025, there are 1,523 unicorns worldwide, with a combined valuation of about US$5.6 trillion. The United States leads with 758 unicorns (\u224849.8%), followed by China with 343, and India with 64. The unicorns are concentrated in a few countries. The unicorn leaders are the U.S. with 196 companies, China with 165, India with 107 and the U.K. with 16. The largest unicorns included Ant Financial, ByteDance, DiDi, Uber, Xiaomi, and Airbnb. When the value of a company is over US$10 billion, the company will be called as a decacorn. When the company is valued over US$100 billion, hectocorn will be used.\nCritiques of the start-up mode.\nAccording to Nikos Smyrnaios, Silicon Valley's start-ups are emblematic of the post-Fordist enterprise, reflecting a move toward values of liberty, autonomy and authenticity, and away from the Fordist emphasis on solidarity, economic security and equality.\nFor some researchers, such as Antoine Gouritin, the start-up model, like many digital-related objects, is underpinned by a \"solutionist\" logic, as Evgeny Morozov describes it. \"Technological solutionism\" corresponds to the belief that thanks to digital tools such as those created by start-ups, simple and technical solutions can be found to all kinds of problems. Therefore, what is expected of start-ups is not that they address the root causes of problems, but that they find effective technical solutions quickly.\nThe organizational model of start-ups is also questioned by former employees. For example, Mathilde Ramadier, a former start-up employee, brings the debate to the fore in France with her book \"Bienvenue dans le nouveau monde. Comment j'ai surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 la coolitude des start-ups\" [\"Welcome to the new world. How I survived start-up coolness\"] in 2017. Since then, awareness has been growing. The non-hierarchical organization of start-ups means that all employees bear equal responsibility for their running smoothly. They are based on voluntary commitment and internalized behavioral norms rather than formal hierarchical constraints. Employees, encouraged to meet targets, often exceed overtime limits. Professional and personal life often blend in this highly connected environment. Employees are expected, without discussion, to give of themselves without counting the cost, to be always reachable and available, without asking for compensation commensurate with their professional commitment (in terms of time and activities), and to place the general interest of the organization before their personal interest. Finally, the employment contracts of start-up employees are often precarious since the company itself is not completely stable.\nEconomist Scott A. Shane has used data on start-ups published in many countries to draw conclusions in terms of public policy. He is critical of public policy that encourages start-ups, pointing to evidence that these policies lead people to create marginal businesses that are more likely to fail, have little economic impact, and generate a very limited number of jobs.\nToday.\nToday, the San Francisco bay area has the highest number of startups globally, with 14,500. It is followed by New York City with 12,500 and Silicon Wadi in Israel, with around 9000, which is the highest per capita figure in the world.\nAccording to PitchBook research, nearly 1 in 4 startups claims to be an artificial intelligence company as of 2024.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63218", "revid": "49556611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63218", "title": "Present value", "text": "Economic concept\nIn economics and finance, present value (PV), also known as present discounted value (PDV), is the value of an expected income stream determined as of the date of valuation. The present value is usually less than the future value because money has interest-earning potential, a characteristic referred to as the time value of money, except during times of negative interest rates, when the present value will be equal or more than the future value. Time value can be described with the simplified phrase, \"A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow\". Here, 'worth more' means that its value is greater than tomorrow. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because the dollar can be invested and earn a day's worth of interest, making the total accumulate to a value more than a dollar by tomorrow. Interest can be compared to rent. Just as rent is paid to a landlord by a tenant without the ownership of the asset being transferred, interest is paid to a lender by a borrower who gains access to the money for a time before paying it back. By letting the borrower have access to the money, the lender has sacrificed the exchange value of this money, and is compensated for it in the form of interest. The initial amount of borrowed funds (the present value) is less than the total amount of money paid to the lender.\nPresent value calculations, and similarly future value calculations, are used to value loans, mortgages, annuities, sinking funds, perpetuities, bonds, and more. These calculations are used to make comparisons between cash flows that don\u2019t occur at simultaneous times, since time and dates must be consistent in order to make comparisons between values. When deciding between projects in which to invest, the choice can be made by comparing respective present values of such projects by means of discounting the expected income streams at the corresponding project interest rate, or rate of return. The project with the highest present value, i.e. that is most valuable today, should be chosen.\nBackground.\nIf offered a choice between $100 today or $100 in one year, and there is a positive real interest rate throughout the year, a rational person will choose $100 today. This is described by economists as time preference. Time preference can be measured by auctioning off a risk free security\u2014like a US Treasury bill. If a $100 note with a zero coupon, payable in one year, sells for $80 now, then $80 is the present value of the note that will be worth $100 a year from now. This is because money can be put in a bank account or any other (safe) investment that will return interest in the future.\nAn investor who has some money has two options: to spend it right now or to save it. But the financial compensation for saving it (and not spending it) is that the money value will accrue through the compound interest that he or she will receive from a borrower (the bank account in which he has the money deposited).\nTherefore, to evaluate the real value of an amount of money today after a given period of time, economic agents compound the amount of money at a given (interest) rate. Most actuarial calculations use the risk-free interest rate which corresponds to the minimum guaranteed rate provided by a bank's saving account for example, assuming no risk of default by the bank to return the money to the account holder on time. To compare the change in purchasing power, the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate) should be used.\nThe operation of evaluating a present value into the future value is called a capitalization (how much will $100 today be worth in 5 years?). The reverse operation\u2014evaluating the present value of a future amount of money\u2014is called a discounting (how much will $100 received in 5 years\u2014at a lottery for example\u2014be worth today?).\nIt follows that if one has to choose between receiving $100 today and $100 in one year, the rational decision is to choose the $100 today. If the money is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the person has to be offered at least $105 in one year so that the two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 today or receiving $105 in one year). This is because if $100 is deposited in a savings account, the value will be $105 after one year, again assuming no risk of losing the initial amount through bank default.\nInterest rates.\nInterest is the additional amount of money gained between the beginning and the end of a time period. Interest represents the time value of money, and can be thought of as rent that is required of a borrower in order to use money from a lender. For example, when an individual takes out a bank loan, the individual is charged interest. Alternatively, when an individual deposits money into a bank, the money earns interest. In this case, the bank is the borrower of the funds and is responsible for crediting interest to the account holder. Similarly, when an individual invests in a company (through corporate bonds, or through stock), the company is borrowing funds, and must pay interest to the individual (in the form of coupon payments, dividends, or stock price appreciation).\nThe interest rate is the change, expressed as a percentage, in the amount of money during one compounding period. A compounding period is the length of time that must transpire before interest is credited, or added to the total. For example, interest that is compounded annually is credited once a year, and the compounding period is one year. Interest that is compounded quarterly is credited four times a year, and the compounding period is three months. A compounding period can be any length of time, but some common periods are annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, daily, and even continuously.\nThere are several types and terms associated with interest rates:\nCalculation.\nThe operation of evaluating a present sum of money some time in the future is called a capitalization (how much will 100 today be worth in five years?). The reverse operation\u2014evaluating the present value of a future amount of money\u2014is called discounting (how much will 100 received in five years be worth today?).\nSpreadsheets commonly offer functions to compute present value. In Microsoft Excel, there are present value functions for single payments - \"=NPV(...)\", and series of equal, periodic payments - \"=PV(...)\". Programs will calculate present value flexibly for any cash flow and interest rate, or for a schedule of different interest rates at different times.\nPresent value of a lump sum.\nThe most commonly applied model of present valuation uses compound interest. The standard formula is:\nformula_1\nWhere formula_2 is the future amount of money that must be discounted, formula_3 is the number of compounding periods between the present date and the date where the sum is worth formula_2, formula_5 is the interest rate for one compounding period (the end of a compounding period is when interest is applied, for example, annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, daily). The interest rate, formula_5, is given as a percentage, but expressed as a decimal in this formula.\nOften, formula_7 is referred to as the Present Value Factor \nThis is also found from the formula for the future value with negative time.\nFor example, if you are to receive $1000 in five years, and the effective annual interest rate during this period is 10% (or 0.10), then the present value of this amount is\nformula_8\nThe interpretation is that for an effective annual interest rate of 10%, an individual would be indifferent to receiving $1000 in five years, or $620.92 today.\nThe purchasing power in today's money of an amount formula_2 of money, formula_3 years into the future, can be computed with the same formula, where in this case formula_5 is an assumed future inflation rate.\nIf we are using lower discount rate(\"i\" ), then it allows the present values in the discount future to have higher values.\nNet present value of a stream of cash flows.\nA cash flow is an amount of money that is either paid out or received, differentiated by a negative or positive sign, at the end of a period. Conventionally, cash flows that are received are denoted with a positive sign (total cash has increased) and cash flows that are paid out are denoted with a negative sign (total cash has decreased). The cash flow for a period represents the net change in money of that period. Calculating the net present value, formula_12, of a stream of cash flows consists of discounting each cash flow to the present, using the present value factor and the appropriate number of compounding periods, and combining these values.\nFor example, if a stream of cash flows consists of +$100 at the end of period one, -$50 at the end of period two, and +$35 at the end of period three, and the interest rate per compounding period is 5% (0.05) then the present value of these three Cash Flows are:\nformula_13\nformula_14\nformula_15 respectively\nThus the net present value would be:\nformula_16\nThere are a few considerations to be made.\nformula_17\nformula_19\nHere, formula_20 is the nominal annual interest rate, compounded quarterly, and the interest rate per quarter is formula_21\nPresent value of an annuity.\nMany financial arrangements (including bonds, other loans, leases, salaries, membership dues, annuities including annuity-immediate and annuity-due, straight-line depreciation charges) stipulate structured payment schedules; payments of the same amount at regular time intervals. Such an arrangement is called an annuity. The expressions for the present value of such payments are summations of geometric series.\nThere are two types of annuities: an annuity-immediate and annuity-due. For an annuity immediate, formula_22 payments are received (or paid) at the end of each period, at times 1 through formula_22, while for an annuity due, formula_22 payments are received (or paid) at the beginning of each period, at times 0 through formula_25. This subtle difference must be accounted for when calculating the present value.\nAn annuity due is an annuity immediate with one more interest-earning period. Thus, the two present values differ by a factor of formula_26:\nformula_27\nThe present value of an annuity immediate is the value at time 0 of the stream of cash flows:\nformula_28\nwhere:\nformula_22 = number of periods,\nformula_30 = amount of cash flows,\nformula_18 = effective periodic interest rate or rate of return.\nAn approximation for annuity and loan calculations.\nThe above formula (1) for annuity immediate calculations offers little insight for the average user and requires the use of some form of computing machinery. There is an approximation which is less intimidating, easier to compute and offers some insight for the non-specialist. It is given by \n formula_32\nWhere, as above, C is annuity payment, PV is principal, n is number of payments, starting at end of first period, and i is interest rate per period. Equivalently C is the periodic loan repayment for a loan of PV extending over n periods at interest rate, i. The formula is valid (for positive n, i) for ni\u22643. For completeness, for ni\u22653 the approximation is formula_33.\nThe formula can, under some circumstances, reduce the calculation to one of mental arithmetic alone. For example, what are the (approximate) loan repayments for a loan of PV = $10,000 repaid annually for n = ten years at 15% interest (i = 0.15)? The applicable approximate formula is C \u2248 10,000*(1/10 + (2/3) 0.15) = 10,000*(0.1+0.1) = 10,000*0.2 = $2000 pa by mental arithmetic alone. The true answer is $1993, very close.\nThe overall approximation is accurate to within \u00b16% (for all n\u22651) for interest rates 0\u2264i\u22640.20 and within \u00b110% for interest rates 0.20\u2264i\u22640.40. It is, however, intended only for \"rough\" calculations.\nPresent value of a perpetuity.\nA perpetuity refers to periodic payments, receivable indefinitely, although few such instruments exist. The present value of a perpetuity can be calculated by taking the limit of the above formula as \"n\" approaches infinity.\nformula_34\nFormula (2) can also be found by subtracting from (1) the present value of a perpetuity delayed n periods, or directly by summing the present value of the payments\nformula_35\nwhich form a geometric series.\nAgain there is a distinction between a perpetuity immediate \u2013 when payments received at the end of the period \u2013 and a perpetuity due \u2013 payment received at the beginning of a period. And similarly to annuity calculations, a perpetuity due and a perpetuity immediate differ by a factor of formula_36:\nformula_37\n\"See: Bond valuation#Present value approach\"\nPV of a bond.\nA corporation issues a bond, an interest earning debt security, to an investor to raise funds. The bond has a face value, formula_38, coupon rate, formula_39, and maturity date which in turn yields the number of periods until the debt matures and must be repaid. A bondholder will receive coupon payments semiannually (unless otherwise specified) in the amount of formula_40, until the bond matures, at which point the bondholder will receive the final coupon payment and the face value of a bond, formula_41.\nThe present value of a bond is the purchase price.\nThe purchase price can be computed as:\nformula_42 formula_43\nThe purchase price is equal to the bond's face value if the coupon rate is equal to the current interest rate of the market, and in this case, the bond is said to be sold 'at par'. If the coupon rate is less than the market interest rate, the purchase price will be less than the bond's face value, and the bond is said to have been sold 'at a discount', or below par. Finally, if the coupon rate is greater than the market interest rate, the purchase price will be greater than the bond's face value, and the bond is said to have been sold 'at a premium', or above par.\nTechnical details.\nPresent value is additive. The present value of a bundle of cash flows is the sum of each one's present value. See time value of money for further discussion.\nThese calculations must be applied carefully, as there are underlying assumptions:\nVariants/approaches.\nThere are mainly two flavors of Present Value. Whenever there will be uncertainties in both timing and amount of the cash flows, the expected present value approach will often be the appropriate technique. With Present Value under uncertainty, future dividends are replaced by their conditional expectation.\nChoice of interest rate.\nThe interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate if there are no risks involved in the project. The rate of return from the project must equal or exceed this rate of return or it would be better to invest the capital in these risk free assets. If there are risks involved in an investment this can be reflected through the use of a risk premium. The risk premium required can be found by comparing the project with the rate of return required from other projects with similar risks. Thus it is possible for investors to take account of any uncertainty involved in various investments.\nPresent value method of valuation.\nAn investor, the lender of money, must decide the financial project in which to invest their money, and present value offers one method of deciding.\nA financial project requires an initial outlay of money, such as the price of stock or the price of a corporate bond. The project claims to return the initial outlay, as well as some surplus (for example, interest, or future cash flows). An investor can decide which project to invest in by calculating each projects\u2019 present value (using the same interest rate for each calculation) and then comparing them. The project with the smallest present value \u2013 the least initial outlay \u2013 will be chosen because it offers the same return as the other projects for the least amount of money.\nYears' purchase.\nThe traditional method of valuing future income streams as a present capital sum is to multiply the average expected annual cash-flow by a multiple, known as \"years' purchase\". For example, in selling to a third party a property leased to a tenant under a 99-year lease at a rent of $10,000 per annum, a deal might be struck at \"20 years' purchase\", which would value the lease at 20 * $10,000, i.e. $200,000. This equates to a present value discounted in perpetuity at 5%. For a riskier investment the purchaser would demand to pay a lower number of years' purchase. This was the method used for example by the English crown in setting re-sale prices for manors seized at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the early 16th century. The standard usage was 20 years' purchase.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A dissenting person may be referred to as a \"dissenter\".\nPhilosophical.\nIn philosophical skepticism, particularly that of Pyrrhonism, the existence of dissent is a rationale for suspending judgment regarding the issue associated with the dissent. Dissent in this respect appears as one of the tropes in the Five Modes of Agrippa, pointing to the uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general.\nPolitical.\nPolitical dissent is a dissatisfaction with or opposition to the policies of a governing body. Expressions of dissent may take forms from vocal disagreement to civil disobedience to the use of violence. In some political systems, dissent may be formally expressed by way of opposition politics, while politically repressive regimes may prohibit any form of dissent, leading to suppression of dissent and the encouragement of social or political activism. Individuals who do not conform or support the policies of certain states are known as \"dissidents\". Several thinkers have argued that a healthy society needs not only to protect, but also to encourage dissent.\nReligious.\nHeresy.\nHeresy is any belief or theory that is strongly at variance with established beliefs or customs, in particular the accepted beliefs of a church or religious organization. A heretic is a proponent of such claims or beliefs. Heresy is distinct from both apostasy, which is the explicit renunciation of one's religion, principles or cause, and blasphemy, which is an impious utterance or action concerning God or sacred things.\nThe term is usually used to refer to violations of important religious teachings, but is used also of views strongly opposed to any generally accepted ideas. It is used in particular in reference to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.\nSchism.\nA schism (pronounced , or, less commonly, ) is a division between people, usually belonging to an organization, movement, or religious denomination. The word is most frequently applied to a split in what had previously been a single religious body, such as the East\u2013West Schism or the Great Western Schism. It is also used of a split within a non-religious organization or movement or, more broadly, of a separation between two or more people, be it brothers, friends, lovers, etc.\nA \"schismatic\" is a person who creates or incites schism in an organization or who is a member of a splinter group. \"Schismatic\" as an adjective means pertaining to a schism or schisms, or to those ideas, policies, etc. that are thought to lead towards or promote schism.\nIn religion, the charge of schism is distinguished from that of heresy, since the offence of schism concerns not differences of belief or doctrine but promotion of, or the state of, division. However, schisms frequently involve mutual accusations of heresy. In Roman Catholic teaching, every heresy is a schism, while there may be some schisms free of the added guilt of heresy. Liberal Protestantism, however, has often preferred heresy over schism. Presbyterian scholar James I. McCord (quoted with approval by the Episcopalian Bishop of Virginia Peter Lee) drew a distinction between them, teaching: \"If you must make a choice between heresy and schism, always choose heresy. As a schismatic, you have torn and divided the body of Christ. Choose heresy every time.\"\nMilitary.\nOfficers and enlisted personnel regularly take an oral oath to support and defend the primary convening document (i.e. constitution, articles of confederation, ruling laws and statutes) and/or the supreme leader of the nation-state. There have been countless cases throughout human history where commissioned military officers and enlisted personnel\u2014as individuals or small groups\u2014have chosen to question and disobey the orders of their superior officers or the supreme leader of the state. Dissent by military officers falls into two main categories: violent and non-violent. In essence, when a military officer, military leader chooses to oppose the orders given to them by their superior officers or national leader, they must decide whether their counter-action will be violent or non-violent in nature and in aim.\nJudicial.\nA dissenting opinion (or \"dissent\") is an opinion in a legal case in certain legal systems written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion of the court which gives rise to its judgment. When not necessarily referring to a legal decision, this can also be referred to as a minority report.\nDissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any concurring opinions, and are also delivered and published at the same time. A dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law. Even though they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court's holding should be limited or overturned. In some cases, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law, and a later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular understanding of the law formerly advocated in dissent. As with concurring opinions, the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often illuminate the precise holding of the majority opinion.\nScientific.\nScientific dissent is dissent from scientific consensus. Disagreements can be useful for finding problems in underlying assumptions, methodologies, and reasoning, as well as for generating and testing new ways of tackling the unknown. In modern times, with the increased role of science on the society and the politicization of science, a new aspect gained prominence: effects of scientific dissent on public policies.\nScientific dissent is distinct from denialism, which is a deliberate rejection of scientific consensus usually for commercial or ideological reasons.\nOrganizational.\nOrganizational dissent is the \"expression of disagreement or contradictory opinions about organizational practices and policies\". Since dissent involves disagreement it can lead to conflict, which if not resolved, can lead to violence and struggle. As a result, many organizations send the message \u2013 verbally or nonverbally \u2013 that dissent is discouraged. However, recent studies have shown that dissent serves as an important monitoring force within organizations. Dissent can be a warning sign for employee dissatisfaction or organizational decline. Redding (1985) found that receptiveness to dissent allows for corrective feedback to monitor unethical and immoral behavior, impractical and ineffectual organizational practices and policies, poor and unfavorable decision making, and insensitivity to employees' workplace needs and desires. Furthermore, Eilerman argues that the hidden costs of silencing dissent include: wasted and lost time, reduced decision quality, emotional and relationship costs, and decreased job motivation. Perlow (2003) found that employee resentment can lead to a decrease in productivity and creativity which can result in the organization losing money, time, and resources.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63229", "revid": "45266726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63229", "title": "Bee-eater", "text": "Widespread group of insectivorous bird species in the family Meropidae\nThe bee-eaters are a group of birds in the family Meropidae, containing three genera and thirty-one species. Most species are found in Africa and Asia, with a few in southern Europe, Australia, and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured plumage, slender bodies, and usually elongated central tail feathers. All have long down-turned bills and medium to long wings, which may be pointed or round. Male and female plumages are usually similar.\nAs their name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which are caught on the wing from an open perch. The insect's stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect's body, thereby discharging most of the venom.\nMost bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows tunnelled into vertical sandy banks, often at the side of a river or in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for their young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.\nBee-eaters may be killed by raptors; their nests are raided by rodents, weasels, martens and snakes, and they can carry various parasites. Some species are adversely affected by human activity or habitat loss, but none meet the International Union for Conservation of Nature's vulnerability criteria, and all are therefore evaluated as \"least concern\". Their conspicuous appearance means that they have been mentioned by ancient writers and incorporated into mythology.\nTaxonomy.\nThe bee-eaters were first named as a scientific group by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz, who created the bird subfamily Meropia for these birds in 1815. The name, now modernised as Meropidae, is derived from \"Merops\", the Ancient Greek for \"bee-eater\", and the English term \"bee-eater\" was first recorded in 1668, referring to the European species.\nThe bee-eaters have been considered to be related to other families, such as the rollers, hoopoes and kingfishers, but ancestors of those families diverged from the bee-eaters at least forty million years ago, so any relationship is not close. The scarcity of fossils is unhelpful. Bee-eater fossils from the Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) have been found in Austria, and there are Holocene (from 11,700 years ago to present) specimens from Israel and Russia, but all have proved to be of the extant European bee-eater. Opinions have varied as to the bee-eater's nearest relatives. In 2001, Fry considered the kingfishers to be the most likely, whereas a large study published in 2008 found that bee-eaters are sister to all other Coraciiformes (rollers, ground rollers, todies, motmots and kingfishers). A 2009 book supported Fry's contention, but then a later study in 2015 suggested that the bee-eaters are sister to the rollers. The 2008 and 2015 papers both linked the kingfishers to the New World motmots.\nMore recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed that the bee-eaters are more closely related to the rollers and ground rollers than they are to the todies, motmots and kingfishers. The relationship between the families is shown the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).\nThe bee-eaters are generally similar in appearance, although they are normally divided into three genera. \"Nyctyornis\" comprises two large species with long throat feathers, the blue-bearded bee-eater and the red-bearded bee-eater, both of which have rounded wings, a ridged culmen, feathered nostrils and a relatively sluggish lifestyle. The purple-bearded bee-eater is the sole member of \"Meropogon\", which is intermediate between \"Nyctyornis\" and the typical bee-eaters, having rounded wings and a \"beard\", but a smooth culmen and no nostril feathers. All the remaining species are normally retained in the single genus \"Merops\". There are close relationships within this genus, for example the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eater form a superspecies, but formerly suggested genera, such as \"Aerops\", \"Melittophagus\", \"Bombylonax\" and \"Dicrocercus\", have not been generally accepted for several decades since a 1969 paper united them in the current arrangement.\nSpecies in taxonomic order.\nThe bee-eater family contains the following species.\nThe Asian green bee-eater, African green bee-eater, and Arabian green bee-eater were previously considered to be a single species, and are still treated as such by some authorities.\nA 2007 nuclear and mitochondrial DNA study produced a possible phylogenetic tree, although the position of the purple-bearded bee-eater seems anomalous, in that it appears amongst \"Merops\" species.\nDescription.\nThe bee-eaters are morphologically a fairly uniform group. They share many features with related Coraciiformes such as the kingfishers and rollers, being large-headed (although less so than their relatives), short-necked, brightly plumaged and short-legged. Their wings may be rounded or pointed, with the wing shape closely correlated with the species' preferred foraging habitat and migratory tendencies. Shorter, rounder wings are found on species that are sedentary and make typically short foraging flights in denser forests and reed-beds. Those with more elongated wings are more migratory. All the bee-eaters are highly aerial; they take off strongly from perches, fly directly without undulations, and are able to change direction quickly, although they rarely hover.\nThe flight feathers of the wing comprise 10 primaries, the outermost being very small, and 13 secondaries, and there are 12 tail feathers.\nThe bills of bee-eaters are curved, long and end in a sharp point. The bill can bite strongly, particularly at the tip, and it is used as a pair of forceps with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.\nThe plumage of the family is generally very bright and in most species is mainly or at least partially green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are primarily rose-coloured. Most of the \"Merops\" bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.\nThere is little visible difference between the sexes in most of the family, although in several species the iris is red in the males and brown-red in the females, and in species with tail-streamers these may be slightly longer in males. Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow bee-eater has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually dichromatic at the ultraviolet part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of blue-tailed bee-eater found that males were more colourful than females in UV light. Their overall colour was also affected by body condition, suggesting that there was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two \"Nyctyornis\" species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.\nBee-eaters have calls that are characteristic for each species. Most sound simple to the human ear, but show significant variability when studied in detail, carrying significant information for the birds.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe bee-eaters have an Old World distribution, occurring from Europe to Australia. The centre of diversity of the family is Africa, although a number of species also occur in Asia. Single species occur in each of Europe, (the European bee-eater), Australia (the rainbow bee-eater) and Madagascar (the olive bee-eater, also found on mainland Africa). Of the three genera, \"Merops\", which has the majority of the species, occurs across the entirety of the family's distribution. \"Nyctyornis\" is restricted to Asia, ranging from India and southern China to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The genus \"Meropogon\" has a single species restricted to Sulawesi in Indonesia.\nBee-eaters are fairly indiscriminate in their choice of habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages close to the ground in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.\nSpecies that breed in subtropical or temperate areas of Europe, Asia and Australia are all migratory. The European bee-eaters that breed in southern Europe and Asia migrate to West and southern Africa. Another population of the same species breeds in South Africa and Namibia; these birds move northwards after breeding. In Australia the rainbow bee-eater is migratory in the southern areas of its range, migrating to Indonesia and New Guinea, but occurs year-round in northern Australia. Several species of bee-eater, are intra-African migrants; the white-throated bee-eater, for example, breeds on the southern edge of the Sahara and winters further south in equatorial rainforest. The most unusual migration is that of the southern carmine bee-eater, which has a three-stage migration; after breeding in a band between Angola and Mozambique it moves south to Botswana, Namibia and South Africa before moving north to its main wintering grounds in northern Angola, Congo and Tanzania.\nBehaviour.\nThe bee-eaters are diurnal, although a few species may migrate during the night if the terrain \"en route\" is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are often so close that they touch (an individual distance of zero). Many species are colonial in the breeding season and some species are also highly gregarious when not nesting.\nThe social structures of the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eaters have been described as more complex than for any other bird species. The birds exist in colonies located on nesting cliffs, and have a stable structure all year round. These colonies typically contain five to 50 burrows, occasionally up to 200, and are composed of clans of two or three pairs, their helpers, and their offspring. The helpers are male offspring from a previous year. Within the colony, the males alternate between guarding their mate and attempting to make forced copulations with other females. The females in turn attempt to lay eggs in their neighbour's nests, an example of brood parasitism. Some individuals also specialise in kleptoparasitism, stealing prey collected by other colony members. The colony's daily routine is to emerge from the nesting holes or roosting branches soon after dawn, preen and sun themselves for an hour, then disperse to feed. Feeding territories are divided by clan, with each clan defending its territory from all others of the same species, including clans of the same colony. The clans return to the colony before dusk, and engage in more social behaviour before retiring for the night. Colonies are situated several hundred metres apart and have little to do with each other, although young individuals may disperse between colonies. As such, these species can be thought to have four tiers of social kinship: the individual pair, the family unit, the clan, and the colony as a whole.\nBee-eaters spend around 10% of their day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning behaviour helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.\nDiet and feeding.\nThe bee-eaters are almost exclusively aerial hunters of insect prey. Prey is caught either on the wing or more commonly from an exposed perch from which the bee-eater watches for prey. Smaller, rounder-winged bee-eaters typically hunt from branches and twigs closer to the ground, whereas the larger species hunt from tree tops or telephone wires. One unusual technique often used by carmine bee-eaters is to ride on the backs of bustards.\nPrey can be spotted from a distance; European bee-eaters are able to spot a bee away, and blue-cheeked bee-eaters have been observed flying out to catch large wasps. Prey is approached directly or from behind. Prey that lands on the ground or on plants is usually not pursued. Small prey may be eaten on the wing, but larger items are returned to the perch where they are beaten until dead and then broken up. Insects with poisonous stings are first smacked on the branch, then, with the bird's eyes closed, rubbed to discharge the venom sac and stinger. This behaviour is innate, as demonstrated by a juvenile bird in captivity, which performed the task when first presented with wild bees. This bird was stung on the first five tries, but by ten bees, it was as adept at handling bees as adult birds.\nBee-eaters consume a wide range of insects; beyond a few distasteful butterflies they consume almost any insect from tiny \"Drosophila\" flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, mayflies, stoneflies, cicadas, termites, crickets and grasshoppers, mantises, true flies and moths. For many species, the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely wasps and bees. In a survey of 20 studies, the proportion of the diet made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these honeybees can comprise a large part of the diet, as much as 89% of the overall intake. The preference for bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The giant honeybee is a particularly commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably could not fit down its throat.\nLike kingfishers, bee-eaters regurgitate pellets of undigested material, typically long black oblongs.\nPredation of honey bees.\nIf an apiary is set up close to a bee-eater colony, a larger number of honey bees are eaten because they are more abundant. However, studies show the bee-eaters do not intentionally fly into the apiary, rather they feed on the insects caught on pastures and meadows within a radius of from the colony, this maximum distance being reached only when there is a shortage of food. Observations show that the birds actually enter the apiary only in cold and rainy periods, when the bees do not leave the hive and other insect prey are harder for the bee-eaters to detect.\nMany bee-keepers believe that the bee-eaters are the main obstacle causing worker bees not to forage, and instead stay inside the hives for much of the day between May and the end of August. However, a study carried out in a eucalyptus forest in the Alaluas region in the Murqub District in Libya, east of Tripoli, showed that the bee-eaters were not the main obstacle to bee foraging; in some cases, the foraging rate was higher in the presence of the birds than in their absence. The average bird meal consisted of 90.8% honey bees and 9.2% beetles.\nPredation is more likely when the bees are queening or during the peak of migration, from late March till mid-April, and in mid-September. Hives close to or under trees or overhead cables are at increased risk as the birds pounce on flying insects from these perches.\nBreeding.\nBee-eaters are monogamous during a nesting season, and in sedentary species, pairs may stay together for multiple years. Migratory bee-eaters may find new mates each breeding season. The courtship displays of the bee-eaters are rather unspectacular, with some calling and raising of throat and wing feathers. The exception is the performance of the white-throated bee-eater. Their \"butterfly display\" involves both members of a pair performing a gliding display flight with shallow wing-beats; they then perch facing each other, raising and folding their wings while calling. Most members of the family engage in courtship feeding, where the male presents prey items to the female, and such feeding can account for much, if not all, of the energy females require for egg creation.\nLike almost all Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In the case of the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or directly into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although B\u00f6hm's bee-eater always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine loess deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.\nNo nesting material is used in the breeding cavity. One white egg is laid each day until the typical clutch of about five eggs is complete. Incubation starts soon after the first egg is laid, with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young defecate in the nest, and their pellets are trodden underfoot, making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are in the nest for about 30 days.\nBee-eaters may nest as single pairs, loose colonies or dense colonies. Smaller species tend to nest solitarily, while medium-sized bee-eaters have small colonies, and larger and migratory species nest in large colonies that can number in the thousands. In some instances, colonies may contain more than one species of bee-eater. In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers. These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.\nPredators and parasites.\nBee-eater nests may be raided by rats and snakes, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little bee-eater and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater's chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like \"two\" bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.\nBee-eaters may be infested by several blood-feeding flies of the genus \"Carnus\", and the biting fly \"Ornithophila metallica\". Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera \"Meromenopon\", \"Brueeliaa\" and \"Meropoecus\", some of which are specialist parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea \"Echidnophaga gallinacea\". The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus \"Haemoproteus\" including \"H. meropis\".\nFly larvae of the genus \"Fannia\" live in the nests of at least European bee-eaters, and feed on faeces and food remains. Their presence and cleaning activities appear to benefit the developing bee-eaters.\nStatus.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assesses species vulnerability in terms of total population and the rate of any population decline. None of the bee-eaters meet the IUCN vulnerability criteria, and all are therefore evaluated as \"Least-concern species\".\nOpen country species, which comprise the majority of bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.\nA study of the southern carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost through poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000\u20136,000 annually being killed illegally by poachers in Cyprus alone, where it is a protected species.\nIn culture.\nBee-eaters were mentioned by ancient writers such as Aristotle and Virgil, who both advised beekeepers to kill the birds. Aristotle knew that bee-eaters nested at the end of tunnels up to long and the size of their clutch. He said that nesting adults were fed by their own young, based on the observed actual help at the nest by related birds.\nIn Greek mythology, the Theban Botres was fatally struck by his father when he desecrated a ritual sacrifice of a ram to the god Apollo by tasting the victim's brains. The god took pity on him, turning him into a bee-eater.\nThe Ancient Egyptians believed that bee-eaters had medical properties, prescribing the application of bee-eater fat to deter biting flies, and treating the eyes with the smoke from charred bee-eater legs to cure an unspecified female complaint.\nIn Hinduism, the shape of the bird in flight was thought to resemble a bow, with the long bill as an arrow. This led to a Sanskrit name meaning \"Vishnu's bow\" and an association with archer gods. Scandalmongers were thought to be reincarnated as bee-eaters, because of the metaphorical poison they bore in their mouths.\nDepictions in classical art are rare for such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian example is a relief, probably of a little green bee-eater, on a wall of Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, and an early Roman mural depicting blue-cheeked bee-eaters was found in the villa of Agrippina. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most common subjects, with 18 and 11 countries respectively.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Victoria is the State with the greatest number of ski resorts in Australia. The highest peak in Victoria is Mount Bogong at 1986m. The first ski tow was constructed near Mount Buffalo in 1938. Victoria has a number of well developed ski resorts including Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Buller. Cross country skiing is popular in such national parks as Mount Buffalo National Park and Alpine National Park.\nOverview.\nA hospice was built at Mount Saint Bernard (Elevation 1540) around 1863 along a track developed to link the Victorian gold fields. Snowshoes were developed locally to assist winter travellers and a larger hospice built around 1884. Recreational and practical skiing was being practised in the area by the 1880s and 90s with skis made from local timbers, and making use of single steering poles. The first winter traverse of the Victorian Alps was made in 1900, via the Hospice and Mount Hotham. The Hospice operated as a recreational ski location into the 1930s, but was destroyed by bushfire in 1939.\nSkiing began at Mount Buffalo in the 1890s and the Mount Buffalo Chalet in Victoria was constructed in 1910. Australia's first ski tow was constructed near Mount Buffalo in 1938. Buffalo's first ski lodge was built at Dingo Dell in 1954. A bushfire in 2006 forced the temporary closure of the resort and negotiations are continuing over a new lease on the property. A stone cottage was built at Mount Hotham in 1925 to cater for a growing interest in sport of skiing and a Club was built in 1944 with the first ski tow installed in 1951. A ski hut was erected at Mount Baw Baw, just 120\u00a0km East of Melbourne, in 1945 and a ski rope tow added in 1955. The first ski lift went into service at Mount Buller in 1949, and in the same year rope tow was installed at Falls Creek. In 1957, Australia's first chairlift was installed at Falls Creek, and the area is today the largest ski resort in Victoria.\nThe Mount Buller Interschools Event claims to be the largest interdisciplinary snow-sports event on earth. In 2008 it attracted 3500 participants.\nSnow play is also available at Mount Donna Buang.\nCross Country &amp; Back Country Skiing.\nDedicated Cross Country ski resorts are located at Lake Mountain, Mount Stirling and Mount St Gwinear in Victoria and popular areas for back country skiing and ski touring in the Alpine National Park, Yarra Ranges National Park and the Baw Baw National Park include: Mount Bogong, Mount Feathertop, Bogong High Plains, Mount Howitt, Mount Reynard and Snowy Plains. The Kangaroo Hoppet is a leg of the Worldloppet cross-country race series which is conducted on the last Saturday of August each year, hosted by Falls Creek in Victoria. The showpiece 42-kilometre race attracts thousands of spectators and competitors.\nThe Australian High Country is populated by unique flora and fauna including wombats, wallabies, echidnas, and the Snow Gum. The Alpine regions are subject to environmental protection, which has limited the scope of commercial development of skiable terrain, however Australia has extensive cross country skiing terrain.\nSki areas.\nBack country ski areas.\nPopular areas for back country skiing and ski touring in the Alpine National Park, Mount Buffalo National Park, Yarra Ranges National Park and the Baw Baw National Park include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The national park is situated approximately west of Melbourne and approximately southwest of Macarthur. It derives its name from the Budj Bim volcano, formerly Mount Eccles, which is situated in the north-east of the park.\nThe park now forms part of the larger Budj Bim heritage areas of both national and world significance, due to the extensive systems of aquaculture created by Aboriginal Australians thousands of years ago and the significance of the area to the Gunditjmara people.\nFeatures.\nLocated within the national park is Budj Bim, formerly named Mount Eccles by the European people who settled in the area, is the site of one of the most recent active volcanos in Australia. The first activity was about 40,000\u00a0years ago when Budj Bim was formed by lava pouring out the Earth's crust. The most recent eruption was approximately 8,000\u00a0years ago. Budj Bim is a fairly small hill surrounded by lush vegetation with a small, hidden, deep volcanic crater lake named Lake Surprise. It is famous for an adjacent lava tube and there are numerous lava tubes in the surrounding farm land.\nHeritage areas.\nThe park was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2004 as part of the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape for its importance in Indigenous history and its geology.\nAs one of three components of the Budj Bim Cultural Landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List on 6 July 2019.\nManagement.\nAs of 2020[ [update]] Budj Bim National Park, as part of the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape, is jointly managed by Parks Victoria, the (Gunditjmara) Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation (GMTOAC) and Winda-Mara TOAC (a south-west Victorian organisation representing Indigenous Australians in the area). The Council forms part of the 2007 Native Title Settlement Agreement between the Gunditjmara and the Victoria State Government, under which both parties manage the park landscape.\n2020 bushfires.\nDuring the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, fires broke out within the Budj Bim Cultural Heritage Landscape. The stone fish traps and the stone house site were unaffected by fire, and fortunately the fires were quickly contained, partly due to mild weather conditions and partly by the efforts of firefighters. Lake Condah and Condah Mission were not directly affected by the fires. In the National Park, the campground and picnic area reopened from 29 February 2020, but the Lake Surprise walking track and access to Tunnel Cave were closed due to the impact of the fires. As of 2020[ [update]], the Crater Rim Walk and Lava Canal Walk are open, but re-routed near Tunnel Cave.\n2025 bushfires.\nOn Sunday, March 9, 2025, a lightning strike ignited a bushfire in the park. As the fire spread, campers and other visitors were asked to leave. The fire was contained a week later. A few weeks after the fire damaged a significant portion of the park, state government officials decided to euthanise many koalas, believed to be suffering from poor health after the fires, and with a low chance of survival, given that their food source had been decimated. The state hired marksmen to shoot koalas from helicopters; some 700 koalas were eliminated. Once discovered, the aerial culling draw great criticism from wildlife advocates and media attention internationally. Opponents called for an end to the killing, access to the closed area, and an investigation into the government's opaque decision-making process.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The national park is located approximately northeast of Melbourne in the Australian Alps. Within the national park is Mount Buffalo, a moderately high mountain plateau, with an elevation of above sea level.\nOn 4 November 1898 an area of was reserved around the plateau and Eurobin Falls as Mount Buffalo National Park, making it one of the oldest national parks in Australia. In 1908 a road was opened to the plateau and the park was expanded to ; and in 1980 to its current size to take in most of the surrounding foothill country.\nOn 7 November 2008, the park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.\nLocation and features.\nMount Buffalo is a moderately tall mountain plateau on the west side of the Victorian Alpine region. The top of the mountain has striking granite boulders and rock formations. From the north, the mountain is quite remarkable, with the highest accessible point being a prominent peak called The Horn. A walking track leads to The Horn and visitors can enjoy a 360 degree view from the top.\nVisitor accommodation was available at the historic guest house, the Mount Buffalo Chalet, built in 1910, until January 2007. Parks Victoria and the Victorian Government undertook restoration work on the exterior and gardens of the Chalet in 2017 and 2018. The chalet overlooks large sheets of granite and has views of the Ovens Valley and Buckland Valley below.\nTatra Inn, a lodge located at the west end of the plateau near the cathedral, was destroyed in 2006 by an escaped fuel reduction burn. This is a rock climbing, abseiling and hang-gliding site, and there is adventure caving at Mount Buffalo. The camping ground at Lake Catani is open from November to April.\nDuring the winter season, Mount Buffalo is a destination for cross-country skiing. There are a number of cross-country ski trails near the cathedral (Cresta), and toboggan runs at Dingo Dell and Cresta Valley, both of which are used by beginners. Cross-country lessons and many cross-country trails for more experienced skiers are also available. Visitors stay in the nearby towns of Porepunkah and Bright.\nHistory.\nMitambuta and Taungurung people climbed Mount Buffalo in summer to feast on protein-rich bogong moths, and also to meet and hold ceremonies.\nExplorers Hume and Hovell named the mountain in 1824 because of its supposed resemblance to a reclining buffalo. Gold miners and botanists later visited the area. With the beginning of tourism in the 1880s, an area around the Gorge was reserved as a national park in 1898. The park has been enlarged several times since and now takes in all the plateau and surrounding slopes. The Mount Buffalo Chalet was built in 1910, soon after the first road to the plateau was constructed, replacing some earlier more \"rustic\" accommodation. The park became a holiday destination for succeeding generations and a place for early skiing and ice skating ventures. Mount Buffalo had the first ski tow in Australia.\nWhen the Mount Buffalo Chalet was run by the Victorian Railways the restaurant was known as an official \"Railways Refreshment Room\". Staff worked in railway uniforms, blew whistles and imposed curfews for guests. Railway tickets were issued for equipment and activities such as \"Motor to Wangaratta\" and \"Skis, steel edged with cane stocks and boots 2nd Grade 8/6-\".\nIn late 2006, during the early stages of the huge 2006\u201307 Victorian Alps Fire Complex, bushfires raged through parts of the national park. The fires destroyed the Cresta Lodge, however the historic Chalet was saved despite being thought to be under threat.\nFauna.\nDue to the range in altitude in the park, there are a variety of fauna habitats. The foothill forests contain kangaroos, wallabies, and several species of possums and sugar gliders. Smaller mammals such as native rats and mice inhabit the plateau. Wombats occur in all habitats. The alpine silver xenica is a species of butterfly found only on the plateau of Mount buffalo. Bogong moths shelter in rock crevices at the horn and it is common to see birds darting in and out of the cracks to feed on them during the day and bats doing the same at night. Peregrine falcons sometimes nest in the granite rock faces. Crimson rosellas are abundant throughout the park.\nClimate.\nClimate data are sourced from Mount Buffalo Chalet, situated at an altitude of . An extreme winter rainfall peak is noted, with a large quantity falling as heavy snow.\nVegetation.\nOver 550 native species occur; the most significant vegetation communities are the alpine and sub-alpine communities. The lower slopes have communities of mixed gum and peppermint, including the bogong gum (\"Eucalyptus chapmaniana\"). These grade into pure stands of alpine ash (\"Eucalyptus delegatensis\") around elevation, and subalpine woodland of snow gum, (\"Eucalyptus pauciflora\") above . The majority of the plateau is at an elevation of , where inverted treelines in valley bottoms give rise to grasslands, with bog and fen communities of \"Sphagnum\" and \"Empodisma\" in watercourses.\nThe endemic eucalypt \"Eucalyptus mitchelliana\", the Buffalo sallee, is found on higher granite outcrops. Other endemic plants are \"Grevillea alpivaga\" (Buffalo grevillea), \"Acacia phlebophylla\" (Buffalo sallow wattle), and \"Babingtonia crenulata\" (fern-leaf baeckea). The rare \"Pratia gelida\", snow pratia, occurs in a small area on Hospice Plain.\nGrazing was excluded from the park in 1957, one of the earliest exclusions of this activity in any alpine park. Weed species, particularly Himalayan honeysuckle, yarrow and blackberries, pose a continuing management challenge.\nFungi.\nMount Buffalo National Park is also home to an enormous diversity of fungi. Fungi are ecologically important and megadiverse, yet their significance in underpinning the terrestrial ecology of the park is little recognised. The park also contains a great variety of lichens (which are classified as fungi), many of which are important pioneer species, and some of which are restricted to alpine habitats.\nAlthough the https:// makes no reference to fungi, the park has a great variety of fungi that perform beneficial ecological roles. As primary recyclers of organic matter, saprobic fungi break down fallen branches and leaf litter, making vital nutrients available to other organisms. Other fungi form symbiotic relationships with other organisms. Although rarely acknowledged, the great majority of plants in Mount Buffalo National Park (indeed in the world) form mutually beneficial mycorrhizal relationships with fungi.\nGiven the great diversity of plants, specialist habitats and micro-climates in the park, a great diversity of fungi, including lichens, is also expected to occur there. Several hundred fungal species have already been recorded by field naturalists and interested individuals and a list can be found in the http://. \"Leotia lubrica\" commonly known as the http:// grows in leaf litter, moss and soils in the wetter parts of the park. The yellow gelatinous fruitbodies typically grows in clumps. The rhubarb bolete, \"Boletellus obscurecoccineus\" is a distinctive species that grows in soils in association with \"Eucalyptus\" species. The Australian citizen-science organisation, http:// is documenting and mapping the distribution of fungi including those that occur in national parks.\nDespite their essential roles in supporting ecosystems, fungi are barely recognised as a vital part of Australia's biodiversity. Although Australia has national and state level biodiversity conservation strategies there is currently no statewide biodiversity strategy for managing biodiversity in Victoria and the http:// n contains no reference to the protection of fungi.\nRoad cycling.\nMount Buffalo is a popular destination for road cyclists due to the challenging yet scenic climb to the top of the mountain. From the now defunct tollbooth at the base of the mountain to the Mount Buffalo Chalet it's a 20.9\u00a0km climb at an average gradient of 4.8%. The climb can be extended by following the road around to the right at the Chalet turn-off and continuing to Dingo Dell or The Horn.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Jardwadjali name for the mountain range itself is Gariwerd.\nThe national park is situated between Stawell and Horsham on the Western Highway and Dunkeld on the Glenelg Highway, west of Melbourne and east of Adelaide. Proclaimed as a national park on 1 July 1984, the park was listed on the National Heritage List on 15 December 2006 for its outstanding natural beauty and being one of the richest Aboriginal rock art sites in south-eastern Australia.\nThe Grampians feature a striking series of mountain ranges of sandstone. The Gariwerd area features about 90% of the rock art in the state.\nEtymology.\nAt the time of European colonisation, the Grampians had a number of indigenous names, one of which was \"Gariwerd\" in the western Kulin language of the Mukjarawaint, Jardwadjali, and Djab Wurrung people, who lived in the area and who shared 90 per cent of their vocabulary.\nAccording to historian Benjamin Wilkie, the name \"Gariwerd\" was first written down in 1841, taken from a Jardwadjali speaker by the Chief Protector of Aborigines, George Augustus Robinson, as \"Currewurt\". From speakers of the Djab Wurrung language or Djargurd Wurrung language, to the east, he recorded \"Erewurrr, country of the Grampians\" \u2013 likely a mishearing of \"Gariwerd\". Recorded variations on \"Gariwerd\" include \"Cowa\", \"Gowah\", and \"Gar\" \u2013 generic words for a pointed mountain. Dhauwurd Wurrung language speakers from the south-west coast of Victoria called the mountains \"Murraibuggum\", while Wathawurrung (Wathaurong) speakers used the name \"Tolotmutgo\".\nIn 1836, the explorer and Surveyor General of New South Wales Sir Thomas Mitchell named \"Gariwerd\" after the Grampian Mountains in his native Scotland. According to Wilkie, Mitchell first referred to \"Gariwerd\" as the \"Coast Mountains\" and, in July 1836, called them the \"Gulielmian Mountains\" after William IV of the United Kingdom (\"Gulielmi IV Regis)\". Members of his expedition referred to the mountains as the \"Gulielmean\", \"Gulielman\", and the \"Blue Gulielmean Mountains\". Later in 1836, Mitchell settled on \"Grampians\", and the \"Grampians National Park\" took that name in 1984.\nAfter a two-year consultation process, the park was renamed Grampians (Gariwerd) National Park in 1991, but that proved controversial and was reversed after the election of the Kennett government in 1992. The 1998 \"Geographic Place Names Act\" reinstated the dual naming of geographical features, and that has been subsequently adopted in the park, based on Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung names for rock art sites and landscape features, with the Australian National Heritage List referring to \"Grampians National Park (Gariwerd)\".\nPhysiography.\nThis area is a distinct physiographic section of the larger Western Victorian Highlands province, which, in turn, is part of the larger East Australian Cordillera physiographic division \u2014 commonly known as the Great Dividing Range \u2014 a series of mountain ranges, plateaus and rolling hills forming out of the Wimmera plains just to the west of the Grampians, staying close to the east Australian coastline and extending 4,000\u00a0km (2,500 miles) to the north to Dauan Island in the Torres Strait off the northern tip of the Cape York Peninsula.\nGeography.\nThe general form that the ranges take is: from the west, a series of low-angled sandstone ridges running roughly north\u2013south. The eastern sides of the ridges, where the sedimentary layers have faulted, are steep and beyond the vertical in place - notably at Hollow Mountain near Dadswells Bridge at the northern end of the ranges.\nGeology.\nThe rock material that composes the high peaks is sandstone which was laid down from rivers during the Devonian period 425 - 415 million years ago. This sediment slowly accumulated to a depth of ; this was later raised and tilted for its present form. \nA number of stratigraphic layers have been identified, such as the Silverband Formation, the Mount Difficult Subgroup and the Red Man Bluff Subgroup. The coarse grain and fine lamination of the Silverstone Formation, along with undulations at the surface, is thought to have been an estuarine backwater before becoming preserved around 400 million years ago.\nThe Southern Ocean reached the base of the northern and western edges of the mountain range about 40 million years ago, the deposition from the range forming the sea floor which is now Little Desert National Park.\nThe highest peak is Mount William at . Numerous waterfalls, such as Mackenzie Falls, are found in the park and are easily accessible via a well-developed road network.\nClimate.\nDue to being an exposed peak in the west of Victoria, Mount William features especially cool maximum temperatures throughout the year. Winter cloud cover is profound; with an extraordinary 26 days of precipitation in July, constituting an annual total of 215 days\u2014quite possibly the highest figure of any site in mainland Australia.\nSnowfalls are both frequent and heavy throughout the year. Daily maximum temperatures can struggle above the single digits even in summer, and on such days the afternoon and mid-day readings can be near to in extreme cases such as in December 2022. The peak can be classed as a cold and moist Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Csb\") on account of the low summer rainfall \u2212 in February averaging only of rain.\nCultural heritage.\nEvidence of vertebrate life.\nThe Silverband Formation (see Geology above) was the source of sandstone paving slabs used for the construction of a nearby Cobb &amp; Co station in 1873. The surface of one paver contained 23 impressions, the tracks of a four-legged animal around in length, which have been described as the oldest trace of a vertebrate walking on land.\nAboriginal Australian heritage.\nTo the Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung peoples, \"Gariwerd\" was central to the dreaming of the creator, Bunjil, and \"buledji Brambimbula\", the two brothers Bram, who were responsible for the creation and naming of many landscape features in western Victoria.\nGrampians National Park (Gariwerd) is one of the richest Indigenous rock art sites in south-eastern Australia and was listed on the National Heritage List for its natural beauty as well as its past and continuing Aboriginal cultural associations. Motifs painted in numerous caves include depictions of humans, human hands, animal tracks and birds. Notable rock art sites include:\nThe rock art was created by Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung peoples, and while Aboriginal communities continue to pass on knowledge and cultural traditions, much Indigenous knowledge has also been lost since European settlement of the area from 1840. The significance of the right hand prints at Gulgurn Manja is now unknown.\nOne of the most significant Aboriginal cultural sites in south-eastern Australia is Bunjil's Shelter, not within the park area, but in Black Range Scenic Reserve near Stawell. It is the only known rock art depiction of Bunjil, the creator-being in Aboriginal Australian mythology.\nDual naming of features has been adopted in the park based on Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung names for rock art sites and landscape features, including:\nRecreation.\n\"Gariwerd\" and the Grampians National Park has been a popular destination for recreation and tourism since the middle of the nineteenth century. According to Wilkie, the extension of railways to nearby Stawell, Ararat and Dunkeld were an important factor in the mountains' increasing popularity in the early twentieth century; growing car ownership and the construction of tourist roads in the ranges during the 1920s were also significant.\nGliding.\nMount William is known within the gliding community for the \"Grampians Wave\", a weather phenomenon that sometimes enables glider pilots to reach extreme altitudes of the order of . This predominantly occurs during the months of May, June, September and October when strong westerly winds flow at right angles to the ridge, and produce a large-scale standing wave.\nRock climbing.\nThe Grampians is a famous rock climbing destination, with the first routes being established in the 1960s. Notable routes include \"The Wheel of Life\" (V15 / 35) and \"Groove Train\" (33) which attract world class climbers. Australian adventurer Jon Muir regards the Grampians, along with the Arapiles, as near perfect in their combination of access, climate and type of rock.\nIn March 2019, 30% of climbing areas were closed by Parks Victoria due to cultural and ecological concerns, namely bolting, chalk marks, and making access paths through vegetation. It closed 70% of bouldering routes, and 50% of sport climbing.\nParks Victoria were accused by climbers of exaggerating damage and acting heavy handedly by pitting them against traditional owners, of whom they are \"natural allies\". Jon Muir and renowned Australian mountaineer Tim Macartney-Snape have criticised Parks Victoria\u2019s handling of the situation, with Muir saying, \u201cThe climbers haven\u2019t really been taken into the equation\u201d, and Macartney-Snape saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really the way it has been managed. It\u2019s a blight on Australian administration of natural land.\u201d\nBushwalking.\nIn 2015 Parks Victoria started building the 164\u00a0km Grampians Peaks Trail. The trail, which takes inspiration from popular Tasmanian trails, is designed to take 13 days to walk and crosses the length of the park. It was officially opened on 12 November 2021.\nThe most popular walking area for day trippers is the Wonderland area near Halls Gap. In summer the ranges can get very hot and dry. Winter and spring are the best times for walking. The Wonderland area is also host to \"The Grand Canyon\" on the \"Wonderland Loop\" on one of the tracks to the \"Pinnacle\".\nIn spring, the Grampians wildflowers are an attraction. Colloquially known as the \u2018garden of Victoria\u2019, the Grampians is home to 975 native plant species (including more than 75 orchid species), representing one third of the total Victorian flora, and many of these species are only found in the Grampians, including the Grampians pincushion lily (Borya mirabilis), one of the rarest native lilies in Australia.\nTourist centres.\nHalls Gap / \"Budja Budja\" is the largest service town in the area and is located at a point roughly equidistant between the towns of Ararat and Stawell. The town is located towards the eastern side of the park and offers accommodation to the many tourists who visit the area.\nThe \"Brambuk National Park and Cultural Centre\" in Halls Gap is owned and managed by Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung people from five Aboriginal communities with historic links to the Gariwerd-Grampians ranges and the surrounding plains.\nFood and Wine Festival.\nGrampians National Park is home to one of Australia's longest running food and wine festivals, Grampians Grape Escape, held over the first weekend of May in Halls Gap every year. Launched in 1992, the Grampians Grape Escape is a hallmark event for Victoria and provides food and wine offerings by more than 100 local artisan producers, live music and family entertainment.\nNatural disasters.\nLightning caused a major bushfire that burned out about 127,000 ha (47%) of the Grampians National Park in January 2006. Soon afterwards the first signs of regeneration were already visible with, for example, regrowth of the eucalyptus trees. Many trees exhibit epicormic growth, where a mass of young shoots re-sprout along the whole length of the trunk to the base of the tree. Major flooding followed 5 years later in January 2011, forcing the closure of some parts of the Grampians National Park for several months.\nFurthermore since 2006, the Grampians National Park has experienced another two large-scale fires, both caused by lightning. These fires have impacted roughly 85% of the Grampians National Park.\nIn the 2024-2025 summer, 2 bushfires burnt an estimated 136,329 hectares of the park and surrounding private land.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named Plantin as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in \"The Times\" on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or roman style (sometimes also called Antiqua), the first part of the Times New Roman typeface family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to Rome or to the Romans.\n\"The Times\" stayed with the original Times New Roman for 40 years. The paper subsequently has switched typefaces five times between 1972 and 2007 to different variants of the original due to new production techniques and a format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004.\nDesign.\nTimes New Roman has a robust colour on the page and influences of European early modern and Baroque printing. As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high x-height, short descenders to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance. (Although Hutt, and most other authors, describe Times New Roman as having a higher x-height than Plantin, Tracy reports based on published Monotype dimensions that in the original small metal-type sizes the difference was not great.)\nThe roman style of Plantin was loosely based on a metal type created in the late sixteenth century by the French artisan Robert Granjon and preserved in the collection of the Plantin-Moretus Museum of Antwerp. This style is sometimes categorised as part of the \"old-style\" of serif fonts (from before the eighteenth century). (The 'a' of Plantin was not based on Granjon's work: the Plantin-Moretus Museum's type had a substitute 'a' cut later.) Indeed, the working title of Times New Roman was \"Times Old Style\". However, Times New Roman modifies the Granjon influence further than Plantin due to features such as its 'a' and 'e', with very large counters and apertures, its ball terminal detailing, a straight-sided 'M' and an increased level of contrast between thick and thin strokes, so it has often been compared to fonts from the late eighteenth century, the so-called 'transitional' genre, in particular the Baskerville typeface of the 1750s. Historian and sometime Monotype executive Allan Haley commented that compared to Plantin \"serifs had been sharpened...contrast was increased and character curves were refined,\" while Lawson described Times's higher-contrast crispness as having \"a sparkle [Plantin] never achieved\".\nItalic and bold.\nMorison described the companion italic as also being influenced by the typefaces created by the Didot family in the late 18th and early 19th centuries: a \"rationalistic italic that owed nothing to the tradition of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. It has, indeed, more in common with the eighteenth century.\" Morison had several years earlier attracted attention for promoting the radical idea that italics in book printing were too disruptive to the flow of text, and should be phased out. He rapidly came to concede that the idea was impractical, and later wryly commented to historian Harry Carter that 'Times italic' \"owes more to Didot than dogma.\" Morison wrote in a personal letter of Times New Roman's mixed heritage that it \"has the merit of not looking as if it had been designed by somebody in particular.\"\nRather than creating a companion boldface with letterforms similar to the roman style, Times New Roman's bold has a different character, with a more condensed and more upright effect caused by making the horizontal parts of curves consistently the thinnest lines of each letter, and making the top serifs of letters like 'd' purely horizontal. This effect is not found in sixteenth-century typefaces (which, in any case, did not have bold versions); it is most associated with the Didone, or \"modern\" type of the early nineteenth century (and with the more recent 'Ionic' styles of type influenced by it that were offered by Linotype, discussed below).&lt;ref name=\"Three chapters in the development of Clarendon/Ionic typefaces\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have found 'Times bold' unsatisfactory and too condensed, such as Walter Tracy.\nHistorical background.\nDuring the nineteenth century, the standard roman types for general-purpose printing were \"Modern\" or Didone designs, and these were standard in all newspaper printing. Designs in the nineteenth-century style remain a common part of the aesthetic of newspaper printing; for example in 2017 digital typeface designer Tobias Frere-Jones wrote that he kept his Exchange family, designed for the \"Wall Street Journal\", based on the nineteenth-century model as it \"had to feel like the news.\" According to Mosley and Williamson the modern-face used by \"The Times\" was Monotype's Series 7 or \"Modern Extended\", based on typefaces by Miller and Richard.\nBy the 1920s, some in the publishing industry felt that the modern-face model was too spindly and high-contrast for optimal legibility at the small sizes and punishing printing techniques of newspaper printing. In 1925, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company, Monotype's main competitor, launched a new newspaper typeface called Ionic, which became the first in a series known as the Legibility Group. These kept to the nineteenth-century model but greatly reduced the contrast of the letterform. The thinnest strokes of the letter were made thicker and strokes were kept as far apart as possible to maximise legibility. It proved extremely successful: Allen Hutt, Monotype's newspaper printing consultant in the late 1930s, later noted that it \"revolutionised newspaper text setting...within eighteen months it was adopted by 3,000 papers.\" Although Times New Roman does not in any way resemble it, Walter Tracy, a prominent type designer who worked on a redesign of Times in the 1970s and wrote an analysis of its design in his book \"Letters of Credit\" (1986), commented that its arrival must at least have influenced the decision to consider a redesign.\nThe development of Times New Roman was relatively involved due to the lack of a specific pre-existing model \u2013 or perhaps a surfeit of possible choices. Morison wrote in a memo that he hoped for a design that would have relatively sharp serifs, matching the general design of the Times' previous font, but on a darker and more traditional basic structure. Bulked-up versions of Monotype's pre-existing but rather dainty Baskerville and Perpetua typefaces were considered for a basis, and the Legibility Group designs were also examined. (Perpetua, which Monotype had recently commissioned from sculptor Eric Gill at Morison's urging, is considered a 'transitional' design in aesthetic, although it does not revive any specific model.) Walter Tracy, who knew Lardent, suggested in the 1980s that \"Morison did not begin with a clear vision of the ultimate type, but felt his way along.\"\nMorison's biographer Nicolas Barker has written that Morison's memos of the time wavered over a variety of options before it was ultimately concluded that Plantin formed the best basis for a condensed font that could nonetheless be made to fill out the full size of the letter space as far as possible. (Morison ultimately conceded that Perpetua, which had been his pet project, was 'too basically circular' to be practical to condense in an attractive way.)\nWalter Tracy and James Moran, who discussed the design's creation with Lardent in the 1960s, found that Lardent himself had little memory of exactly what material Morison gave him as a specimen to use to design the typeface, but he told Moran that he remembered working on the design from archive photographs of vintage type; he thought this was a book printed by Christophe Plantin, the sixteenth-century printer whose printing office the Plantin-Moretus Museum preserves and is named for. Moran and Tracy suggested that this actually might have been the same specimen of type from the Plantin-Moretus Museum that Plantin had been based on, and Barker notes that this is likely to be correct, as although Plantin is based on a Granjon type in the collection of the museum, that specific type was only acquired by Plantin's heirs after his death, and Times and Plantin both copy an 'a' not added to the type after Plantin's death. The sharpened serifs somewhat recall Perpetua, although Morison's stated reason for them was to provide continuity with the previous Didone design and the crispness associated with the \"Times\"' printing; he also cited as a reason that sharper serifs looked better after stereotyping or printed papers on a rotary press. Although Morison may not have literally drawn the design, his influence on its concept was sufficient that he felt he could call it \"my one effort at designing a font\" in a letter to Daniel Berkeley Updike, a prominent American printing historian with whom he corresponded frequently. Morison's several accounts of his reasoning in designing the concept of Times New Roman were somewhat contradictory and historians of printing have suggested that in practice they were mostly composed to rationalise his pre-existing aesthetic preferences: after Morison's death Allen Hutt went so far as to describe his unsigned 1936 article on the topic as \"rather odd...it can only be regarded as a piece of Morisonian mystification\".\nLardent's original drawings are according to Rhatigan lost, but photographs exist of his drawings. Rhatigan comments that Lardent's originals show \"the spirit of the final type, but not the details.\" The design was adapted from Lardent's large drawings by the Monotype drawing office team in Salfords, Surrey, which worked out spacing and simplified some fine details. Further changes were made after manufacturing began (the latter a difficult practice, since new punches and matrices had to be machined after each design change).\nMorison continued to develop a close connection with the \"Times\" that would last throughout his life. Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to pressures of austerity, took a post as editor of the \"Times Literary Supplement\" which he held from 1945 to 1948. Times New Roman remained Morison's only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the Bauer Type Foundry of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war. Morison told his friend Ellic Howe that the test type sent to him just before the war was sent to the government to be \"analysed in order that we should know whether the Hun is hard up for lead or antimony or tin.\" Brooke Crutchley, Printer to Cambridge University, recorded in his diary a more informal discussion of the design's origins from a conversation in August 1948:SM thought that Dreyfus might in time be able to design a mathematical font but he would first have to get out of his system a lot of personal ideas and searching for effects. He, Morison, had to do all this before he could design the Times font. Will Carter came in to consult M about a new type for the \"Radio Times\", on which he had been invited to experiment. M said that the answer was really Times and that if he worked out the problem from the bottom that was the sort of answer he would get...Will has been experimenting with Plantin, but it doesn't come out well when printed from plates on rotaries, perhaps a face based on Plantin would do the trick. M said that was just how he got to Times.\nMetal type versions.\nA large number of variants of Times were cut during the metal type period, in particular headline weights and families of titling capitals for headlines. Walter Tracy in \"Letters of Credit\", Allen Hutt and others have discussed these extensively in their works on the family. (Morison felt in 1953 that the most important part of \"The Times\"'s redesign that introduced Times New Roman was not the body text at all, but introducing headline fonts that matched the text type.)\nTitling.\nMonotype created some caps-only titling designs to match Times New Roman itself. These are not sold by Monotype in digital format, although Linotype's Times Eighteen in the same style (see below) is.\nTimes Hever Titling.\nAn elegant titling caps design, quite different from Times New Roman with a Caslon-style A (with a serif at top left of the letter, suggesting a stroke written with a quill) and old-style C and W; Tracy suggests Monotype's previous Poliphilus design as an influence. Named after Hever Castle, the home of the \"Times\"' owner Lord Astor and designed early on, it was used by the \"Times\" for headings in the lighter sections such as society pages, arts and fashion. It has not been digitised.\nTimes Wide (1938, series 427).\nA variant intended for book printing, avoiding the slight condensation of the original Times New Roman. Although it was popular in the metal type period for book printing, it was apparently never digitised. Monotype also created a version, series 627, with long descenders more appropriate to classic book typography. Optional text figures were also available.\nSeries 727 and 827.\nMonotype also produced Series 727, in which the heavier strokes of upper-case letters were made slightly thinner. This was done to produce a lighter effect in which capital letters do not stand out so much, and was particularly intended for German use, since in the German language capitals are far more common since they appear at the start of each noun. Series 827 modified some letters (notably the \"R\") to correspond to their appearance in other typefaces popular in French printing. This production of what are now called stylistic alternates to suit national tastes was common at the time, and many alternates were also offered for Gill Sans for use in Europe.\nClaritas (1951).\nA modified 4&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 point size of Times Roman was produced by Monotype for use in printing matter requiring a very small size of type. Listed as Times Newspaper Smalls, available as either Series 333 or 335, it was also referred to by the name Claritas.\nTimes 4-line Mathematics Series 569.\nThis is a variant designed for printing mathematical formulae, using the 4\u2011line system for mathematics developed by Monotype in 1957. This modified version of Times Roman was designed for use as part of Monotype's 4-line Mathematics system. The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic 'v' and 'w' so that italic 'v' could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point bodies. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a kern which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, Monotype's Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose. Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).\nOthers.\n\"The Times\" also used a sans-serif wood type for printing newbills which had no connection to Times New Roman. It was similar to Kabel Bold Condensed.\nBesides Monotype versions, Times New Roman was also available in metal type from Linotype, discussed below, and Intertype.\nUsage.\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing. Monotype promoted the typeface in their trade magazine, \"The Monotype Recorder\", and took advantage of this popularity by cutting a widened version, Series 427, for book publishing, although many books ultimately used the original version. The first known book published in Times New Roman (the original 327 Monotype series) was \"Minnow Among Tritons\", published by the Nonesuch Press and printed by R&amp;R Clark in 1934. (Because the cover of the \"Monotype Recorder\" compared the new \"Times New Roman\" with a sample of the previous type labelled as \"Times Old Roman\", some writers have assumed that the Times' previous typeface was actually called this, which it was not.)\nAn early user of Times New Roman outside its origin was by Daniel Berkeley Updike, an influential historian of printing with whom Morison carried an extensive correspondence. Impressed by the design, he used it to set his book \"Some Aspects of Printing, Old and New\". It then was chosen by the Crowell-Collier magazines \"Woman's Home Companion\" and then its sister publications such as \"Collier's\". A brochure was published to mark the change along with a letter from Morison hoping that the redesign would be a success. Ultimately it became Monotype's best-selling metal type of all time.\nWalter Tracy, who worked on a redesign, however noted that the design's compression and fine detail extending to the edge of the matrices was not ideal in the aggressive conditions of most newspaper printing, in which the \"Times\" was unusual for its particularly high standard of printing suiting its luxury market. Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\" He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\". Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but \"The Times\", whose house style in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.\nA number of early reviews of Times New Roman were published in Morison's lifetime that discussed aspects of its design. Most were appreciative (Morison was an influential figure in publishing) but several noted that it did not follow conventional expectations of newspaper typeface design. One article that discussed its design was \"Optical Scale in Typefounding\", written by Harry Carter and published in 1937, which discussed the differences between small and large-size typeface designs. He commented \"The small sizes of Plantin embody what are supposed to be the requirements of a good small type [but] Times Roman, which most people find the easiest to read of small text-types, runs counter to some of them...[Morison] avoided blunt serifs and thickened hairlines because he found they wore down more noticeably than sharper-cut features.\"\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing. For example, the American Psychological Association suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its APA style.\nThe U.S. Department of State used Times New Roman as the standard font in its official documents from 2004 to 2023, before switching to Calibri.\nThe Australian Government logo used Times New Roman Bold as a wordmark for departments and agencies are required to use common branding on their websites and print publications.\nLinotype design (Times Roman).\nMonotype originally created Times New Roman for its typesetting machines, but its rival, Linotype, rapidly began to offer its version of the typeface with subtle differences. A key reason is that many newspapers, including \"The Times\", also used Linotype equipment for production. Linotype referred to its design as \"Times\" or \"Times Roman\". Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but the lineage of Times has been split into two subtly different designs since its earliest days.\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to photo and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted serifs on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5. Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details, as well as the width metrics for their version of Times, grew apart. Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight), and in the percent sign in all weights (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not). Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline. Linotype's metal version of Times had a shrunken 'f' due to a technical limitation of the Linotype system\u2014it could not cast a kerning 'f', one that extended into the space of surrounding letters. This restriction was removed in the digital version.\nLinotype licensed its version to IBM, Xerox, and subsequently to Adobe and Apple, guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the PostScript page description language. This digital iteration of Times Roman was derived from the 12pt metal type, similar to the phototype version. Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name. For compatibility, Monotype had to subtly redraw its design to match the widths from the Adobe/Linotype version. Versions of Times New Roman from Monotype (discussed below) exist that vary from the PostScript metrics. Linotype applied for registration of the trademark name \"Times Roman\" and received registration status in 1945.\nModern releases.\nMonotype variants.\nMonotype has released at least eight digital typefaces under the name Times New Roman.\nTimes New Roman.\nSince Windows 3.1, all versions of Microsoft Windows include Times New Roman. Version 6.87 of this typeface is available for purchase under the name Times New Roman OS (see below). The current 7.03 version of Windows' Times New Roman includes small capitals, text figures, and italic swash capitals. It omits automatic ligature insertion, but enabling the \"discretionary ligatures\" feature will provide ligatures for \"fi\" and \"Th\". More complex Unicode ligatures like \"ffi\" and \"ft\" are also available. A previous version of Times New Roman was also distributed as part of Microsoft's Core Fonts for the Web package.\nWhen the system font Times New Roman was expanded to support Arabic script, it was complemented with the Arabic character set from Simplified Arabic, a typeface that Compugraphic Corporation had plagiarized from Linotype and leased to Microsoft. Times New Roman with support for Arabic was first published in the Arabic version of Windows 3.1x.\nTimes New Roman OS.\nAlso known as Times New Roman World, this is originally based on the version of Times New Roman bundled with Windows Vista. It includes fonts in WGL character sets, Hebrew and Arabic characters. Similar to Helvetica World, Arabic in italic fonts are in roman positions.\nOthers.\nMonotype further sells a wider range of styles and optical sizes in order to meet the needs of newspapers and books which print at a range of text sizes.\nLinotype variants.\nTimes.\nThis is the digitalisation of Linotype's Times (see above). It is pre-installed on macOS but not on iOS, and is also widely available for purchase. Times provides standard ligature for \"fi\", but it does not provide any ligature for \"Th\".\nOthers.\nLike Monotype, Linotype released additional versions of Times for different text sizes. These include:\nLater typefaces used by \"The Times\".\n\"The Times\" newspaper has commissioned various successors to Times New Roman:\nWilliam Starling Burgess.\nIn 1994 the printing historian Mike Parker published claims that the design of Times New Roman's roman or regular style was based on a 1904 design of William Starling Burgess. This theory remains controversial. Parker and his friend Gerald Giampa, a Canadian printer who had bought up the defunct American branch of Lanston Monotype, claimed that, in 1904, Burgess created a type design for company documents at his shipyard in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and hired Lanston Monotype to issue it. However, Burgess abandoned the idea and Monotype shelved the sketches, ultimately reusing them as a basis for Times New Roman. Giampa claimed that he stumbled upon original material in 1987, after he had purchased Lanston Monotype, and that some of the papers that had been his evidence had been lost in a flood at his house, while Parker claimed that an additional source was material in a section of the Smithsonian now closed due to asbestos contamination. Giampa asked Parker to complete the type from the limited number of surviving letters, which was issued in June 2009 by Font Bureau under the name of 'Starling'.\nReception to the claims was sceptical, with dismissal from Morison's biographer Nicolas Barker and Luc Devroye among others; Barker suggested that the material had been fabricated in order to aid Giampa in embarrassing Monotype's British branch, while Devroye and Thomas Phinney of FontLab suggested that the claim had begun as a prank. In 2010, Mark Owens described Parker's article in retrospect as \"the scantest of evidence\" and a \"fog of irrelevant details\" and Simon Loxley that it \"doesn't really have a leg to stand on\". Monotype executive Dan Rhatigan described the theory as implausible in 2011: \"I'll admit that I tend to side with the more fully documented (both in general, and in agreement with what little I can find within Monotype to support it) notion that Times New Roman was based on Plantin...I won't rule out the possibility that Starling Burgess drew up the concept first, but Occam's razor makes me doubt it.\"\nThe Times Online web site credits the design to \"Stanley Morrison, Victor Lardent and perhaps Starling Burgess\".\nDesigns inspired by Times New Roman.\nIn the phototypesetting and digital typesetting periods many font designs have been published inspired by Times New Roman. Although the digital data of Monotype and Linotype releases of Times New Roman are copyrighted, and the name \"Times\" is trademarked, the design itself is in many countries not copyrightable. Notably, the United States allows alternative interpretations if they do not reuse digital data.\nFree alternatives.\nThere are some free software fonts used as alternatives, including metric-compatible designs used for font substitution.\nNon-Latin fonts using Times New Roman's Latin-alphabet glyphs.\nSome fonts intended for typesetting multiple writing systems use Times New Roman as a model for Latin-alphabet glyphs:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited literature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Element symbols for chemical elements, also known as atomic symbols, normally consist of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet and are written with the first letter capitalised.\nHistory.\nEarlier symbols for chemical elements stem from classical Latin and Greek words. For some elements, this is because the material was known in ancient times, while for others, the name is a more recent invention. For example, Pb is the symbol for lead (\"plumbum\" in Latin); Hg is the symbol for mercury (\"hydrargyrum\" in Greek); and He is the symbol for helium (a Neo-Latin name) because helium was not known in ancient Roman times. Some symbols come from other sources, like W for tungsten (\"Wolfram\" in German) which was not known in Roman times.\nA three-letter temporary symbol may be assigned to a newly synthesized (or not yet synthesized) element. For example, \"Uno\" was the temporary symbol for hassium (element 108) which had the temporary name of \"unniloctium\", based on the digits of its atomic number. There are also some historical symbols that are no longer officially used.\nExtension of the symbol.\nIn addition to the letters for the element itself, additional details may be added to the symbol as superscripts or subscripts a particular isotope, ionization, or oxidation state, or other atomic detail. A few isotopes have their own specific symbols rather than just an isotopic detail added to their element symbol.\nAttached subscripts or superscripts specifying a nuclide or molecule have the following meanings and positions:\nMany functional groups also have their own chemical symbol, e.g. Ph for the phenyl group, and Me for the methyl group.\nA list of current, dated, as well as proposed and historical signs and symbols is included here with its signification. Also given is each element's atomic number, atomic weight, or the atomic mass of the most stable isotope, group and period numbers on the periodic table, and etymology of the symbol.\nSymbols for chemical elements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSymbols and names not currently used.\nThe following is a list of symbols and names formerly used or suggested for elements, including symbols for placeholder names and names given by discredited claimants for discovery.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSystematic chemical symbols.\nThese symbols are based on systematic element names, which are now replaced by trivial (non-systematic) element names and symbols. Data is given in order of: atomic number, systematic symbol, systematic name; trivial symbol, trivial name.\nWhen elements beyond oganesson (starting with ununennium, Uue, element 119), are discovered; their systematic name and symbol will presumably be superseded by a trivial name and symbol.\nAlchemical symbols.\nThe following ideographic symbols were used in alchemy to denote elements known since ancient times. Not included in this list are spurious elements, such as the classical elements fire and water or phlogiston, and substances now known to be compounds. Many more symbols were in at least sporadic use: one early 17th-century alchemical manuscript lists 22 symbols for mercury alone.\nPlanetary names and symbols for the metals \u2013 the seven planets and seven metals known since Classical times in Europe and the Mideast \u2013 was ubiquitous in alchemy. The association of what are anachronistically known as planetary metals started breaking down with the discovery of antimony, bismuth and zinc in the 16th century. Alchemists would typically call the metals by their planetary names, e.g. \"Saturn\" for lead and \"Mars\" for iron; compounds of tin, iron and silver continued to be called \"jovial\", \"martial\" and \"lunar\"; or \"of Jupiter\", \"of Mars\" and \"of the moon\", through the 17th century. The tradition remains today with the name of the element mercury, where chemists decided the planetary name was preferable to common names like \"quicksilver\", and in a few archaic terms such as lunar caustic (silver nitrate) and saturnism (lead poisoning).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDaltonian symbols.\nThe following symbols were employed by John Dalton in the early 1800s as the periodic table of elements was being formulated. Not included in this list are symbols for compounds, such as certain rare-earth mineral blends. Modern alphabetic notation was introduced in 1814 by J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius; its precursor can be seen in Dalton's circled letters for the metals, especially in his augmented table from 1810.\nA trace of Dalton's conventions also survives in ball-and-stick models of molecules, where balls for carbon are black and for oxygen red.\nSymbols for named isotopes.\nThe following is a list of isotopes which have been given unique symbols. This is not a list of current systematic symbols (in the \"u\"Atom form); such a list can instead be found in . The symbols for isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium (D) and tritium (T), are still in use today, as is thoron (Tn) for radon-220 (though not actinon; usually instead referring to a generic actinide). Heavy water and other deuterated solvents are commonly used in chemistry, and it is convenient to use a single character rather than a symbol with a subscript in these cases. The practice also continues with tritium compounds. When the name of the solvent is given, a lowercase d is sometimes used. For example, d6-benzene or C6D6 can be used instead of C6[2H6].\nThe symbols for isotopes of elements other than hydrogen and radon are no longer used in the scientific community. Many of these symbols were designated during the early years of radiochemistry, and several isotopes (namely those in the decay chains of actinium, radium, and thorium) bear placeholder names using the early naming system devised by Ernest Rutherford.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther symbols.\nGeneral:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrom organic chemistry:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrom organometallic chemistry:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExotic atoms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHazard pictographs are another type of symbols used in chemistry.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In editorial production the \"pilcrow\" typographic character is also known as the paragraph mark, the paragraph sign, the paragraph symbol, the paraph, and the blind P.\nIn writing and editorial practice, authors and editors use the pilcrow grapheme to indicate the start of separate paragraphs, and to identify a new paragraph within a long block of text without paragraph indentions, as in the book \"An Essay on Typography\" (1931), by Eric Gill. In the Middle Ages, the practice of rubrication (type in red-ink) used a red pilcrow to indicate the beginning of a different train of thought within the author's narrative without paragraphs.\nThe letterform of the pilcrow resembles a minuscule q or a mirrored majuscule P, with a usually-doubled backbone reaching from the descender to the ascender height.\nThe bowl on the left side can be filled or empty, and occasionally extends far enough downward that the character resembles a mirrored D. The backbone is usually straight, but in some fonts curves toward the bowl.\nOrigin and name.\nThe English word \"pilcrow\" derives from the &amp;lsqb;&amp;rsqb;, \"written in the side\" or \"written in the margin\". In Old French, \"par\u00e1graphos\" became the word and later . The earliest English language reference to the modern pilcrow is in 1440, with the Middle English word .\nUse in Ancient Greek.\nThe first way to divide sentences into groups in Ancient Greek was the original [], which was a horizontal line in the margin to the left of the main text. As the became more popular, the horizontal line eventually changed into the Greek letter gamma (\u27e8\u0393\u27e9, \u27e8\u03b3\u27e9) and later into , which were enlarged letters at the beginning of a paragraph.\nUse in Latin.\nThe above notation soon changed to the letter \u27e8K\u27e9, an abbreviation for the Latin word , which translates as \"head\", i.e. it marks the head of a new thesis. Eventually, to mark a new section, the Latin word , which translates as \"little head\", was used, and the letter \u27e8C\u27e9 came to mark a new section, or chapter, in 300 BC.\nUse in Middle Ages.\nIn the 1100s, \u27e8C\u27e9 had completely replaced \u27e8K\u27e9 as the symbol for a new chapter. Rubricators eventually added one or two vertical bars to the C to stylize it (as \u2e3f); the \"bowl\" of the symbol was filled in with dark ink and eventually looked like the modern pilcrow, \u00b6.\nScribes would often leave space before paragraphs to allow rubricators to add a hand-drawn pilcrow in contrasting ink. With the introduction of the printing press from the late medieval period on, space before paragraphs was still left for rubricators to complete by hand. If it was not practical to complete the rubrication, books might be sold with the spaces before the paragraphs left blank, thus creating the typographical practice of indentation.\nModern use.\nThe pilcrow remains in use in modern documents in the following ways:\nThe pilcrow is also often used in word processing and desktop publishing software:\nThe pilcrow may indicate a footnote in a convention that uses a set of distinct typographic symbols in turn to distinguish between footnotes on a given page; it is the sixth in a series of footnote symbols beginning with the asterisk. (The modern convention is to use numbers or letters in superscript form.)\nEncoding.\nThe pilcrow character was encoded in the 1984 Multinational Character Set (Digital Equipment Corporation's extension to ASCII) at 0xB6 (decimal 182), subsequently adopted by ISO/IEC 8859-1 (\"ISO Latin-1\", 1987) at the same code point, and thence by Unicode as . In addition, Unicode also defines , , and . The capitulum character is obsolete, being replaced by pilcrow, but is included in Unicode for backward compatibility and historic studies.\nThe pilcrow symbol was included in the default hardware codepage 437 of IBM PCs (and all other 8-bit OEM codepages based on this) at code point 20 (0x14), which is an ASCII control character.\nParagraph signs in non-Latin writing systems.\nIn Sanskrit and other Indian languages, text blocks are commonly written in stanzas. Two vertical bars, \u0965, called a \"double \"da\u1e47\u1e0da\"\", are the functional equivalent of a pilcrow.\nIn Thai, the character \u0e4f marks the beginning of a stanza and \u0e2f\u0e30 or \u0e5a\u0e30 marks the end of a stanza.\nIn Amharic, the characters \u1360 and \u1368 can mark a section/paragraph.\nIn China, the \u3007, which has been used as a zero character since the 12th century, has been used to mark paragraphs in older Western-made books such as the Chinese Union Version of the Bible.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63251", "revid": "892079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63251", "title": "Geology of Victoria", "text": "Geology of Australia\nVictoria is an Australian state, situated at the southern end of the Great Dividing Range. The Great Dividing Range stretches along the east coast of the continent and terminates near the Victorian city of Ballarat west of the capital Melbourne, though the nearby Grampians may be considered to be the final part of the range. The highest mountains in Victoria (just under 2,000 m) are the Victorian Alps, located in the northeast of the state.\nThe northwest of the state is mostly Cainozoic rocks while the southeast is primarily made up of Palaeozoic rocks. There have been no discoveries of Precambrian rocks in Victoria.\nThe low flat northwest of the state that borders the Murray River was once the bed of an ancient sea and the land is much afflicted with salinity. Saline drainage from Victorian land is one of the sources of the salinity problem in the Murray\u2013Darling River system. Commercial salt evaporation is undertaken near Swan Hill.\nCentral and western Victoria comprise world-class vein-hosted gold deposits, hosted mostly in the extensive Ordovician turbidites.\nThe southeast of the state has enormous brown coal fields.\nVolcanism.\nThere is an area of extensive volcanism in central and southwestern Victoria, where there are numerous volcanoes and volcanic lakes. The Western Victorian Volcanic Plains are the third largest in the world after the Deccan in western India, and the Snake River Plateau in Idaho, United States. The most recent volcanic activity was at Mt Eccles, which last erupted a few thousand years ago, making it an active volcanic region. Large basaltic lava flows are present on the western side of Melbourne and in the southwest of the state.\nNeoproterozoic to early Carboniferous.\nThis period is covered by the recent Geological Survey of Victoria publication \"The Tasman Fold Belt System in Victoria\". The sequence of events associated with the building of southeastern Australia reveals that mineralization and magmatic processes are intimately linked with the tectonic development of the region. The history is dominated by east\u2013west compression of predominantly oceanic sedimentary and igneous rocks and their resultant folding, faulting and uplift. Recently, it has become increasingly apparent that major north\u2013south movements have also been involved in constructing eastern Australia.\nThe Palaeozoic basement is traversed by thrust faults more or less parallel to the north\u2013south structural grain. The largest faults separate rocks with different ages and structural histories, and subdivide Victoria into three main structural rankings consisting of twofold belts (Delamerian and Lachlan), two terranes in the Lachlan Fold Belt (Whitelaw and Benambra), and ten structural zones (Glenelg, Grampians-Stavely, Stawell, Bendigo, Melbourne, Tabberabbera, Omeo, Deddick, Kuark, Mallacoota).\nMoyston Fault.\nThe Moyston Fault is the most important fault as it forms the terrane boundary between the Delamerian and Lachlan fold belts. These twofold belts show important differences. The Delamerian Fold Belt is mainly composed of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rocks and was deformed in the Late Cambrian Delamerian Orogeny whereas the Lachlan Fold Belt contains mainly Cambrian-Devonian rocks with the main deformations occurring in the late Ordovician to early Carboniferous interval. The first regional deformation to affect the Lachlan Fold Belt was the Benambran Orogeny, about 450 MYA, after the Delamerian Orogeny. Granites comprise 20% of the total exposed area of the Lachlan Fold Belt and fall within an age range of 440 to 350 MYA. Volcanics associated with the granites are also widespread and cover an additional 5%. Blocks of older crust consisting of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rocks, such as the Selwyn Block in central Victoria, were deformed during the late Cambrian Tyennan Orogeny prior to being incorporated into the Lachlan Fold Belt.\nBaragwanath Transform.\nThe second major structural break in Victoria is the Baragwanath Transform, which occurs along the eastern side of the Selwyn Block. This transform fault divides the Lachlan Fold Belt into two terranes, the Whitelaw Terrane to the west and the Benambra Terrane to the east. The main difference between these is that orogen-parallel (north-south) transport was more prevalent in the Benambra Terrane, whereas convergent east\u2013west transport orthogonal to the orogen was dominant in the Whitelaw Terrane.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Cornish Rex only has down hair. Most breeds of cat have three different types of hair in their coats: the outer fur or \"guard hairs\", a middle layer called the \"awn hair\"; and the down hair or undercoat, which is very fine and about 1\u00a0cm long. Cornish Rexes only have the undercoat. The curl in their fur is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Devon Rex. The breed originated in Cornwall, Great Britain.\nCharacteristics.\nThe coat of a Cornish Rex is extremely fine and naturally curly. Their light coat means that they are best suited for indoor living in warm and dry conditions, as they are sensitive to low temperatures.\nThe breed is sometimes referred to as the Greyhound of the cats, because of the sleek appearance and the galloping run characteristic of the breed.\nAppearance.\nAccording to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) standard, the Cornish Rex's colour is irrelevant \u2014 therefore the cat may be any colour.\nAside from the distinctive coat, the Cornish Rex is set apart by its 'foreign type', slender legs and tail, oval eyes, and wedge shaped head. The Cornish Rex's ears are large and wide at the base with rounded tips and are described as being almost mussel shell shaped. The eyes are medium in size and come in all varieties of eye colour. The body is slender and muscular with small paws.\nGenetics.\nIn 2013, researchers identified the mutation that defines the Cornish Rex breed. Genome-wide analyses were performed in the Cornish Rex breed and in 11 phenotypically diverse breeds and two random bred populations. A gene on chromosome A1, the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (\"LPAR6\"), was identified to have a 4 base pair deletion. This induces a premature stop codon in the receptor that is absent in all straight haired cats analyzed. \"LPAR6\" encodes a receptor essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the hair shaft. In humans, LPAR6 mutations result in a form of ectodermal dysplasia characterised by a woolly hair phenotype.\nOrigin.\nThe distinctive look of the Cornish Rex is a genetic mutation that originated from a litter of kittens born in the 1950s on a farm in Cornwall, UK. One of the kittens, a cream-colored male named Kallibunker, had an extremely unusual, fine and curly coat; he was the first Cornish Rex. The owner then backcrossed Kallibunker to his mother to produce 2 other curly-coated kittens. The male, Poldhu, sired a female called Lamorna Cove who was later brought to America and crossed with a Siamese, giving the breed their long whippy tails and big ears.\nThe Devon Rex looks similar in appearance to the Cornish Rex but has guard hairs and sheds. The Devon Rex mutation is different from the Cornish Rex mutation in that the Devon has shortened guard hairs, while the Cornish Rex lacks guard hairs altogether.\nHypoallergenic.\nDespite some belief to the contrary, the Cornish Rex's short hair does not make it non- or hypo-allergenic. Allergic reactions from cats are not the result of hair length, but from a glycoprotein known as Fel d 1, produced in the sebaceous glands of the skin, saliva, and urine. Most people who have cat allergies are reacting to this protein in cat saliva and cat dander: when the cat cleans its fur, the saliva dries and is transformed into dust that people breathe in. Since Cornish Rex cats groom as much as or even more than ordinary cats, a Cornish Rex cat can still produce a reaction in people who are allergic to cats. It is, however, widely reported to cause lesser to little allergic reaction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It therefore centers on decision making under uncertainty in the context of the financial markets, and the resultant economic and financial models and principles, and is concerned with deriving testable or policy implications from acceptable assumptions. \nIt thus also includes a formal study of the financial markets themselves, especially market microstructure and market regulation.\nIt is built on the foundations of microeconomics and decision theory.\nFinancial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterise the relationships identified.\nMathematical finance is related in that it will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models suggested by financial economics.\nWhereas financial economics has a primarily microeconomic focus, monetary economics is primarily macroeconomic in nature.\nUnderlying economics.\nFinancial economics studies how rational investors would apply decision theory to investment management. The subject is thus built on the foundations of microeconomics and derives several key results for the application of decision making under uncertainty to the financial markets. The underlying economic logic yields the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, which gives the conditions for arbitrage-free asset pricing.\nThe various \"fundamental\" valuation formulae result directly.\nPresent value, expectation and utility.\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of present value and expectation.\nCalculating their present value, formula_1 in the first formula, allows the decision maker to aggregate the cashflows (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is then the starting point for financial decision making.\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the expected value criterion which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, formula_3 and formula_4 respectively.\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider risk aversion. In other words, since individuals receive greater utility from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is therefore to \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes, i.e. \"states\", correspondingly: formula_5. See indifference price. (Some investors may in fact be risk seeking as opposed to risk averse, but the same logic would apply.)\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be defined as the maximization of expected utility. More formally, the resulting expected utility hypothesis states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the subjective value associated with a gamble by an individual is \"that individual\"'s statistical expectation of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\nThe impetus for these ideas arises from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the St. Petersburg paradox and the Ellsberg paradox.\nArbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium.\nThe concepts of arbitrage-free, \"rational\", pricing and equilibrium are then coupled\nwith the above to derive various of the \"classical\" (or \"neo-classical\") financial economics models.\nRational pricing is the assumption that asset prices (and hence asset pricing models) will reflect the arbitrage-free price of the asset, as any deviation from this price will be arbitraged away: the \"law of one price\". This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\nEconomic equilibrium is a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. General equilibrium deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices are complete and do not allow profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and they are therefore not in equilibrium. An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, formula_6, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming no friction): essentially solving simultaneously for \"n\" (risk-neutral) probabilities, formula_7, given \"n\" prices. For a simplified example see , where the economy has only two possible states \u2013 up and down \u2013 and where formula_8 and formula_9 (\nformula_10) are the two corresponding probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or \"measure\".\nThe fundamental theorem of asset pricing formalizes this. A market with \"physical\" probabilities, denoted by \"P\": \nis (i) considered arbitrage-free if, and only if, there exists at least one risk neutral probability measure \"Q\" that is equivalent to P; \nand (ii) is considered complete, if Q is unique \"and\" there is a risk-free bond which may act as the numeraire, or pricing reference.\nThe formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments. The analysis here is often undertaken to assume a \"representative agent\", essentially treating all market participants, \"agents\", as identical (or, at least, assuming that they act in such a way that the sum of their choices is equivalent to the decision of one individual) with the effect that the problems are then mathematically tractable.\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the risk-free return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\", i.e. a security-specific risk premium, compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions or conditions. This approach is consistent with the above, but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\nContinuing the example, in pricing a derivative instrument, its forecasted cashflows in the abovementioned up- and down-states formula_11 and formula_12, are multiplied through by formula_8 and formula_9, and are then discounted at the risk-free interest rate; per the second equation above. In pricing a \"fundamental\", underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with formula_15 and formula_2 combined. This premium may be derived by the CAPM (or extensions) as will be seen under .\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \"manufacturing\" the instrument as a combination of the underlying and a risk free \"bond\"; see (and below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such \"manufacturing\" is of course not possible \u2013 the instrument being \"fundamental\", i.e. as opposed to \"derivative\" \u2013 and a premium is then required for risk.\nAlthough mathematical finance separates into , these - per the fundamental theorem - are at base consistent.\nThus, risk and portfolio management generally use P, physical (or actual or actuarial) probabilities, while derivatives pricing uses Q, risk-neutral (or arbitrage-pricing) probabilities. (In specific applications the lower case symbols p and q are used, as in the above equations.) But here, \"quants\", in fact, construct the latter from the former (as outlined); and this as a modelling \"convenience\", allowing them to operate \"as if\" risk-neutral and to discount expected payoffs at the risk-free rate.\nState prices.\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized Arrow\u2013Debreu model may be derived. \nThis result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. \nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally complete markets, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods.\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a state price security, also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security, a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a numeraire (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the \"state price\" formula_17 of this particular state of the world; the collection of these is also referred to as a \"Risk Neutral Density\".\nIn the above example, the state prices, formula_18, formula_19would equate to the present values of formula_20 and formula_21: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the state price vector is the vector of state prices for all states. Applied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [formula_18\u00d7formula_11 + formula_19\u00d7formula_12]: the fourth formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a continuous random variable indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by integrating over the state price \"density\".\nState prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (\"contingent claim analysis\"); but can also be applied to valuation problems. Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value \u2013 true in fact for \"every security\" \u2013 as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices. \nThese recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself.\nUsing the related stochastic discount factor - SDF; also called the pricing kernel - the asset price is computed by \"discounting\" the future cash flow by the stochastic factor formula_26, and then taking the expectation; the third equation above. Essentially, this factor divides expected utility at the relevant future period - a function of the possible asset values realized under each state - by the utility due to today's wealth, and is then also referred to as \"the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution\".\nCorrespondingly, the SDF, formula_27, may be thought of as the discounted value of Risk Aversion, formula_28\n(The latter may be inferred via the ratio of risk neutral- to physical-probabilities, formula_29\nSee Girsanov theorem and Radon-Nikodym derivative.)\nResultant models.\nApplying the above economic concepts, we may then derive various economic- and financial models and principles. As outlined, the two areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\", as will be seen below.\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"deterministic\" and \"random\", or \"stochastic\".)\nCertainty.\nThe starting point here is \"Investment under certainty\", and usually framed in the context of a corporation.\nThe Fisher separation theorem, asserts that the objective of the corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. \nRelated is the Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem, which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by \nJohn Burr Williams' \"The Theory of Investment Value\", which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the \"intrinsic\", long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of dividends; in the corporate context, \"free cash flow\" as aside. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. Net present value (NPV), the result of this discounted cashflow valuation, is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of \"Equity valuation\" topics under .\nBond valuation, in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal, or \"Face value\") are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion. An immediate extension, Arbitrage-free bond pricing, discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate \u2013 i.e. at each coupon's corresponding zero rate, and of equivalent credit worthiness \u2013 as opposed to an overall rate.\nIn many treatments bond valuation precedes equity valuation, under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" \"per se\". Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these \u2013 based on historic ratios or published dividend policy \u2013 and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under .\nFor both stocks and bonds, \"under certainty, with the focus on cash flows from securities over time,\" valuation based on a term structure of interest rates is in fact consistent with arbitrage-free pricing.\nIndeed, a corollary of the above is that \"the law of one price implies the existence of a discount factor\".\nCorresponding to these: ; and equivalently, for the above \"numeraire bond\", . In practice, the latter is interchangeable with the risk-free yield curve: this ensures consistency between the theoretical no-arbitrage framework and applied valuation, providing a common benchmark for discounting future cash flows.\nWhereas these \"certainty\" results are all commonly employed under corporate finance, uncertainty is the focus of \"asset pricing models\" as follows. Fisher's formulation of the theory here - developing an intertemporal equilibrium model - underpins also the below applications to uncertainty; \nsee for the development.\nUncertainty.\nFor \"choice under uncertainty\" the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency, as more closely defined, lead to modern portfolio theory (MPT) with its capital asset pricing model (CAPM) \u2013 an \"equilibrium-based\" result \u2013 and to the Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton theory (BSM; often, simply Black\u2013Scholes) for option pricing \u2013 an \"arbitrage-free\" result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see .\nBriefly, and intuitively \u2013 and consistent with above \u2013 the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows. \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. \"efficient\", prices: the efficient-market hypothesis, or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See earnings response coefficient.)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information are identical to the \"best guess of the future\": the assumption of rational expectations. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact,\nbut what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a normal distribution \u2013 so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news: the random walk hypothesis. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \nUnder these conditions, investors can then be assumed to act rationally: their investment decision must be calculated or a loss is sure to follow; correspondingly, where an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, then arbitrageurs will exploit it, reinforcing this equilibrium.\nHere, as under the certainty-case above, the specific assumption as to pricing is that prices are calculated as the present value of expected future dividends, \nas based on currently available information.\nWhat is required though, is a theory for determining the appropriate discount rate, i.e. \"required return\", given this uncertainty: this is provided by the MPT and its CAPM. Relatedly, rationality \u2013 in the sense of arbitrage-exploitation \u2013 gives rise to Black\u2013Scholes; option values here ultimately consistent with the CAPM.\nIn general, then, while portfolio theory studies how investors should balance risk and return when investing in many assets or securities, the CAPM is more focused, describing how, in equilibrium, markets set the prices of assets in relation to how risky they are.\nThis result will be independent of the investor's level of risk aversion and assumed utility function, thus providing a readily determined discount rate for corporate finance decision makers as above, and for other investors.\nThe argument proceeds as follows: \nIf one can construct an efficient frontier \u2013 i.e. each combination of assets offering the best possible expected level of return for its level of risk, see diagram \u2013 then mean-variance efficient portfolios can be formed simply as a combination of holdings of the risk-free asset and the \"market portfolio\" (the Mutual fund separation theorem), with the combinations here plotting as the capital market line, or CML. \nThen, given this CML, the required return on a risky security will be independent of the investor's utility function, and solely determined by its covariance (\"beta\") with aggregate, i.e. market, risk. \nThis is because investors here can then maximize utility through leverage as opposed to stock selection; see Separation property (finance), and CML diagram aside. \nAs can be seen in the formula aside, this result is consistent with the preceding, equaling the riskless return plus an adjustment for risk. \nA more modern, direct, derivation is as described at the bottom of this section; which can be generalized to derive other equilibrium-pricing models.\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing derivative instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of European-styled options.\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a partial differential equation describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, geometric Brownian motion (see Brownian model of financial markets).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (formula_30, the value, or price, of the option, grows at formula_2, the risk-free rate).\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price \u2013 in an arbitrage-free sense \u2013 for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is the solution to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with above. Relatedly, therefore, the pricing formula may also be derived directly via risk neutral expectation.\nIt\u00f4's lemma provides the underlying mathematics, and, with It\u00f4 calculus more generally, remains fundamental in quantitative finance.\nAs implied by the Fundamental Theorem, the two major results are consistent. \nHere, the Black-Scholes equation can alternatively be derived from the CAPM, and the price obtained from the Black\u2013Scholes model is thus consistent with the assumptions of the CAPM. \nThe Black\u2013Scholes theory, although built on Arbitrage-free pricing, is therefore consistent with the equilibrium based capital asset pricing. \nBoth models, in turn, are ultimately consistent with the Arrow\u2013Debreu theory, and can be derived via state-pricing \u2013 essentially, by expanding the above fundamental equations \u2013 further explaining, and if required demonstrating, this consistency. \nHere, the CAPM is derived by linking formula_15, risk aversion, to overall market return, and setting the return on security formula_33 as formula_34; see .\nThe Black\u2013Scholes formula is found, in the limit, by attaching a binomial probability to each of numerous possible spot-prices (i.e. states) and then rearranging for the terms corresponding to formula_35 and formula_36, per the boxed description; see .\nExtensions.\nMore recent work further generalizes and extends these models. As regards asset pricing, developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under \"Portfolio theory\" below, while \"Derivative pricing\" relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing. As regards the use of capital, \"Corporate finance theory\" relates, mainly, to the application of these models.\nPortfolio theory.\nMuch of the development here relates to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the Fama\u2013French three-factor model and the Carhart four-factor model, propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The intertemporal CAPM and consumption-based CAPM similarly extend the model. With intertemporal portfolio choice, the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of consumption (in the economic sense) then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the single-index model is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization.\nThe arbitrage pricing theory (APT) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\" It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\nThe linear factor model \"structure\" of the APT is used as the basis for many of the commercial risk and fund management systems employed by asset managers. Here, \nmanagers apply various of the abovementioned multi-factor models - often \nbespoke extensions - such that their portfolio has the desired exposure (\"tilt\") to macroeconomic, market and / or fundamental risk factors; respectively: Macro-, Factor-, and Style Funds.\nResearch here, and application (e.g. \"Smart Beta\"), is ongoing, and over the years \"hundreds of factors attempt to explain the cross-section of expected returns\"; \nwith this \"factor zoo\", \nthere is a risk of data mining, and researchers have proposed various criteria for establishing significance.\nAt the same time as these, \"classic\" mean-variance optimization \u2014 i.e. building an efficient portfolio as described above \u2014 is still widely used by Asset Allocation Funds. Here, given issues noted with this approach, the application is typically in combination with other techniques.\nThe Black\u2013Litterman model is often employed.\nBlack\u2013Litterman departs from the original Markowitz model approach: it starts with an equilibrium assumption, as for the latter, but this is then modified to take into account the \"views\" (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. \nA further modification often used relates to the subsequent optimization: under (Tail) risk parity, the focus is on the allocation of risk, rather than the allocation of capital.\nOther developments re portfolio optimization include the following. \nWhere factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then multiple-criteria decision analysis can be applied; here deriving a Pareto efficient portfolio. The universal portfolio algorithm identifies the \"growth optimal portfolio\" per the Kelly criterion, applying information theory to asset selection. Behavioral portfolio theory recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals. Copulas have lately been applied here; recently this is the case also for genetic algorithms and machine learning, more generally; see below.\nDerivative pricing.\nIn pricing derivatives, the binomial options pricing model provides a discretized version of Black\u2013Scholes, useful for the valuation of American styled options. Discretized models of this type are built \u2013 at least implicitly \u2013 using state-prices (as above); relatedly, a large number of researchers have used options to extract state-prices for a variety of other applications in financial economics. For path dependent derivatives, Monte Carlo methods for option pricing are employed; here the modelling is in continuous time, but similarly uses risk neutral expected value. Various other numeric techniques have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that martingale pricing is now the standard approach.\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based on the same logic (using \"contingent claim analysis\"). Real options valuation allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for employee stock option valuation explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; Credit derivatives allow that payment obligations or delivery requirements might not be honored. Exotic derivatives are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or copula based analysis.\nSimilarly, the various short-rate models allow for an extension of these techniques to fixed income- and interest rate derivatives. (The Vasicek and CIR models are equilibrium-based, while Ho\u2013Lee and subsequent models are based on arbitrage-free pricing.) The more general HJM Framework describes the dynamics of the full forward-rate curve \u2013 as opposed to working with short rates \u2013 and is then more widely applied. The valuation of the underlying instrument \u2013 additional to its derivatives \u2013 is relatedly extended, particularly for hybrid securities, where credit risk is combined with uncertainty re future rates; see and . \nFollowing the Crash of 1987, equity options traded in American markets began to exhibit what is known as a \"volatility smile\"; that is, for a given expiration, options whose strike price differs substantially from the underlying asset's price command higher prices, and thus implied volatilities, than what is suggested by BSM. (The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2013 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2013 are discussed in the next section.\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, a further development: as outlined, (over the counter) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2013 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as counterparty credit risk, funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing, and a credit valuation adjustment, or CVA \u2013 and potentially other \"valuation adjustments\", collectively xVA \u2013 is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\nThe standard economic arguments can be extended to incorporate these various adjustments.\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) curve, as opposed to LIBOR as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the overnight rate is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\". (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash collateral is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"CSA discounting\".) Swap pricing \u2013 and, therefore, yield curve construction \u2013 is further modified: previously, swaps were valued off a single \"self discounting\" interest rate curve; whereas post crisis, to accommodate OIS discounting, valuation is now under a \"multi-curve framework\" where \"forecast curves\" are constructed for each floating-leg LIBOR tenor, with discounting on the \"common\" OIS curve.\nCorporate finance theory.\nMirroring the above developments, corporate finance valuations and decisioning no longer need assume \"certainty\".\nMonte Carlo methods in finance allow financial analysts to construct \"stochastic\" or probabilistic corporate finance models, as opposed to the traditional static and deterministic models; see . \nRelatedly, Real Options theory allows for owner \u2013 i.e. managerial \u2013 actions that impact underlying value: by incorporating option pricing logic, these actions are then applied to a distribution of future outcomes, changing with time, which then determine the \"project's\" valuation today. \nMore traditionally, decision trees \u2013 which are complementary \u2013 have been used to evaluate projects, by incorporating in the valuation (all) possible events (or states) and consequent management decisions; the correct discount rate here reflecting each decision-point's \"non-diversifiable risk looking forward.\"\nRelated to this, is the treatment of forecasted cashflows in equity valuation. In many cases, following Williams above, the average (or most likely) cash-flows were discounted, as opposed to a theoretically correct state-by-state treatment under uncertainty; see comments under Financial modeling \u00a7 Accounting. \nIn more modern treatments, then, it is the \"expected\" cashflows (in the mathematical sense: formula_37) combined into an overall value per forecast period which are discounted.\nAnd using the CAPM \u2013 or extensions \u2013 the discounting here is at the risk-free rate plus a premium linked to the uncertainty of the entity or project cash flows\n(essentially, formula_15 and formula_2 combined).\nOther developments here include agency theory, which analyses the difficulties in motivating corporate management (the \"agent\"; in a different sense to the above) to act in the best interests of shareholders (the \"principal\"), rather than in their own interests; here emphasizing the issues interrelated with capital structure. \nClean surplus accounting and the related residual income valuation provide a model that returns price as a function of earnings, expected returns, and change in book value, as opposed to dividends. This approach, to some extent, arises due to the implicit contradiction of seeing value as a function of dividends, while also holding that dividend policy cannot influence value per Modigliani and Miller's \"Irrelevance principle\"; see .\n\"Corporate finance\" as a discipline more generally, building on Fisher above, relates to the long term objective of maximizing the value of the firm - and its return to shareholders - and thus also incorporates the areas of capital structure and dividend policy.\nExtensions of the theory here then also consider these latter, as follows:\n(i) optimization re capitalization structure, and theories here as to corporate choices and behavior: Capital structure substitution theory, Pecking order theory, Market timing hypothesis, Trade-off theory;\n(ii) considerations and analysis re dividend policy, additional to - and sometimes contrasting with - Modigliani-Miller, include: \nthe Walter model, Lintner model, Residuals theory and signaling hypothesis, as well as discussion re the observed clientele effect and dividend puzzle.\nAs described, the typical application of real options is to capital budgeting type problems. \nHowever, here, they are also applied to problems of capital structure and dividend policy, and to the related design of corporate securities; \nand since stockholder and bondholders have different objective functions, in the analysis of the related agency problems. \nIn all of these cases, state-prices can provide the market-implied information relating to the corporate, as above, which is then applied to the analysis. For example, convertible bonds can (must) be priced consistent with the (recovered) state-prices of the corporate's equity.\nFinancial markets.\nThe discipline, as outlined, also includes a formal study of financial markets. Of interest especially are market regulation and market microstructure, and their relationship to price efficiency.\nRegulatory economics studies, in general, the economics of regulation. In the context of finance, it will address the impact of financial regulation on the functioning of markets and the efficiency of prices, while also weighing the corresponding increases in market confidence and financial stability.\nResearch here considers how, and to what extent, regulations relating to disclosure (earnings guidance, annual reports), insider trading, and short-selling will impact price efficiency, the cost of equity, and market liquidity.\nMarket microstructure is concerned with the details of how exchange occurs in markets \n(with Walrasian-, matching-, Fisher-, and \nArrow-Debreu markets as prototypes), \nand \"analyzes how specific trading mechanisms affect the price formation process\", examining the ways in which the processes of a market affect determinants of transaction costs, prices, quotes, volume, and trading behavior.\nIt has been used, for example, in providing explanations for long-standing exchange rate puzzles, and for the equity premium puzzle. \nIn contrast to the above classical approach, models here explicitly allow for (testing the impact of) market frictions and other imperfections;\nsee also market design.\nFor both regulation and microstructure, and generally, agent-based models can be developed to due to a change in structure or policy - or to make inferences re market dynamics - by testing these in an artificial financial market, or AFM.\nThis approach, essentially simulated trade between numerous agents, \"typically uses artificial intelligence technologies [often genetic algorithms and neural nets] to represent the adaptive behaviour of market participants\".\nThese 'bottom-up' models \"start from first principals of agent behavior\", with participants modifying their trading strategies having learned over time, and \"are able to describe macro features [i.e. stylized facts] emerging from a soup of individual interacting strategies\".\nAgent-based models depart further from the classical approach \u2014 the representative agent, as outlined \u2014 in that they introduce heterogeneity into the environment (thereby addressing, also, the aggregation problem).\nMore recent research focuses on the potential impact of machine learning on market functioning and efficiency.\nAs these methods become more prevalent in financial markets, economists would expect greater information acquisition and improved price efficiency. \nIn fact, an apparent rejection of market efficiency (see below) might simply represent \"the unsurprising consequence of investors not having precise knowledge of the parameters of a data-generating process that involves thousands of predictor variables\".\nAt the same time, it is acknowledged that a potential downside of these methods, in this context, is their lack of interpretability \"which translates into difficulties in attaching economic meaning to the results found.\"\nChallenges and criticism.\nAs above, there is a very close link between:\nthe random walk hypothesis, with the associated belief that price changes should follow a normal distribution, on the one hand; \nand market efficiency and rational expectations, on the other.\nWide departures from these are commonly observed, and there are thus, respectively, two main sets of challenges.\nDepartures from normality.\nThe assumptions that market prices follow a random walk and that asset returns are normally distributed are fundamental. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold, and that in practice, traders, analysts and risk managers frequently modify the \"standard models\" (see kurtosis risk, skewness risk, long tail, model risk). \nIn fact, Benoit Mandelbrot had discovered already in the 1960s \nthat changes in financial prices do not follow a normal distribution, the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\nFinancial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while jump diffusion models allow for (option) pricing incorporating \"jumps\" in the spot price. \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard value at risk models with historical simulations, mixture models, principal component analysis, extreme value theory, as well as models for volatility clustering. \nFor further discussion see , and . Portfolio managers, likewise, have modified their optimization criteria and algorithms; see above.\nClosely related is the volatility smile, where, as above, implied volatility \u2013 the volatility corresponding to the BSM price \u2013 is observed to \"differ\" as a function of strike price (i.e. moneyness), true only if the price-change distribution is non-normal, unlike that assumed by BSM (i.e. formula_35 and formula_36 above). The term structure of volatility describes how (implied) volatility differs for related options with different maturities. An implied volatility surface is then a three-dimensional plot of volatility smile and term structure. These empirical phenomena negate the assumption of constant volatility \u2013 and log-normality \u2013 upon which Black\u2013Scholes is built. \nWithin institutions, the function of Black\u2013Scholes is now, largely, to \"communicate\" prices via implied volatilities, much like bond prices are communicated via YTM; see .\nIn consequence traders (and risk managers) now, instead, use \"smile-consistent\" models, firstly, when valuing derivatives not directly mapped to the surface, facilitating the pricing of other, i.e. non-quoted, strike/maturity combinations, or of non-European derivatives, and generally for hedging purposes. \nThe two main approaches are local volatility and stochastic volatility. The first returns the volatility which is \"local\" to each spot-time point of the finite difference- or simulation-based valuation; i.e. as opposed to implied volatility, which holds overall. In this way calculated prices \u2013 and numeric structures \u2013 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense. The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first calibrated to observed prices, and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are Heston, SABR and CEV. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.\nRelated to local volatility are the lattice-based implied-binomial and -trinomial trees \u2013 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2013 which are similarly, but less commonly, used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. Edgeworth binomial trees allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) skew and kurtosis in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required. \nSimilarly purposed (and derived) closed-form models were also developed.\nAs discussed, additional to assuming log-normality in returns, \"classical\" BSM-type models also (implicitly) assume the existence of a credit-risk-free environment, where one can perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge, and then discount at \"the\" risk-free-rate. \nAnd therefore, post crisis, the various x-value adjustments must be employed, effectively correcting the risk-neutral value for counterparty- and funding-related risk.\nThese xVA are \"additional\" to any smile or surface effect: with the surface built on price data for fully-collateralized positions, there is therefore no \"double counting\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...)\nAs mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly financial engineering) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above \"extreme event\" approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. Recognizing this, critics of financial economics - especially vocal since the 2008 financial crisis - suggest that instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The current system, based on the idea that risk is distributed in the shape of a bell curve, is flawed... The problem is [that economists and practitioners] never abandon the bell curve. They are like medieval astronomers who believe the sun revolves around the earth and are furiously tweaking their geo-centric math in the face of contrary evidence. They will never get this right; they need their Copernicus.\nDepartures from rationality.\nAs seen, a common assumption is that financial decision makers act rationally; see Homo economicus. Recently, however, researchers in experimental economics and experimental finance have challenged this assumption empirically. These assumptions are also challenged theoretically, by behavioral finance, \na discipline primarily concerned with the limits to rationality of economic agents.\nFor related criticisms re corporate finance theory vs its practice see:.\nVarious market anomalies have been documented in parallel. These comprise price \"distortions\", e.g. size premiums, or return \"predictability\" as exemplified by the various calendar effects, and are anomalous in the sense that they cannot be explained by traditional economic theories, (apparently) contradicting the efficient-market hypothesis. Related to these are various of the economic puzzles, similarly contradicting the theory. The equity premium puzzle, as one example, arises in that the difference between the observed returns on stocks as compared to government bonds is consistently higher than the risk premium rational equity investors should demand, an \"abnormal return\". For further context see Random walk hypothesis \u00a7 A non-random walk hypothesis, and sidebar for specific instances.\nMore generally, and, again, particularly following the 2008 financial crisis, financial economics (and mathematical finance) has been subjected to deeper criticism.\nNotable here is Nassim Taleb, whose critique overlaps the above, but extends \nalso to the institutional\naspects of finance - including academic.\nHis Black swan theory posits that although events of large magnitude and consequence play a major role in finance, since these are (statistically) unexpected, they are \"ignored\" by economists and traders - who often have no skin in the game. \nThus, although a \"Taleb distribution\" - which normally provides a payoff of small positive returns, while carrying a small but significant risk of catastrophic losses - more realistically describes markets than current models, the latter continue to be preferred; and even with professionals here acknowledging that it only \"generally works\" or only \"works on average\".\nHere, financial crises have been a topic of interest \nand, in particular, the failure of (financial) economists - as well as bankers and regulators - to model and predict these.\nSee .\nThe related problem of systemic risk, has also received attention. Where companies hold securities in each other, then this interconnectedness may entail a \"valuation chain\" \u2013 and the performance of one company, or security, here will impact all, a phenomenon not easily modeled, regardless of whether the individual models are correct. See: Systemic risk \u00a7 Inadequacy of classic valuation models; Cascades in financial networks; Flight-to-quality.\nAreas of research attempting to explain (or at least model) these phenomena, and crises, include market microstructure and Heterogeneous agent models, as above. The latter is extended to agent-based computational models; here, as mentioned, price is treated as an emergent phenomenon, resulting from the interaction of the various market participants (agents). The noisy market hypothesis argues that prices can be influenced by speculators and momentum traders, as well as by insiders and institutions that often buy and sell stocks for reasons unrelated to fundamental value; see Noise (economic) and Noise trader. The adaptive market hypothesis is an attempt to reconcile the efficient market hypothesis with behavioral economics, by applying the principles of evolution to financial interactions. An information cascade, alternatively, shows market participants engaging in the same acts as others (\"herd behavior\"), despite contradictions with their private information. Copula-based modelling has similarly been applied. See also Hyman Minsky's \"financial instability hypothesis\", as well as George Soros' application of \"reflexivity\".\nIn the alternative, institutionally inherent limits to arbitrage - i.e. as opposed to factors directly contradictory to the theory - are sometimes referenced.\nNote however, that despite the above inefficiencies, asset prices do \"effectively\" follow a random walk - i.e. (at least) in the sense that \"changes in the stock market are unpredictable, lacking any pattern that can be used by an investor to beat the overall market\".\nThus after fund costs - and given other considerations - it is difficult to consistently outperform market averages \nand achieve \"alpha\".\nThe practical implication is that passive investing, i.e. via low-cost index funds, should, on average, serve better than any other active strategy - \nand, in fact, this practice is now widely adopted.\nHere, however, the following concern is posited:\nalthough in concept, it is \"the research undertaken by active managers [that] keeps prices closer to value... [and] thus there is a fragile equilibrium in which some investors choose to index while the rest continue to search for mispriced securities\";\nin practice, as more investors \"pour money into index funds tracking the same stocks, valuations for those companies become inflated\", potentially leading to asset bubbles.\nSee Grossman-Stiglitz paradox.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistorical notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFinancial economics\nAsset pricing\nCorporate finance"}
{"id": "63263", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63263", "title": "Evolution of flagella", "text": "Origin of three known varieties of flagella\nThe evolution of flagella is of great interest to biologists because the three known varieties of flagella \u2013 (eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal) each represent a sophisticated cellular structure that requires the interaction of many different systems.\nEukaryotic flagellum.\nThere are two competing groups of models for the evolutionary origin of the eukaryotic flagellum (referred to as cilium below to distinguish it from its bacterial counterpart). Recent studies on the microtubule organizing center suggest that the most recent ancestor of all eukaryotes already had a complex flagellar apparatus.\nEndogenous, autogenous and direct filiation models.\nThese models argue that cilia developed from pre-existing components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton (which has tubulin and dynein\u00a0\u2013 also used for other functions) as an extension of the mitotic spindle apparatus. The connection can still be seen, first in the various early-branching single-celled eukaryotes that have a microtubule basal body, where microtubules on one end form a spindle-like cone around the nucleus, while microtubules on the other end point away from the cell and form the cilium. A further connection is that the centriole, involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle in many (but not all) eukaryotes, is homologous to the cilium, and in many cases \"is\" the basal body from which the cilium grows.\nAn intermediate stage between spindle and cilium would be a non-swimming appendage made of microtubules with a function subject to natural selection, such as increasing surface area, helping the protozoan remain suspended in water, increasing the chances of bumping into bacteria to eat, or serving as a stalk attaching the cell to a solid substrate.\nRegarding the origin of the individual protein components, a paper on the evolution of dyneins shows that the more complex protein family of ciliary dynein has an apparent ancestor in a simpler cytoplasmic dynein (which itself has evolved from the AAA protein family that occurs widely in all archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes). Long-standing suspicions that tubulin was homologous to FtsZ (based on very weak sequence similarity and some behavioral similarities) were confirmed in 1998 by the independent resolution of the 3-dimensional structures of the two proteins.\nSymbiotic/endosymbiotic/exogenous models.\nThese models argue that the cilium evolved from a symbiotic Gracilicutes (ancestor of spirochete and Prosthecobacter) that attached to a primitive eukaryote or archaebacterium (archaea).\nThe modern version of the hypothesis was first proposed by Lynn Margulis. The hypothesis, though very well publicized, was never widely accepted by the experts, in contrast to Margulis' arguments for the symbiotic origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Margulis did strongly promote and publish versions of this hypothesis until the end of her life.\nOne primary point in favor of the symbiotic hypothesis was that there are eukaryotes that use symbiotic spirochetes as their motility organelles (some parabasalids inside termite guts, such as \"Mixotricha\" and \"Trichonympha\"). \nThis is an example of co-option and the flexibility of biological systems, and the proposed homologies that have been reported between cilia and spirochetes have stood up to further scrutiny.\nMargulis' hypothesis suggests that an archaea acquired tubulin proteins from a eubacter ancestor of Prosthecobacter. However, the homology of tubulin to the bacterial replication and cytoskeletal protein FtsZ (see Prokaryotic cytoskeleton), which was apparently native in archaea, suggesting an endogenous origin of tubulin rather than a symbiotic transfer.\nBacterial flagellum.\nThere is good evidence that the bacterial flagellum includes and might even be based on a Type III secretory and transport system, given the similarity of proteins in both systems.\nAll currently known nonflagellar Type III transport systems serve the function of exporting (injecting) toxin into eukaryotic cells. Similarly, flagella grow by exporting flagellin through the flagellar machinery. It is hypothesised that the flagellum evolved from the type three secretory system. For example, the bubonic plague bacterium \"Yersinia pestis\" has an organelle assembly very similar to a complex flagellum, except that it is missing only a few flagellar mechanisms and functions, such as a needle to inject toxins into other cells. As such, the type three secretory system supports the hypothesis that the flagellum evolved from a simpler bacterial secretion system.\nHowever, the true relationship could be the reverse: recent phylogenetic research strongly suggests the type three secretory system evolved from the flagellum through a series of gene deletions.\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by flagellation can cause oxidative damage to DNA and are mutagenic with researchers asking \"Did the innovation of a functional flagellum impact either the short- or long-term rate of bacterial evolution?\".\nEubacterial flagellum.\nEubacterial flagellum is a multifunctional organelle. It is also one of a range of motility systems in bacteria. The structure of the organelle appears like a motor, shaft and a propeller. However, the structure of eubacterial flagellae varies based on whether their motor systems run on protons or sodium, and on the complexity of the flagellar whip. The evolutionary origin of eubacterial flagellae is probably an example of indirect evolution. A hypothesis on the evolutionary pathway of the eubacterial flagellum argues that a secretory system evolved first, based around the SMC rod- and pore-forming complex. This is presumed to be the common ancestor of the type-III secretory system and the flagellar system. Then, an ion pump was introduced to this structure which improved secretion. The ion pump later became the motor protein. This was followed by the emergence of the proto-flagellar filament as part of the protein-secretion structure. Gliding-twitching motility arose at this stage or later and was then refined into swimming motility.\nArchaeal flagellum.\nThe recently elucidated archaeal flagellum, or \"archaellum\", is analogous\u2014but not homologous\u2014to the bacterial one. In addition to no sequence similarity being detected between the genes of the two systems, the archaeal flagellum appears to grow at the base rather than the tip, and is about 15 nanometers (nm) in diameter rather than 20.\nSequence comparison indicates that the archaeal flagellum is homologous to bacterial Type IV pili, filamentous structures outside the cell. Pilus retraction provides enables a different form of bacterial motility called \"twitching\" or \"social gliding\" which allows bacterial cells to crawl along a surface, They are assembled through the Type II secretion system. They can also promote swimming, but no species of bacteria is known to use its Type IV pili for both swimming and crawling.\nFurther research.\nTestable outlines exist for the origin of each of the three motility systems, and avenues for further research are clear; for prokaryotes, these avenues include the study of secretion systems in free-living, nonvirulent prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the mechanisms of both mitosis and cilial construction, including the key role of the centriole, need to be much better understood. A detailed survey of the various nonmotile appendages found in eukaryotes is also necessary.\nFinally, the study of the origin of all of these systems would benefit greatly from a resolution of the questions surrounding deep phylogeny, as to what are the most deeply branching organisms in each domain, and what are the interrelationships between the domains.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is considered one of the most significant representatives of Viennese Modernism. Schnitzler\u2019s works, which include psychological dramas and narratives, dissected turn-of-the-century Viennese bourgeois life, making him a sharp and stylistically conscious chronicler of Viennese society around 1900. Schnitzler's Jewish upbringing and the sexual content of his works made them controversial or banned in his time and beyond.\nLife.\nArthur Schnitzler was born at Praterstrasse 16, Leopoldstadt, Vienna, capital of the Austrian Empire (as of 1867, part of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary). He was the son of a prominent Hungarian laryngologist, Johann Schnitzler (1835\u20131893), and Luise Markbreiter (1838\u20131911), a daughter of the Viennese doctor Philipp Markbreiter. His parents were both from Jewish families. In 1879 Schnitzler began studying medicine at the University of Vienna and in 1885 he received his doctorate of medicine. He began work at Vienna's General Hospital (), but ultimately abandoned the practice of medicine in favour of writing.\nOn 26 August 1903, Schnitzler married Olga Gussmann (1882\u20131970), a 21-year-old aspiring actress and singer who came from a Jewish middle-class family. They had a son, Heinrich (1902\u20131982), born on 9 August 1902. In 1909 they had a daughter, Lili, who committed suicide in 1928. The Schnitzlers separated in 1921. Schnitzler died on 21 October 1931 in Vienna of a brain haemorrhage. In 1938, following the Anschluss, his son Heinrich went to the United States and did not return to Austria until 1959; he is the father of the Austrian musician and conservationist Michael Schnitzler, born in 1944 in Berkeley, California, who moved to Vienna with his parents in 1959.\nLiterary works.\nSchnitzler's works were often controversial, both for their frank description of sexuality (in a letter to Schnitzler Sigmund Freud confessed \"I have gained the impression that you have learned through intuition \u2013 although actually as a result of sensitive introspection \u2013 everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons\") and for their strong stand against antisemitism, represented by works such as his play \"Professor Bernhardi\" and his novel \"Der Weg ins Freie\". However, although Schnitzler was Jewish, Professor Bernhardi and Fr\u00e4ulein Else are among the few clearly identified Jewish protagonists in his work.\nSchnitzler was branded as a pornographer after the release of his play \"Reigen\", in which 10 pairs of characters are shown before and after the sexual act, leading and ending with a prostitute. The furor after this play was couched in the strongest antisemitic terms. \"Reigen\" was made into a French language film in 1950 by the German-born director Max Oph\u00fcls as \"La Ronde\". The film achieved considerable success in the English-speaking world, with the result that Schnitzler's play is better known there under its French title. Richard Oswald's film \"The Merry-Go-Round\" (1920), Roger Vadim's \"Circle of Love\" (1964) and Otto Schenk's \"Der Reigen\" (1973) also are based on the play. A more recent adaptation is the Fernando Meirelles' film \"360\".\nIn the novella \"Fr\u00e4ulein Else\" (1924) Schnitzler may be rebutting a contentious critique of the Jewish character by Otto Weininger (1903) by positioning the sexuality of the young female Jewish protagonist. The story, a first-person stream of consciousness narrative by a young aristocratic woman, reveals a moral dilemma that ends in tragedy.\nIn response to an interviewer who asked Schnitzler what he thought about the critical view that his works all seemed to treat the same subjects, he replied \"I write of love and death. What other subjects are there?\" Despite his seriousness of purpose, Schnitzler frequently approaches the bedroom farce in his plays (and had an affair with Adele Sandrock, one of his actresses). \"Professor Bernhardi\", a play about a Jewish doctor who turns away a Catholic priest in order to spare a patient the realization that she is on the point of death, is his only major dramatic work without a sexual theme.\nA member of the avant-garde group Young Vienna (\"Jung-Wien\"), Schnitzler toyed with formal as well as social conventions. With his 1900 novella \"Leutnant Gustl\", he was the first to write German fiction in stream-of-consciousness narration. The story is an unflattering portrait of its protagonist and of the army's obsessive code of formal honor. It caused Schnitzler to be stripped of his commission as a reserve officer in the medical corps, due to the novella's reputation and the rising antisemitism of the time.\nHe specialized in shorter works like novellas and one-act plays. And in his short stories like \"The Green Tie\" (\"Die gr\u00fcne Krawatte\") he showed himself to be one of the early masters of microfiction. However he also wrote two full-length novels: \"Der Weg ins Freie\" about a talented but not very motivated young composer, a brilliant description of a segment of pre-World War I Viennese society; and the artistically less satisfactory \"Therese\".\nIn addition to his plays and fiction, Schnitzler meticulously kept a diary from the age of 17 until two days before his death. The manuscript, which runs to almost 8,000 pages, is most notable for Schnitzler's casual descriptions of sexual engagements; he was often in relationships with several women at once (most of his liaisons occurred with an embroiderer named \u201cJeanette\u201d) and for a period of some years he kept a record of every orgasm. Collections of Schnitzler's letters also have been published.\nSchnitzler's works were called \"Jewish filth\" by Adolf Hitler and were banned by the Nazis in Austria and Germany. In 1933, when Joseph Goebbels organized book burnings in Berlin and other cities, Schnitzler's works were thrown into flames along with those of other Jews, including Einstein, Marx, Kafka, Freud and Stefan Zweig.\nHis novella \"Fr\u00e4ulein Else\" has been adapted a number of times, including the German silent film \"Fr\u00e4ulein Else\" (1929), starring Elisabeth Bergner, and the 1946 Argentine film \"The Naked Angel\", starring Olga Zubarry.\nIn 1973, five of Schnitzler's short stories were adapted as the BBC television series \"Vienna 1900\".\nArchive.\nThe majority of Schnitzler's archive, which consists of 40,000 pages worth of documents, was saved from the Nazis by a British man, Eric A. Blackall. Acting at the behest of Schnitzler's widow (actually his ex-wife), Olga, Blackhall arranged for the documents to be secretly transported to Cambridge University under a diplomatic seal. After the war, this created a difficult legal situation, as Schnitzler's ex-wife, Olga did not have the legal right to donate the documents. In fact, Schnitzler had bequeathed them to his son, Heinrich, who was not in Vienna at the time. During the Second World War and afterwards, Heinrich Schnitzler tried and failed to get the documents returned. Thomas Trenkler wrote in the newspaper \"Kurier\" that the acquisition of the documents by the British was not legitimate and that the documents should be handed to Schnitzler's remaining family in 2015. Schnitzler's grandsons, Michael and Peter, announced that they indeed wanted the documents handed over to them.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated jazz in the early 1940s when swing was most popular. The term \"big band\" is also used to describe a genre of music, although this was not the only style of music played by big bands.\nBig bands started as accompaniment for dancing the Lindy Hop. In contrast to the typical jazz emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements. They gave a greater role to bandleaders, arrangers, and sections of instruments rather than soloists.\nInstruments.\nBig bands generally have four sections: trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and a rhythm section of guitar, piano, double bass, drums and sometimes vibraphone or other percussion. The division in early big bands, from the 1920s to 1930s, was typically two or three trumpets, one or two trombones, three or four saxophones, and a rhythm section of four instruments. In the 1940s, Stan Kenton's band used up to five trumpets, five trombones (three tenor and two bass trombones), five saxophones (two alto saxophones, two tenor saxophones, one baritone saxophone), and a rhythm section. Duke Ellington at one time used six trumpets. While most big bands dropped the previously common jazz clarinet from their arrangements (other than the clarinet-led orchestras of Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman), many Duke Ellington songs had clarinet parts, often replacing or doubling one of the tenor saxophone parts; more rarely, Ellington would substitute baritone sax for bass clarinet, such as in \"Ase's Death\" from Swinging Suites. Boyd Raeburn drew from symphony orchestras by adding flute, French horn, strings, and timpani to his band. In the late 1930s, Shep Fields incorporated a solo accordion, temple blocks, piccolo, violins and a viola into his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra. Paul Whiteman also featured a solo accordion in his ensemble.\nJazz ensembles numbering eight (octet), nine (nonet) or ten (tentet) voices are sometimes called \"little big bands\". During the 1940s, somewhat smaller configurations of the big band emerged in the form of the \"rhythm sextet\". These ensembles typically featured three or more accordions accompanied by piano, guitar, bass, cello, percussion, and marimba with vibes and were popularized by recording artists such as Charles Magnante, Joe Biviano and John Serry.\nTwenty-first century big bands can be considerably larger than their predecessors, exceeding 20 players, with some European bands using 29 instruments and some reaching 50.\nSeating and arrangements.\nIn the most common seating for a 17-piece big band, each section is carefully set-up in a way to optimize the band's sound. For the wind players, there are 3 different types of parts: lead parts (including first trumpet, first trombone, and first alto sax), solo parts (including second or fourth trumpet, second trombone, and the first tenor sax), and section members (which include the rest of the band). The band is generally configured so lead parts are seated in the middle of their sections and solo parts are seated closest to the rhythm section. The fourth trombone part is generally played by a bass trombone. In some pieces the trumpets may double on flugelhorn or cornet, and saxophone players frequently double on other woodwinds such as flute, piccolo, clarinet, bass clarinet, or soprano saxophone.\nIt is useful to distinguish between the roles of composer, arranger and leader. The composer writes original music that will be performed by individuals or groups of various sizes, while the arranger adapts the work of composers in a creative way for a performance or recording. Arrangers frequently notate all or most of the score of a given number, usually referred to as a \"chart\". Bandleaders are typically performers who assemble musicians to form an ensemble of various sizes, select or create material for them, shape the music's dynamics, phrasing, and expression in rehearsals, and lead the group in performance often while playing alongside them. One of the first prominent big band arrangers was Ferde Grof\u00e9, who was hired by Paul Whiteman to write for his \u201csymphonic jazz orchestra\u201d. A number of bandleaders established long-term relationships with certain arrangers, such as the collaboration between leader Count Basie and arranger Neil Hefti. Some bandleaders, such as Guy Lombardo, performed works composed by others (in Lombardo's case, often by his brother Carmen), while others, such as Maria Schneider, take on all three roles. In many cases, however, the distinction between these roles can become blurred. Billy Strayhorn, for example, was a prolific composer and arranger, frequently collaborating with Duke Ellington, but rarely took on the role of bandleader, which was assumed by Ellington, who himself was a composer and arranger.\nTypical big band arrangements from the swing era were written in strophic form with the same phrase and chord structure repeated several times. Each iteration, or chorus, commonly follows twelve bar blues form or thirty-two-bar (AABA) song form. The first chorus of an arrangement introduces the melody and is followed by choruses of development. This development may take the form of improvised solos, written solo sections, and \"shout choruses\".\nAn arrangement's first chorus is sometimes preceded by an introduction, which may be as short as a few measures or may extend to a chorus of its own. Many arrangements contain an interlude, often similar in content to the introduction, inserted between some or all choruses. Other methods of embellishing the form include modulations and cadential extensions.\nSome big ensembles, like King Oliver's, played music that was half-arranged, half-improvised, often relying on head arrangements. A head arrangement is a piece of music that is formed by band members during rehearsal. They experiment, often with one player coming up with a simple musical figure leading to development within the same section and then further expansion by other sections, with the entire band then memorizing the way they are going to perform the piece, without writing it on sheet music. During the 1930s, Count Basie's band often used head arrangements, as Basie said, \"we just sort of start it off and the others fall in.\" Head arrangements were more common during the period of the 1930s because there was less turnover in personnel, giving the band members more time to rehearse.\nHistory.\nDance music.\nBefore 1910, social dance in America was dominated by steps such as the waltz and polka. As jazz migrated from its New Orleans origin to Chicago and New York City, energetic, suggestive dances traveled with it. During the next decades, ballrooms filled with people doing the jitterbug and Lindy Hop. The dance duo Vernon and Irene Castle popularized the foxtrot while accompanied by the Europe Society Orchestra led by James Reese Europe.\nOne of the first bands to accompany the new rhythms was led by a drummer, Art Hickman, in San Francisco in 1916. Hickman's arranger, Ferde Grof\u00e9, wrote arrangements in which he divided the jazz orchestra into sections that combined in various ways. This intermingling of sections became a defining characteristic of big bands. In 1919, Paul Whiteman hired Grof\u00e9 to use similar techniques for his band. Whiteman was educated in classical music, and he called his new band's music symphonic jazz. The methods of dance bands marked a step away from New Orleans jazz. With the exception of Jelly Roll Morton, who continued playing in the New Orleans style, bandleaders paid attention to the demand for dance music and created their own big bands. They incorporated elements of Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, ragtime, and vaudeville.\nDuke Ellington led his band at the Cotton Club in Harlem. Fletcher Henderson's career started when he was persuaded to audition for a job at Club Alabam in New York City, which eventually turned into a job as bandleader at the Roseland Ballroom. At these venues, which themselves gained notoriety, bandleaders and arrangers played a greater role than they had before. Hickman relied on Ferde Grof\u00e9, Whiteman on Bill Challis. Henderson and arranger Don Redman followed the template of King Oliver, but as the 1920s progressed they moved away from the New Orleans format and transformed jazz. They were assisted by a band full of talent: Coleman Hawkins on tenor saxophone, Louis Armstrong on cornet, and multi-instrumentalist Benny Carter, whose career lasted into the 1990s.\nThe swing era.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSwing music began appearing in the early 1930s and was distinguished by a more supple feel than the more literal of early jazz. Walter Page is often credited with developing the walking bass, although earlier examples exist, such as Wellman Braud on Ellington's \"Washington Wabble\" (1927).\nThis type of music flourished through the early 1930s, although there was little mass audience for it until around 1936. Up until that time, it was viewed with ridicule and sometimes looked upon as a menace. After 1935, big bands rose to prominence playing swing music and held a major role in defining swing as a distinctive style. Western swing musicians also formed popular big bands during the same period.\nA considerable range of styles evolved among the hundreds of popular bands. Many of the better known bands reflected the individuality of the bandleader, the lead arranger, and the personnel. Count Basie played a relaxed, propulsive swing, Bob Crosby (brother of Bing), more of a dixieland style, Benny Goodman a hard driving swing, and Duke Ellington's compositions were varied and sophisticated. Many bands featured strong instrumentalists whose sounds dominated, such as the clarinets of Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw, the trombone of Jack Teagarden, the trumpet of Harry James, the drums of Gene Krupa, and the vibes of Lionel Hampton.\nThe popularity of many of the major bands was amplified by star vocalists, such as Frank Sinatra and Connie Haines with Tommy Dorsey, Helen O'Connell and Bob Eberly with Jimmy Dorsey, Ella Fitzgerald with Chick Webb, Billie Holiday and Jimmy Rushing with Count Basie, Kay Starr with Charlie Barnet, Bea Wain with Larry Clinton, Dick Haymes, Kitty Kallen and Helen Forrest with Harry James, Fran Warren with Claude Thornhill, Doris Day with Les Brown, and Peggy Lee and Martha Tilton with Benny Goodman. Some bands were \"society bands\" which relied on strong ensembles, such as the bands of Guy Lombardo and Paul Whiteman.\nA distinction is often made between so-called \"hard bands\", such as those of Count Basie and Tommy Dorsey, which emphasized quick hard-driving jump tunes, and \"sweet bands\", such as the Glenn Miller Orchestra and the Shep Fields Rippling Rhythm Orchestra who specialized in less improvised tunes with more emphasis on sentimentality, featuring somewhat slower-paced, often heart-felt songs.\nBy this time the big band was such a dominant force in jazz that the older generation found they either had to adapt to it or simply retire. With no market for small-group recordings (made worse by a Depression-era industry reluctant to take risks), musicians such as Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines led their own bands, while others, like Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver, lapsed into obscurity. Even so, many of the most popular big bands of the swing era cultivated small groups within the larger ensemble: e.g. Benny Goodman developed both a trio and a quartet, Artie Shaw formed the Gramercy Five, Count Basie developed the Kansas City Six and Tommy Dorsey the Clambake Seven.\nThe major \"black\" bands of the 1930s included, apart from Ellington's, Hines's, and Calloway's, those of Jimmie Lunceford, Chick Webb, and Count Basie. The \"white\" bands of Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, Shep Fields and, later, Glenn Miller were more popular than their \"black\" counterparts from the middle of the decade. Bridging the gap to white audiences in the mid-1930s was the Casa Loma Orchestra and Benny Goodman's early band. The contrast in commercial popularity between \"black\" and \"white\" bands was striking: between 1935 and 1945 the top four \"white\" bands had 292 top ten records, of which 65 were number one hits, while the top four \"black\" bands had only 32 top ten hits, with only three reaching number one.\nWhite teenagers and young adults were the principal fans of the big bands in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They danced to recordings and the radio and attended live concerts. They were knowledgeable and often biased toward their favorite bands and songs, and sometimes worshipful of famous soloists and vocalists. Many bands toured the country in grueling one-night stands. Traveling conditions and lodging were difficult, in part due to segregation in most parts of the United States, and the personnel often had to perform having had little sleep and food. Apart from the star soloists, many musicians received low wages and would abandon the tour if bookings disappeared. Sometimes bandstands were too small, public address systems inadequate, pianos out of tune. Bandleaders dealt with these obstacles through rigid discipline (Glenn Miller) and canny psychology (Duke Ellington).\nBig bands raised morale during World War II. Many musicians served in the military and toured with USO troupes at the front, with Glenn Miller losing his life while traveling between shows. Many bands suffered from loss of personnel during the war years, and, as a result, women replaced men who had been inducted, while all-female bands began to appear. The 1942\u201344 musicians' strike worsened the situation. Vocalists began to strike out on their own. By the end of the war, swing was giving way to less danceable music, such as bebop. Many of the great swing bands broke up, as the times and tastes changed.\nMany bands from the swing era continued for decades after the death or departure of their founders and namesakes, and some are still active in the 21st century, often referred to as \"ghost bands\", a term attributed to Woody Herman, referring to orchestras that persist in the absence of their original leaders.\nModern big bands.\nAlthough big bands are identified with the swing era, they continued to exist after those decades, though the music they played was often different from swing. Bandleader Charlie Barnet's recording of \"Cherokee\" in 1942 and \"The Moose\" in 1943 have been called the beginning of the bop era. Woody Herman's first band, nicknamed the First Herd, borrowed from progressive jazz, while the Second Herd emphasized the saxophone section of three tenors and one baritone. In the 1950s, Stan Kenton referred to his band's music as \"progressive jazz\", \"modern\", and \"new music\". He created his band as a vehicle for his compositions. Kenton pushed the boundaries of big bands by combining clashing elements and by hiring arrangers whose ideas about music conflicted. This expansive eclecticism characterized much of jazz after World War II. During the 1960s and '70s, Sun Ra and his Arketstra took big bands further out. Ra's eclectic music was played by a roster of musicians from ten to thirty and was presented as theater, with costumes, dancers, and special effects.\nAs jazz was expanded during the 1950s through the 1970s, the Basie and Ellington bands were still around, as were bands led by Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton, Earl Hines, Les Brown, Clark Terry, and Doc Severinsen. Progressive bands were led by Dizzy Gillespie, Gil Evans, Carla Bley, Toshiko Akiyoshi and Lew Tabackin, Don Ellis, and Anthony Braxton.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, big band rock became popular by integrating such musical ingredients as progressive rock experimentation, jazz fusion, and the horn choirs often used in blues and soul music, with some of the most prominent groups including Chicago; Blood, Sweat and Tears; Tower of Power; and, from Canada, Lighthouse. The genre was gradually absorbed into mainstream pop rock and the jazz rock sector.\nOther bandleaders used Brazilian and Afro-Cuban music with big band instrumentation, and big bands led by arranger Gil Evans, saxophonist John Coltrane (on the album \"Ascension\" from 1965) and bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius introduced cool jazz, free jazz and jazz fusion, respectively, to the big band domain. Modern big bands can be found playing all styles of jazz music. Some large contemporary European jazz ensembles play mostly avant-garde jazz using the instrumentation of the big bands. Examples include the Vienna Art Orchestra, founded in 1977, and the Italian Instabile Orchestra, active in the 1990s.\nIn the late 1990s, there was a swing revival in the U.S. The Lindy Hop became popular again and young people took an interest in big band styles again.\nBig bands maintained a presence on American television, particularly through the late-night talk show, which has historically used big bands as house accompaniment. Typically the most prominent shows with the earliest time slots and largest audiences have bigger bands with horn sections while those in later time slots go with smaller, leaner ensembles.\nMany college and university music departments offer jazz programs and feature big band courses in improvisation, composition, arranging, and studio recording, featuring performances by 18 to 20 piece big bands.\nRadio.\nDuring the 1930s, Earl Hines and his band broadcast from the Grand Terrace in Chicago every night across America. In Kansas City and across the Southwest, an earthier, bluesier style was developed by such bandleaders as Bennie Moten and, later, by Jay McShann and Jesse Stone. By 1937, the \"sweet jazz band\" saxophonist Shep Fields was also featured over the airways on the NBC radio network in his \"Rippling Rhythm Revue,\" which also showcased a young Bob Hope as the announcer.\nBig band remotes on the major radio networks spread the music from ballrooms and clubs across the country during the 1930s and 1940s, with remote broadcasts from jazz clubs continuing into the 1950s on NBC's \"Monitor\". Radio increased the fame of Benny Goodman, the \"Pied Piper of Swing\". Others challenged him, and battle of the bands became a regular feature of theater performances.\nSimilarly, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians Orchestra also achieved widespread notoriety for nearly half a century as a result of their broadcasts on the NBC and CBS networks of the annual New Year's Eve celebrations from the Roosevelt Grill at New York's Roosevelt Hotel (1929-1959) and the Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (1959-1976) .\nGloria Parker had a radio program on which she conducted the largest all-girl orchestra led by a female. She led her Swingphony while playing marimba. Phil Spitalny, a native of Ukraine, led a 22-piece female orchestra known as Phil Spitalny and His Hour of Charm Orchestra, named for his radio show, \"The Hour of Charm\", during the 1930s and 1940s. Other female bands were led by trumpeter B. A. Rolfe, Anna Mae Winburn, and Ina Ray Hutton.\nMovies.\nBig Bands began to appear in movies in the 1930s through the 1960s, though cameos by bandleaders were often stiff and incidental to the plot. Shep Fields appeared with his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra in a playful and integrated animated performance of \"This Little Ripple Had Rhythm\" in the musical extravaganza \"The Big Broadcast of 1938\". Fictionalized biographical films of Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, and Benny Goodman were made in the 1950s.\nThe bands led by Helen Lewis, Ben Bernie, and Roger Wolfe Kahn's band were filmed by Lee de Forest in his Phonofilm sound-on-film process in 1925, in three short films which are in the Library of Congress film collection.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital of the province of North Holland. Haarlem is situated at the northern edge of the Randstad, one of the most populated metropolitan areas in Europe; it is also part of the Amsterdam metropolitan area. Haarlem had a population of in .\nHaarlem was granted city status or in 1245, although the first city walls were not built until 1270. The modern city encompasses the former municipality of Schoten as well as parts that previously belonged to Bloemendaal and Heemstede. Apart from the city, the municipality of Haarlem also includes the western part of the village of Spaarndam. Newer sections of Spaarndam lie within the neighbouring municipality of Haarlemmermeer.\nGeography.\nHaarlem is located on the river Spaarne, giving it its nickname Spaarnestad (Spaarne city). It is situated about west of Amsterdam and near the coastal dunes. Haarlem has been the historical centre of the tulip bulb-growing district for centuries and bears its other nickname Bloemenstad (flower city) for this reason.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHaarlem has a rich history dating back to pre-medieval times, as it lies on a thin strip of land above sea level known as the strandwal (beach ridge), which connects Leiden to Alkmaar. The people on this narrow strip of land struggled against the waters of the North Sea from the west, and the waters of the IJ and the Haarlem Lake from the east. Haarlem became wealthy with toll revenues that it collected from ships and travellers moving on this busy north\u2013south route. \nAs shipping became increasingly important economically, the city of Amsterdam became the main Dutch city of North Holland during the Dutch Golden Age. The town of Halfweg became a suburb, and Haarlem became a quiet bedroom community, and for this reason Haarlem still has many of its central medieval buildings intact. Many of them are now on the Dutch Heritage register known as Rijksmonuments. The gives an overview of these per neighbourhood, with the majority in the old city centre.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe oldest mention of Haarlem dates from the 10th century. The name probably comes from \"Haarlo-heim\". This name is composed of three elements: \"haar\", \"lo\" and \"heim\". In Old Dutch toponyms \"lo\" always refers to 'forest' and \"heim\" (\"heem\", \"em\" or \"um\") to 'home' or 'house'. \"Haar\", however, has several meanings, one of them corresponding with the location of Haarlem on a sand dune: 'elevated place'. The name Haarlem or Haarloheim would therefore mean 'home on a forested dune'.\nThere was a stream called \"De Beek\", dug from the peat grounds west of the river Spaarne as a drainage canal. Over the centuries the Beek was turned into an underground canal, as the city grew larger and the space was needed for construction. Over time it began to silt up and in the 19th century it was filled in. The village had a good location: by the river Spaarne, and by a major road going south to north. By the 12th century it was a fortified town, and Haarlem became the residence of the Counts of Holland.\nIn 1219 the knights of Haarlem were laurelled by Count Willem I, because they had conquered the Egyptian port of Damietta (or Damiate in Dutch, present-day Dimyat) in the fifth crusade. Haarlem received the right to bear the Count's sword and cross in its coat of arms. On 23 November 1245 Count Willem II granted Haarlem city rights. This implied a number of privileges, among which the right for the sheriff and magistrates to administer justice, instead of the Count. This allowed for a quicker and more efficient judiciary system, more suited to the needs of the growing city.\nAfter a siege from the surrounding area of Kennemerland in 1270 a defensive wall was built around the city. Most likely this was an earthen wall with wooden gates. Originally the city started out between Spaarne, Oudegracht, Ridderstraat, Bakenessergracht and Nassaustraat. In the 14th century the city expanded, and the Burgwalbuurt, Bakenes and the area around the Oudegracht became part of the city. The old defenses proved not to be sufficiently strong for the expanded city, and at the end of the 14th century a 16\u00bd-metre high wall was built, complete with a 15-metre wide canal circling the city. In 1304 the Flemish threatened the city, but they were defeated by Witte van Haemstede at Manpad.\nAll the city's buildings were made of wood, and fire was a great risk. In 1328 nearly the whole city burnt down. The Sint-Bavokerk was severely damaged, and rebuilding it would take more than 150 years. Again on 12 June 1347 there was a fire in the city. A third large fire, in 1351, destroyed many buildings including the Count's castle and the city hall. The Count did not need a castle in Haarlem because his castle in The Hague (Den Haag) had taken over all functions. \nThe count donated the ground to the city and later a new city hall was built there. The shape of the old city was square\u2014this was inspired by the shape of ancient Jerusalem. After every fire the city was rebuilt quickly, an indication of the wealth of the city in those years. The Black Death came to the city in 1381. According to an estimate by a priest from Leiden the disease killed 5,000 people, about half the population at that time.\nIn the 14th century, Haarlem was a major city. It was the second largest city in historical Holland after Dordrecht and before Delft, Leiden, Amsterdam, Gouda and Rotterdam. In 1429 the city gained the right to collect tolls, including ships passing the city on the Spaarne river. At the end of the Middle Ages, Haarlem was a flourishing city with a large textile industry, shipyards and beer breweries. Around 1428, the city was put under siege by the army of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut. Haarlem had taken side with the Cods in the Hook and Cod wars and thus against Jacoba of Bavaria. The entire Haarlemmerhout wood was burnt down by the enemy.\nSpanish siege.\nWhen the city of Brielle was conquered by the Geuzen revolutionary army, the municipality of Haarlem started supporting the Geuzen. King Philip II of Spain was not pleased, and sent an army north under the command of Don Fadrique (Don Frederick in Dutch), son of Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. On 17 November 1572 all citizens of the city of Zutphen were killed by the Spanish army, and on 1 December the city of Naarden suffered the same fate.\nOn 11 December 1572 the Spanish army besieged Haarlem; the city's defenses were commanded by city-governor Wigbolt Ripperda. Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer, a powerful widow, helped defend the city together with some three hundred other women.\nDuring the first two months of the siege, the situation was in balance. The Spanish army was digging tunnels to reach the city walls and blow them up; the defenders dug in turn and undermined the Spaniards' tunnels. The situation worsened on 29 March 1573: the Amsterdam army, faithful to the Spanish king, controlled Haarlemmermeer lake, effectively blocking Haarlem from the outside world. An attempt by the Prince of Orange to destroy the Spanish navy on the Haarlemmermeer had failed. Hunger in the city grew, and the situation became so tense that on 27 May many (Spanish-loyal) prisoners were taken from the prison and murdered; the Spaniards had previously gibbeted their own prisoners of war.\nIn the beginning of July the Prince of Orange assembled an army of 5,000 soldiers near Leiden to free Haarlem. However, he was prevented from accompanying them in person and the Spanish forces trapped them at the Manpad where they were decisively defeated. On 13 July 1573, after seven months of siege, the city surrendered. Many defenders were slaughtered; some were drowned in the Spaarne river. Governor Ripperda and his lieutenant were beheaded. The citizens were allowed to buy freedom for themselves and the city for 240,000 guilders and the city was required to host a Spanish garrison. Don Fadrique thanked God for his victory in the Sint-Bavo Church. However, the terms of the treaty were not kept, with the Spanish soldiery plundering the townspeople's property.\nDespite Haarlem's ultimate fall, the fact that the Haarlemers had been able to stand for seven months against the whole Spanish array inspired the rest of Holland to resist the invaders, and their prolonged resistance allowed the Prince of Orange to prepare and arm the rest of the country for war. Some 12,000 of the Spanish army had fallen during the siege.\nGreat fire.\nThe city suffered a large fire in the night from 22 to 23 October 1576. The fire started in brewery het Ankertje, near the weighhouse at the Spaarne, which was used by mercenaries as a guarding place. When they were warming themselves at a fire it got out of control. The fire was spotted by farmers, who sailed their ships on the river. However, the soldiers turned down all help, saying that they would put out the fire themselves. \nThis failed, and the fire destroyed almost 500 buildings, among them St-Gangolf's church and St-Elisabeth's hospital. Most of the mercenaries were later arrested, and one of them was hanged on the Grote Markt in front of a large audience. Maps from that era clearly show the damage done by the fire: a wide strip through the city was destroyed. The combined result of the siege and the fire was that about a third of the city was destroyed.\nGolden age.\nThe fire and the long siege had taken their toll on the city. The Spanish left in 1577 and under the Agreement of Veere, Protestants and Catholics were given equal rights, though in government the Protestants clearly had the upper hand and Catholic possessions once seized were never returned. To restore the economy and attract workers for the brewing and bleaching businesses (Haarlem was known for these, thanks to the clean water from the dunes), the Haarlem council decided to promote the pursuit of arts and history, showing tolerance for diversity among religious beliefs. \nThis attracted a large influx of Flemish and French immigrants (Catholics and Huguenots alike) who were fleeing the Spanish occupation of their own cities. Expansion plans soon replaced plans of rebuilding the destroyed city walls. Just like the rest of the country, the Golden Age in the United Provinces had started.\nLinen and silk.\nThe new citizens had a lot of expertise in linen and silk manufacture and trading, and the city's population grew from 18,000 in 1573 to around 40,000 in 1622. At one point, in 1621, over 50% of the population was Flemish-born. Haarlem's linen became notable and the city flourished. Today an impression of some of those original textile tradesmen can be had from the Book of Trades document created by Jan Luyken and his son.\nInfrastructure.\nIn 1632 a tow canal between Haarlem and Amsterdam, the Haarlemmertrekvaart was opened, the first tow canal in the country. The empty areas in the city that were a result of the fire of 1576 were filled with new houses and buildings. Even outside the city wall buildings were constructed\u2014in 1643 about 400 houses were counted outside the wall. \nHaving buildings outside the city walls was not a desirable situation to the city administration. Not only because these buildings would be vulnerable in case of an attack on the city, but there was also less control over taxes and city regulations outside the walls. Therefore, a major project was initiated in 1671: expanding the city northwards. \nTwo new canals were dug, and a new defensive wall was constructed (the current Staten en Prinsenbolwerk). Two old city gates, the Janspoort and Kruispoort, were demolished. The idea that a city had to be square-shaped was abandoned.\nCultural life.\nAfter the fall of Antwerp, many artists and craftsmen migrated to Haarlem and received commissions from the Haarlem council to decorate the city hall. The paintings commissioned were meant to show Haarlem's glorious history as well as Haarlem's glorious products. Haarlem's cultural life prospered, with painters like Frans Hals and Jacob van Ruisdael, the architect Lieven de Key and Jan Steen who made many paintings in Haarlem. \nThe Haarlem councilmen became quite creative in their propaganda promoting their city. On the Grote Markt, the central market square, there's a statue of Laurens Janszoon Coster who is allegedly the inventor of the printing press. This is the second and larger statue to him on the square. The original stands behind the city hall in the little garden known as the Hortus (where today the Stedelijk Gymnasium school is located). \nMost scholars agree that the scarce evidence seems to point to Johann Gutenberg as the first European inventor of the printing press, but Haarlem children were taught about \"Lau\", as he is known, well into the 20th century. This legend served the printers of Haarlem well, however, and it is probably for that reason the most notable Dutch history books from the Dutch Golden Age period were published in Haarlem; by Hadrianus Junius (Batavia), Dirck Volkertszoon Coornhert (Works), Karel van Mander (Schilderboeck), Samuel Ampzing (Description and Ode to Haarlem), Petrus Scriverius (Batavia Illustrata), and Pieter Christiaenszoon Bor (Origin of the Dutch wars).\nBeer brewing.\nBeer brewing was a very important industry in Haarlem. Until the 16th century, the water for the beer was taken from the canals in the city. These canals were connected to seawater, via the Spaarne and the IJ. However, the canal water was getting more and more polluted and less suitable for brewing beer. A place south-west of the city was then used to take fresh water in. \nHowever, the quality of that water was not good enough either. From the 17th century, a canal (Santvaert) was used to transport water from the dunes to the city. The water was transported in barrels on ships. The location where the water was taken is called the Brouwerskolkje, and the canal to there still exists, and is now called the Brewers' Canal (Brouwersvaart).\nHaarlem was a major beer producer in the Netherlands. The majority of the beer it produced was consumed in North Holland. During the Spanish siege, there were about 50 breweries in the city. In 1620, the city had about one hundred breweries.\nThere was another epidemic of the Black Death in 1657, which took a heavy toll in the six months it ravaged the city. From the end of the 17th century, the economy in the city worsened for a long time. In 1752, only seven breweries remained, and by 1820 no breweries were registered in the city. In the 1990s, the Stichting Haarlems Biergenootschap revived some old recipes under the Jopen beer brand that is marketed as a \"Haarlem bier.\" In 2010, Jopen opened a brewery in a former church in central Haarlem called the Jopenkerk. In 2012, Haarlem gained another local brewery with http:// in the Zijlstraat, which specializes in craft beer.\nTulip centre.\nSince the 1630s, Haarlem has been a major trading centre for tulips, and it was at the epicentre during tulip mania, when outrageous prices were paid for tulip bulbs. From the opening of the Leiden-Haarlem canal Leidsevaart in 1656, it became popular to travel from Rotterdam to Amsterdam by passenger boat rather than by coach. The canals were dug for passenger service only, and were comfortable though slow. The towpath led these passengers through the bulb fields south of Haarlem. \nHaarlem was an important stopover for passengers from the last half of the 17th century and through the 18th century until the building of the first rail tracks along the routes of former passenger canal systems. As Haarlem slowly expanded southwards, so did the bulb fields. Today, rail passengers between Rotterdam and Amsterdam in spring can see blooming bulb fields on the route between Leiden and Haarlem.\n18th century.\nAs the centre of trade gravitated towards Amsterdam, Haarlem declined in the 18th century. The Golden Age had created a large upper middle class of merchants and well-to-do small business owners. Taking advantage of the reliability of the trekschuit connection between Amsterdam and Haarlem, many people had a business address in Amsterdam and a weekend or summer home in Haarlem. \nHaarlem became more and more a bedroom community as the increasingly dense population of Amsterdam caused the canals to smell in the summer. Many well-to-do gentlemen moved their families to summer homes in the Spring and commuted between addresses. Popular places for summer homes were along the Spaarne in southern Haarlem. Pieter Teyler van der Hulst and Henry Hope built summer homes there, as well as many Amsterdam merchants and councilmen. Today, boat travel along the Spaarne is still possible and has become a popular form of tourism in the summer. In the 18th century, Haarlem became the seat of a suffragan diocese of the Old Catholic Church of Utrecht.\nFrench rule.\nAt the end of the 18th century, a number of anti-Orange commissions were founded. On 18 January 1795 the \"Staatse\" army was defeated near Woerden. During the night preceding 19 January, the same night that stadtholder William V of Orange fled the country, the various commissions gathered and implemented a revolution. The commissions changed the city's administrators in a bloodless revolution, and the next morning the city was \"liberated\" of the tyranny of the House of Orange. The revolution was peaceful, and the Orange-loyal people were not harmed. The Batavian Republic was then proclaimed.\nThe French army entered the liberated city two days later, on 20 January. An army of 1,500 soldiers was provided with food and clothing by the citizens. The new national government was strongly centralised, and the role and influence of the cities was reduced. The Batavian Republic signed a mutual defense pact with France and was thus automatically at war with England. The strong English presence at sea severely reduced trading opportunities, and the Dutch economy suffered accordingly.\n19th century.\nThe textile industry, which had always been an important pillar of Haarlem's economy, was suffering at the beginning of the 19th century. Strong international competition and revolutionary new production methods based on steam engines already in use in England dealt a striking blow to Haarlem's industry. In 1815, the city's population was about 17,000 people, many of whom were poor. The foundation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in that year gave hope to many who believed that under a new government, the economy would improve and that export-oriented economic activities, such as the textile industry, would recover.\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, the defense walls had lost their function, and architect Zocher Jr. planned a park on the location of the former defense line. The city walls and gates were demolished, and the bricks were reused for construction of factories and workers' homes . Haarlem became the provincial capital of North Holland province in the early 19th century. \nIn the mid-19th century, the city's economy slowly started to improve. New factories opened, and a number of large industrial companies were founded in Haarlem by Thomas Wilson, Guillaume Jean Poelman, J.B.T. Pr\u00e9vinaire, J.J. Beijnes, Hendrik Figee, Gerardus Johannes Droste, and G.P.J. Beccari.\nCotton mills.\nThe Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (NHM or Dutch Trade Company) was founded by King Willem I to create employment opportunities. As one of the cities in the western part of the Netherlands with the worst economic situation, three cotton mills were created in Haarlem under the NHM-program in the 1830s. These were run by experts from the Southern Netherlands, whom the NHM considered better at mechanical weaving through the local expertise of Lieven Bauwens. \nThe contract winners were Thomas Wilson, whose factory was situated north of what is today the Wilsonplein, Guillaume Jean Poelman, who was in business with his nephew Charles Vervaecke from Ghent and had a factory on what today is the Phoenixstraat, and Jean Baptiste Theodore Pr\u00e9vinaire, who had a factory on the Garenkokerskade and whose son Marie Prosper Theodore Pr\u00e9vinaire created the Haarlemsche Katoenmaatschappij in 1875.\nThese cotton factories produced goods for export, and because the Dutch government levied heavy taxes on foreign cotton producers this was a profitable business for the NHM-factories, especially for export to the Dutch East Indies. The programme started in the 1830s, and was initially successful. However, after 1839 when Belgium split away from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the protectionist measures for the Dutch East Indian market were removed, and the business began to flounder. When the American Civil War reduced the import of raw cotton significantly after 1863, the business went sour. Only Pr\u00e9vinaire was able to survive through specialisation with his \"Turkish Red\" dye. The Pr\u00e9vinaire \"toile Adrinople\" was popular. Pr\u00e9vinaire's son went on to create the Haarlemsche Katoenmaatschappij, which made a kind of imitation batik cloth called \"La Javanaise\" that became popular in Belgian Congo.\nTrain and tram.\nIn England in 1804, Richard Trevithick designed the first locomotive. The government of the Netherlands was relatively slow to catch up, even though the king feared competition from newly established Belgium if it would construct a railway between Antwerp and other cities. The Dutch parliament balked at the high level of investment needed, but a group of private investors started the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij on 1 June 1836. \nIt took three years to build the first track on the railway, between Haarlem and Amsterdam along the old tow canal called the Haarlemmertrekvaart. The ground there was wet and muddy. On 20 September 1839, the first train service in the Netherlands started. The train had a speed of about . The train service gave the Beijnes company, and indirectly the whole economy of Haarlem, a strong boost, and the effects of this can be seen in the Haarlem railway station, now a rijksmonument. Instead of more than two hours, Amsterdam was now only 30 minutes away. \nThe old passenger service by trekschuit along the Haarlemmertrekvaart was quickly taken out of service in favour of the train service, which was quicker and more reliable. In 1878, a Beijnes-made horse tram started servicing passengers from the railway station to the Haarlemmerhout woodland park, and in 1894, the Eerste Nederlandsche Electrische Tram Maatschappij (ENET) was founded with cars built by Beijnes and became the first Dutch electric tram, which ran in Haarlem from 1899 onwards.\nWater management.\nThough the old trekvaart was closed for water traffic after railway development, it is still possible to travel by boat from Amsterdam to Haarlem, via the ringvaart or the North Sea Canal. Pleasure boating in the summer has become an important Haarlem tourist attraction, though it is not possible to travel all of the original canals as in Amsterdam. The creation of new land in the Haarlemmermeer polder from 1852 onwards meant that the city could no longer refresh the water in its canals from the Spaarne river. The increase in industry worsened water quality. In 1859, the Oude Gracht canal stank so badly in the summer that it not only forced visitors away, but posed a public health threat due to cholera outbreaks. It was filled in to create a new street called the Gedempte Oude Gracht. The periodic cholera outbreaks had not been new, but they had been increasing. In 1591, the city fathers had ordered excavation to build the Verwulft, a wide bridge over the Oude Gracht connecting the north and south portions of the Grote Houtstraat. Such \"overclosures\" can still be seen in other Dutch cities, such as the Nieuwmarkt in Amsterdam.\nExpanding borders.\nFrom 1879, the population of the city almost doubled in thirty years, from 36,976 to 69,410 in 1909. Not only did the population grow, but the city was expanding rapidly, too. The Leidsebuurt district was incorporated into Haarlem in the 1880s. A small part of the (now defunct) municipality of Schoten was incorporated in 1884 because the council of Haarlem wanted to have the hospital (Het Dolhuys) inside the municipal borders. This hospital was situated at \"het bolwerk\" on Schoten's territory.\nEarly 20th century.\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, the city expanded north. As early as 1905, an official plan was presented by the Haarlem municipality for expansion. However, the surrounding municipalities did not agree, and it would take 25 years to come to an agreement. On 1 May 1927, the municipality of Schoten became part of Haarlem, as well as part of Spaarndam, Bloemendaal and Heemstede. The population increased at once with 31,184 citizens.\nIn 1908, a renewed railway station was opened. The tracks were elevated, so traffic in the city was no longer hampered by railway crossings. In 1911, Anthony Fokker showed his plane de Spin to the audience in Haarlem by flying around the Sint-Bavokerk on Queen's Day.\nLater the expansion of the city went southwards (Schalkwijk) and eastwards (Waarderpolder). In 1932, Vroom &amp; Dreesmann, a Dutch retailer built a department store at Verwulft. Many buildings were demolished, except one small chemist's shop on the corner, \"Van der Pigge\", who refused to be bought out and which is now encapsulated by the V&amp;D building. They are therefore also called \"David and Goliath\" by locals.\nHaarlem in World War II.\nFrom 17 to 21 September 1944, parts of Haarlem-Noord (north of the Jan Gijzenvaart) were evacuated by the Germans to make way for a defensive line. The stadium of HFC Haarlem, the football club, was demolished. Hundreds of people had to leave their homes and were forced to stay with other citizens.\nFrom 22 September 1944 to the end of the war, there was gas available only two hours per day. Electricity stopped on 9 October. The German occupiers built a thick, black wall through the Haarlemmerhout (in the south of the city), as well as at the Jan Gijzenvaart in the evacuated area. The wall was called Mauer-muur and was meant to help defend the city.\nIn February 1944, the family of Corrie ten Boom was arrested by the Nazis; they had been hiding Jews and Dutch resistance workers from the German occupier throughout the war.\nDuring World War II, the Dutch heroine Hannie Schaft, who worked for a Dutch resistance group, was captured and executed by the German occupation just before the end of the war in 1945. Despite her efforts and those of her colleagues and private families such as the Ten Booms, most Haarlem Jews were deported, the Haarlem Synagogue was demolished, and the Jewish hospital was annexed by the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis. Several Haarlem families, whether they were politically active in the NSB or not, suffered from random attacks, as the Haarlem writer Harry Mulisch described in his book De Aanslag. Haarlemmers survived during the Hunger Winter by eating tulip bulbs stored in sheds in the sandy fields around the city.\nPost-World War II.\nAfter the war, much of the large industry left the city, such as the banknote printing firm of Joh. Ensched\u00e9. The centre of industry and shipping shifted towards Amsterdam. Though the population had been decimated by starvation, a new wave of immigrants came to the city from the Dutch former colonies in Indonesia. This brought some government funding for building projects. In 1963, a large number of houses was built in Schalkwijk.\nReligion.\nHaarlem has had a Christian parish church since the 9th century. This first church was a \"daughter church\" of Velsen, which itself was founded in 695 by St. Willibrord. It was a wooden church at the site of the current Grote Kerk on the Grote Markt (central market square). Haarlem was granted its first known indulgence by Clement V in 1309, during the Avignon Papacy. In 1245 Haarlem received city rights as a result of population growth and the church was expanded. Later, after the fires of 1347 and 1351, Haarlem was again granted a Portiuncula indulgence in 1397 for funding to rebuild the church. This indulgence would be used again and again over the centuries to fund expansion and restoration activities.\nHaving been granted papal rights from Avignon was perhaps the reason that the ties to Rome were never very strong in Haarlem, since the building most commonly called the Cathedral in the centre of town only held a cathedra for 19 years, from 1559 to 1578. This Grote Kerk or Sint-Bavokerk was originally a parish church devoted to the Virgin Mary, but was later named after the patron saint of Haarlem, Saint Bavo, who descended from Heaven regularly to free the Haarlemmers from invaders, most recently when the Kennemers and West-Friesians attacked in 1274. This is allegedly how the Haarlem war cry \"Sint Bavo voor Haarlem\" originated, which was used during the siege against the Spaniards in 1572 that eventually resulted in an underground cathedra called the Sint Josephstatie, on the Goudsmitsplein.\nThe Roman Catholic parish of Haarlem became a Diocese in 1559 (Dioecesis Harlemensis) and the first bishop of Haarlem was Nicolaas van Nieuwland (born in 1510). He accepted the position on 6 November 1561. In 1569 he was advised to resign by the Duke of Alva, because of his reputation for drinking (Dronken Klaasje). He had a good reason to drown his sorrows, because he feared the Catholic Spanish invaders as much as the native Dutch reformers. The Grote Kerk was initially spared from iconoclasm, because the city's mayor ordered the closing of the church for several months in 1566. That gave the various groups in Haarlem the time to quietly remove many of the treasures from the church and stash them safely in underground chapels. All symbols and statues linked to the Roman Catholic faith were removed from the cathedral. Since many groups already had their own chapels in the Grote Kerk, this was conducted in an orderly way. However, after the siege of Haarlem was lost, the Spanish army restored Roman Catholic iconography. The guilds had to restore their old altars, at great expense. Since Haarlem was quite poor after the siege, this led to many of the chapels and other Catholic churches being abandoned and used for other purposes. The Bakenesserkerk, where 1500 soldiers were held before being killed by the Spanish after their victory, was used to store turf for fifty years.\nVan Nieuwland was succeeded by Godfried van Mierlo, who was the last bishop in communion with Rome Haarlem would know for 300 years. In 1578 after the Spanish were defeated, the church was attacked on Sacrament day (29 May), this time by soldiers of the Prince of Orange. One of the priests was killed, and many objects in the church were destroyed. This event, called the Haarlemse Noon, forced the bishop to flee the city. Many treasures were still safe 500 yards away in the underground Catholic church. The city council confiscated the Sint Bavo Kerk and all of its daughter churches, and later converted them along the tenets of the Evangelical Reformed Church. The new (and current) name became Grote Kerk. Old Catholics and the Lutherans, though unofficially tolerated, went underground. Both Protestants and Catholics alike felt that when all political unrest had subsided, the Catholics could regain control of \"their\" church. However, the Dutch Protestants had also removed all Catholics from local government and feared that they would have to pay damages to the Catholics if they were allowed their own churches again. \nIn the 19th century, all over the Netherlands, new Catholic churches were subsidised, called Waterboard churches, for their similarity to Waterboard pump stations (they were designed by the same architect in Neo-classical style), and in Haarlem they built the St. Joseph kerk in the Jansstraat in 1841. It was not until 1853 that a new Roman Catholic bishop was installed in the St. Joseph kerk. As this church grew, a new cathedral, again called the Cathedral of Saint Bavo, was built at the Leidsevaart (canal to Leiden) in 1898. The Bishop of Haarlem has a formal residence on the Nieuwe Gracht canal.\nThere is also an Old Catholic bishop of Haarlem.\nThere is still a small Jewish community with their own synagogue.\nThe Frans Hals Museum, which was the Haarlem municipal museum, has still in its collection today many pieces confiscated from the churches during the Haarlemse Noon.\nDemographics.\nAs of 2020, Haarlem had a total population of 162,090 people.\nCulture and entertainment.\nMuseums.\nThere are several museums in Haarlem. The Teylers Museum lies on the Spaarne river, and it is the oldest museum of the Netherlands. Its main subjects are art, science, and natural history, and it owns a number of works by Michelangelo and Rembrandt. Another museum is the Frans Hals Museum of fine arts, with its main location housing Dutch master paintings, and its exhibition halls on the housing a gallery for modern art called De Hallen. Also on the Grote Markt, in the cellar of the Vleeshal is the Archeologisch Museum Haarlem, while across the square on Saturdays, the Hoofdwacht building is open with exhibitions on Haarlem history.\nOther museums include the Barrel Organ Museum Haarlem, Museum van de Geest (a museum of psychiatry), the Ten Boom Museum (a hiding place for Jews in World War II) and the Historisch Museum Haarlem, across from the Frans Hals Museum.\nTheater, film and cultural centres.\nThe city contains several theatres, a cinema and other cultural attractions. The Philharmonie (Phil) is a concert hall in the centre of the city, near the Grote Markt. Next to it is the Schuur theatre, which also has some movie theatres (previously referred to as the Filmschuur). The Stadsschouwburg on the Wilsonsplein reopened in 2008 after a major renovation and can seat 698.\nThe Cinema Palace was established in 1915 and was one of the older cinemas in the Netherlands. It closed definitively on 15 January 2011. The Brinkmann cinema, located on the Grote Markt, closed on 1 February 2012. There are currently two cinemas in Haarlem, in addition to Schuur. Path\u00e9 Haarlem is located in the Raaks shopping mall and opened on 5 July 2011. Filmkoepel is located in the former Koepelgevangenis prison and opened in 2022.\nThe Patronaat is a pop music hall, one of the larger of its kind in the Netherlands. It is a popular night spot in the city.\nFestivals.\nEvery year in April, the bloemencorso (flower parade) takes place. Floats decorated with flowers drive from Noordwijk to Haarlem, where they are exhibited for one day. In the same month there is also a funfair organised on the Grote Markt and the Zaanenlaan in Haarlem-Noord. Other festivals are held on the Grote Markt as well, in particular the annual Haarlem Jazz &amp; More (formerly known as Haarlem Jazzstad), a music festival; Haarlem Culinair, a culinary event; and the biannual Haarlemse Stripdagen (Haarlem comic days).\nBevrijdingspop is a music festival to celebrate the Dutch liberation from the Nazis after World War II. It is held every year on 5 May, the day that the Netherlands were liberated in 1945, at the Haarlemmerhout. At the same location, the Haarlemmerhoutfestival is held every year, which is a music and theatre festival.\nSports.\nHaarlem has many different sport clubs practicing a great diversity of sports.\nThere are several amateur association football clubs. Haarlem also had a professional football club, HFC Haarlem, which went bankrupt in January 2010. Another Haarlem based football club still in existence is Koninklijke HFC (Royal Haarlemsche Football Club). It was founded by Pim Mulier in 1879 as the first football club in the Netherlands, making it the oldest club in Dutch history.\nTennis club HLTC Haarlem, founded in 1884, and judo association Kenamju, founded in 1948, are also the oldest Dutch clubs in their sports. RFC Haarlem is a rugby club.\nHaarlem is known for hosting several international sports tournaments as well: the Haarlemse Honkbalweek (Haarlem Baseball Week), a baseball event held every two years at the Pim Mulier Stadium (named after Pim Mulier), and the Haarlem Basketball Classic, a basketball event. Haarlem also hosted the 2014 Women's Softball World Championship.\nThe first international bandy match was played between Haarlem and Bury Fen Bandy Club in 1891. Some rink bandy exists today.\nCultural references.\nBuildings and locations.\nSince the 18th century, Haarlem has historically had more museums per inhabitant than any other city of the Netherlands. It also has the highest number of defunct museums per inhabitant.\nTransport.\nHaarlem is served by two railway stations of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways). From Haarlem railway station there are 8 trains an hour to Amsterdam, with a journey time of 15 to 20 minutes, 6 trains an hour to Leiden and The Hague (two stations), and 2 trains an hour to Zandvoort aan Zee. On the east of Haarlem, there is Haarlem Spaarnwoude, which has 4 trains per hour to Amsterdam.\nThe city is also served by several bus lines of Connexxion. These buses traverse a large region around Haarlem, including Amsterdam. There is a special bus rapid transit too, called the Zuidtangent, which is operated by Connexxion. This bus goes from Haarlem to Amsterdam South East via Schiphol Airport.\nLocal government.\nThe municipal council of Haarlem consists of 39 seats. At the 2022 municipal elections the council divided as follows:\nPolice and law enforcement.\nThe police services in Haarlem are provided by the Kennemerland police corps. The city of Haarlem also employs uniformed municipal enforcement officers, their duties consist of parking, sanitation, traffic, permit enforcement, and patrols throughout the city.\nMiscellaneous.\nLocal beer.\nBeer brewing has been a very important industry for Haarlem going back to the 15th century, when there were no fewer than 100 breweries in the city. When the town's 750th anniversary was celebrated in 1995 a group of enthusiasts re-created an original Haarlem beer and brewed it again. The beer is called Jopenbier, or Jopen for short, named after an old type of beer barrel.\nHarlem, Manhattan.\nIn 1658, Peter Stuyvesant, the Director-General of the Dutch colony of Nieuw Nederland (New Netherland), founded the settlement of Nieuw Haarlem in the northern part of Manhattan Island as an outpost of Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam) at the southern tip of the island. After the English capture of New Netherland in 1664, the new English colonial administration renamed both the colony and its principal city \"New York,\" but left the name of Haarlem more or less unchanged. The spelling changed to Harlem in keeping with contemporary English usage, and the district grew (as part of the borough of Manhattan) into the vibrant centre of African American culture in New York City and the United States generally by the 20th century.\nLautje, statue on the Grote Markt.\nOn the main square, the Grote Markt, stands a statue of Laurens Janszoon Coster, nicknamed 'Lautje' by locals. Laurens Janszoon Coster is credited with being the inventor of a printing press using movable type, since he's said to have invented it simultaneously with Johannes Gutenberg, but only some people believe this. In the past, the statue was moved a couple of times. It once stood at the other side of the square and even perched at the Riviervismarkt, near the Philharmonie.\nUniversities.\nThe group of universities SRH opened a campus in Haarlem in 2022 on the site of the former Cupola prison.\nMeat advertisement ban.\nIn September 2022, the Haarlem municipal council adopted an ordinance prohibiting advertisements for meat and fossil fuels in public spaces because of their climate impact. The ordinance took effect in 2024, making Haarlem the first city in the world to ban such advertisements.\nTwin cities.\nHaarlem is twinned with:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63280", "revid": "18779361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63280", "title": "Boris Spassky", "text": "Russian chess grandmaster (1937\u20132025)\nBoris Vasilyevich Spassky (; January 30, 1937 \u2013\u00a0February 27, 2025) was a Soviet chess grandmaster who was the tenth World Chess Champion, holding the title from 1969 to 1972. Spassky played three world championship matches: he lost to Tigran Petrosian in 1966; defeated Petrosian in 1969 to become world champion; then lost to Bobby Fischer in a famous match in 1972.\nSpassky won the Soviet Chess Championship twice outright (1961, 1973), and twice lost in playoffs (1956, 1963), after tying for first place during the event proper. He was a World Chess Championship candidate on seven occasions (1956, 1965, 1968, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1985). In addition to his Candidates wins in 1965 and 1968, Spassky reached the semi-final stage in 1974 and the final stage in 1977.\nSpassky immigrated to France in 1976 and became a French citizen in 1978. He continued to compete in tournaments, but was no longer a major contender for the world title. Spassky lost an unofficial rematch against Fischer in 1992. In 2012, he left France and returned to Russia.\nEarly life.\nBoris Vasilyevich Spassky was born in Leningrad, into a Russian family, on January 30, 1937. His father, Vasili Vladimirovich Spassky, served in the military. He came from the family of Vladimir Alexandrovich Spassky, a prominent Russian Orthodox priest of the Kursk Governorate, later a protoiereus of the Russian Church (since 1916), as well as a State Duma deputy (1912\u20131917) and an active member of the Union of the Russian People. Boris's mother, Ekaterina Petrovna Spasskaya (\"n\u00e9e\" Petrova), was a school teacher. She was born in the Ryadnevo village of the Gdov district (now Pskov Oblast) as an illegitimate daughter of Daria Ivanovna Ivanova (from a local peasant family) and Andrei Kupriyanovich Kupriyanov, a landlord who owned houses in Saint Petersburg and Pskov. After some time Daria Ivanovna fled to St. Petersburg, leaving her daughter with Petr Vasiliev, a relative of hers, who raised Ekaterina under the surname of Petrova. She joined her mother later on.\nSpassky learned to play chess at the age of five on a train evacuating from Leningrad during the siege of Leningrad in World War II. During the war, he was sent to an orphanage in Siberia. He first drew wide attention in 1947 at age 10, when he defeated Soviet champion Mikhail Botvinnik in a simultaneous exhibition in Leningrad. Spassky's early coach was Vladimir Zak, a respected master and trainer. During his youth, from the age of 10, Spassky often worked on chess for several hours a day with master-level coaches. He set records as the youngest Soviet player to achieve first category rank (age 10), candidate master rank (age 11), and Soviet Master rank (age 15). In 1952, at 15, Spassky scored 50 percent in the Soviet Championship semi-final at Riga, and placed second in the Leningrad Championship that same year, for which he was highly praised by Botvinnik.\nCareer.\nAs a statistic encompassing all of the games of his career, Spassky's most-played openings with both the White and Black pieces were the Sicilian Defence and the Ruy Lopez.\nSpassky beat six undisputed World Champions at least twice (not necessarily while they were reigning): Vasily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Bobby Fischer, Anatoly Karpov, and Garry Kasparov.\nYoung grandmaster.\nSpassky made his international debut in 1953, aged sixteen, in Bucharest, Romania, finishing tied for fourth place with L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 on 12/19, an event won by his trainer, Alexander Tolush. At Bucharest he defeated Vasily Smyslov, who challenged for the World Championship the following year. In the same year, Spassky was awarded the title of International Master by FIDE at its congress in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. In his first attempt at the Soviet Championship final, the 22nd in the series, held in Moscow 1955, Spassky tied for third place with 11\u00bd/19, after Smyslov and Efim Geller, which was sufficient to qualify him for the Gothenburg Interzonal later that year.\nThe same year, he won the World Junior Chess Championship held at Antwerp, Belgium, scoring 6/7 to qualify for the final, then 8/9 in the final to win by a full point over Edmar Mednis. Spassky competed for the Lokomotiv Voluntary Sports Society.\nBy sharing seventh place with 11/20 at Gothenburg, Spassky qualified for the 1956 Candidates' Tournament, held in Amsterdam, automatically gaining the grandmaster title, and was then the youngest to hold the title. At Amsterdam, he tied for third place with four others in the ten-player field, scoring 9\u00bd/18. At the 23rd Soviet final, held in Leningrad in January\u2013February 1956, Spassky shared first place on 11\u00bd/19, with Mark Taimanov and Yuri Averbakh, but Taimanov won the subsequent playoff to become champion, defeating Spassky in both their games. Spassky then tied for first in a semifinal for the 24th Soviet championship, thereby qualifying.\nUneven results.\nSpassky then went into a slump in world championship qualifying events, failing to advance to the next two Interzonals (1958 and 1962), a prerequisite to earn the right to play for the world championship. This crisis coincided with the hard three final years of his first marriage before his divorce in 1961, the same year that he broke with his trainer Tolush.\nIn the 24th Soviet final, played at Moscow in January\u2013February 1957, Spassky shared fourth place with Tolush, as both scored 13/21.\nSpassky's failure to qualify for the Portoroz Interzonal came after a last-round defeat at the hands of Mikhail Tal, in a nervy game in the 1958 Soviet championship, held at Riga. Spassky had the advantage for much of the game, but missed a difficult win after adjournment, then declined a draw. A win would have qualified Spassky for the Interzonal, and a draw would have ensured a share of fourth place with Yuri Averbakh, with qualification possible via a playoff.\nSpassky tied for first place at Moscow 1959 on 7/11, with Smyslov and David Bronstein. He shared second place in the 26th Soviet final with Tal, at Tbilisi 1959, finishing a point behind champion Tigran Petrosian, on 12\u00bd/19. Soon after Spassky notched a victory at Riga 1959, with 11\u00bd/13, one-half point in front of Vladas Mik\u0117nas. Spassky finished in a tie for ninth at the 27th Soviet final in Leningrad, with 10/19, as fellow Leningrader Viktor Korchnoi scored his first of four Soviet titles. Spassky travelled to Argentina, where he shared first place with Bobby Fischer, two points ahead of Bronstein, at Mar del Plata 1960 on 13\u00bd/15, defeating Fischer in their first career meeting. Spassky played on board one for the USSR at the 7th Student Olympiad in Leningrad, where he won the silver, but lost the gold to William Lombardy, also losing their individual encounter.\nAnother disappointment for Spassky came at the qualifier for the next Interzonal, the Soviet final, played in Moscow 1961, where he again lost a crucial last-round game, this to Leonid Stein, who thus qualified, as Spassky finished equal fifth with 11/19, while Petrosian won.\nTitle contender.\nSpassky decided upon a switch in trainers, from the volatile attacker Tolush to the calmer strategist Igor Bondarevsky. This proved the key to his resurgence. He won his first of two USSR titles in the 29th Soviet championship at Baku 1961, with a score of 14\u00bd/20, one-half point ahead of Lev Polugaevsky. Spassky shared second with Polugaevsky at Havana 1962 with 16/21, behind winner Miguel Najdorf. He placed joint fifth, with Leonid Stein at the 30th Soviet championship held in Yerevan 1962, with 11\u00bd/19. At Leningrad 1963, the site of the 31st Soviet final, Spassky tied for first with Stein and Ratmir Kholmov, with Stein winning the playoff, which was held in 1964. Spassky won at Belgrade 1964 with an undefeated 13/17, as Korchnoi and Borislav Ivkov shared second place with 11\u00bd. He finished fourth at Sochi 1964 with 9\u00bd/15, as Nikolai Krogius won.\nIn the 1964 Soviet Zonal at Moscow, a seven-player double round-robin event, Spassky won with 7/12, overcoming a start of one draw and two losses, to advance to the Amsterdam Interzonal the same year. At Amsterdam, he tied for first place, along with Mikhail Tal, Vasily Smyslov and Bent Larsen on 17/23, with all four, along with Borislav Ivkov and Lajos Portisch thus qualifying for the newly created Candidates' Matches the next year. With Bondarevsky, Spassky's style broadened and deepened, with poor results mostly banished, yet his fighting spirit was even enhanced. He added psychology and surprise to his quiver, and this proved enough to eventually propel him to the top.\nChallenger.\nSpassky was considered an all-rounder on the chess board, and his adaptable \"universal style\" was a distinct advantage in beating many top grandmasters. In the 1965 cycle, he beat Paul Keres in the quarterfinal round at Riga 1965 with careful strategy, triumphing in the last game to win 6\u20134 (+4\u22122=4). Also at Riga, he defeated Efim Geller with mating attacks, winning by 5\u00bd\u20132\u00bd (+3\u22120=5). Then, in his Candidates' Final match against Mikhail Tal at Tbilisi 1965, Spassky often managed to steer play into quieter positions, either avoiding former champion Tal's tactical strength, or exacting too high a price for complications. Though losing the first game, he won by 7\u20134 (+4\u22121=6).\nSpassky won two tournaments in the run-up to the final. He shared first at the third Chigorin Memorial in Sochi, in 1965 with Wolfgang Unzicker on 10\u00bd/15, then tied for first at Hastings 1965\u201366 with Wolfgang Uhlmann on 7\u00bd/9.\nSpassky lost a keenly fought match to Petrosian in Moscow, with three wins against Petrosian's four, with seventeen draws, though the last of his three victories came only in the twenty-third game, after Petrosian had ensured his retention of the title, the first outright match victory for a reigning champion since the latter of Alekhine's successful defences against Bogoljubov in 1934. Spassky's first event after the title match was the fourth Chigorin Memorial, where he finished tied for fifth with Anatoly Lein as Korchnoi won. Spassky then finished ahead of Petrosian and a super-class field at Santa Monica 1966 (the Piatigorsky Cup), with 11\u00bd/18, half a point ahead of Bobby Fischer, as he overcame the American grandmaster's challenge after Fischer had scored 3\u00bd/9 in the first cycle of the event. Spassky also won at Beverwijk 1967 with 11/15, one-half point ahead of Anatoly Lutikov, and shared first place at Sochi 1967 on 10/15 with Krogius, Alexander Zaitsev, Leonid Shamkovich, and Vladimir Simagin.\nAs losing finalist in 1966, Spassky was automatically seeded into the next Candidates' cycle. In 1968, he faced Geller again, this time at Sukhumi, and won by the same margin as in 1965 (5\u00bd\u20132\u00bd, +3\u22120=5). He next met Bent Larsen at Malm\u00f6, and again won by the score of 5\u00bd\u20132\u00bd after winning the first three games. The final was against his Leningrad rival Korchnoi at Kiev, and Spassky triumphed (+4\u22121=5), which earned him another match with Petrosian. Spassky's final tournament appearance before the match came at Palma, where he shared second place (+10\u22121=6) with Larsen, a point behind Korchnoi. Spassky's flexibility of style was the key to victory over Petrosian, by 12\u00bd\u201310\u00bd, with the site again being Moscow.\nWorld Champion.\nIn Spassky's first appearance after winning the crown, he placed first at San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October 1969 with 11\u00bd/15, one and one-half points clear of second. He then played the annual event at Palma, where he finished fifth with 10/17. While Spassky was undefeated and handed tournament victor Larsen one of his three losses, his fourteen draws kept him from seriously contending for first prize, as he came two points behind Larsen. In March\u2013April 1970, Spassky played first board for the Soviet side in the celebrated USSR vs. World event at Belgrade, where he scored +1\u22121=1 in the first three rounds against Larsen before Stein replaced him for the final match, as the Soviets won by the odd point, 20\u00bd\u201319\u00bd. He won a quadrangular event at Leiden 1970 with 7/12, a point ahead of Jan Hein Donner, who was followed by Larsen and Botvinnik, the latter of whom was making his final appearance in serious play. Spassky shared first at the annual IBM event held in Amsterdam 1970 with Polugaevsky on 11\u00bd/15. He was third at Gothenburg 1971 with 8/11, behind winners Vlastimil Hort and Ulf Andersson. He shared first with Hans Ree at the 1971 Canadian Open in Vancouver. In November and December, Spassky finished the year by tying for sixth with Tal, scoring +4\u22122=11, at the Alekhine Memorial in Moscow, which was won by Stein and Anatoly Karpov.\nChampionship match with Fischer.\nSpassky's reign as world champion lasted for three years, as he lost to Fischer of the United States in 1972 in the World Chess Championship 1972, popularly known as the Match of the Century. The contest took place in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, at the height of the Cold War, and consequently was seen as symbolic of the political confrontation between the two superpowers. Spassky accommodated many demands by Fischer, including moving the third game into a side room. The Fischer vs. Spassky world championship was the most widely covered chess match in history, reported upon by mainstream media throughout the world. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger spoke with Fischer urging him to play the match, and chess was at its apex.\nGoing into the match, Fischer had never won a game from Spassky in five attempts, losing three. In addition, Spassky had secured Geller as his coach, who also had a plus score against Fischer. However, Fischer won the title match 12\u00bd/8\u00bd (+7\u22123=11), with one of the three losses by default.\nThe match could be divided into halves, the first won convincingly by Fischer, and the second a close battle. Before the match, Fischer had defeated Mark Taimanov, Bent Larsen, and Tigran Petrosian, but Spassky maintained his composure and competitiveness. It has been suggested that Spassky's preparation was largely bypassed by Fischer, since Spassky and his team wrongly expected Fischer to always play 1. e4 openings as White.\nAccording to Reshevsky, the match as a whole was disappointing. \"It was marked by blunders by both players. The blunders committed by Spassky were incredible. In two games, for example, Spassky overlooked a one-move combination. In the first, he was compelled to resign immediately, and, in the other, he threw away all chances for a win. Fischer was also not in his best form. He made errors in a number of games. His play lacked brilliance, but his defense was excellent.\"\nEx-champion (1973\u20131985).\nIn February\u2013March 1973, Spassky finished equal third at Tallinn with 9/15, three points behind Tal; he tied for first at Dortmund on 9\u00bd/15 (+5\u22121=9) with Hans-Joachim Hecht and Ulf Andersson. Spassky finished in fourth place at the annual IBM tournament held in Amsterdam, one point behind winners Petrosian and Albin Planinc. In September, Spassky went 10/15 to finish second to Tal in the Chigorin Memorial at Sochi by a point. In the 41st Soviet Championship at Moscow, Spassky scored 11\u00bd/17 to win by a full point in a field which included all the top Soviet grandmasters of the time.\nIn the 1974 Candidates' matches, Spassky first defeated American Robert Byrne in San Juan, Puerto Rico, by 4\u00bd\u20131\u00bd (+3\u22120=3); he then lost the semifinal match to Anatoly Karpov in Leningrad, despite winning the first game, (+1\u22124=6). In Spassky's only tournament action of 1974, he played at Solingen, finishing with 8\u00bd/14 (+4\u22121=9), thus sharing third with Bojan Kurajica, behind joint winners Lubomir Kavalek and Polugaevsky, who scored 10.\nDuring 1975, Spassky played two events, the first being the annual tournament at Tallinn, where he finished equal second with Fridrik Olafsson, scoring 9\u00bd/15 (+5\u22121=9), one point behind Keres, the last international event won by the latter before his sudden death in June 1975. In October\u2013November, Spassky finished second to Geller at the Alekhine Memorial in Moscow with a score of 10 points from fifteen games (+6\u22121=8).\nIn 1976, Spassky was obliged to return to the Interzonal stage, and finished in a tie for tenth place in Manila, well short of qualifying for the Candidates matches, but was nominated to play after Fischer declined his place. Spassky won an exhibition match with Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman at Amsterdam 1977 by 4\u20132. He triumphed in extra games in his quarterfinal Candidates' match over Vlastimil Hort at Reykjav\u00edk 1977 by 8\u00bd\u20137\u00bd. This match saw Spassky fall ill, exhaust all his available rest days while recovering; then the healthy Hort used one of his own rest days, to allow Spassky more time to recover; Spassky eventually won the match.\nSpassky won an exhibition match over Robert H\u00fcbner at Solingen, 1977 by 3\u00bd\u20132\u00bd, then defeated Lubomir Kavalek, also at Solingen, by 4\u20132 in another exhibition. His next Candidates' match was against Portisch at Geneva 1977, and Spassky won by 8\u00bd\u20136\u00bd, to qualify for the final. At Belgrade 1977\u201378, Spassky lost to Korchnoi, by (+4\u22127=7). In this match, Spassky fell behind 2\u00bd\u20137\u00bd after losing the tenth game; however, he then won four consecutive games. After draws in games fifteen and sixteen, Korchnoi won the next two games to clinch the match by the score of 10\u00bd\u20137\u00bd.\nSpassky, as losing finalist, was seeded into the 1980 Candidates' matches, and faced Portisch again, with this match held in Mexico. After fourteen games, the match was 7\u20137, but Portisch advanced since he had won more games with the black pieces. Spassky narrowly missed qualification from the 1982 Toluca Interzonal with 8/13, finishing half a point short, in third place behind Portisch and Eugenio Torre, both of whom thus qualified. The 1985 Candidates' event was held as a round-robin tournament at Montpellier, France, and Spassky was nominated as an organizer's choice. He scored 8/15 to tie for sixth place with Alexander Beliavsky, behind joint winners Andrei Sokolov, Rafael Vaganian, and Artur Yusupov, and once again \u2013 one-half point short of potentially qualifying via a playoff. This was Spassky's last appearance at the Candidates' level.\nInternational team results.\nSpassky played five times for the USSR in Student Olympiads, winning eight medals. He scored 38\u00bd/47 (+31\u22121=15), for 81.91 percent. His complete results are:\nSpassky played twice for the USSR in the European Team Championships, winning four gold medals. He scored 8\u00bd/12 (+5\u22120=7), for 70.83 percent. His complete results are:\nSpassky played seven times for the Soviet Olympiad team. He won thirteen medals, and scored 69/94 (+45\u22121=48), for 73.40 percent. His complete results are:\nSpassky played board one in the USSR vs. Rest of the World match at Belgrade 1970, scoring (+1\u22121=1) against Larsen.\nSpassky then represented France in three Olympiads, on board one in each case. For Thessaloniki 1984, he scored 8/14 (+2\u22120=12). At Dubai 1986, he scored 9/14 (+4\u22120=10). Finally at Thessaloniki 1988, he scored 7\u00bd/13 (+3\u22121=9). He also played board one for France at the inaugural World Team Championships, Lucerne 1985, where he scored 5\u00bd/9 (+3\u22121=5).\nLater tournament career (after 1976).\nIn his later years, Spassky showed a reluctance to devote himself completely to chess. In 1976, he immigrated to France with his third wife; he became a French citizen in 1978, and competed for France in the Chess Olympiads. Spassky later lived with his wife in Meudon near Paris.\nSpassky did, however, score some notable triumphs in his later years. In his return to tournament play after the loss to Korchnoi, he tied for first at Bugojno 1978 on 10/15 with Karpov, with both players scoring +6\u22121=8 to finish a point ahead of Timman. He was clear first at Montilla\u2013Moriles 1978 with 6\u00bd/9. At Munich 1979, he tied for first place with 8\u00bd/13, with Yuri Balashov, Andersson and Robert H\u00fcbner. He shared first at Baden in 1980, on 10\u00bd/15 with Alexander Beliavsky. He won his preliminary group at Hamburg 1982 with 5\u00bd/6, but lost the final playoff match to Anatoly Karpov in extra games. His best result during this period was clear first at Linares 1983 with 6\u00bd/10, ahead of Karpov and Ulf Andersson, who shared second. At London Lloyds' Bank Open 1984, he tied for first with John Nunn and Murray Chandler, on 7/9. He won at Reykjav\u00edk 1985. At Brussels 1985, he placed second with 10\u00bd/13 behind Korchnoi. At Reggio Emilia 1986, he tied for 2nd\u20135th places with 6/11 behind Zolt\u00e1n Ribli. He swept Fernand Gobet 4\u20130 in a match at Fribourg 1987. He finished equal first at the Plaza tournament in the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts at Wellington in 1988, with Chandler and Eduard Gufeld. Spassky's Elo rating was in the world top ten continually throughout the early 1980s until it dropped out in 1983, and intermittently throughout the mid-1980s until it dropped out for the final time in 1987.\nHowever, Spassky's performances in the World Cup events of 1988 and 1989 showed that he could by this stage finish no higher than the middle of the pack against elite fields. He participated in three of the six events of the World Cup. At Belfort, he scored 8/15 for a joint 4th\u20137th place, as Garry Kasparov won. At Reykjav\u00edk, he scored 7/17 for a joint 15th\u201316th place, with Kasparov again winning. Finally, at Barcelona, Spassky scored 7\u00bd/16 for a tied 8th\u201312th place, as Kasparov shared first with Ljubomir Ljubojevi\u0107.\nSpassky played in the 1990 French Championship at Angers, placing fourth with 10\u00bd/15, as Marc Santo-Roman won. At Salamanca 1991, he placed 2nd with 7\u00bd/11 behind winner Evgeny Vladimirov. Then in the 1991 French Championship at Montpellier, he scored 9\u00bd/15 for a tied 4th\u20135th place, as Santo-Roman won again.\nIn 1992, Bobby Fischer, after a twenty-year hiatus from chess, re-emerged to arrange a \"Revenge Match of the 20th century\" against Spassky in Montenegro and Belgrade; this was a rematch of the 1972 World Championship. At the time, Spassky was rated 106th in the FIDE rankings, and Fischer did not appear on the list at all, owing to his inactivity. Spassky lost the match with a score of +5\u221210=15, earning US$1.65 million for losing the match.\nSpassky then played the 16-year-old prodigy Judit Polg\u00e1r in a 1993 match in Budapest, losing narrowly by 4\u00bd\u20135\u00bd.\nSpassky continued to play occasional events through much of the 1990s, such as the Veterans vs. Women match in Prague, 1995.\nLater years.\nOn October 1, 2006, Spassky suffered a minor stroke during a chess lecture in San Francisco. In his first major post-stroke play, he drew a six-game rapid match with Hungarian Grandmaster Lajos Portisch in April 2007.\nOn March 27, 2010, at 73 years old, he became the oldest surviving former World Chess Champion upon the death of Vasily Smyslov.\nOn September 23, 2010, ChessBase reported that Spassky had suffered a more serious stroke that had left him paralysed on his left side. After that he returned to France for a long rehabilitation programme. On August 16, 2012, Spassky left France to return to Russia under disputed circumstances and took up residence in an apartment in Moscow.\nOn September 25, 2016, he made a public speech at the opening of the Tal Memorial tournament. He said he had \"the very brightest memories\" of Mikhail Tal and told an anecdote from the 15th Chess Olympiad about Soviet analysis of an adjourned game between Fischer and Botvinnik. He was described by Chess24 as being 'sprightly'.\nSpassky died in Moscow on February 27, 2025, at the age of 88.\nLegacy.\nSpassky's best years were as a youthful prodigy in the mid-1950s, and in the mid- to late 1960s. He applauded Fischer in Game 6 of their 1972 match, and defended Fischer when the latter was detained near Narita Airport in 2004.\nSpassky has been described by many as a universal player. Never a true openings expert, at least when compared to contemporaries such as Geller and Fischer, he excelled in the middlegame and in tactics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was not only one of the greatest players of the Soviet era and the world, but also a true gentleman. His contributions to chess will never be forgotten.\u2014\u200a\nSpassky succeeded with a wide variety of openings, including the King's Gambit, 1.e4 e5 2.f4, an aggressive and risky line rarely seen at the top level. The chess game between \"Kronsteen\" and \"McAdams\" in the early part of the James Bond movie \"From Russia With Love\" is based on a game in that opening played between Spassky and David Bronstein in 1960 in which Spassky (\"Kronsteen\") was victorious.\nHis contributions to opening theory extend to reviving the Marshall Attack for Black in the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d5), developing the Leningrad Variation for White in the Nimzo-Indian Defence (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Bg5), the Spassky Variation on the Black side of the Nimzo-Indian, and the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence for White (1.e4 c5 2.Nc3). A variation of the B19 Caro-Kann (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5) also bears his name, as does a rare line in the King's Indian Attack (1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 b5!?).\nSpassky was played by Liev Schreiber in the 2014 film \"Pawn Sacrifice\".\nPersonal life.\nBoris was married three times. His first wife (1959\u20131961) was Nadezda Konstantinovna Latyntceva. Their daughter was born in 1960. His second wife was Larisa Zakharovna Solovyova. She gave birth to a son in 1967. His third marriage, in 1975 in France, was to Marina Yurievna Shcherbachova, granddaughter of the Russian war general and White movement activist Dmitry Shcherbachev. Their son was born in 1980.\nHis younger sister Iraida Spasskaya (born November 6, 1944) is a four-time champion of the Soviet Union in Russian draughts and the world vice-champion in international draughts (1974).\nIn an interview to a Western journalist Spassky talked about his psychological approach to chess:\nBobby Fischer once wrote that \"Spassky sits at the board with the same dead expression whether he's mating or being mated. He can blunder away a piece and you are never sure whether it's a blunder or a fantastically deep sacrifice.\"\nPolitics and religion.\nDuring his meeting with fans in Kaliningrad in 2005 Spassky stated about the economic and social decline of Russia in the 1990s: \"If only I knew what was going to happen to our country, I would've joined the Communist Party.\"\nIn 2005 Spassky signed the Letter of 5000 addressed to the Prosecutor General of Russia, along with Igor Shafarevich, Vyacheslav Klykov, Vasily Belov and other activists. The petition suggested that all religious and national Jewish organizations that functioned on the territory of Russia according to the Shulchan Aruch codes should be shut down for extremism, warning about a \"hidden campaign of genocide against the Russian people and their traditional society and values\". He later tried to distance himself from the petition, saying that signing the petition was a mistake.\nIn 2006, Spassky described himself as an Orthodox Christian, a monarchist and a Russian nationalist.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOriginal (russian)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:English (translation)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

{"id": "63283", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63283", "title": "Captain Beefheart", "text": "American musician (1941\u20132010)\nDon Van Vliet (; born Don Glen Vliet; January 15, 1941 \u2013 December 17, 2010), known by his stage name Captain Beefheart, was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and visual artist. Conducting a rotating ensemble known as the Magic Band, he recorded 13 studio albums between 1967 and 1982. His music blended elements of blues, free jazz, rock, and avant-garde composition with idiosyncratic rhythms, absurdist wordplay, and Vliet\u2019s gravelly singing voice with a wide vocal range.\nKnown as an enigmatic persona, Beefheart frequently constructed myths about his life and was known to exercise extreme, dictatorial control over his supporting musicians. Although he achieved little commercial success, he sustained a cult following as an influence on an array of experimental rock and punk-era artists.\nHe began performing in his Captain Beefheart persona in 1964, when he joined the original Magic Band line-up. The group's 1969 album \"Trout Mask Replica\" would rank 58th in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\nBeefheart eventually formed a new Magic Band with a group of younger musicians and regained critical approval through three final albums: \"Shiny Beast\" (1978), \"Doc at the Radar Station\" (1980) and \"Ice Cream for Crow\" (1982). In 1982, he retired from music and pursued a career in art. His abstract expressionist paintings and drawings command high prices, and have been exhibited in art galleries and museums across the world.\nEarly life.\nVan Vliet was born Don Glen Vliet in Glendale, California, on January 15, 1941, to Glen Alonzo Vliet, a service station owner from Kansas, and Willie Sue Vliet (\"n\u00e9e\" Warfield), who was from Arkansas. Van Vliet said that he was descended from adventurer and author Richard Halliburton and related to actor Slim Pickens, and that he remembered being born.\nVliet began painting and sculpting at age three. His subjects reflected his \"obsession\" with animals, particularly dinosaurs, fish, African mammals and lemurs. Considered a child prodigy, at age four he was featured with his animal sculptures on a Los Angeles television program. At the age of nine, he won a children's sculpting competition organized for the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park by local tutor and sculptor, Agostinho Rodrigues.\nDuring the 1950s, Vliet worked as an apprentice with Rodrigues, who considered him a prodigy. Van Vliet said that he was a lecturer at the Barnsdall Art Institute in Los Angeles at the age of eleven, although it is likely he simply gave a form of artistic dissertation. He said that his parents discouraged his interest in sculpture, due to their perception of artists as \"queer\". According to Van Vliet, they declined several scholarship offers, including one from the local Knudsen Creamery to travel to Europe with six years' paid tuition to study marble sculpture. Their denial of this opportunity made him so bitter that he abandoned his art until he was twenty-three.\nWhen he was 13, the family moved to the farming town of Lancaster, in the Mojave Desert, where there was a growing aerospace industry supported by nearby Edwards Air Force Base. It was an environment that would greatly influence Vliet creatively. He remained interested in art; several of his paintings were later used as covers for his albums. He developed his taste and interest in music, listening to the Delta blues of Son House and Robert Johnson, jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor, and the Chicago blues of Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. Vliet socialized with members of local bands such as The Omens and The Blackouts. The Omens' guitarists, Alexis Snouffer and Jerry Handley, who would later found The Magic Band; The Blackouts' drummer was Frank Zappa. Van Vliet collaborated with Zappa on his scripts for \"teenage operettas\", one of which was \"Captain Beefheart &amp; the Grunt People\". The earliest known recording of both Beefheart and Zappa is \"Lost in a Whirlpool\", recorded c. 1958-59 and included in the 1996 posthumous Zappa album \"The Lost Episodes\".\nVan Vliet claimed that \"half a day of kindergarten\" was the extent of his formal education, but his graduation picture appears in the Antelope Valley High School yearbook. His disavowals of education may have been related to his dyslexia which, though never officially diagnosed, was obvious to Magic Band members John French and Denny Walley, who observed his difficulty reading cue-cards, and his frequent need to be read to.\nAs Zappa recalled of those years, \"He spent most of his time at home. His girlfriend lived in the house, his grandmother lived in the house, and his aunt and his uncle lived across the street. And his father had had a heart attack; his father drove a Helms bread truck; part of the time Don was helping out by taking over the bread truck route [and] driving up to Mojave. The rest of the time he would just sit at home and listen to rhythm and blues records, and scream at his mother to get him a Pepsi.\" Zappa later wrote the tune \"Why Doesn't Someone Give Him a Pepsi?\".\nCareer.\nAfter Zappa began regular occupation at Paul Buff's PAL Studio in Cucamonga, he and Van Vliet began collaborating as \"The Soots\". By the time Zappa had turned the venue into , they had completed the songs \"Cheryl's Canon\", \"Metal Man Has Hornet's Wings\" and a Howlin' Wolf-styled rendition of Little Richard's \"Slippin' and Slidin'\".\nThe name 'Captain Beefheart' may have come from Vliet's uncle Alan, who had a habit of exposing himself to Don's girlfriend. He would urinate with the bathroom door open and, if she walked by, exclaim that his penis looked like a big beef heart.\nVan Vliet enrolled at Antelope Valley College as an art major, but left after one year. He worked as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, and sold a vacuum cleaner to the writer Aldous Huxley at his home in Llano, pointing to it and declaring, \"Well, I assure you sir, this thing sucks.\" After managing a Kinney's shoe store, he moved to Rancho Cucamonga, California to reconnect with Zappa. Van Vliet was quite shy but was eventually able to imitate the deep voice of Howlin' Wolf with his wide vocal range. He grew comfortable with public performance and, after learning to play the harmonica, began playing at dances and small clubs in Southern California.\nInitial recordings, 1962\u201369.\nIn early 1965, Snouffer invited Vliet to sing with a group that he was assembling. Vliet joined the first Magic Band and changed his name to Don Van Vliet, while Snouffer became Alex St. Clair. Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band signed to A&amp;M Records and, in 1966, released two singles: a version of Bo Diddley's \"Diddy Wah Diddy\" that became a regional hit in Los Angeles, and \"Moonchild\" (written by David Gates, later of the band Bread). That year, the band began to play larger west coast venues such as the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco.\n\"Safe as Milk\".\nAfter fulfilling their deal for two singles, the band presented demos to A&amp;M for what would become the album \"Safe as Milk\". A&amp;M's Jerry Moss reportedly described this new direction as \"too negative\" and dropped the band from the label. Much of the demo recording was accomplished at Art Laboe's Original Sound Studio, then with Gary Marker at Sunset Sound on 8-track. By the end of 1966, they were signed to Buddah Records and much of the demo work was transferred to 4-track, at the behest of Bob Krasnow and Richard Perry in the RCA Studio in Hollywood, where the recording was finalized. By now, Doug Moon had left the band and his tracks were taken up by Ry Cooder, who had been brought into the band after much pressure from Van Vliet.\nDrummer John French had joined the group and it would be his patience that was required to transcribe Van Vliet's ideas (often expressed by whistling or banging on the piano) into musical form for the other group members. Upon French's departure, this role was taken over by Bill Harkleroad for \"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\".\nMany of the lyrics on the \"Safe as Milk\" album were written by Van Vliet in collaboration with the writer Herb Bermann, who befriended Van Vliet after seeing him perform at a bar in Lancaster in 1966. The song \"Electricity\" was a poem written by Bermann, who gave Van Vliet permission to adapt it to music. Unlike the album's mostly blues rock sound, songs such as \"Electricity\" illustrated the band's unconventional instrumentation and Van Vliet's unusual vocals.\nMuch of the \"Safe as Milk\" material was honed and arranged by Cooder. The band began recording in spring 1967 and the album was released in September 1967. Richie Unterberger of \"Allmusic\" called it \"blues\u2013rock gone slightly askew, with jagged, fractured rhythms, soulful, twisting vocals from Van Vliet, and more doo wop, soul, straight blues, and folk\u2013rock influences than he would employ on his more avant garde outings\".\nJohn Lennon displayed two of the album's promotional \"baby bumper stickers\" in the sunroom at his home. The Beatles planned to sign Beefheart to their experimental Zapple label, plans that were scrapped after Allen Klein took over the Beatles management.\nVan Vliet was often critical of the Beatles. He considered the lyric \"I'd love to turn you on\" from \"A Day in the Life\" to be ridiculous and conceited. Tiring of their \"lullabies\", he lampooned them with the \"Strictly Personal\" song \"Beatle Bones 'n' Smokin' Stones\", with the sardonic refrain of \"strawberry fields, all the winged eels slither on the heels of today's children, strawberry fields forever\". Vliet spoke badly of Lennon after getting no response when he sent a telegram of support to him and wife Yoko Ono during their 1969 \"Bed-in\".\nTo support the \"Safe as Milk\" release, the group was scheduled to play at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Vliet was having severe panic attacks and was convinced that he was having a heart attack, a fear exacerbated by his heavy LSD use and the fact that his father had died of heart failure a few years earlier. At a vital warm-up performance at the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival (June 10\u201311) shortly before the Monterey Festival, the band began to play \"Electricity\" and Van Vliet froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the stage and landed on manager Bob Krasnow. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles coming from her mouth. This aborted any opportunity of breakthrough success at Monterey, as Cooder decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet and quit. There was no time for the band to find a replacement. Cooder's spot was eventually filled by Gerry McGee, who had played with the Monkees. According to French, the band did two gigs with McGee, one at The Peppermint Twist near Long Beach, the other at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, August 7, 1967, as the opening act for The Yardbirds.\n\"Strictly Personal\".\nIn August 1967, guitarist Jeff Cotton filled the spot vacated by Cooder and McGee. In October and November 1967 the Snouffer/Cotton/Handley/French line\u2013up recorded material for what was planned to be a double album called \"It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper\" for the Buddah label\u2013it was released in pieces in 1971 and 1995. After rejection from Buddah, Krasnow encouraged the band to re-record four of the shorter numbers, add two more, and make shorter versions of \"Mirror Man\" and \"Kandy Korn\". Krasnow created a strange mix full of \"phasing\" that, by most accounts (including Beefheart's), diminished the music's strength. This was released in October 1968 as \"Strictly Personal\" on Krasnow's Blue Thumb label. Stewart Mason in his \"Allmusic\" review of the album described it as a \"terrific album\" and a \"fascinating, underrated release...every bit the equal of \"Safe as Milk\" and \"Trout Mask Replica\"\". Langdon Winner of \"Rolling Stone\" called \"Strictly Personal\" \"an excellent album...with the lyrics demonstrating \"Beefheart's ability to juxtapose delightful humor with frightening insights\".\n\"Mirror Man\".\nIn 1971, some of the recordings done for Buddah were released as \"Mirror Man\", bearing a liner note stating that the material had been recorded in \"one night in Los Angeles in 1965\". This was a ruse to circumvent possible copyright issues. The material was recorded in November and December 1967. It is a \"jam\" album, described as pushing \"the boundaries of conventional blues\u2013rock, with a Beefheart vocal tossed in here and there. Some may miss Beefheart's surreal poetry, gruff vocals, and/or free jazz influence, while others may find it fascinating to hear the Magic Band simply letting go and cutting loose.\" The album's \"miss-credit errors\" also state band members as \"Alex St. Clare Snouffer\" (Alex St. Clare/Alexis Snouffer), \"Antennae Jimmy Simmons\" (Semens/Jeff Cotton) and \"Jerry Handsley\" (Handley).\nDuring his first trip to England in January 1968, Captain Beefheart was briefly represented by mod icon Peter Meaden, an early manager of the Who. The Captain and his band members were initially denied entry to the United Kingdom because Meaden had booked them for gigs without applying for the required work permits. Press coverage and public outcry resulted in the band being permitted to enter the UK, where they recorded material for John Peel's BBC radio show and, on Friday January 19, appeared at Middle Earth, where they played tracks from \"Safe as Milk\" and some of the experimental blues tracks from \"Mirror Man\". The band was met by an enthusiastic audience; French recalled the event as a rare high moment: \"After the show, we were taken to the dressing room where we sat for hours as a line of what seemed like hundreds of people walked in one by one to shake our hands or get an autograph. Many brought imports of \"Safe as Milk\" with them for us to autograph ... It seemed like we had finally gained some reward ... Suddenly all the criticizing and intimidation and eccentricities seemed very unimportant. It was a glorious moment, one of the very few I ever experienced\". By this time, the band had terminated their association with Meaden. On January 27, 1968, they performed in the MIDEM Music Festival on the beach at Cannes.\n\"The 'Brown Wrapper' Sessions\".\nAfter returning to the US, the plan was for the band to leave Buddah and sign to MGM Records, and they re-recorded some Buddah material of the partial \"Mirror Man\" sessions at Sunset Sound with Bruce Botnick. Beefheart was conceptualizing new band names, including \"25th Century Quaker\" and \"Blue Thumb\". The idea of \"25th Century Quaker\" was that it would be a \"blues band\" alias for the more avant-garde work of the Magic Band. Krasnow then set up his own label, \"Blue Thumb\", which launched with \"Strictly Personal\". Thus \"25th Century Quaker\" became a track and a potential band-name became a label. Given that Krasnow had poached the band from Buddah, there were limitations on what material could be released. The raft of material left behind emerged as \"I May Be Hungry, But I Sure Ain't Weird\". Both \"Blue Thumb\" and the stamps on the cover of \"Strictly Personal\" have LSD connotations, as does the track \"Ah Feel Like Ahcid\".\n\"Trout Mask Replica\".\nCritically acclaimed as Van Vliet's magnum opus, \"Trout Mask Replica\" was released as a 28-track double album in June 1969 on Frank Zappa's newly formed Straight Records label. A school-age portrait of Van Vliet appears on the front of this sheet, while the cover of the gatefold shows Beefheart in a modified Pilgrim hat. The inner spread \"infra-red\" photography is by Ed Caraeff, whose Beefheart vacuum cleaner images from this session also appear on Zappa's \"Hot Rats\" release to accompany \"Willie The Pimp\" lyrics sung by Vliet.\nAlex St. Clair had now left the band and, after Elwood Madeo from the Blackouts was considered, the role was filled by Bill Harkleroad. Bassist Jerry Handley had also departed, with Gary Marker stepping in\u2013he was soon replaced by Mark Boston. Thus the long rehearsals for the album began in the rented house in Woodland Hills that would become the Magic Band House.\nThe Magic Band began recordings for \"Trout Mask Replica\" at TTG Studios; it was completed at the Whitney Studios, with some field recordings made at the house. Van Vliet assigned nicknames to his band members, so Harkleroad became \"Zoot Horn Rollo\", Boston became \"Rockette Morton\", John French assumed the name \"Drumbo\", and Jeff Cotton became \"Antennae Jimmy Semens\". Van Vliet's cousin Victor Hayden, \"the Mascara Snake\", performed as a bass clarinetist. Vliet's girlfriend Laurie Stone, who can be heard laughing at the beginning of \"Fallin' Ditch\", became the audio typist.\nVan Vliet wanted the band to \"live\" the \"Trout Mask Replica\" album. The group rehearsed his difficult compositions for eight months, with everyone living in the two-bedroom house. Van Vliet implemented his vision by completely dominating his musicians, artistically and emotionally. He would berate a musician continually, sometimes for days, until the musician collapsed in tears or in total submission. Bill Harkleroad complained that his fingers were a \"bloody mess\" as a result of Beefheart's orders that he use heavy strings. French described the situation as \"cultlike\" and a visitor said \"the environment in that house was positively Mansonesque\". Their material circumstances were dire. With no income other than welfare and contributions from relatives, the group barely survived and some were arrested for shoplifting food. French recalled living on no more than a small cup of beans a day for a month. A visitor described their appearance as \"cadaverous\". Band members were restricted from leaving the house and rehearsed for 14 or more hours a day.\nIn his 2010 book \"Through the Eyes of Magic\", French describes how, when he did not finish drum parts quickly enough, he was punched by band members, thrown into walls, kicked, and attacked with a sharpened broomstick. Beefheart punched him in the face and threatened to throw him out a window. He admits complicity in similarly attacking his bandmates during Beefheart's \"talks\" aimed at them. In the end, after the album's recording, Beefheart ejected French from the band by throwing him down a flight of stairs, telling him to \"Take a walk\" after French did not properly respond to a request to \"play a strawberry\". Beefheart replaced French with drummer Jeff Burchell, a roadie with no drumming experience whom Beefheart called \"Fake Drumbo\". French's name does not appear on the album credits.\nAccording to Van Vliet, the 28 songs on the album were written in a single &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;8+1\u20442-hour session at the piano, an instrument he did not play. Band members have stated that the songs were written over the course of a year, beginning around December 1967. It took them eight months to mold the songs into shape, with French bearing primary responsibility for transposing and shaping Vliet's piano fragments into guitar and bass lines. Harkleroad recalled: \"We're dealing with a strange person, coming from a place of being a sculptor/painter, using music as his idiom. He was getting more into that part of who he was instead of this blues singer. The band had rehearsed the songs so thoroughly that the instrumental tracks for 21 of the songs were recorded in a single four-and-a-half-hour session. The album's cover shows Van Vliet wearing the raw head of a carp fashioned into a mask by photographer Cal Schenkel.\n\"Trout Mask Replica\" incorporated a wide variety of musical styles, including blues, avant garde/experimental, and rock. The relentless practice prior to recording blended the music into an iconoclastic whole of contrapuntal tempos, featuring slide guitar, polyrhythmic drumming (with French's drums and cymbals covered in cardboard), honking saxophone and bass clarinet. Van Vliet's vocals range from his signature Howlin' Wolf-inspired growl to frenzied falsetto to laconic, casual ramblings.\nThe instrumental backing was recorded live, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, \"[it was] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It seemed to me that if he was going to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not.\"\nVan Vliet used the ensuing publicity, particularly with a 1970 \"Rolling Stone\" interview with Langdon Winner, to promulgate a number of myths. Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor the members of the Magic Band ever took drugs; Harkleroad contradicted this. Van Vliet claimed to have taught Harkleroad and Boston to play their instruments from scratch; in fact, both were accomplished musicians before joining the band. Lastly, Van Vliet claimed to have gone a year and half without sleeping. When asked how this was possible, he claimed to have only eaten fruit.\n\"AllMusic\" critic Steve Huey writes that the album's influence \"was felt more in spirit than in direct copycatting, as a catalyst rather than a literal musical starting point. However, its inspiring re-imagining of what was possible in a rock context laid the groundwork for countless experiments in rock surrealism to follow, especially during the punk and new wave era.\" In 2003, the album was ranked sixtieth by \"Rolling Stone\" on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: \"On first listen, \"Trout Mask Replica\" sounds like raw Delta blues\", with Beefheart \"singing and ranting and reciting poetry over fractured guitar licks. Tracks such as \"Ella Guru\" and \"My Human Gets Me Blues\" are the direct predecessors of modern musical primitives such as Tom Waits and PJ Harvey.\" Guitarist Fred Frith noted that during this process \"forces that usually emerge in improvisation are harnessed and made constant, repeatable\".\nCritic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+, saying, \"I find it impossible to give this record an A because it is just too weird. But I'd like to. Very great played at high volume when you're feeling shitty, because you'll never feel as shitty as this record.\" John Peel said of the album: \"If there has been anything in the history of popular music which could be described as a work of art in a way that people who are involved in other areas of art would understand, then \"Trout Mask Replica\" is probably that work.\" It was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry in 2011.\n\"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\".\n\"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\" (1970) continued in a similarly experimental vein. An album with \"a very coherent structure\" in the Magic Band's \"most experimental and visionary stage\", it was Van Vliet's most commercially successful in the United Kingdom, spending twenty weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at number 20. An early promotional music video was made of its title song, and a bizarre television commercial included excerpts from \"Woe-Is-uh-Me-Bop\", silent footage of masked Magic Band members using kitchen utensils as musical instruments, and Beefheart kicking over a bowl of what appears to be porridge onto a dividing stripe in the middle of a road. The video was rarely played but was accepted into the Museum of Modern Art, where it has been used in several programs related to music.\nOn this LP, Art Tripp III, formerly of the Mothers of Invention, played drums and marimba, along with a returning John French. \"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\" was the first record on which the band was credited as \"\"The\" Magic Band, rather than \"His\"\" Magic Band. Journalist Irwin Chusid interprets this change as \"a grudging concession of its members' at least semi-autonomous humanity\". Robert Christgau gave the album an A\u2212, commenting, \"Beefheart's famous five-octave range and covert totalitarian structures have taken on a playful undertone, repulsive and engrossing and slapstick funny.\" Due to licensing disputes, \"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\" was unavailable on CD for many years, though it remained in print on vinyl. It was ranked second in \"Uncut\" magazine's May 2010 list of \"The 50 Greatest Lost Albums\".\n\"The Spotlight Kid\" &amp; \"Clear Spot\".\nThe next two records, \"The Spotlight Kid\" (simply credited to \"Captain Beefheart\") and \"Clear Spot\" (credited to \"Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band\"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of \"The Spotlight Kid\" is, according to one critic, \"definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam\". And though \"things do sound maybe just a little too blas\u00e9\", \"Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best.\" The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases; this was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made almost no money during the previous two years. Van Vliet said he \"got tired of scaring people with what I was doing ... I realized that I had to give them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music. It's more human that way\".\nMagic Band members said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated by the fact that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording, the band again lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation. According to John French, the worst of this was directed at Harkleroad. In his autobiography, Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having \"metaphorical intent\".\n\"Clear Spot\"'s production credit of Ted Templeman made AllMusic's Ned Raggett consider \"why in the world [it] wasn't more of a commercial success\", and that while fans \"of the fully all-out side of Beefheart might find the end result not fully up to snuff as a result, but those less concerned with pushing back all borders all the time will enjoy his unexpected blend of everything tempered with a new accessibility\". The review called the song \"Big Eyed Beans from Venus\" \"a fantastically strange piece of aggression\". A \"Clear Spot\" song, \"Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles\", appeared on the soundtrack of the Coen brothers' 1998 cult comedy \"The Big Lebowski\".\n\"Unconditionally Guaranteed\" &amp; \"Bluejeans &amp; Moonbeams\".\nIn 1974, immediately after the recording of \"Unconditionally Guaranteed\", which continued the trend towards a more commercial sound, the Magic Band's original members departed. They worked together for a period, gigging at Blue Lake and putting together their own ideas and demos, with John French as vocalist. These concepts eventually coalesced around the core of Art Tripp III, Harkleroad and Boston, with the formation of the band Mallard, helped by money and UK recording facilities from Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. Some of French's compositions were used in the band's work, but the group's singer was Sam Galpin and the role of keyboardist was taken by John Thomas, who shared a house with French in Eureka. At this time Vliet attempted to recruit both French and Harkleroad as producers for his next album, but his pleas fell on deaf ears.\nVliet was forced to form a new Magic Band to complete support-tour dates. He recruited singer and keyboardist Michael Smotherman, bassist Paul Uhrig, drummer Ty Grimes, saxophonist Del Simmons, and guitarists Dean Smith and Robert 'Fuzzy' Fuscaldo. These were session musicians who had never heard Beefheart's music, so they improvised what they thought would go with each song, playing much slicker \"bar band\" versions. A review described this incarnation of the Magic Band as the \"Tragic Band\", a term that stuck.\nMike Barnes said that the description of the new band \"grooving along pleasantly\", was \"...an appropriately banal description of the music of a man who only a few years ago had composed with the express intent of shaking listeners out of their torpor.\" The one album this band recorded, \"Bluejeans &amp; Moonbeams\" (1974) has a completely different, almost soft rock sound. Neither was well received; drummer Art Tripp recalled that when he and the original Magic Band listened to \"Unconditionally Guaranteed\", they \"were horrified...each song was worse than the one which preceded it\". Beefheart later disowned both albums, calling them \"horrible and vulgar\", asking that they not be considered part of his musical output and urging fans who bought them to \"take copies back for a refund\".\n\"Bongo Fury\" and \"Bat Chain Puller\".\nBy the fall of 1975, the band had completed a European tour, and added US dates in early 1976, supporting Zappa and Dr. John. Van Vliet now found himself stuck in a web of contractual hang-ups. Zappa extended a helping hand, with Vliet performing incognito as \"Bloodshot Rollin' Red\" on \"One Size Fits All\" (1975) and then joining with him on the \"Bongo Fury\" album and its tour. Two Vliet-penned numbers on \"Bongo Fury\" are \"Sam with the Showing Scalp Flat Top\" and \"Man with the Woman Head\". He also sings \"Poofter's Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead\", harmonizes on \"200 Years Old\" and \"Muffin Man\", and plays harmonica and saxophone.\nThe friendship between Zappa and Van Vliet was sometimes expressed in the form of rivalry as musicians drifted back and forth between their groups. Van Vliet embarked on the 1975 \"Bongo Fury\" tour with Zappa and the Mothers, mainly because conflicting contractual obligations made him unable to tour or record independently. Their relationship grew acrimonious on the tour to the point that they refused to talk to one another. Zappa became irritated by Van Vliet, who drew constantly, including while on stage, filling one of his large sketch books with rapidly executed portraits and warped caricatures of Zappa. Musically, Van Vliet's primitive style contrasted sharply with Zappa's compositional discipline and abundant technique. Mothers of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black described the situation as \"two geniuses\" on \"ego trips\". Estranged for years afterwards, they reconnected at the end of Zappa's life, after his diagnosis of terminal prostate cancer.\nTheir collaborative work appears on the Zappa rarity collections \"The Lost Episodes\" (1996) and \"Mystery Disc\" (1996). Particularly notable is their song \"Muffin Man\", included on \"Bongo Fury\" and Zappa's compilation album \"Strictly Commercial\" (1995). Zappa finished concerts with the song for many years afterwards. Beefheart also provided vocals for \"Willie the Pimp\" on Zappa's otherwise instrumental album \"Hot Rats\" (1969). Van Vliet played the harmonica on two songs on Zappa albums: \"San Ber'dino\" on \"One Size Fits All\" (1975) and \"Find Her Finer\" on \"Zoot Allures\" (1976). He is also the vocalist on \"The Torture Never Stops (Original Version)\" on Zappa's \"You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4\".\nIn early 1976, Zappa offered his studio and finances to produce the Vliet album \"Bat Chain Puller\". The band was John French (drums), John Thomas (keyboards) and guitarists Moris Tepper and Denny Walley. Much of the work on this album was finished and some demos had been circulated when, in May 1976, the long association between Zappa and his manager/business partner Herb Cohen ceased. This resulted in Zappa's finances and works becoming part of protracted legal negotiations. The \"Bat Chain Puller\" project went \"on ice\" and did not see an official release until 2012.\nIn 1977, Beefheart appeared on the Tubes' album \"Now\", playing saxophone on the song \"Cathy's Clone\". The album also featured a cover of the \"Clear Spot\" song \"My Head Is My Only House Unless It Rains\". In 1978 he appeared on Jack Nitzsche's soundtrack to the film \"Blue Collar\".\n\"Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)\".\nHaving extricated himself from a mire of contractual difficulties, Beefheart emerged with 1978's \"Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)\", on the Warner Bros label. It contained re-workings of the shelved \"Bat Chain Puller\" album and retained its original guitarist, Moris Tepper. He and Vliet were now joined by Richard Redus (guitar, bass and accordion), Eric Drew Feldman (bass, piano and synthesizer), Bruce Lambourne Fowler (trombone and air bass), Art Tripp (percussion and marimba) and Robert Arthur Williams (drums). The album was co-produced by Vliet and Pete Johnson. Members of this Magic Band and the \"Bat Chain\" elements would feature on Beefheart's last two albums.\n\"Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)\" was described by Ned Raggett of \"Allmusic\" as \"...manna from heaven for those feeling Beefheart had lost his way on his two Mercury albums\". Following Vliet's death, John French claimed the 40-second spoken word track \"Apes-Ma\" was an analogy of Van Vliet's deteriorating physical condition. The album's sleeve features Van Vliet's 1976 painting \"Green Tom\".\n\"Doc at the Radar Station\".\n\"Doc at the Radar Station\" (1980) helped establish Beefheart's late resurgence. Released by Virgin Records during the post-punk scene, the music was now accessible to a younger, more receptive audience. He was interviewed in a feature report on KABC-TV's \"Channel 7 Eyewitness News\" in which he was hailed as \"the father of the new wave. One of the most important American composers of the last fifty years, [and] a primitive genius\". Van Vliet said he was \"doing a non-hypnotic music to break up the catatonic state ... and I think there is one right now.\"\nSteve Huey of \"Allmusic\" cited \"Doc at the Radar Station\" as being \"...the strongest album of his comeback, and by some as his best since \"Trout Mask Replica\"\", \"even if the Captain's voice isn't quite what it once was, \"Doc at the Radar Station\" is an excellent, focused consolidation of Beefheart's past and then-present\". Van Vliet's biographer Mike Barnes writes of \"revamping work built on skeletal ideas and fragments that would have mouldered away in the vaults had they not been exhumed and transformed into full-blown, totally convincing new material\". During this period, Van Vliet made two appearances on Late Night With David Letterman, and performed on \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\"Ice Cream for Crow\".\nThe final Beefheart record, \"Ice Cream for Crow\" (1982), was recorded with Gary Lucas (who was also Van Vliet's manager), Moris Tepper, Richard Snyder and Cliff Martinez. This line-up made a video to promote the title track, directed by Van Vliet and Ken Schreiber, with cinematography by Daniel Pearl, which was rejected by MTV for being \"too weird\". However, the video was included in a Letterman broadcast, and was accepted by the Museum of Modern Art.\n\"Ice Cream for Crow\" features instrumental performances by the Magic Band with performance poetry readings by Van Vliet. Ned Raggett called the album a \"last entertaining blast of wigginess from one of the few truly independent artists in late 20th century pop music, with humor, skill, and style all still intact\", with the Magic Band \"turning out more choppy rhythms, unexpected guitar lines, and outr\u00e9 arrangements, Captain Beefheart lets everything run wild as always, with successful results\". Barnes writes that, \"The most original and vital tracks (on the album) are the newer ones\", and that it \"feels like an hors-d'oeuvre for a main course that never came\". Michael Galucci of \"Goldmine\" praised the album, describing it as \"the single, most bizarre entry in Van Vliet's long, odd career.\" Van Vliet now retired from music to begin a new career as a painter.\nCareer as an artist.\nIn the mid-1980s, Van Vliet became reclusive and abandoned music, stating he had gotten \"too good at the horn\" and could make far more money painting. His first exhibition had been at The Bluecoat, in Liverpool during the Magic Band's 1972 UK tour. He was interviewed on Granada regional television, standing in front of his bold black and white canvases. He was further inspired when Julian Schnabel, who admired the artwork on his album covers, asked to buy a drawing from him. His debut exhibition as a serious painter was at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York in 1985 and was initially regarded as that of \"another rock musician dabbling in art for ego's sake\", though his primitive, non-conformist work has since received more serious attention, with some sales approaching $25,000.\nIn the early 1980s Van Vliet established an association with the Galerie Michael Werner in Cologne. Eric Drew Feldman said that Werner told Van Vliet he needed to stop playing music if he wanted to be respected as a painter, or he would only be considered a \"musician who paints\". In doing so, it was said that he had effectively \"succeeded in leaving his past behind\".\nVan Vliet has been described as a modernist, a primitivist, an abstract expressionist, and, \"in a sense\" an outsider artist. Morgan Falconer of \"Artforum\" concurs, mentioning both a \"neo-primitivist aesthetic\" and stating that his work is influenced by the CoBrA painters. The resemblance to the CoBrA painters is also recognized by art critic Roberto Ohrt, while others have compared his paintings to the work of Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Antonin Artaud, Francis Bacon, Vincent van Gogh and Mark Rothko.\nDr. John Lane, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, said that, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting \"has that same kind of edge the music has\". Curator David Breuer asserts that, in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is distinctly naturalistic, and that he is a distinguished figure in contemporary art whose work will survive in the canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, \"I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I'm trying to completely bare what I think at that moment\" and \"I paint for the simple reason that I have to. I feel a sense of relief after I do.\" When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. \"I just paint like I paint and that's enough influence.\" He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz, Piet Mondrian, and Vincent van Gogh; after seeing van Gogh's paintings, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying, \"The sun disappoints me so.\"\nExhibits of his paintings from the late 1990s were held in New York in 2009 and 2010. He exhibited only few of his paintings because he immediately destroyed any that did not satisfy him. Falconer stated that the exhibitions showed \"evidence of a serious, committed artist\".\nPublications.\nIn 1987, Van Vliet published \"Skeleton Breath, Scorpion Blush\", a collection of his poetry, paintings and drawings.\nTwo books have been published specifically devoted to critique and analysis of his artwork: \"Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh: On The Arts Of Don Van Vliet\" (1999) by W. C. Bamberger and \"Stand Up To Be Discontinued\", first published in 1993, a now rare collection of essays on Van Vliet's work. The limited edition version of the book contains a CD of Van Vliet reading six of his poems: \"Fallin' Ditch\", \"The Tired Plain\", \"Skeleton Makes Good\", \"Safe Sex Drill\", \"Tulip\" and \"Gill\". A deluxe edition was published in 1994; only 60 were printed, with etchings of Van Vliet's signature, costing \u00a3180.\nIn 2004, Rhino Handmade released in a limited edition of 1,500 copies of \"Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh\". It is a signed and numbered box set containing a CD of Vliet-recited poetry, the Anton Corbijn film of Vliet \"Some YoYo Stuff\" on DVD, and two art books produced by Artist Ink Editions. \"Splinters\" is a visual \"scrapbook\" of Vliet's life. The second book, eponymously titled, is packed with Vliet's artwork. An onion-skin wallet contains a matching-numbered Vliet lithograph on hand-rolled paper, signed by the artist.\nLater life and death.\nAfter his retirement from music, Van Vliet rarely appeared in public. He lived near Trinidad, California, with his wife Janet. By the early 1990s, his multiple sclerosis had advanced to the point where he was using a wheelchair.\nOne of Van Vliet's last public appearances was in the 1993 short documentary \"Some Yo Yo Stuff\" by filmmaker Anton Corbijn, described as an \"observation of his observations\". Around 13 minutes long and shot entirely in black and white, with an appearance by David Lynch, the film showed a noticeably weakened and dysarthric Van Vliet at home, reading poetry, and philosophically discussing his life, environment, music and art. In 2000, he appeared on Gary Lucas's album \"Improve the Shining Hour\" and Moris Tepper's \"Moth to Mouth\", and spoke on Tepper's 2004 song \"Ricochet Man\" from the album \"Head Off\". He is credited for naming Tepper's 2010 album \"A Singer Named Shotgun Throat\".\nVan Vliet supported environmental issues and causes, particularly those concerned with the welfare of animals; he referred to Earth as \"God's Golfball\". In 2003 he was heard on the compilation album \"Where We Live: Stand for What You Stand On: A Benefit CD for EarthJustice\", singing a version of \"Happy Birthday to You\" retitled \"Happy Earthday\". The track lasts 34 seconds and was recorded over the telephone.\nVan Vliet died at a hospital in Arcata, California, on Friday, December 17, 2010, of complications from multiple sclerosis. Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan commented on his death, saying he was \"Wondrous, secret\u00a0... and profound, he was a diviner of the highest order.\"\nOn the day of his death, Dweezil Zappa dedicated the song \"Willie the Pimp\" to Beefheart at the \"Zappa Plays Zappa\" show at the Beacon Theatre, while Jeff Bridges exclaimed \"Rest in peace, Captain Beefheart!\" at the conclusion of the December 18, 2010, episode of \"Saturday Night Live\".\nMusical style.\nCaptain Beefheart was a pioneer of art rock and experimental rock. His music has been cited as an influence on punk rock, post-punk and new wave music, and he has been classified as a proto-punk musician.\n\"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"The crucial problem in Beefheart\u2019s career has been that few people have ever been able to accept him for what he is, a blues and rock musician\". His management referred to him as \"potentially the greatest white blues singer of all time\", while a combination of managers, musicians, fans and critics felt that he should have either sung more clearly and softly, made more commercial music or played \"blues songs that people could understand and dance to\". He adapted to, and pushed the boundaries of, genres throughout his career. According to \"Entertainment Weekly\", his music \"drew on blues, jazz, psychedelia, and a thousand other subgenres\". \"The Independent\" described his music as a fusion of rhythm and blues and avant-garde jazz. \"Far Out\" magazine said that his \"combination of jazz, blues and psychedelic rock\" defied categorization, and as a result of his difficult to place style, many simply referred to it as avant-garde. According to \"Rolling Stone\", \"Beefheart\u2019s brand of abrasive blues-rock was truly a novelty to young listeners in 1964\". \"Popular Song in the 20th Century: Styles and Singers and What They Said About America\" included him among the prominent progressive rock musicians of the 1960s and '70s.\nJohn Parish described Captain Beefheart's music as a \"combination of raw blues and abstract jazz. There was humour in there, but you could tell that it wasn't [intended as] a joke. I felt that there was a depth to what he did that very few other rock artists have managed to achieve.\" A \"Rolling Stone\" biography described his work as \"a sort of modern chamber music for rock bands, since he plans every note and teaches the band their parts by ear.\" The \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" describes Beefheart's songs as conveying a \"deep distrust of modern civilization, a yearning for ecological balance, and the belief that all animals in the wild are far superior to human beings\". Barret Hansen, in a review of \"Strictly Personal\", described the singer as \"the only white voice that has come close to capturing what Charley Patton and Son House are all about\".\nLegacy.\nVan Vliet has been the subject of two documentaries, the BBC's 1997 \"The Artist Formerly Known as Captain Beefheart\", narrated by John Peel, and the 2006 independent production \"Captain Beefheart: Under Review\".\nAccording to Peel, \"If there has ever been such a thing as a genius in the history of popular music, it's Beefheart\u00a0... A psychedelic shaman who frequently bullied his musicians and sometimes alarmed his fans, Don somehow remained one of rock's great innocents.\" Mike Barnes referred to him as an \"iconic counterculture hero\" who, with the Magic Band, \"went on to stake out startling new possibilities for rock music\". Lester Bangs cited Beefheart as \"one of the four or five unqualified geniuses to rise from the hothouses of American music in the Sixties\", while John Harris of \"The Guardian\" praised the music's \"pulses with energy and ideas, the strange way the spluttering instruments meld together\". A \"Rolling Stone\" biography said that, because his work \"breaks so many of rock's conventions at once, Beefheart's music has always been more influential than popular.\" \"Far Out\" cites the music of Captain Beefheart as laying \"the groundwork for post-punk, new wave, and no wave, allowing the likes of Brian Eno and David Bowie to pick up from where Beefheart had left off\".\nMany artists have cited Van Vliet as an influence, beginning with the Edgar Broughton Band, who covered \"Dropout Boogie\" as \"Apache Drop Out\" in 1970, as did the Kills 32 years later. The Minutemen were fans of Beefheart, and were among the few to synthesize his music with their own\u2013Michael Azerrad describes the Minutemen's early output as \"highly caffeinated Captain Beefheart running down James Brown tunes\", and notes that Beefheart was the group's \"idol\". Others who conveyed the same influence are John Cale of the Velvet Underground, Buzz Osborne of Melvins, Little Feat, Laurie Anderson, the Residents and Henry Cow. Industrial music pioneers Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, and poet mystic Z'EV, cited Van Vliet and Zappa as influences. More notable were those emerging during the early days of punk rock, such as the Clash and John Lydon of the Sex Pistols. Frank Discussion of punk rock band the Feederz learned to play guitar by listening to \"Trout Mask Replica\" and \"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\".\nCartoonist and writer Matt Groening first saw Beefheart and the Magic Band perform in the front row at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in the early 1970s. He later declared \"Trout Mask Replica\" to be the greatest album ever made. He considered the appeal of the Magic Band as outcasts who were even \"too weird for the hippies\". Groening served as the curator of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that reunited the post\u2013Beefheart Magic Band.\nVan Vliet's influence on post\u2013punk bands was demonstrated by Magazine's recording of \"I Love You You Big Dummy\" in 1978 and 1988's \"Fast 'n' Bulbous \u2013 A Tribute to Captain Beefheart\", featuring the Dog Faced Hermans, the Scientists, the Membranes, Simon Fisher Turner, That Petrol Emotion, the Primevals, The Mock Turtles, XTC, and Sonic Youth, who included a cover of Beefheart's \"Electricity\" which would later be re-released on their 1988 album \"Daydream Nation\". Other post-punk bands influenced by Beefheart include Gang of Four, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Pere Ubu, Babe the Blue Ox and Mark E. Smith of the Fall, who covered \"Beatle Bones 'N' Smokin' Stones\" in \"The Complete Peel Sessions 1978\u20132004\". Beefheart is also considered to have \"greatly influenced\" new wave artists, such as David Byrne of Talking Heads, Blondie, Devo, the Bongos, and the B-52s.\nTom Waits' shift in artistic direction, starting with 1983's \"Swordfishtrombones\", was, Waits claims, a result of his wife Kathleen Brennan introducing him to Van Vliet's music. \"Once you've heard Beefheart\", said Waits, \"it's hard to wash him out of your clothes. It stains, like coffee or blood.\" Guitarist John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers cited Van Vliet as a prominent influence on the band's 1991 album \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" as well as on his debut solo album \"Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt\". Black Francis of the Pixies cited Beefheart's \"The Spotlight Kid\" as one of the albums he listened to regularly when first writing songs for the band, and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana mentioned Van Vliet's among his notoriously eclectic range of influences.\nIn 2000, The White Stripes released \"Party of Special Things to Do\", containing covers of that Beefheart song plus \"China Pig\" and \"Ashtray Heart\". The Kills included a cover of \"Dropout Boogie\" on their debut \"Black Rooster EP\". In 2008, The Black Keys released a free cover of Beefheart's \"I'm Glad\" from \"Safe as Milk\". The LCD Soundsystem song \"Losing My Edge\" has a verse in which James Murphy says, \"I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band\". In 2005, Genus Records produced \"Mama Kangaroos \u2013 Philly Women Sing Captain Beefheart\". Beck included \"Safe as Milk\" and \"Ella Guru\" in his website's \"Planned Obsolescence\" series of songs that influenced him. Franz Ferdinand cited \"Doc at the Radar Station\" as a strong influence on their LP, \"You Could Have It So Much Better.\" Placebo briefly named themselves Ashtray Heart, after the track on \"Doc at the Radar Station\"; the band's album \"Battle for the Sun\" contains the song. Joan Osborne covered Beefheart's \"(His) Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles\", which appears on \"Early Recordings\". Ty Segall covered \"Drop Out Boogie\" on his 2009 album \"Lemons\". PJ Harvey's first heard Beefheart's music as a child. Her parents had all of his albums; she said that listening to them made her \"feel ill\". At age 16, Harvey was re-introduced to Beefheart's music by John Parish. She cited him as one of her greatest influences since.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63285", "revid": "42075620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63285", "title": "JPEG 2000", "text": "Image compression standard and coding system\nJPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image compression standard and coding system. It was developed from 1997 to 2000 by a Joint Photographic Experts Group committee chaired by Touradj Ebrahimi (later the JPEG president), with the intention of superseding their original JPEG standard (created in 1992), which is based on a discrete cosine transform (DCT), with a newly designed, wavelet-based method. The standardized filename extension is '.jp2' for ISO/IEC 15444-1 conforming files and .jpx or .jpf for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2. The MIME types for JPEG 2000 are defined in RFC 3745. The MIME type for JPEG 2000 (ISO/IEC 15444-1) is image/jp2.\nThe JPEG 2000 project was motivated by Ricoh's submission in 1995 of the CREW (Compression with Reversible Embedded Wavelets) algorithm to the standardization effort of JPEG LS. Ultimately the LOCO-I algorithm was selected as the basis for JPEG LS, but many of the features of CREW ended up in the JPEG 2000 standard.\nJPEG 2000 codestreams are regions of interest that offer several mechanisms to support spatial random access or region of interest access at varying degrees of granularity. It is possible to store different parts of the same picture using different quality.\nJPEG 2000 is a compression standard based on a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The standard could be adapted for motion imaging video compression with the Motion JPEG\u00a02000 extension. JPEG\u00a02000 technology was selected as the video coding standard for digital cinema in 2004. However, JPEG\u00a02000 is generally not supported in web browsers for web pages as of 2024,[ [update]] and hence is not generally used on the World Wide Web. Nevertheless, for those with PDF support, web browsers generally support JPEG\u00a02000 in PDFs.\nUnlike the legacy .jpg format, which offers basic image compression without support for embedded metadata or access control, JPEG 2000 introduces advanced container options such as .jp2 and .jpf. Of these, the .jpf extension offers a significantly more powerful and extensible framework. It supports high-fidelity wavelet compression, layered and tiled image structures, region-of-interest encoding, and remote streaming via the JPEG 2000 Interactive Protocol (JPIP). Crucially, the .jpf format enables the embedding of machine-readable consent flags, secure face hashes, and cryptographic signatures\u2014allowing for time-limited, revocable access to visual data. These capabilities have positioned JPF as a leading candidate for privacy-respecting media exchange in an era of deepfakes and unauthorized AI model training.\nDesign goals.\nWhile there is a modest increase in compression performance of JPEG\u00a02000 compared to JPEG, the main advantage offered by JPEG\u00a02000 is the significant flexibility of the codestream. The codestream obtained after compression of an image with JPEG\u00a02000 is scalable in nature, meaning that it can be decoded in a number of ways; for instance, by truncating the codestream at any point, one may obtain a representation of the image at a lower resolution, or signal-to-noise ratio \u2013 see scalable compression. By ordering the codestream in various ways, applications can achieve significant performance increases. However, as a consequence of this flexibility, JPEG\u00a02000 requires codecs that are complex and computationally demanding. Another difference, in comparison with JPEG, is in terms of visual artifacts: JPEG\u00a02000 only produces ringing artifacts, manifested as blur and rings near edges in the image, while JPEG produces both ringing artifacts and 'blocking' artifacts, due to its 8\u00d78 blocks.\nJPEG 2000 has been published as an ISO standard, ISO/IEC 15444. The cost of obtaining all documents for the standard has been estimated at 2,718CHF (US$2,720 as of 2015).\nApplications.\nNotable markets and applications intended to be served by the standard include:\nImprovements over the 1992 JPEG standard.\nMultiple resolution representation.\nJPEG 2000 decomposes the image into a multiple resolution representation in the course of its compression process. This pyramid representation can be put to use for other image presentation purposes beyond compression.\nProgressive transmission by pixel and resolution accuracy.\nThese features are more commonly known as \"progressive decoding\" and \"signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scalability\". JPEG\u00a02000 provides efficient codestream organizations which are progressive by pixel accuracy and by image resolution (or by image size). This allows the viewer to see a lower quality version of the final picture before the whole file has been downloaded. The quality improves progressively as more data is downloaded from the source.\nChoice of lossless or lossy compression.\nLike the Lossless JPEG standard, the JPEG 2000 standard provides both lossless and lossy compression in a single compression architecture. Lossless compression is provided by the use of a reversible integer wavelet transform in JPEG\u00a02000.\nError resilience.\nLike JPEG 1992, JPEG 2000 is robust to bit errors introduced by noisy communication channels, due to the coding of data in relatively small independent blocks.\nFlexible file format.\nThe JP2 and JPX file formats allow for handling of color-space information, metadata, and for interactivity in networked applications as developed in the JPEG Part 9 JPIP protocol.\nHigh dynamic range support.\nJPEG 2000 supports bit depths of 1 to 38 bits per component. Supported color spaces include monochrome, 3 types of YCbCr, sRGB, PhotoYCC, CMY(K), YCCK and CIELab. It also later added support for CIEJab (CIECAM02), e-sRGB, ROMM, YPbPr and others.\nSide channel spatial information.\nFull support for transparency and alpha planes.\nJPEG 2000 image coding system \u2013 Parts.\nThe JPEG 2000 image coding system (ISO/IEC 15444) consists of the following parts:\nTechnical discussion.\nThe aim of JPEG 2000 is not only improving compression performance over JPEG but also adding (or improving) features such as scalability and editability. JPEG\u00a02000's improvement in compression performance relative to the original JPEG standard is actually rather modest and should not ordinarily be the primary consideration for evaluating the design. Very low and very high compression rates are supported in JPEG\u00a02000. The ability of the design to handle a very large range of effective bit rates is one of the strengths of JPEG\u00a02000. For example, to reduce the number of bits for a picture below a certain amount, the advisable thing to do with the first JPEG standard is to reduce the resolution of the input image before encoding it. That is unnecessary when using JPEG\u00a02000, because JPEG\u00a02000 already does this automatically through its multi-resolution decomposition structure. The following sections describe the algorithm of JPEG\u00a02000.\nAccording to the Royal Library of the Netherlands, \"the current JP2 format specification leaves room for multiple interpretations when it comes to the support of ICC profiles, and the handling of grid resolution information\".\nColor components transformation.\nInitially images have to be transformed from the RGB color space to another color space, leading to three \"components\" that are handled separately. There are two possible choices:\nformula_1\nIf R, G, and B are normalized to the same precision, then numeric precision of CB and CR is one bit greater than the precision of the original components. This increase in precision is necessary to ensure reversibility. The chrominance components can be, but do not necessarily have to be, downscaled in resolution; in fact, since the wavelet transformation already separates images into scales, downsampling is more effectively handled by dropping the finest wavelet scale. This step is called \"multiple component transformation\" in the JPEG\u00a02000 language since its usage is not restricted to the RGB color model.\nTiling.\nAfter color transformation, the image is split into so-called \"tiles\", rectangular regions of the image that are transformed and encoded separately. Tiles can be any size, and it is also possible to consider the whole image as one single tile. Once the size is chosen, all the tiles will have the same size (except optionally those on the right and bottom borders). Dividing the image into tiles is advantageous in that the decoder will need less memory to decode the image and it can opt to decode only selected tiles to achieve a partial decoding of the image. The disadvantage of this approach is that the quality of the picture decreases due to a lower peak signal-to-noise ratio. Using many tiles can create a blocking effect similar to the older JPEG\u00a01992 standard.\nWavelet transform.\nThese tiles are then wavelet-transformed to an arbitrary depth, in contrast to JPEG\u00a01992 which uses an 8\u00d78 block-size discrete cosine transform. JPEG\u00a02000 uses two different wavelet transforms:\nThe wavelet transforms are implemented by the lifting scheme or by convolution.\nQuantization.\nAfter the wavelet transform, the coefficients are scalar-quantized to reduce the number of bits to represent them, at the expense of quality. The output is a set of integer numbers which have to be encoded bit-by-bit. The parameter that can be changed to set the final quality is the quantization step: the greater the step, the greater is the compression and the loss of quality. With a quantization step that equals 1, no quantization is performed (it is used in lossless compression).\nCoding.\nThe result of the previous process is a collection of \"sub-bands\" which represent several approximation scales. A sub-band is a set of \"coefficients\"\u2014real numbers which represent aspects of the image associated with a certain frequency range as well as a spatial area of the image.\nThe quantized sub-bands are split further into \"precincts\", rectangular regions in the wavelet domain. They are typically sized so that they provide an efficient way to access only part of the (reconstructed) image, though this is not a requirement.\nPrecincts are split further into \"code blocks\". Code blocks are in a single sub-band and have equal sizes\u2014except those located at the edges of the image. The encoder has to encode the bits of all quantized coefficients of a code block, starting with the most significant bits and progressing to less significant bits by a process called the \"EBCOT\" scheme. \"EBCOT\" here stands for \"Embedded Block Coding with Optimal Truncation\". In this encoding process, each bit plane of the code block gets encoded in three so-called \"coding passes\", first encoding bits (and signs) of insignificant coefficients with significant neighbors (i.e., with 1-bits in higher bit planes), then refinement bits of significant coefficients and finally coefficients without significant neighbors. The three passes are called \"Significance Propagation\", \"Magnitude Refinement\" and \"Cleanup\" pass, respectively.\nIn lossless mode all bit planes have to be encoded by the EBCOT, and no bit planes can be dropped.\nThe bits selected by these coding passes then get encoded by a context-driven binary arithmetic coder, namely the binary MQ-coder (as also employed by JBIG2). The context of a coefficient is formed by the state of its eight neighbors in the code block.\nThe result is a bit-stream that is split into \"packets\" where a \"packet\" groups selected passes of all code blocks from a precinct into one indivisible unit. Packets are the key to quality scalability (i.e., packets containing less significant bits can be discarded to achieve lower bit rates and higher distortion).\nPackets from all sub-bands are then collected in so-called \"layers\".\nThe way the packets are built up from the code-block coding passes, and thus which packets a layer will contain, is not defined by the JPEG\u00a02000 standard, but in general a codec will try to build layers in such a way that the image quality will increase monotonically with each layer, and the image distortion will shrink from layer to layer. Thus, layers define the progression by image quality within the codestream.\nThe problem is now to find the optimal packet length for all code blocks which minimizes the overall distortion in a way that the generated target bitrate equals the demanded bit rate.\nWhile the standard does not define a procedure as to how to perform this form of rate\u2013distortion optimization, the general outline is given in one of its many appendices: For each bit encoded by the EBCOT coder, the improvement in image quality, defined as mean square error, gets measured; this can be implemented by an easy table-lookup algorithm. Furthermore, the length of the resulting codestream gets measured. This forms for each code block a graph in the rate\u2013distortion plane, giving image quality over bitstream length. The optimal selection for the truncation points, thus for the packet-build-up points is then given by defining critical \"slopes\" of these curves, and picking all those coding passes whose curve in the rate\u2013distortion graph is steeper than the given critical slope. This method can be seen as a special application of the method of \"Lagrange multiplier\" which is used for optimization problems under constraints. The Lagrange multiplier, typically denoted by \u03bb, turns out to be the critical slope, the constraint is the demanded target bitrate, and the value to optimize is the overall distortion.\nPackets can be reordered almost arbitrarily in the JPEG\u00a02000 bit-stream; this gives the encoder as well as image servers a high degree of freedom.\nAlready encoded images can be sent over networks with arbitrary bit rates by using a layer-progressive encoding order. On the other hand, color components can be moved back in the bit-stream; lower resolutions (corresponding to low-frequency sub-bands) could be sent first for image previewing. Finally, spatial browsing of large images is possible through appropriate tile or partition selection. All these operations do not require any re-encoding but only byte-wise copy operations.\nCompression ratio.\nCompared to the previous JPEG standard, JPEG\u00a02000 delivers a typical compression gain in the range of 20%, depending on the image characteristics. Higher-resolution images tend to benefit more, where JPEG\u00a02000's spatial-redundancy prediction can contribute more to the compression process. In very low-bitrate applications, studies have shown JPEG\u00a02000 to be outperformed by the intra-frame coding mode of H.264.\nComputational complexity and performance.\nJPEG 2000 is much more complicated in terms of computational complexity in comparison with JPEG standard. Tiling, color component transform, discrete wavelet transform, and quantization could be done pretty fast, though entropy codec is time-consuming and quite complicated. EBCOT context modelling and arithmetic MQ-coder take most of the time of JPEG\u00a02000 codec.\nOn CPU the main idea of getting fast JPEG 2000 encoding and decoding is closely connected with AVX/SSE and multithreading to process each tile in a separate thread. The fastest JPEG\u00a02000 solutions utilize both CPU and GPU power to get high performance benchmarks.\nFile format and codestream.\nSimilar to JPEG-1, JPEG 2000 defines both a file format and a codestream. Whereas JPEG\u00a02000 entirely describes the image samples, JPEG-1 includes additional meta-information such as the resolution of the image or the color space that has been used to encode the image. JPEG\u00a02000 images should\u2014if stored as files\u2014be boxed in the JPEG\u00a02000 file format, where they get the .jp2 extension. The part-2 extension to JPEG\u00a02000 (ISO/IEC 15444-2) enriches the file format by including mechanisms for animation or composition of several codestreams into one single image. This extended file format is called JPX, and should use the file extension .jpf, although .jpx is also used.\nThere is no standardized extension for codestream data because codestream data is not to be considered to be stored in files in the first place, though when done for testing purposes, the extension .jpc, .j2k or .j2c is commonly used.\nJPF File Format.\nThe .jpf file extension is an alternative container format for JPEG 2000 images, supporting the extended feature set defined in Part 2 of the ISO/IEC 15444 standard. While functionally similar to codice_1, the codice_2 format is commonly used in applications requiring wavelet compression, layered image structures, embedded metadata, and support for the JPEG 2000 Interactive Protocol (JPIP). It is often found in domains such as geospatial imaging, digital cinema, and forensic science.\nThe codice_2 format supports revocable image access through a combination of metadata and network streaming mechanisms. These features enable greater control over how images are accessed and used, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence and identity protection. Capabilities include:\nThese mechanisms allow codice_2 images to function as consent-aware media containers, offering post-publication control over AI training usage, facial recognition indexing, and unauthorized redistribution.\nDespite these technical capabilities, adoption of codice_2 in consumer imaging software remains limited due to minimal support in mainstream browsers, mobile operating systems, and cloud platforms.\nMetadata.\nFor traditional JPEG, additional metadata, e.g. lighting and exposure conditions, is kept in an application marker in the Exif format specified by the JEITA. JPEG\u00a02000 chooses a different route, encoding the same metadata in XML form. The reference between the Exif tags and the XML elements is standardized by the ISO TC42 committee in the standard 12234-1.4.\nExtensible Metadata Platform can also be embedded in JPEG 2000.\nLegal status.\nISO 15444 is covered by patents and the specification lists 17 patent holders, but the contributing companies and organizations agreed that licenses for its first part\u2014the core coding system\u2014can be obtained free of charge from all contributors. But this is not a formal guarantee. License and royalties may be required to use some extensions.\nThe JPEG committee has stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It has always been a strong goal of the JPEG committee that its standards should be implementable in their baseline form without payment of royalty and license fees... The up and coming JPEG\u00a02000 standard has been prepared along these lines, and agreement reached with over 20 large organizations holding many patents in this area to allow use of their intellectual property in connection with the standard without payment of license fees or royalties.\nHowever, the JPEG committee acknowledged in 2004 that undeclared submarine patents may present a hazard:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is of course still possible that other organizations or individuals may claim intellectual property rights that affect implementation of the standard, and any implementers are urged to carry out their own searches and investigations in this area.\nIn ISO/IEC 15444-1:2016, the JPEG committee stated in \"Annex L: Patent statement\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) draw attention to the fact that it is claimed that compliance with this Recommendation | International Standard may involve the use of patents.\nThe complete list of intellectual property rights statements can be obtained from the ITU-T and ISO patent declaration databases (available at https://www.iso.org/iso-standards-and-patents.html)\nISO and IEC take no position concerning the evidence, validity and scope of these patent rights.\nAttention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this Recommendation | International Standard may be the subject of patent rights other than those identified in the above mentioned databases. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.\nRelated standards.\nSeveral additional parts of the JPEG 2000 standard exist; amongst them are ISO/IEC 15444-2:2000, JPEG\u00a02000 extensions defining the .jpx file format, featuring for example Trellis quantization, an extended file format and additional color spaces, ISO/IEC 15444-4:2000, the reference testing and ISO/IEC 15444-6:2000, the compound image file format (.jpm), allowing compression of compound text/image graphics.\nExtensions for secure image transfer, \"JPSEC\" (ISO/IEC 15444-8), enhanced error-correction schemes for wireless applications, \"JPWL\" (ISO/IEC 15444-11) and extensions for encoding of volumetric images, \"JP3D\" (ISO/IEC 15444-10) are also already available from the ISO.\nJPIP protocol for streaming JPEG 2000 images.\nIn 2005, a JPEG 2000\u2013based image browsing protocol, called JPIP was published as ISO/IEC 15444-9. Within this framework, only selected regions of potentially huge images have to be transmitted from an image server on the request of a client, thus reducing the required bandwidth.\nJPEG 2000 data may also be streamed using the ECWP and ECWPS protocols found within the ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK.\nMotion JPEG 2000.\nMotion JPEG 2000, (MJ2), originally defined in Part 3 of the ISO Standard for JPEG2000 (ISO/IEC 15444-3:2002,) as a standalone document, has now been expressed by ISO/IEC 15444-3:2002/Amd 2:2003 in terms of the ISO Base format, ISO/IEC 15444-12 and in ITU-T Recommendation T.802. It specifies the use of the JPEG 2000 format for timed sequences of images (motion sequences), possibly combined with audio, and composed into an overall presentation. It also defines a file format, based on ISO base media file format (ISO 15444-12). Filename extensions for Motion JPEG\u00a02000 video files are .mj2 and .mjp2 according to RFC 3745.\nIt is an open ISO standard and an advanced update to MJPEG (or MJ), which was based on the legacy JPEG format. Unlike common video formats, such as MPEG-4 Part 2, WMV, and H.264, MJ2 does not employ temporal or inter-frame compression. Instead, each frame is an independent entity encoded by either a lossy or lossless variant of JPEG\u00a02000. Its physical structure does not depend on time ordering, but it does employ a separate profile to complement the data. For audio, it supports LPCM encoding, as well as various MPEG-4 variants, as \"raw\" or complement data.\nMotion JPEG 2000 (often referenced as MJ2 or MJP2) is considered as a digital archival format by the Library of Congress though MXF_OP1a_JP2_LL (lossless JPEG\u00a02000 wrapped in MXF operational pattern 1a) is preferred by the LOC Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation.\nISO base media file format.\nISO/IEC 15444-12 is identical with ISO/IEC 14496-12 (MPEG-4 Part 12) and it defines ISO base media file format. For example, Motion JPEG\u00a02000 file format, MP4 file format or 3GP file format are also based on this ISO base media file format.\nGML JP2 georeferencing.\nThe Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has defined a metadata standard for georeferencing JPEG\u00a02000 images with embedded XML using the Geography Markup Language (GML) format: \"GML in JPEG\u00a02000 for Geographic Imagery Encoding (GMLJP2)\", version 1.0.0, dated 2006-01-18. Version 2.0, entitled \"GML in JPEG 2000 (GMLJP2) Encoding Standard Part 1: Core\" was approved 2014-06-30.\nJP2 and JPX files containing GMLJP2 markup can be located and displayed in the correct position on the Earth's surface by a suitable Geographic Information System (GIS), in a similar way to GeoTIFF and GTG images.\nApplication support.\nApplications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63299", "revid": "3525933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63299", "title": "V\u00e1clav Havel", "text": "Last president of Czechoslovakia and first president of the Czech Republic (1936\u20132011)\nV\u00e1clav Havel (; 5 October 1936\u00a0\u2013 18 December 2011) was a Czech statesman, author, poet, playwright, and dissident. Havel served as the last president of Czechoslovakia from 1989 until 1992, prior to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 31 December, before he became the first president of the Czech Republic from 1993 to 2003. He was the first democratically elected president of either country after the fall of communism. As a writer of Czech literature, he is known for his plays, essays and memoirs.\nHis educational opportunities having been limited by his bourgeois background under the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Havel first rose to prominence as a playwright. In works such as \"The Garden Party\" and \"The Memorandum\", Havel used an absurdist style to criticize the Communist system. After participating in the Prague Spring and being blacklisted after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, he became more politically active and helped found several dissident initiatives, including Charter 77 and the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted. His political activities brought him under the surveillance of the StB secret police, and he spent several periods as a political prisoner, the longest of his imprisoned terms being nearly four years, between 1979 and 1983.\nHavel's Civic Forum party played a major role in the Velvet Revolution that toppled the Communist system in Czechoslovakia in 1989. He assumed the presidency shortly thereafter, and was re-elected in a landslide the following year and after Slovak independence in 1993. Havel was instrumental in dismantling the Warsaw Pact and enlargement of NATO membership eastward. Many of his stances and policies, such as his opposition to Slovak independence, condemnation of the treatment of Sudeten Germans and their mass expulsion from Czechoslovakia after World War II, as well as granting of general amnesty to all those imprisoned under the Communist era, were very controversial domestically. By the end of his presidency, he enjoyed greater popularity abroad than at home. Havel continued his life as a public intellectual after his presidency, launching several initiatives including the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism, the VIZE 97 Foundation, and the Forum 2000 annual conference.\nHavel's political philosophy was one of anti-consumerism, humanitarianism, environmentalism, civil activism, and direct democracy. He supported the Czech Green Party from 2004 until his death. He received numerous accolades during his lifetime, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Gandhi Peace Prize, the Philadelphia Liberty Medal, the Order of Canada, the Four Freedoms Award, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, and the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award. The 2012\u20132013 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour. He is considered by some to be one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th century. The international airport in Prague was renamed V\u00e1clav Havel Airport Prague in 2012.\nEarly life.\nHavel was born in Prague on 5 October 1936 into a wealthy family celebrated in Czechoslovakia for its entrepreneurial and cultural accomplishments. His grandfather, V\u00e1cslav Havel, a real estate developer, built a landmark entertainment complex on Prague's Wenceslas Square. His father, V\u00e1clav Maria Havel, was the real estate developer behind the suburban Barrandov Terraces, located on the highest point of Prague\u2014next door to which his uncle, Milo\u0161 Havel, built one of the largest film studios in Europe. Havel's mother, Bo\u017eena Vavre\u010dkov\u00e1, also came from an influential family; her father was a Czechoslovak ambassador and a well-known journalist.\nIn the early 1950s, because of his class background, Havel entered into a four-year apprenticeship as a chemical laboratory assistant and simultaneously took evening classes at a gymnasium. He completed his secondary education in 1954.\nFor political reasons, he was not accepted into any post-secondary school with a humanities program; therefore, he opted for studies at the Faculty of Economics of the Czech Technical University in Prague but dropped out after two years. On 9 July 1964, Havel married Olga \u0160pl\u00edchalov\u00e1.\nEarly theatre career.\nThe intellectual tradition of his family was essential for Havel's lifetime adherence to the humanitarian values of the Czech culture. After finishing his military service (1957\u201359), Havel had to bring his intellectual ambitions in line with the given circumstances, especially with the restrictions imposed on him as a descendant of a bourgeois family. He found employment in Prague's theatre world as a stagehand at Prague's Theatre ABC\u00a0\u2013 \"Divadlo ABC\", and then at the Theatre on Balustrade\u00a0\u2013 \"Divadlo Na z\u00e1bradl\u00ed\". Simultaneously, he was a student of dramatic arts by correspondence at the Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (DAMU). His first own full-length play performed in public, besides various vaudeville collaborations, was \"The Garden Party\" (1963). Presented in a series of Theatre of the Absurd, at the Theatre on Balustrade, this play won him international acclaim. The play was soon followed by \"The Memorandum\", one of his best known plays, and \"The Increased Difficulty of Concentration\", all at the Theatre on Balustrade. In 1968, \"The Memorandum\" was also brought to The Public Theater in New York, which helped to establish Havel's reputation in the United States. The Public Theater continued to produce his plays in the following years. After 1968, Havel's plays were banned from the theatre world in his own country, and he was unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances of his works.\nPolitical dissident.\nDuring the first week of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Havel assisted the resistance by providing an on-air narrative via Radio Free Czechoslovakia station (at Liberec). Following the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, he was banned from the theatre and became more politically active. He took a job at Krakono\u0161 brewery in Trutnov, an experience he wrote about in his play \"Audience\". This play, along with two other \"Van\u011bk\" plays (so-called because of the recurring character Ferdinand Van\u011bk, a stand in for Havel), became distributed in samizdat form across Czechoslovakia, and greatly added to Havel's reputation of being a leading dissident (several other Czech writers later wrote their own plays featuring Van\u011bk). This reputation was cemented with the publication of the \"Charter 77\" manifesto, written partially in response to the imprisonment of members of the Czech psychedelic rock band The Plastic People of the Universe; Havel had attended their trial, which centered on the group's non-conformity in having long hair, using obscenities in their music, and their overall involvement in the Prague underground movement. Havel co-founded the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted in 1979. His political activities resulted in multiple imprisonments by the authorities, and constant government surveillance and questioning by the secret police (St\u00e1tn\u00ed bezpe\u010dnost). His longest period in prison, from May 1979 to February 1983, is documented in letters to his wife that were later published as \"Letters to Olga\".\nHe was known for his essays, most particularly \"The Power of the Powerless\" (1978), in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to \"live within a lie\" under the Communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: \"we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, sometimes we have ended up in prison without precisely knowing how. We simply went ahead and did certain things that we felt we ought to do, and that seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less.\"\nSamuel Beckett's 1982 short play, \"Catastrophe\", was dedicated to Havel while he was held as a political prisoner in Czechoslovakia. Both plays were published by Index on Censorship, which in 2022 requested a followup play on similar themes from the Iranian playwright Reza Shirmarz.\nPresidency.\nOn 29 December 1989, while he was leader of the Civic Forum, Havel became President of Czechoslovakia by a unanimous vote of the Federal Assembly. He had long insisted that he was not interested in politics and had argued that political change in the country should be induced through autonomous civic initiatives rather than through the official institutions. In 1990, soon after his election, Havel was awarded the Prize For Freedom of the Liberal International.\nIn 1990, Czechoslovakia held its first free elections in 44 years, resulting in a sweeping victory for Civic Forum and its Slovak counterpart, Public Against Violence. Between them, they commanded strong majorities in both houses of the legislature, and tallied the highest popular vote share recorded for a free election in the country.\nDespite increasing political tensions between the Czechs and the Slovaks in 1992, Havel supported the retention of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic prior to the dissolution of the country. Havel sought re-election in 1992. Although no other candidate filed, when the vote came on 3 July, he failed to get a majority due to a lack of support from Slovak deputies. The largest Czech political party, the Civic Democratic Party, let it be known that it would not support any other candidate. After the Slovaks issued their Declaration of Independence, he resigned as president on 20 July, saying that he would not preside over the country's breakup.\nHowever, when the Czech Republic was created as one of two successor states, he stood for election as its first president on 26 January 1993, and won. Although he was nominally the new country's chief executive, the framers of the Constitution of the Czech Republic intended to vest most of the real power in the prime minister. However, owing to his prestige, he still commanded great moral authority, and the presidency acquired a greater role than the framers intended. For instance, largely due to his influence, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), successor to the KSC's branch in the Czech Lands, was kept on the margins for most of his presidency. Havel suspected that the KSCM was still an unreformed Stalinist party.\nHavel's popularity abroad surpassed his popularity at home, and he was often the object of controversy and criticism. During his time in office, Havel stated that the expulsion of the indigenous Sudeten German population after World War II was immoral, causing a great controversy at home. He also extended general amnesty as one of his first acts as president, in an attempt to lessen the pressure in overcrowded prisons as well as to release political prisoners and persons who may have been falsely imprisoned during the Communist era. Havel felt that many of the decisions by the previous regime's courts should not be trusted, and that most of those in prison had not received fair trials. However, critics claimed that this amnesty led to a significant increase in the crime rate: the total number of crimes doubled, as did the number of murders. Several of the worst crimes in the history of the Czech criminology were committed by criminals released in this amnesty. Within four years of the Velvet Revolution (and following another two amnesties declared by Havel), criminality had more than tripled since 1989.\nIn an interview with Karel Hv\u00ed\u017e\u010fala (included in \"To the Castle and Back\"), Havel expressed his feeling that it was his most important accomplishment as president to have contributed to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. According to his statement the dissolution was very complicated. The infrastructure created by the Warsaw Pact was part of the economies of all member states, and the Pact's dissolution necessitated restructuring that took many years to complete.\nFollowing a legal dispute with his sister-in-law Dagmar Havlov\u00e1 (wife of his brother Ivan M. Havel), Havel decided to sell his 50% stake in the Lucerna Palace on Wenceslas Square in Prague, built from 1907 to 1921 by his grandfather, also named V\u00e1clav Havel (spelled V\u00e1cslav,) one of the multifunctional \"palaces\" in the center of the once booming pre-World War II Prague. In a transaction arranged by Mari\u00e1n \u010calfa, Havel sold the estate to V\u00e1clav Junek, a former Communist spy in France and head of the soon-to-be bankrupt conglomerate Chemapol Group, who later openly admitted that he bribed politicians of the Czech Social Democratic Party.\nHis close friend was Ivan Medek, who became the chief of the president's office.\nIn January 1996, Olga Havlov\u00e1, his wife of 32 years, died of cancer at 62. In December 1996, Havel who had been a chain smoker for a long time, was diagnosed with lung cancer. The disease reappeared two years later. He quit smoking. In 1997, he remarried, to actress Dagmar Ve\u0161krnov\u00e1.\nHavel was among those influential politicians who contributed most to the transition of NATO from being an anti-Warsaw Pact alliance to its present form. Havel advocated vigorously for the inclusion of former-Warsaw Pact members, like the Czech Republic, into the Western alliance.\nHavel was re-elected president in 1998. He had to undergo a colostomy in Innsbruck when his colon ruptured while he was on holiday in Austria.\nOn 30 January 2003, Havel signed \"The letter of the eight\" supporting planned U.S. invasion of Iraq.\nHavel left office after his second term as Czech president ended on 2 February 2003. V\u00e1clav Klaus, one of his greatest political adversaries, was elected his successor as president on 28 February 2003. Margaret Thatcher wrote of the two men in her foreign policy treatise , reserving the greater respect for Havel. Havel's dedication to democracy and his steadfast opposition to communist ideology earned him admiration.\nPost-presidential career.\nBeginning in 1997, Havel hosted Forum 2000, an annual conference to \"identify the key issues facing civilisation and to explore ways to prevent the escalation of conflicts that have religion, culture or ethnicity as their primary components\". In 2005, the former president occupied the Kluge Chair for Modern Culture at the John W. Kluge Center of the United States Library of Congress, where he continued his research on human rights. In November and December 2006, Havel spent eight weeks as a visiting artist in residence at Columbia University. The stay was sponsored by the Columbia Arts Initiative and featured \"performances, and panels centr[ing] on his life and ideas\", including a public \"conversation\" with former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Concurrently, the Untitled Theater Company No. 61 launched a Havel Festival, the first complete festival of his plays in various venues throughout New York City, including The Brick Theater and the Ohio Theatre, in celebration of his 70th birthday. Havel was a member of the World Future Society and addressed the Society's members on 4 July 1994. His speech was later printed in THE FUTURIST magazine (July 1995).\nHavel was greatly admired by Czech citizens. In the poll taken for the 2005 TV show \"Nejv\u011bt\u0161\u00ed \u010cech\" (the Czech spin-off of the BBC \"100 Greatest Britons\"), Havel placed third.\nHavel's memoir of his experience as president, \"To the Castle and Back\", was published in May 2007. The book mixes an interview in the style of \"Disturbing the Peace\" with actual memoranda he sent to his staff and modern diary entries and recollections.\nOn 4 August 2007, Havel met with members of the Belarus Free Theatre at his summer cottage in the Czech Republic in a show of his continuing support, which has been instrumental in the theatre's attaining international recognition and membership in the European Theatrical Convention.\nHavel went on a hunger strike in 2007 to support Kurdish doctor and human rights activist Yekta Uzunoglu in his legal battle. A former president going on a hunger strike to support the legal battle of a foreigner in his country was a first in world history.\nHavel's first new play in almost two decades, \"Leaving\", was published in November 2007, and was to have had its world premiere in June 2008 at the Prague Vinohrady Theatre, but the theater withdrew it in December as it felt it could not provide the technical support needed to mount the play. The play instead premiered on 22 May 2008 at the Archa Theatre to standing ovations. Havel based the play on \"King Lear\", by William Shakespeare, and on \"The Cherry Orchard\", by Anton Chekhov; \"Chancellor Vil\u00e9m Rieger is the central character of \"Leaving\", who faces a crisis after being removed from political power.\" The play had its English language premiere at the Orange Tree Theatre in London and its American premiere at The Wilma Theater in Philadelphia. Havel subsequently directed a film version of the play, which premiered in the Czech Republic on 22 March 2011.\nOther works included the short sketch \"P\u011bt Tet\", a modern sequel to \"Unveiling\", and \"The Pig, or V\u00e1clav Havel's Hunt for a Pig\", which was premiered in Brno at Theatre Goose on a String and had its English language premiere at the 3LD Art &amp; Technology Center in New York, in a production from Untitled Theater Company No. 61, in a production workshopped in the Ice Factory Festival in 2011 and later revived as a full production in 2014, becoming a \"New York Times\" Critic's Pick.\nIn 2008, Havel became a Member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation. He met U.S. President Barack Obama in private before Obama's departure after the end of the European Union (EU) and United States (US) summit in Prague in April 2009. Havel was the chair of the Human Rights Foundation's International Council and a member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.\nHavel was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. From the 1980s, Havel supported the green politics movement, partly due to his friendship with the co-founder of the German Alliance 90/The Greens party Milan Hor\u00e1\u010dek. From 2004 until his death, he supported the Czech Green Party.\nDeath.\nA week before his death, he met with his long-time friend, the Dalai Lama, in Prague; Havel appeared in a wheelchair. He died in the morning of 18 December 2011, at the age of 75, at his country home in Hr\u00e1de\u010dek.\nPrime Minister Petr Ne\u010das announced a three-day mourning period from 21 to 23 December, the date announced by President V\u00e1clav Klaus for the state funeral. The funeral Mass was held at Saint Vitus Cathedral, celebrated by the Archbishop of Prague Dominik Duka and Havel's old friend Bishop V\u00e1clav Mal\u00fd. During the service, a 21 gun salute was fired in the former president's honour, and in accordance with the family's request, a private ceremony followed at Prague's Stra\u0161nice Crematorium. Havel's ashes were placed in the family tomb in the Vinohrady Cemetery in Prague. On 23 December 2011, the V\u00e1clav Havel Tribute Concert was held in Prague's Pal\u00e1c Lucerna.\nReactions.\nWithin hours Havel's death was met with numerous tributes, including from U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former Polish President Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa. Merkel called Havel \"a great European\", while Wa\u0142\u0119sa said he should have been given the Nobel Peace Prize. The Russian Embassy sent an official condolence on behalf of the President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Slovakia declared 23 December a day of national mourning.\nAt the news of his death, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a native of Czechoslovakia, said, \"He was one of the great figures of the 20th Century\", while Czech expatriate novelist Milan Kundera said: \"V\u00e1clav Havel's most important work is his own life.\" Leader of Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, Vojt\u011bch Filip, stated that Havel was a very controversial person and that his words often conflicted with his deeds. He criticized Havel for having supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, repeating the charge that Havel had called the event a \"humanitarian bombing\", although Havel had expressly and emphatically denied ever using such a phrase.\nAn online petition organized by one of the best-known Czech and Slovak film directors, Fero Feni\u010d, calling on the government and the Parliament to rename Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport to V\u00e1clav Havel International Airport attracted\u2014in a week after 20 December 2011\u2014support of over 80,000 Czech Republic and foreign signatories. It was announced that the airport would be renamed the V\u00e1clav Havel Airport Prague on 5 October 2012.\nReviewing a new biography by Michael \u017dantovsk\u00fd, Yale historian Marci Shore summarized his challenges as president: \"Havel's message, 'We are all responsible, we are all guilty,' was not popular. He enacted a general amnesty for all but the most serious criminals, apologized on behalf of Czechoslovakia for the post-World War II expulsion of the Sudeten Germans and resisted demands for a more draconian purge of secret police collaborators. These things were not popular either. And as the government undertook privatization and restitution, Havel confronted pyramid schemes, financial corruption and robber baron capitalism. He saw his country fall apart (if bloodlessly), becoming in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\"\nAwards.\nIn 1986, Havel received the Erasmus Prize, in 1989 the Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels, and in 1990, he received the Gottlieb Duttweiler Prize for his outstanding contributions to the well-being of the wider community. In the same year he received the Freedom medal.\nIn 1993, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\nOn 4 July 1994, V\u00e1clav Havel was awarded the Philadelphia Liberty Medal. In his acceptance speech, he said: \"The idea of human rights and freedoms must be an integral part of any meaningful world order. Yet I think it must be anchored in a different place, and in a different way, than has been the case so far. If it is to be more than just a slogan mocked by half the world, it cannot be expressed in the language of departing era, and it must not be mere froth floating on the subsiding waters of faith in a purely scientific relationship to the world.\"\nHavel was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1995.\nIn 1997, Havel received \"ex aequo\" the Prince of Asturias Award for Communication and Humanities and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.\nIn 1998, the jury of the Europe Theatre Prize awarded him a special prize by the President Jack Lang.\nIn 2001, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nIn 2002, he was the third recipient of the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award presented by the Prague Society for International Cooperation. In 2003, he was awarded the International Gandhi Peace Prize by the government of India for his outstanding contribution towards world peace and upholding human rights in most difficult situations through Gandhian means; he was the inaugural recipient of Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award for his work in promoting human rights; he received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom; and he was appointed as an honorary Companion of the Order of Canada.\nIn 2008 he was also awarded the Giuseppe Motta Medal for support for peace and democracy. As a former Czech President, Havel was a member of the Club of Madrid. In 2009 he was awarded the Quadriga Award, but decided to return it in 2011 following the announcement of Vladimir Putin as one of the 2011 award recipients.\nHavel also received multiple honorary doctorates from various universities such as the prestigious Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) in 2009, and was a Foreign Associate Member of the French from October 1992 until his death.\nOn 10 October 2011, Havel was awarded by the Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili with the St. George Victory Order. In November 2014, he became only the fourth non-American honored with a bust in the U.S. Capitol.\nMemorials.\nV\u00e1clav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent.\nIn April 2012, Havel's widow, Dagmar Havlov\u00e1, authorized the creation of the V\u00e1clav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent. The prize was created by the New York-based Human Rights Foundation and is awarded at the annual Oslo Freedom Forum. The prize \"will celebrate those who engage in creative dissent, exhibiting courage and creativity to challenge injustice and live in truth\".\nV\u00e1clav Havel Library.\nThe V\u00e1clav Havel Library, located in Prague, is a charitable organization founded by Dagmar Havlov\u00e1, Karel Schwarzenberg and Miloslav Petrusek on 26 July 2004. It maintains a collection of pictorial, audio and written materials and other artefacts linked to V\u00e1clav Havel. The institution gathers these materials for the purpose of digitisation, documentation and research and to promote his ideas. It organises lectures, holds conferences and social and cultural events that introduce the public to the work of V\u00e1clav Havel and club discussion meetings on current social issues.\nIn May 2012, the library opened a branch in New York City named the V\u00e1clav Havel Library Foundation. In 2014, the V\u00e1clav Havel Library moved to larger premises at Ostrovni 13, in the centre of Prague.\nV\u00e1clav Havel Building of the European Parliament.\nIn July 2017, the European Parliament opened a new building on its official Strasbourg site. The building was named after Havel and decorated with a bust of the former Czech president.\nV\u00e1clav Havel Memory in Zagreb.\nOn 4 October 2016, the day before what would have been the 80th birthday of V\u00e1clav Havel, his photograph was presented on a fountain in Croatian capital Zagreb. Croatian-Czech Society proposed the V\u00e1clav Havel Street in Zagreb.\nV\u00e1clav Havel Boulevard and memorial plaque in Kyiv.\nIn November 2016, V\u00e1clav Havel Boulevard was opened in Kyiv, Ukraine. The new name has replaced the one given during Soviet era when boulevard was named in honor of the Communist politician J\u0101nis Lepse. In December, First Deputy Chairman Iryna Herashchenko along with Minister of Culture of Czech Republic Daniel Herman and Minister of Culture of Ukraine Yevhen Nyshchuk opened memorial plaque in honor of V\u00e1clav Havel.\nV\u00e1clav Havel Bench.\nThe V\u00e1clav Havel Bench (Havel's Place) is an artistic and urban utility project, created by Czech architect and designer Bo\u0159ek \u0160\u00edpek. It is composed of two wooden garden chairs connected by a round table, which has a hole inside. A linden, the Czech national tree, is growing through this hole. These benches can be found in many Czech towns as well as in some foreign locations such as Washington, D.C., Dublin, Lisbon, and Barcelona.\nSculptures and busts.\nOn 19 November 2014, a bust of Havel, created by Czech-American artist Lubom\u00edr Jane\u010dka, was unveiled at the U.S. Congress, commemorating the 25-year anniversary of the Velvet Revolution. Havel is the fourth European ever to be honored by having a bust of himself in the U.S. Congress, after Winston Churchill, Raoul Wallenberg and Lajos Kossuth. Another sculpture of Havel is placed in a boardroom of Leinster House in Dublin, the historical seat of the Oireachtas, the Irish National Parliament.\nOn 22 June 2017 a statue of V\u00e1clav Havel created by Georgian sculptor Jumber Jikia was unveiled in Tbilisi, Georgia.\nThe V\u00e1clav Havel Library Foundation donated a bust of Havel to Columbia University in New York City. This bust was unveiled on 27 September 2018 while Havel was being honored by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.\nCultural references.\nV\u00e1clav Havel has been portrayed, as himself or a character based on him, in a number of feature and television films:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\nWorks by V\u00e1clav Havel\nMedia interviews with V\u00e1clav Havel"}

He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KS\u010c), the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines \u2013 \"Rovnost\", \"Sr\u0161atec\", and \"Reflektor\" \u2013 and the employee of a communist publishing house.\nDuring the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovak artistic avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal \"Dev\u011btsil\". In March 1929, he and six other writers left the KS\u010c after signing a manifesto protesting against Bolshevized Stalinist-influenced tendencies in the new leadership of the party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s.\nIn 1949 Seifert left journalism and began to devote himself exclusively to literature. His poetry was awarded important state prizes in 1936, 1955, and 1968, and in 1967 he was designated National Artist.

He died on 10 January 1986, aged 84.\nHe was buried in the family tomb in Kralupy nad Vltavou. His burial was marked by a high presence of the communist secret police, the StB, who tried to suppress any hint of dissent on the part of mourners.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63310", "revid": "9084172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63310", "title": "Day of the Dead (1985 film)", "text": "1985 American post-apocalyptic zombie horror film by George A. Romero\nDay of the Dead is a 1985 American post-apocalyptic zombie horror film written and directed by George A. Romero, and produced by Richard P. Rubinstein. The third film in Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" series, it stars Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, Joseph Pilato, Jarlath Conroy and Richard Liberty as members of a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse sheltering in an underground bunker in Florida, where they must determine the outcome of humanity's conflict with the undead horde. Romero described the film as a \"tragedy about how a lack of human communication causes chaos and collapse even in this small little pie slice of society\".\nWork on \"Day of the Dead\" began shortly after the release of the previous film in the series, \"Dawn of the Dead\" (1978), but was halted when Romero began work on other projects. It was developed as part of a three-film deal with that film's distributor, United Film Distribution Company (UFDC); Romero elected to make the two other projects outlined in the deal, \"Knightriders\" (1981) and \"Creepshow\" (1982), first. Although the filmmaker was given final cut privilege, the screenplay was rewritten multiple times due to UFDC's concerns that Romero's ambitious original vision \u2015 which he described as \"the \"Gone with the Wind\" of zombie films\" \u2015 would need to be shot with the intention of receiving an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America to ensure its commercial viability; Romero elected to make the film on a lower budget and release it without a rating. \"Day of the Dead\" was filmed in fall 1984, with above-ground scenes in the cities of Fort Myers and Sanibel and underground scenes near Wampum, Pennsylvania. Tom Savini returned to provide the film's special make-up effects; he was assisted by a team of artists that included Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, who later became known for their work on the television series \"The Walking Dead\".\n\"Day of the Dead\" premiered in Hicksville, New York on June 30, 1985, and grossed $34 million worldwide against a budget of approximately $4 million. Although the make-up effects were praised, the film initially did not match the critical and commercial success of its predecessors; the series did not see another installment until the 2005 release of \"Land of the Dead\". Reception of the film has improved with time, and Romero deemed it to be his personal favorite film in the original \"Dead\" trilogy. Like its predecessors, \"Day of the Dead\" has garnered a cult following and inspired numerous parodies and homages.\nThe film was remade twice: the first is the 2008 film of the same name, and the second is \"\" (2017). A television series named after the film began airing on Syfy in 2021, while a stand-alone sequel, \"Night of the Living Dead II\", was reported to be in active development.\nPlot.\nSeven years after the events of \"Dawn of the Dead\", the zombie apocalypse has ravaged the entire world. The societal structures that used to safeguard civilization have mostly vanished, leaving the scattered remnants of human survivors vastly outnumbered by the zombie populations. A handful of scientists and soldiers live within a secure underground missile bunker in the Florida Everglades. The scientists are trying to find a solution to the zombie pandemic; the soldiers have been assigned to protect them. Dr. Sarah Bowman, soldier Private Miguel Salazar, radio operator Bill McDermott, and helicopter pilot John fly from their underground base to Fort Myers in an attempt to locate additional survivors. They find only a large horde of the undead and return to the base, where they are told that the military detachment's officer-in-charge Major Cooper has died. Sarah becomes concerned over Miguel's worsening mental state, but he lashes out at her until she stops trying to help him.\nDr. Logan, the lead scientist (nicknamed \"Frankenstein\" by the soldiers because of his grisly surgical dissections of the zombies), believes that the undead plague victims can be made docile and domesticated through training and conditioning. He keeps a collection of captive undead for use as test subjects in a large underground corral in the compound. Sarah vehemently opposes Logan's conditioning research; instead, she wants to search for a possible cure for the virus. Sarah discovers that Logan has been experimenting on the corpses of the dead soldiers, including Major Cooper. Fearful that the other soldiers will turn on them, Sarah reluctantly keeps this a secret.\nThe soldiers range from decent and workmanlike to mean-spirited and confrontational, especially the unstable Captain Rhodes. Rhodes vehemently objects to the dangers involved in capturing and maintaining zombie specimens, and tension between soldiers and scientists worsens in the face of dwindling supplies, the loss of communication with other survivors, and slow, uncertain progress in the research. During a meeting, Rhodes declares that he is establishing martial law under his command in the compound. He only grants the scientists \"some\" time to prove results and declares that he will execute anyone who interferes with his leadership. He also threatens to abandon the scientists and leave the compound, cutting off their protection from the undead hordes, though he cannot rebut Logan's sarcastic asides that the soldiers have nowhere to run to and no way to stop the zombies on their own.\nDisturbed by Rhodes' threats, Sarah discusses the situation with John and Bill, who reside in an RV at the far end of the tunnels and bluntly tell her they do not believe in anything she and the scientists are trying to accomplish. John professes his conviction that the zombie plague is a form of divine retribution against mankind, and suggests that the three of them should take the helicopter, abandon the soldiers, and fly to a desert island somewhere where they could live off the land and start a new life. Logan hopes to secure Rhodes' goodwill by showing him the results of his research. He is especially proud of \"Bub\", a docile zombie who remembers some parts of his past life and engages in rudimentary human behavior. Rhodes, however, is not impressed and loses more patience with the scientists.\nDuring a zombie roundup procedure, a zombie escapes its harness when Miguel loses his focus, resulting in the deaths of soldiers Miller and Johnson. Miguel snaps and attempts to kill the creature, but another zombie bites him on the arm. With John and Bill's help, Sarah amputates and cauterizes Miguel's arm to stop the infection. Rhodes calls off the experiments and demands that all captive zombies be destroyed, as well as denying any further help from him and his remaining men.\nSarah and Bill later go to the operating theater to gather medical supplies for Miguel, where they find that Logan has been experimenting on Miller and Johnson's remains. After discovering evidence that Logan has drifted into insanity due to his failure to civilize the zombies' baser instincts, Bill decides that they should leave in the helicopter immediately. Rhodes finds out that Logan has been feeding the flesh of his dead soldiers to Bub as positive reinforcement for his behavior. Furious, Rhodes kills Logan and seizes the remaining scientists and non-military personnel, stripping them of their weapons. Rhodes attempts to force John to fly him and his remaining soldiers away from the base, which John refuses to do. In response, Rhodes kills Logan's assistant Dr. Fisher, locks Sarah and Bill inside the zombie corral, and orders Private Steel to beat John into submission.\nBack in the laboratory, Bub uses his newly developed intelligence to free himself from his chain restraints and later discovers Logan's corpse. In a display of human emotion, he mourns the loss of his instructor, then picks up a pistol and goes in search of revenge. Meanwhile Miguel, whose self-control has finally snapped, heads off to the surface. While the soldiers try to go after him, John knocks out Rhodes and Torrez, steals their guns, and goes into the zombie corral to rescue Sarah and Bill.\nOutside, a suicidal Miguel opens the perimeter fence, letting in hundreds of zombies, which surround him on the missile elevator platform. As they begin tearing at him, he activates the elevator control box, lowering the ravenous zombies into the complex. As the undead swarm the bunker, Rhodes leaves his men behind to be killed. Chased by Bub, he desperately attempts to escape, but runs into a mass of zombies and is shot in the stomach by Bub, who mockingly salutes Rhodes as he is torn apart. John, Sarah, and Bill make it to the chopper and escape to a tropical island.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nRomero originally intended the film to be \"the \"Gone with the Wind\" of zombie films\". Following budget disputes and the artistic need to release the film unrated, the budget of the film was cut in half, dropping from $7 million to $3.5 million. This forced Romero to scale back his story, rewriting the script and adjusting his original vision to fit the smaller budget.\nA total of five scripts were written as Romero wrestled with the film's concepts and the budgetary constraints. The first draft was over 200 pages, which he later condensed to a shorter page count. This is the true original script, and to date no copies of it have come to light. This version was likely rejected because UFDC felt it was too expensive for them to produce even with an R rating. Romero subsequently scaled down the scope of this script into a 155-page draft (often erroneously referred to as the original version), then condensed it again to a 104-page draft labeled the \"second version, second draft\" in an unsuccessful final attempt to get the story within budget parameters. When this failed, he drastically altered the original story concept and ultimately produced a shooting draft that numbered only 88 pages.\nThe film was given a very limited release. This is chronicled in the documentary \"The Many Days of 'Day of the Dead'\" on the two-disc Anchor Bay special edition DVD of the film. Some of the original concepts and characters remain, but the film differs greatly from Romero's original script, as stated by actress Lori Cardille:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He could've made me this sexy little twit bouncing around with a gun:- much more the sexual element. But he made her intelligent and strong. In fact, whenever I would try and make her a little more emotional, he would not allow me to do that.\nCasting.\nJoseph Pilato was cast as Rhodes, the film's antagonist. As stated by Pilato \"He pretty much just gave it to me. I don't know if he auditioned other people, but it was very quick. I came in and it was like, 'You got it!'\". Pilato had acted in two prior films directed by Romero, the first being Pilato's debut \"Dawn of the Dead\" and the second being \"Knightriders\"; in between those films he played his first lead role in a film entitled \"Effects\" (1979). In an interview, Pilato was asked if Romero \"had him in mind\", Pilato stated that one of the reasons why he got the role was because of the budget being scaled down from 7 to 3.5 million.\nThe role of Dr. Matthew \"Frankenstein\" Logan was played by Richard Liberty. In a 2000 interview, Liberty said that he received a call from Christine Forrest, Romero's then-wife and casting director for \"Day of the Dead\", wherein he was both offered the role and told that George Romero specifically wrote the role for Liberty. Liberty had previously worked with Romero on the 1973 film \"The Crazies\".\nMembers of the rock band NRBQ cameo in the film in zombie makeup.\nFilming.\nFilming took place in the fall of 1984 at locations in Pennsylvania and Florida. All above-ground scenes were filmed at several locations around Florida, where Romero was living at the time. The opening scene was filmed in the downtown area of Fort Myers, Florida.\nRelease and reception.\nSubsequent to its theatrical release, the film has grossed over 30 million dollars worldwide. \"Day of the Dead\" would earn most of its gross revenue when the film was released internationally on VHS format, and later DVD and Blu-ray. This is in contrast to the film's poor box-office reception when it was released in cinemas.\nBased on 103 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, \"Day of the Dead\" has a 61% approval rating making it the lowest-rated film in Romero's original \"Dead\" trilogy, with \"Night of the Living Dead\" having a 95% approval rating and \"Dawn of the Dead\" having a 92% approval rating. The website's critical consensus states that \"\"Day of the Dead\" may arguably be the least haunting entry in George A. Romero's undead trilogy, but it will give audiences' plenty to chew on with its shocking gore and scathing view of society\". On Metacritic the film holds a score of 60 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\n\"Day of the Dead\" had its world premiere on June 30, 1985, and was given a limited release on July 3, 1985. The film saw its wide release on July 19, 1985. Roger Ebert, who reacted favorably to other films of Romero's \"Dead\" series, gave \"Day of the Dead\" one and a half stars; he praised the special effects but was put off by what he referred to as \"over-acting\" in the film, specifically that all of the actors screamed at each other for the entire film in a way that was not present in Romero's earlier films. BBC reviewer Almar Haflidason stated \"It benefits from a far larger budget than its predecessors, but suffers from a story as malnourished as the zombies that are chewing it up\", Haflidason would go on to give the film three out of five stars. As noted by \"The New York Times\" reviewer Janet Maslin \"Yes, there are enough spilled guts and severed limbs to satisfy the bloodthirstiest fan. But these moments tend to be clustered together, and a lot of the film is devoted to windy argument.\" AllMovie reviewer Keith Phipps stated that: \"The last, to date at least, of George Romero's living dead films is in many respects the least interesting, although it's not for a lack of ambition.\" \"Variety\" wrote that the film was the most unsatisfying of the original three films and that \"The acting here is generally unimpressive and in the case of Sarah's romantic partner, Miguel (Antone DiLeo Jr), unintentionally risible.\" Dave Kehr praised the film in his review for the \"Chicago Reader\", writing that \"this time the focus is less political than philosophical. Beginning from a position of absolute misanthropy, Romero asks what it means to be human, and the answers are funny, horrifying, and ultimately hopeful.\"\n\"Day of the Dead\" would peak at 23 on the \"Billboard\" chart \"Top VHS Sales\" in 1986 a year after its initial release.\nThe film grossed $5.8 million domestically. It fared much better internationally, grossing $28.2 million outside of the United States. \"Day of the Dead\"'s total gross is a little over $34 million. The film is also noted for its special effects work, notably Tom Savini's make-up, he was honored with his second Saturn Award in 1985 for Best Make-up, the first time being with \"Dawn of the Dead\" in 1980. Jonathan Rosenbaum placed the film in his personal canon of 1,000 favorite films, one of two Romero films chosen by Rosenbaum (the other was \"Martin\"). Romero himself cited \"Day of the Dead\" as his personal favorite of his original trilogy of zombie films. On May 19, 2012, the film headlined the 12-hour film festival Hudson Horror Show V.\nAlex Stewart reviewed \"Day of the Dead\" for \"White Dwarf\" #83, and stated that \"Organized around a tough performance by Lori Cardille as the determined research leader, the movie is as much a study of the several inhumanities of science and the military as it is a feast of gore and putrefaction. After all, disembowelling is only one way, the most literal, of taking people apart.\"\nHome video.\nThe film was released on DVD on November 24, 1998 in the United States and on March 5, 2001 in the United Kingdom.

The camera pans past a newspaper blowing in the wind stating \"The Dead Walk!\", a direct homage to George A. Romero's work on \"Day of the Dead\".\n\"Just Voodoo It\", an episode of \"Stroker &amp; Hoop\", featured the characters battling zombies using guns made by Double-Wide. They turn out to fire only sunlight, which he claims is because of zombies' vulnerability to sunlight, hinted at by the film being called \"Night of the Dead\" and not \"Day of the Dead\". Coroner Rick yells at him \"That was the sequel!\"\nThe song \"M1 A1\" from the self-titled 2001 Gorillaz studio album samples the pulsing synthesizers and cries of \"Hello! Is anyone there?\" from the opening of the film. The song \"Hip Albatross\", also by Gorillaz, features a clip of Terry Alexander's dialogue. Furthermore, the artwork for the song \"November Has Come\" off of the Gorillaz' 2005 album \"Demon Days\" has a picture of a calendar pinned to a brick wall set to the month of October with all the dates marked off in red Xs (reminiscent of the opening scene in \"Day of the Dead\").\nThe song \"Battlefield\" from the 2004 Panzer AG studio album \"This Is My Battlefield\" samples Captain Rhodes asking Sarah in reference to Miguel's zombie bite: \"You think he wants to walk around after he's dead? You think he wants to be one of these things?\" The line \"Sit down or so help me God I'll have you shot\" appears once near the end of the song.\nThe deathcore band Through the Eyes of the Dead sampled a clip at the beginning of the song \"Between the Gardens that Bathe in Blood\", released on the EP \"The Scars of Ages\" (2004).\nThe Ministry song \"Burning Inside\" from the studio album \"The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste\" features an audio sample of the military station's warning horn and a few notes of composer John Harrison's synthesized score.\nThe song \"Confessions of a Knife (Theme Part 2)\" from the 1990 studio album \"Confessions of a Knife...\" by My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult samples dialogue between Sarah and Captain Rhodes.

Are you?\" Along with dialogue from Private Steel and laughter from Private Rickles that repeats later throughout the song. Steel: \"Bang! You're dead!\" followed by Rickles' laughter.\nThe song \"The Only Good God Is a Dead God\" from the 1992 studio album \"Psychological Warfare Technology Systems\" by Terror Against Terror samples Captain Rhodes' final screams \"Choke on them... choke on them\", with the sounds of the zombies eating him.\nAmerican punk band the Misfits recorded a song about the film entitled \"Day of the Dead\" for their 1997 studio album \"American Psycho\".\nIn 2014, Sherman Howard's zombie character Bub appeared in a cameo in \"Us\", the fifteenth episode of the fourth season of the AMC series \"The Walking Dead\", as one of the walkers encountered by the characters Glenn and Tara in a railroad tunnel, an homage to not only the character but also to the underground setting of \"Day of the Dead\".\nThe first episode of the third season of \"Stranger Things\" sees the main characters sneaking into their local cinema to watch an early screening of \"Day of the Dead\".\nSeattle-based musical duo the Little Black Bottles composed \"Letter to Miguel\", a tribute song to character Miguel Salazar, for their studio album \"Let Them Eat Red Velvet Cake\".\nIn ' (2018), the final DLC map for the Zombies mode is named \"Tag der Toten\" ('Day of the Dead' in German).

In \"Tag der Toten\" his iconic glasses show up as a tribute.\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack was released on LP and cassette in the same year as the film (1985) by Saturn Records; it contained 6 tracks, all of which was composed and performed by John Harrison. The vocals came from Sputzy Sparacino who was the lead singer of the Pittsburgh R&amp;B/dance/cover band Modern Man and Delilah, who was known at the time for being the lead singer of the Pittsburgh R&amp;B/gospel/dance band Samson &amp; Delilah on the tracks \"If Tomorrow Comes\" and \"The World Inside Your Eyes\". The album was re-issued in 2002 by Numenorean Music as a limited edition CD. The new edition was limited to 3,000 copies and contained the original album plus five additional tracks from the music and effects reel (the only surviving recording of the film score). It also included a 12-page booklet with information from Harrison and Romero regarding the score.\nWaxwork Records later released the soundtrack on vinyl in 2013, making it the first album release with the complete film score.\nPrequel, remakes and television series.\nA unofficial prequel was released in 2005, entitled \"\". Although it is, by definition, an official sequel as Taurus Entertainment Company holds the rights to the original film, no one from the original \"Day of the Dead\" had any involvement in the film. The film also diverges from the continuity of the original in several respects.\nA loose remake of the film, \"Day of the Dead\", was released straight to DVD on April 8, 2008. Little of the original plot exists, with only a few basic elements remaining; notably the underground army base near the end of the film, and some of the characters' names. This marks the second time that Ving Rhames makes an appearance in a remake of a George A. Romero zombie film, following \"Dawn of the Dead\" (2004).\nOn July 10, 2013, it was announced that there would be another remake of \"Day of the Dead\", titled \"\". Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman, two of the producers behind \"Texas Chainsaw 3D\" (2013) have obtained the rights. Campbell, who had a small role in the first remake, said, \"We want to keep it as close to the Romero version as possible. These are not going to be zombies climbing walls and doing back flips like in \"World War Z\".\" Directed by H\u00e8ctor Hern\u00e1ndez Vicens, it began filming in June 2016. The film was released on December 29, 2017 in Vietnam and on January 5, 2018 in the United States, it was a critical failure.\nIn February 2020, a television series based on the film was announced and will premiere on Syfy in 2021. The series will follow six strangers in the first 24 hours of a zombie invasion and director Steven Kostanski confirmed the series will have a connection to the original 1985 film.\nIn July 2021, it was announced that Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, and Jarlath Conroy were cast in \"Night of the Living Dead II\", originally set for a 2022 release.\nComic.\nStef Hutchinson wrote the 24-page comic \"Day of the Dead: Desertion\", which was exclusively released to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary and shows the origins of Bub, before becoming a zombie.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lundwall", "text": "Swedish writer (born 1@41)\nSam Thore Jerrie Lundwall (born 24 February 1941), published as Sam J. Lundwall, is a Swedish science fiction writer, translator, publisher and singer. He translated a number of science-fiction-related articles and works from Swedish into English.\nCareer.\nLundwall debuted as a writer in the 1950s for \"H\u00e4pna!\" During the 1960s he was active as a photographer and freelance writer. He also produced the LP \"Visor i v\u00e5r tid\". In 1968, he worked as a television producer for Sveriges Radio and made a series about science fiction. In 1969, he published his first book-length work on science fiction, \"Science Fiction: Fr\u00e5n begynnelsen till v\u00e5ra dagar\". This landed him a job at Askild &amp; K\u00e4rnekull (A&amp;K) as an editor for their science fiction books. He subsequently translated this work into English, where it was published in the US in 1971 as \"Science Fiction: What It's All About\". This work was compared favorably to other studies of science fiction coming out at that time, such as \"New Maps of Hell\", \"Billion Year Spree\", \"Seekers of Tomorrow\", \"In Search of Wonder\", and \"The Universe Makers\". In the summer of 1973, he left A&amp;K and worked with Delta F\u00f6rlag that he ran together with the literary agent Gunnar Dahl. Until the end of the 1980s Delta published about 200 science fiction books. During the 1990s Lundwall continued publishing science fiction on his own company, Sam J. Lundwall Fakta &amp; Fantasi.\nLundwall was also the editor of the science fiction magazine \"Jules Verne-Magasinet\" between 1972 and 2009 and has been active in fandom, for instance he organised conventions in Stockholm in 1961, 1963, 1973, 1975, 1977 and 1979. He has been both a board member and chairman (twice) of World SF and north European coordinator for Science Fiction Writers of America.
